            As the scandal surrounding Britain's Prince Andrew continues to make headlines across the world, many are asking whether the disgraced royal will be able to continue living in Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003.
    


            But how much do we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years?
    


            The late Queen Elizabeth II granted Andrew, the third of her four children, the right to live in the lodge, which is officially owned by the Crown Estate. The prince paid ¬£1 million for the property back in 2003, and under the terms of the 75-year lease, due to expire on June 15, 2078, he is expected to pay for any refurbishment work and the maintenance of the surrounding grounds.
    


            He was also required upfront to pay ¬£7.5 million ($10 million) to cover necessary refurbishments that were completed in 2005, according to a National Audit Office report. According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent ‚Äúif demanded‚Äù was only required to be ‚Äúone peppercorn‚Äù per annum.
    


            The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener's cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in.
    


            It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales.
    


            There has been intense media speculation in recent days over Prince Andrew's continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate both declined to comment over reports that he is in talks to leave the residence.
    


            A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. Its first links with the royal family came in the early 19th century when George IV, then the prince regent, converted the rustic-styled cottage into a hunting lodge and then private retreat. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge.
    


            After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a ‚Äúgrace and favor‚Äù residence for most of the rest of the century.
    


            The Royal Chapel was added to the site in 1865, but, though situated within the grounds of the lodge, it does not come under the current lease.
    


            The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV's original cottage.
    


            Prince Andrew's late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents ‚Äî then the Duke and Duchess of York ‚Äî in 1932. The family remained at Royal Lodge until the duke and duchess were crowned four years later, following the abdication of Edward VIII.
    


            Following her husband's death in 1952 and the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother used the Royal Lodge as her Windsor residence until her death in 2002.
    


            After his grandmother died, Prince Andrew approached the Crown Estate about acquiring the leasehold on the property. The property was not offered to the wider market because of its sensitive location in the heart of Windsor Great Park and the need for security, given its proximity to the Royal Chapel.
    


            The renovation work that Andrew carried out on the family property included internal alterations to the tiled ceiling, external repainting, new tarmac for the gate entrance and light fittings and cameras for outside the lodge, according to a planning application lodged with the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.
    


Prince Andrew gives up royal titles after string of scandals



            Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001.
    


            Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as ‚Äúlittle cottage.‚Äù The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children ‚Äî as did their children and grandchildren.
    


            In a 2012 BBC documentary called ‚ÄúThe Diamond Queen,‚Äù Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been ‚Äúlucky enough‚Äù to play there together with their cousins as children.
    


            She described it as the ‚Äúmost glamorous Wendy house ever‚Äù and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a ‚Äúbit of a spruce-up.‚Äù 



            Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s.
    


            In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. 



            In 2020, Eugenie's sister, Beatrice, tied the knot on the estate itself, marrying Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a small ceremony in the chapel while Covid-19 restrictions were in place.

US President Donald Trump has pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who was previously convicted of enabling money laundering at the crypto exchange, the White House has announced.

Binance and then-CEO Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to violating the US Bank Secrecy Act, admitting they failed to enforce anti-money-laundering rules. Prosecutors said the exchange failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions, including those tied to terrorism and child exploitation. Binance was banned from operating in the US and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines, while Zhao resigned as CEO and paid $50 million. He was later sentenced to four months in prison.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that Trump had ‚Äúexercised his constitutional authority‚Äù by pardoning Zhao, claiming he had been ‚Äúegregiously oversentenced‚Äù by the administration of former President Joe Biden ‚Äúin their war on cryptocurrency.‚Äù

The announcement followed months of Binance lobbying and came amid its growing ties with Trump. Formerly a crypto skeptic, the president last year vowed to make the US the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world.‚Äù Trump's family has deepened ties to the industry through ventures and investments. Binance earlier this year backed the World Liberty Financial ‚Äì a crypto-venture co-founded by Trump and his sons, which has raised approximately $550 million in token sales since 2024 ‚Äì by accepting its USD1 stablecoin.

The pardon for Zhao, which analysts say could allow Binance to resume operations in the US, drew criticism that Trump was aiding a figure whose company had financially benefited his family. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Senate Banking Committee's ranking member, denounced the move as ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù and urged Congress to act.

Critics have claimed Trump's crypto ventures and political power overlap dangerously. In August, the New York Times accused him of using his office to promote personal crypto projects, including a Solana-based ‚ÄòTRUMP' token launched earlier this year.

Trump, who last month filed a $15 billion defamation suit against the paper, defended pardoning Zhao, telling reporters he had acted ‚Äúat the request of a lot of very good people.‚Äù Zhao thanked Trump on X, vowing to ‚Äúdo everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto.‚Äù

Deeply grateful for today's pardon and to President Trump for upholding America's commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice. üôèüôèüôèüôèWill do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide. (Still in flight, more posts to come.)‚Ä¶

EU leaders have failed to reach an agreement on whether to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine through a controversial loan scheme, after Belgium demanded stronger legal safeguards. The matter is expected to return to the agenda in December.

According to Bloomberg and Politico, EU officials made little headway at a Brussels summit on Thursday on the plan to use immobilized Russian central bank assets as collateral for a proposed ‚Ç¨140 billion ($163 billion) ‚Äúreparation loan‚Äù to Kiev. The proposal assumes that the sum will be repaid if Ukraine wins the conflict with Russia and Moscow agrees to pay reparations ‚Äì which is widely considered unlikely.

Russia has condemned Western efforts to use its frozen funds to aid Ukraine, calling the move ‚Äútheft.‚Äù

Politico reported that the talks ‚Äúwere thrown into disarray‚Äù after Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever took what one official described as a ‚Äúsurprisingly uncompromising position‚Äù on the loan. Belgium, which has legal control over the bulk of the frozen funds through Brussels-based Euroclear, has demanded that all EU members share the responsibility ‚Äúif it goes wrong.‚Äù 

As a result, Belgium backed a compromise text that effectively delayed a firm commitment. The current draft seen by Politico ‚Äúinvites the [EU] Commission to present, as soon as possible, options for financial support,‚Äù replacing earlier language that called for a legal proposal.

Belgium's opposition left some EU officials unhappy, with one source telling Politico: ‚ÄúNobody wants to be seen to be responsible for Ukraine running out of money ‚Äì but there's nothing [agreed] yet to actually send them any money.‚Äù

According to Bloomberg, EU leaders plan to review the possibilities at the next summit, with the goal being ‚Äúto get a final agreement by the end of the year.‚Äù

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that using Russian assets to finance Kiev would ‚Äúboomerang,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúif someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another.‚Äù

NATO will target Russian jets suspected of violating its airspace only if they are deemed a threat, Secretary-General Mark Rutte has said.

Tensions between Moscow and NATO spiked last month when Estonia called for NATO-wide consultations after claiming that three Russian MIG-31 fighters briefly breached its airspace.

Moscow said the planes were on a routine flight to the exclave of Kaliningrad over neutral waters. Poland and Sweden warned after the incident that they are prepared to shoot down Russian aircraft if the alleged violations continue. The Kremlin described the statements as ‚Äúvery reckless and irresponsible.‚Äù

In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Rutte claimed that the alleged Russian incursion into Estonian airspace was ‚Äúnot intentional, but it was anyway reckless.‚Äù These actions are ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù and have ‚Äúgot to stop,‚Äù he said.

Asked about the possibility of NATO attacking Russian aircraft, the secretary-general replied that ‚Äúthere was some misunderstanding in the last couple of weeks‚Äù regarding the issue.

‚ÄúIf necessary, NATO can take down these planes if they pose a threat. If they do not pose a threat, they will be intercepted and then gently guided outside [the bloc's airspace],‚Äù he explained.

NATO defense chiefs have been lobbying behind closed doors to expand the bloc's engagement guidelines to allow Russian jets carrying ground-attack missiles to be shot down, the Telegraph reported last week.

According to the outlet, the NATO supreme allied commander Europe, US General Alexus Grynkewich, has privately called for the creation of a ‚Äúunified, single air and missile defense system‚Äù to deal with Russian planes. Individual NATO members currently have different rules for targeting aircraft over their territory.

In late September, Russian Ambassador to France Aleksey Meshkov warned that if any NATO member state hits a Russian jet, it ‚Äúwould mean war.‚Äù He noted that ‚Äúquite a lot of [NATO military] planes accidentally or not accidentally violate our airspace. And no one shoots them down.‚Äù

SEOUL, October 24. /TASS/. The participation of Korean People's Army (KPA) units in the liberation operations of Russia's Kursk Region demonstrated the strength of the ties between Russia and North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency reported, citing the country's leader Kim Jong Un.

""On the battlefield, where justice and injustice clashed in a fierce battle, the bond between the two countries and their solidarity passed the most rigorous test,"" Kim Jong Un said. The North Korean leader noted that the relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang has reached its pinnacle.

On October 23, a ceremony was held to mark the start of construction of a museum in honor of the KPA soldiers who participated in the Kursk Region operation. According to Kim Jong Un, the museum will symbolize the blood-sealed alliance between Russia and North Korea. The North Korean leader noted that relations between the two countries grow stronger every day. ""I convey words of support to the brotherly Russian people and army, and I warmly welcome our dear Russian friends who are present here,"" Kim Jong Un said to the Russian embassy staff who attended the ceremony. He also conveyed his greetings to those who participated in the operation to liberate the Kursk Region.

""The heroic soldiers of our nation and the Russian people have demonstrated the strength of the Korean-Russian alliance through their decisive victory,"" the North Korean leader emphasized. The participation of KPA units in Kursk confirms the deep roots of solidarity between the countries, he added.

""For two countries united by common ideals and aspirations, the alliance was the right choice, and the solidarity and friendship forged by blood and life is sacred and eternal. Our people are very proud of the victory they achieved together with the Russian people in the struggle for independence and justice, and they place the heroes of the sacred war on a glorious pedestal,"" Kim Jong Un concluded.

Russia and North Korea have had a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in place since 2024, which includes mutual defense. North Korean servicemen, loyal to their duty as allies, took part in the liberation of parts of the Kursk Region from Ukrainian invaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Armed Forces' General Staff Chief Army General Valery Gerasimov praised the courage and important role of the North Korean military in defending the region.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, October 24. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin vows a overwhelming response to the latest US sanctions, while there is still a window of opportunity for Russia-US dialogue on New START. Meanwhile, the EU agrees on the 19th package of sanctions on Russia. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines in Russia.

 

Even though the new US sanctions on Russian oil majors will not affect the country's economy, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, this is an unfriendly step that will not help normalize relations between Moscow and Washington. The country reserves the right to retaliate, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international committee of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, told Izvestia. However, Washington did not cross the red lines, deciding not to send Tomahawk missiles to Kiev, so the potential for continued Russia-US dialogue remains, experts say.

On Wednesday night, US President Donald Trump imposed the broadest sanctions on Russia, as the country's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as their 34 subsidiaries, were designated. Moscow reacted quite calmly to the latest US move. While the United States is thus attempting to put pressure on Russia, not a single self-respecting country acts under pressure, the Russian leader said as he called for engaging in a serious dialogue for the longer term instead.

Slutsky criticized the additional anti-Russian sanctions as a totally counterproductive step that he said will not force Russia to change its course. ""Our country keeps the right to take retaliatory measures. But, of course, this would neither contribute to successful negotiations, nor would it normalize bilateral relations,"" he said.

Russia could impose sanctions on US businesses, including in rare earths, among potential measures in response, Ivan Loshkarev, associate professor at the Department of Political Theory of MGIMO University of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Izvestia. Or else cooperation in civil space exploration could be frozen, he added. And Russia could also expand restrictions on US individuals, including high-profile officials, the expert specified.

Associate professor at the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs at the Higher School of Economics Dmitry Novikov argues that the latest US sanctions and the move to cancel the upcoming summit in Hungary cannot be called actions that could bring Russian-US relations back on the escalation track, as before. ""The key red line was not crossed. <‚Ä¶> Washington still refrained from arms supplies, including missile systems,"" the expert said. To him, the latest move means a certain tactical step rather than a change in strategy.

Trump is seeking a ceasefire as soon as possible, while Europe and Ukraine categorically reject the Russian vision of resolving the conflict, Dmitry Suslov, Deputy Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, told Vedomosti. Meanwhile, Russia is not ready for a ceasefire along the current front lines, as it would not mean any final settlement, but deepen the root causes of the conflict instead, the expert said. Suslov believes that a diplomatic breakthrough will come with further advancement of Russian troops.

 

After ramping up sanctions on Russia, Trump supported Putin's proposal to maintain the limits outlined in New START. Meanwhile, the issue of nuclear arms reduction faces serious disagreements between Democrats and Republicans. While the former have traditionally supported the idea to extend the treaty, Republicans advocate for the removal of any restrictions. The US is taking its time with a response, as it attempts to involve China in the dialogue on strategic stability. Russia has repeatedly emphasized the need to take the arsenals of France and Britain into account, a scenario that experts say could only be based on agreement between Russia and the United States. However, there are no plans to revive the bilateral commission on the New START Treaty, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told Izvestia.

""The Republican Party is in general more skeptical of New START, as it argues that the treaty directly increases Russia's standing and indirectly ‚Äì China's posture. For their part, Democrats respect the agreement as they insist that there be no vacuum in this sphere,"" research fellow at the Center for International Security of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Vasily Klimov told Izvestia.

The United States may have delayed a response to involve China in the dialogue on strategic stability. However, Beijing has repeatedly stressed that it has not yet reached the limits set out in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed demands to join US-Russian talks on nuclear disarmament as senseless and unrealistic. Moscow respects and recognizes Beijing's position.

""Even as China may join the dialogue, it refuses to take part in unjust trilateral talks on disarmament. Amid the slow progress in the implementation of agreements under New START between the United States and Russia, the demands being put forward to China are premature and are being viewed as a circumvention of someone's own obligations,"" Cui Heng of the SCO Center for International Legal Training and Cooperation at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law told Izvestia.

""If or when China decides to join the dialogue ‚Äì and that will hardly happen before the 2030s, ‚Äì it would be based on a bilateral Russian-American agreement that should serve as a basis for a multilateral pact, involving China as well as Britain and France, too,"" Klimov argues.

 

The US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added Russia's two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, as well as their 34 subsidiaries, to its SDN list. The two companies account for more than half of Russian oil production and crude exports. Besides, Lukoil has a well-developed international business, with its subsidiaries operating in numerous countries, and it runs projects in the oil production and refining sector and even holds a stake in an LNG project. Rosneft is currently implementing several international projects that were hit.

Experts shared their criticism of the latest sanctions. Konstantin Simonov, general director of the National Energy Security Fund, described them as more of a political signal rather than a serious hit to the Russian economy. The companies will certainly face higher costs, and they will have to create new trading subsidiaries without the presence of Lukoil or Rosneft or with their share below 50%. There may also be challenges with oil supplies under long-term contracts - for example, Rosneft has signed such deals with Indian companies, the expert told Rossiyskaya Gazeta.

While the expert does not expect a decline in Russia's oil production volumes or exports, he warns that costs will rise and that buyers will bargain for an additional discount on Russian oil.

Valery Andrianov, associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, agrees. He believes that Trump attempted to ban what has already been restricted and that he is actually ‚Äògoing small' as regards the scope of the sanctions. The US leader demanded that India and China stop purchasing Russian oil, and he even imposed higher import tariffs on New Delhi for its energy cooperation with Russia. However, as long as India does not cut Russian oil imports amid higher tariffs, why should it do so now that two Russian oil companies have been targeted, Andrianov asked rhetorically.

 

The European Union is negotiating a `reparations loan' for Ukraine to be financed with Russia's frozen assets, something that Moscow would view as a theft. The very idea of discussing such a loan may weaken the EU's reputation as a safe haven for investment, Vladislav Maslennikov, Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Department of European Issues, told Izvestia.

Belgium, which hosts Euroclear holding Russian assets, may be hit most. Belgian businesses have already expressed concern that they may lose access to assets and revenues in Russia because of any retaliatory measures from the country. The bloc's 19th sanctions package includes a ban on LNG imports, and restrictions on lenders, oil tankers and Russian diplomats. While coordinating additional restrictions has been increasingly difficult, their effect has failed to change the course of the special military operation.

""The European Union is facing major reputational risks that may affect institutional investors who closely watch the situation and worry about their large portfolios and international reserves in Europe,"" Alexey Rodin, financial adviser and founder of Rodin.Capital, told Izvestia. ""Belgium, which physically hosts Euroclear with Russian assets, understands these risks only too well, hence it opposes the plan,"" he added.

The 19th package of anti-Russian sanctions agreed by the EU on October 23 mostly targets LNG imports, Russia's largest oil companies, vessels, banks, the tourism sector and the travel regime for Russian diplomats. The EU also agreed to prohibit Russian LNG imports from January 1, 2027.

""This looks impressive at first glance, but, in fact, the Russian economy has already developed mechanisms for adjusting to similar situations. Workarounds will certainly be found, as was the case with previous packages,"" Igor Rastorguyev, a leading analyst at AMarkets, explained.

 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim on October 23 that he will address the upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur online, without explaining why. Therefore, Modi will skip a personal meeting with Trump to discuss a trade deal around import tariffs imposed by the United States in August as sanctions for Russian oil purchases.

The summit will receive 10 ASEAN leaders and regional partners, including the United States, China, and India. Russia, too, has been invited to attend but it has yet to confirm whether and how it will participate.

India is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil after China. In January-August, oil imports stood at 1.8 mln barrels per day on average, in September its oil purchases shrank to 1.6 mln bpd, or a 5% decline from August, according to data from Kpler.

The Indian PM is not ready for one-on-ones with Trump amid the uncertainty, noted Boris Volkhonsky, associate professor at the Institute of Asian and African Studies at Moscow State University. New Delhi is trying to come up with a line of behavior with Moscow and Washington and it is reluctant to give any clear promises to the United States regarding its ties with Russia, the expert explained to Vedomosti. ""The Indians are facing the dilemma of whether they should stop buying Russian energy at a discount or continue to import [Russian crude] under the threat of secondary sanctions. While several Indian companies have already ceased buying Russian oil, the country's leadership has not yet formulated decisions,"" he said. However, Volkhonsky continued, India realizes that a complete rejection of Russian oil is fraught with economic risks. He doubts a new trade agreement between the US and India will now be reached soon.

India is still interested in Russian oil purchases, Gleb Makarevich, researcher at the Center for Indo-Pacific Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, believes. According to Indian political analyst Nandan Unnikrisnan, Modi may have cancelled his trip to Malaysia ahead of elections in Bihar, and India will gradually reduce the volume of Russian oil purchases, he argues.

Incident occurred after ICE agents arriving at Alameda base were met by hundreds of protesters

Law enforcement officers in California opened fire on Thursday night at a vehicle that authorities say attempted to back into the entrance of the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, where protests had taken place earlier in the day over the arrival of federal immigration agents.

In a statement, the Coast Guard said that at around 10.00pm local time on Thursday, ‚ÄúCoast Guard security personnel standing watch on Coast Guard Island observed a vehicle driving erratically and attempting to back into Coast Guard Base Alameda.

‚ÄúCoast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse,‚Äù the news release states. ‚ÄúWhen the vehicle's actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.‚Äù

No Coast Guard personnel were injured, officials said.

The Coast Guard confirmed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was leading the investigation, and said that more information would be released as it becomes available.

According to the Mercury News, the vehicle involved was a U-Haul truck. The outlet also reported that two men, including one believed to be the driver, arrived at local hospitals for gunshot wound treatment after the shooting.

The incident came as the San Francisco Bay Area had been on edge this week following reports that the Trump administration planned to deploy more than 100 federal agents to the region, as part of the administration's immigrant enforcement operations. The agents were set to be stationed at the Alameda Coast Guard base.

Early on Thursday, US Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at the Alameda base, where they were met by hundreds of protesters outside, carrying signs that read ‚ÄúNo ICE or Troops in the Bay!‚Äù

On Thursday, tensions flared outside the base between the demonstrators protesting against the anticipated immigration enforcement operation and police. Officers deployed flash-bang grenades to disperse the crowd as CBP vehicles made their way through.

But then, just hours later, Donald Trump announced that he was calling off the planned ‚Äúsurge‚Äù of federal agents into San Francisco after speaking with the city's mayor and Silicon Valley leaders.

Trump had previously argued in recent weeks that a federal operation in San Francisco was needed to combat crime.

Local leaders have said crime rates in the city are falling.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Baltimore county high schools have gun detection system that alerts police if it sees what it deems suspicious

An artificial intelligence system (AI) apparently mistook a high school student's bag of Doritos for a firearm and called local police to tell them the pupil was armed.

Taki Allen was sitting with friends on Monday night outside Kenwood high school in Baltimore and eating a snack when police officers with guns approached him.

‚ÄúAt first, I didn't know where they were going until they started walking toward me with guns, talking about, ‚ÄòGet on the ground,' and I was like, ‚ÄòWhat?'‚Äù Allen told the WBAL-TV 11 News television station.

Allen said they made him get on his knees, handcuffed and searched him ‚Äì finding nothing. They then showed him a copy of the picture that had triggered the alert.

‚ÄúI was just holding a Doritos bag ‚Äì it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun,‚Äù Allen said.

Baltimore county high schools last year began using a gun detection system using school cameras and AI to detect potential weapons. If it spots something it believes to be suspicious, it sends an alert to the school and law enforcement officials.

In a letter to school families obtained by WBAL TV 11 News, the school wrote: ‚ÄúWe understand how upsetting this was for the individual that was searched as well as the other students who witnessed the incident.

Bacteria for paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever found in DNA from teeth of troops buried in mass grave

When Napoleon ordered his army to retreat from Russia in October 1812, disaster ensued. Starving, cold, exhausted and struggling with sickness, an estimated 300,000 soldiers died.

Researchers now say they have identified two unexpected diseases among soldiers who died in the retreat ‚Äì paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever ‚Äì which provide fresh insights into their plight.

‚ÄúI think that the key thing of why [the retreat] was such a failure was the cold and the hunger and so on. With or without infectious diseases, they would have died massively anyway,‚Äù said Nicol√°s Rascovan, the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Institut Pasteur and an author of the study. ‚ÄúBut I think what this [does] change is some of our knowledge of all the infectious diseases.‚Äù

Writing in the journal Current Biology, Rascovan and his colleagues describe how previous analyses of DNA from soldiers buried in the same mass grave in Vilnius, Lithuania, had revealed evidence of typhus and trench fever.

However, that work was based on a very sensitive technique, called nested PCR, which involved screening samples for particular pathogens.

Using a different technique, called shotgun sequencing, Rascovan's team was able to look for fragments of DNA that matched any out of 185 bacteria known to cause disease in humans.

The results, based on DNA from the teeth of 13 soldiers who had not previously been studied, revealed one soldier had been infected with the louse-borne bacterium Borrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever, and four others had been infected with a type of the bacterium Salmonella enterica, which causes paratyphoid fever, a disease spread by contaminated food or water. One of these four soldiers might also have had relapsing fever, the team said.

The researchers say the findings fit with historical descriptions of the symptoms experienced by soldiers of Napoleon's Grand Arm√©e, such as fever and diarrhoea.

Unlike the previous studies, however, the team found no traces of the bacteria that cause typhus or trench fever. While Rascovan noted it could be that these soldiers were not infected with those diseases, or had only a mild infection, the results could alternatively be explained by the breakdown of ancient DNA over time, or that the quantity of DNA present was below the detection limit of the technique used.

The researchers carried out a number of statistical tests and analyses to ensure their results were robust and pointed to genuine infections. These included looking for the signs of DNA degradation that would be expected from authentic ancient DNA, and exploring where the DNA belonged on the evolutionary ‚Äúfamily tree‚Äù of the two bacteria.

‚ÄúIn light of our results, a reasonable scenario for the deaths of these soldiers would be a combination of fatigue, cold, and several diseases, including paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever. While not necessarily fatal, the louse-borne relapsing fever could significantly weaken an already exhausted individual,‚Äù they write.

Dr Michael Rowe, an expert in European history at King's College London, welcomed the study.

‚ÄúThe science is interesting because I think it does something which a historian couldn't do,‚Äù he said, referring to the identification of the diseases.

But he cautioned against assuming the devastation of the army was simply down to harsh weather that left soldiers susceptible to starvation and disease ‚Äì a view Napoleon promoted.

‚ÄúThat underplays the Russians and it underplays the fact that they actually do some very clever things and that they [have] got a very good strategy and they've got actually quite a sophisticated army,‚Äù he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

MORIOKA ‚Äî Japan's professional wrestling world is mourning a long-serving referee who died this month after being mauled by a bear.

Katsumi Sasazaki was attacked by the bear while cleaning an open-air bath at a hot spring ryokan inn in Kitakami, Iwate Prefecture, on Oct. 16. Sasazaki, 60, contributed to the development of the pro wrestling industry for decades, but had retired from the ring this year and moved with his wife and two daughters to start a new chapter as an employee at the inn.

‚ÄúNobody had a bad word to say about him,‚Äù said Okki Okita, a ring announcer who knew Sasazaki for more than 30 years and had worked with him at the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling. ‚ÄúHe really was a kind person.‚Äù

Okita, whose real name is Yoshitada Okita, said Sasazaki was known for making impartial calls, and popular wrestlers such as Aja Kong affectionately called him ‚ÄúSasayan.‚Äù

With the move to Kitakami, Sasazaki had just realized his dream of living in the countryside. However, Sasazaki was fatally attacked by a bear while working at the Semi Onsen inn, and his body was found in a nearby mountain forest the following day.

‚ÄúWe both adored pro wrestling, and we were always together,‚Äù recalled Okita, 52. ‚ÄúThanks to him, I've also been able to have a good life through pro wrestling.‚Äù

Meiko Satomura, a former pro wrestler and representative of Sendai-based Sendai Girls' Pro-Wrestling, said of Sasazaki, ‚ÄúHe worked to help other people, not for himself.‚Äù After the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Satomura was unable to hold wrestling events in her local area, but Sasazaki invited her to compete in bouts organized by a wrestling organization he belonged to.

About three years ago, Sasazaki spoke to Satomura about his future plans. ‚ÄúFrom now on I'll have to work even harder for my family,‚Äù Sasazaki had said gently, while holding a photo of his daughter as a newborn.

‚ÄúIt's so sad how things turned out,‚Äù Satomura said, choking up.

TORONTO (AP) ‚Äî Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday challenged U.S. President Donald Trump to make a friendly wager on the outcome of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers.

But Carney said Trump hasn't returned his call yet on the potential bet.

‚ÄúI think he's afraid, I think he's afraid to make a bet,‚Äù Carney joked to The Associated Press while taking in batting practice at Toronto's Rogers Centre a day before Game 1 of the World Series in Toronto.

‚ÄúHe doesn't like to lose. He hasn't called. He hasn't returned my call yet on the bet so I'm ready. We're ready to make a bet with the U.S.‚Äù

Carney predicts the Blue Jays will win the best of seven series in six games.

‚ÄúThis country is so pumped. I think the world is so pumped for this series,‚Äù Carney said, noting the interest in Japan because of Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani.

Canada's only major league team will have the country behind it during the World Series.

Trump has been threatening Canada's economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be ‚Äúthe 51st state.‚Äù

Tensions between the neighbors and longtime allies have eased slightly in recent months as Carney tries to get a trade deal with Trump.

One artist is taking kirie paper cutouts to the next level with her skill at creating magical worlds in bottles. Her highly elaborate and three-dimensional paper cutouts appear to float midair inside glass bottles, as if captured by magic.

You'll likely lose track of time, mesmerized by the art.

There are paper cutouts of butterflies hovering around flowers, a little bird flying between cherry blossoms and a girl on a water lily flower.

Various kinds of glass bottles for wine and whiskey house these fantastic scenes.

Paper cutout artist Hase Kamiya produces the pieces, called ‚Äúkirie bottle art.‚Äù ‚ÄúThrough stereoscopic layouts, the paper cutouts come to life,‚Äù she said.

Creating paper cutouts already takes much skill, and it is an extremely delicate task to place them inside bottles.

The folded paper cutouts are put into bottles with tweezers and then carefully unfolded with knitting needles inserted into the bottles, making sure that the paper does not tear.

The art looks like it is floating inside the bottles as some parts of the paper cutouts are fixed to the inner surface with adhesives.

‚ÄúI decide on three points or so that can support the art's weight to make it stable,‚Äù she said.

Kamiya began producing these types of artworks around 2011. At that time, she worked at an anime production company, and her colleague gave her chocolates inside a bottle as a souvenir from Mexico.

She felt like the bottle was unique since it was sealed with a stopper on the bottom, leading her to wonder if she could do something interesting with it.

Kamiya inserted a butterfly-shaped paper cutout in the bottle, and others around her appreciated the artwork.

She began to produce the pieces in earnest around 2014 and has made more than 200 items. Her works are also for sale.

Simply making the cutouts appear to float is not the end of her artistic process.

Kamiya devised a lighting method using small LED lights that are attached to the mouths of the bottles.

When lit up somewhere dark, the shadows of the paper cutouts are cast outside the glass, allowing viewers to enjoy a different side of the art.

For example, one of her works, made using a spherical vase, casts shadows of butterflies, whose joyful dance seems to extend beyond the glass surface.

‚ÄúWhen the light inside the bottle is turned on, my works come to life and startle the viewer. I want everyone to enjoy such feelings of surprise,‚Äù she said.

Kamiya also creates clocks and furin wind chimes that are decorated with paper cutouts.

One of her clocks features a cute cat. Paper cutout acorns are placed on a rotating disk that serves as the second hand.

It's relaxing to watch as the clock face depicts a scene as if the cat keeps watching acorns falling from a tree.

Another work is a wind chime with a cutout featuring hydrangeas, or one with a goldfish, attached to the thin rod that strikes the wind chime.

Seeing the delicate cutouts sway leaves viewers feeling refreshingly cool.

Kamiya was born in Hyogo Prefecture in 1969. Upon graduating from Kyoto City University of Arts, she worked as a greeting card designer as well as an animator. She began producing kirie bottle art in earnest around 2014.

Hi, this is Jared Goyette reporting from a foggy Kyiv on day 1,339 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far: 

French President Emmanuel Macron on Oct. 24 announced that his country would provide Ukraine with ""additional Aster missiles, new training programs, and new Mirage"" fighter jets in the coming days, without providing further details.

The Aster is a surface-to-air missile used in the SAMP/T air defenses. France has previously supplied Ukraine with the air defense system, as well as several Mirage 2000 fighter jets.

""We need to continue to step up our military support to Ukraine ‚Äî air defense capacities, long-range capabilities, drones, and anti-drone systems,"" Macron said.

France and the U.K. have previously provided Ukraine with SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles, most recently used to strike a Russian chemical plant in Bryansk on Oct. 21.

The announcement came as President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders met in London on Oct. 24 for a summit of the ""Coalition of the Willing,"" a European-led initiative launched by the U.K. and France.

The Ukrainian president's visit follows a tense Oct. 17 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, during which Kyiv failed to secure a deal for the acquisition of Tomahawk cruise missiles.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said on Oct. 24 that it had destroyed three Russian air defense systems worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

HUR said in a Telegram post that video from a special forces operation shows the destruction via drones of two Russian Nebo radars (valued at about $100 million each) and a firing unit from a Buk SAM system (the system as a whole is worth at least $10 million and possibly more, depending on the model).

HUR says the systems were struck in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Kherson Oblast, and Crimea.

The Nebo-U system was reportedly capable of monitoring the sky up to 700 kilometers into Ukraine, which helped Russian troops detect Ukrainian weapons and supported fighter jets dropping guided aerial bombs.

The Soviet-era Buk-M1 surface-to-air missile systems have been used by both Ukrainians and Russians in this war. Last year, Ukraine announced it had converted the systems to shoot U.S.-made missiles

Kherson on Oct. 24 came under intense Russian artillery bombardment, with what appeared to be the random targeting of residential areas killing at least two people.

Videos posted to social media ‚Äî some reportedly by Russian forces themselves ‚Äî showed multiple explosions across a vast area of the city.

Valentyna Fedorchuk, a Kherson-based journalist, told the Kyiv Independent that despite areas of the city being ""constantly under attack from artillery and drones,"" the bombing on Oct. 24 was notable for its intensity.

""The last time we experienced such terrible strikes was probably when the occupiers used KABs to hit the bridge connecting the Ostriv microdistrict ‚Äî there were several hellish nights for the locals then,"" she said.

Last updated 3:15 p.m Kyiv time

A man detonated a grenade on a train platform in the city of Ovruch, Zhytomyr Oblast, on Oct. 24, killing himself and three others, and injuring 12, the National Police reported.

The attacker, identified as a 23-year-old resident of Kharkiv, triggered the grenade at around 10:50 a.m. local time on the train platform as State Border Guard officers were checking passengers' documents.

The three women killed were aged 29, 58, and 82.

The man had recently been detained for attempting to cross the state border in western Ukraine, according to the police.

Last updated 2:38 p.m. Kyiv time

The Ukrainian military on Oct. 23 released footage of what it says is a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone ""hunting Ukrainian farmers"" in Donetsk Oblast.

Posted on Facebook by the 12th Brigade Azov, the video clearly shows at least four men in a field abandoning agricultural equipment and running from the drone.

""The interception from an enemy FPV drone shows how Russian operators staged a 'safari' of civilian farmers,"" the post reads.

Last updated 7:04 a.m. Kyiv time.

An overnight drone attack hit a residential building in the city of Krasnogorsk in Moscow Oblast, injuring five people, including a child, regional governor Andrey Vorobyov claimed on Oct. 24.

A drone flew into an apartment on the 14th floor of the building at around 4 a.m. local time, Vorobyov said in his Telegram post. Four victims were hospitalized, including the child who suffered a dislocated knee and minor shin injuries, he added.

Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed in his Telegram post that the Russian air defense had shot down three drones flying toward the capital. He said that the emergency service workers are working at locations where the debris fell.

The Russian Defense Ministry claimed in the morning that it had shot down 111 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 34 flying over Rostov Oblast bordering Ukraine to the west. It only reported one drone being shot down over Moscow Oblast, contrary to the mayor's claim.

In Rostov Oblast, about 1,500 people are left without electricity after the drone attack, regional governor Yuriy Slyusar claimed in his Telegram post at 6 a.m. local time.

At least three people have been killed and 69 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Oct. 23.

Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 72 out of the 128 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. Forty-seven strikes were recorded at 10 locations.

In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and nine others injured due to Russian strikes, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin.

In Sumy Oblast, a 53-year-old man was injured as a result of an first-person-view (FPV) drone strike.local authorities reported.

In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed two people and injured seven others, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin.

The two killed were Freedom TV journalist Olena Hramova and cameraman Yevhen Karmazin. Their colleague, Special Correspondent Oleksandr Kolychev, was injured in the attack and has been hospitalized.

Hramova, Karmazin, and Kolychev had reportedly been on assignment in the region when a Russian Lancet kamikaze drone struck the vehicle they were traveling in.

‚ÄúRussia continues to target journalists who are documenting its war against Ukraine ‚Äî killing them and wounding them,‚Äù President Volodymyr Zelensky said, condemning the attack.

Russia has lost around 1,134,170 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Oct. 24.

The number includes 910 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,283 tanks, 23,458 armored fighting vehicles, 65,356 vehicles and fuel tanks, 33,972 artillery systems, 1,526 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,230 air defense systems, 427 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 73,826 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

Prime Minister Mark Carney says Canada is prepared to pick up trade negotiations with the U.S. when it is ready.

Reuters

Prime Minister Mark Carney says Ottawa is ready to resume tariff talks once U.S. President Donald Trump decides to do so, but he stopped short of calling on Ontario to pull anti-tariff ads running in the United States.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, however, said the ad is going ahead as planned on Friday.

Mr. Trump abruptly cancelled the talks late Thursday night after he became annoyed at ads featuring former president Ronald Reagan that were sponsored by the Ontario government. Mr. Carney spoke while boarding a plane for an Asian trip, where he is expected to see Mr. Trump in South Korea next week for APEC summit but did not take questions from reporters.

‚ÄúWe can't control the trade policy of the United States,‚Äù he said, while noting ‚Äúdetailed and constructive progress‚Äù had been made in recent weeks to get tariff relief on steel and aluminum as well as possible deal on energy.

‚ÄúWe stand ready to pick up on that progress, to build on that progress when the Americans are ready to have those discussions because it will be to the benefit of workers in the United States, workers in Canada,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Carney did not call on Mr. Ford to pull the ads.

The Ontario government has said it is spending $75-million on the entire ad campaign, which is running on major U.S. networks.

In a text message to The Globe and Mail on Friday, Mr. Ford said the ad will be running tonight for the World Series.

The Prime Minister said the U.S. tariff war has affected all of its trading partners, which is why his government is determined to diversify trade away from the U.S.

In Truth Social posts on Thursday night and Friday morning, Mr. Trump lashed out at Canada over the ad, accused Ottawa of trying to influence a U.S. Supreme Court case on the legality of his tariffs and defended the levies as necessary for national security.

‚ÄúCANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote early on Friday. ‚ÄúCanada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country.‚Äù 

The U.S. high court is set on Nov. 5 to hear arguments over whether many of Mr. Trump's sweeping global tariffs ‚Äì those imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ‚Äì are legal after a lower court struck them down.

In the Friday post, he accused Canada of ‚Äúfraudulently‚Äù claiming that Mr. Reagan opposed tariffs ‚Äúwhen actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.‚Äù

Kevin Hassett, Mr. Trump's economic advisor, said Friday morning that the U.S. President's ‚Äúfrustration has built up over time‚Äù because ‚Äúthe Canadians have been very difficult to negotiate with.‚Äù

Speaking with reporters outside the White House, he declined to get into detail about what specifically had soured in the talks. 

‚ÄúI guess the lack of flexibility and also, I would guess, the leftover behaviours from the Trudeau folks that can be very frustrating,‚Äù Mr. Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said when asked what Canada was doing that Mr. Trump did not like.

The tone was a notable shift from Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump's meeting at the White House earlier this month. Mr. Trump had repeatedly praised and complimented the Prime Minister, even as he said the two countries were in competition for auto sector jobs.

The Government of Ontario released this TV ad which will be broadcast in the U.S. that uses a recording of Ronald Reagan to argue against tariffs.

Government of Ontario

Mr. Reagan, who signed the original Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement, which later became NAFTA and now USMCA, was a major proponent of free trade. But the Ronald Reagan Foundation complained that the Ontario ad quotes portions of a speech in which Mr. Reagan criticized tariffs without specifying that, in the same speech, he defended imposing tariffs in some situations.

The Ronald Reagan Foundation, in a post on X, said it learned that the Ontario government created an ad campaign ‚Äúusing selective audio and video‚Äù of Mr. Reagan delivering a radio address about free and fair trade on April 25, 1987.

‚ÄúThe ad misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address, and the Government of Ontario did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter.‚Äù

Mr. Ford responded briefly to Mr. Trump's missives on Friday morning. 

‚ÄúCanada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together,‚Äù Mr. Ford said in a post on X. The Premier also linked to Mr. Reagan's full address.

Mr. Trump on Friday also reiterated his long-standing complaint about Canada's supply-management system for dairy and eggs, one of the few sectors under USMCA that still includes tariffs.

Despite signing USMCA during his first term as president, Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian autos, steel, aluminum and other products as part of his global trade war. The two governments have been in talks since the spring as Ottawa tries to get the tariffs lifted.

Earlier this month, after a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Carney at the White House, the Canadian government said it was focusing on near-term deals on the steel, aluminum and energy sectors. The two countries and Mexico are also set to review and potentially renegotiate USMCA.

Mr. Trump's framing of tariffs in national security terms is key to his argument in the Supreme Court case. Mr. Trump is arguing that the U.S. trade deficit is a crisis for which he had to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The act does not say anything about tariffs and has not previously been used to impose them.

Ontario's 60-second TV ad features present-day images of families and workers, such as welders and bakers, and is voiced with Mr. Reagan's April 25, 1987, radio address decrying American protectionism, saying such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.

‚ÄúHigh tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,‚Äù Mr. Reagan says in the advertisement.

Mr. Ford touted the ad during a speech last week. He said the province intends to repeat the message ‚Äúto every Republican district‚Äù in the U.S. ‚ÄúThat ad, it's not a nasty ad. It's actually just very factual. Coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.‚Äù

Ottawa's move to impose tariffs on some vehicles imported by General Motors GM-N and Stellantis NV STLA-N will harm Canada's manufacturing sector and drive off investments, the Detroit Three automakers say.

The government of Canada on Thursday said it will reduce the number of vehicles the carmakers can import tariff-free, in response to production shifts by the two automakers that could cost thousands of jobs in Ontario. Finance Minister Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne said on social media the tariffs are a ‚Äúclear consequence‚Äù of the ‚Äúdeeply disappointing‚Äù shifts by Stellantis and GM.  

Brian Kingston, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents GM, Stellantis and Ford Motor Company F-N in Canada, called Canada's retaliation ‚Äúan unforced error at the worst possible time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe share the government's goal of protecting Canada's auto industry and its workers,‚Äù Mr. Kingston said. Tariffs on automakers in Canada when they are already under enormous pressure from U.S. trade policies only makes a difficult situation worse, he said.

In response to U.S. President Donald Trump's 25-per-cent tariffs on imported vehicles, Canada launched a tariff remissions plan for the automakers that assemble cars domestically. The cars these companies import from the U.S. remain tariff-free if the automakers maintain a certain investment footprint in Canada. Details of the agreements are confidential.

Opinion: Canada needs to start thinking about an auto sector without U.S. automakers

Ottawa determined Stellantis and GM violated the agreements with recent moves: GM ended production of the Chevrolet BrightDrop electric parcel van in Ingersoll, Ont., costing 1,150 jobs; and Stellantis moved planned production of the Jeep Compass to Illinois from Brampton, Ont., where about 3,000 are laid off.

In a letter to GM Canada president Kristian Aquilina, Mr. Champagne also highlighted declining production of the Chevrolet Silverado at GM's Oshawa plant. GM has been boosting the pickup truck's output at U.S. plants, he noted in the letter posted online.

Industry Minister M√©lanie Joly threatened to sue Stellantis over the Jeep move, which the automaker made as part of a plan to boost U.S. output by 50 per cent over the next four years, adding more than 5,000 jobs in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Mr. Kingston said manufacturers facing remissions rules would rather export cars to Canada than build them here and risk being hit with tariffs for making decisions based on changing consumer demands or business requirements.

‚ÄúThis is completely eroding our competitiveness right now for manufacturing,‚Äù Mr. Kingston said by phone. ‚ÄúThe tariff regime plus the EV mandate, now we have legal threats being levied to companies. It is virtually impossible to imagine a scenario where someone is looking at new investments in Canada under this framework.‚Äù

The Stellantis Brampton factory has been idle for almost two years awaiting a retooling to build the Jeep.

Both automakers say the plants are not permanently closed, and are looking at options for other vehicles to build there. 

Ontario is home to plants owned by Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Honda and Toyota. Ford's Oakville plant is idle but being retooled to make pickup trucks, the company says.

Details about Kim Kardashian's current condition remain unclear, including whether she is experiencing any symptoms.FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images

Kim Kardashian, the American reality television star and businesswoman, disclosed that she has a brain aneurysm during the Season 7 premiere of The Kardashians.

A preview clip from the opening episode on Thursday titled Feels Like the Old Days shows Kardashian, 45, undergoing brain imaging. ‚ÄúThere's like a little aneurysm,‚Äù she is heard saying, as close-up visuals of brain scans are displayed on a monitor.

A brain aneurysm occurs when a weak spot in a blood vessel in the brain bulges outward under pressure, resembling a blister. While most aneurysms are small and pose no immediate threat, a rupture can trigger bleeding in the brain ‚Äì a medical emergency known as a hemorrhagic stroke.

Her sister, Kourtney Kardashian Barker, reacts to the revelation with a brief, ‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù

Kim Kardashian continues, ‚ÄúThey're like, 'Just stress,'‚Äù before reflecting, ‚ÄúPeople think I have the luxury of walking away.‚Äù

The clip then cuts to another moment where Kardashian says, ‚ÄúThis week has been the hardest week of my life.‚Äù

Details about Kardashian's current condition remain unclear, including whether she is experiencing any symptoms. Kardashian's agent, public relations representative and attorney did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Kim Kardashian, reported to be a billionaire, derives her wealth from multiple ventures, including her television career, social media influence, and the development of a profitable line of cosmetics and foundation garments.

Kardashian, who rose to fame through the reality TV series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, filed for divorce from rapper Kanye West in 2021 after nearly seven years of marriage. They share four children.

The latest season of The Kardashians on Disney-owned Hulu continues its close-up of the personal and professional lives of Kris Jenner and her daughters: Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie.

It offers viewers a blend of high-stakes drama, emotional disclosures and behind-the-scenes access to their expansive business empires.

French investigators have found more than 150 pieces of DNA and fingerprints at the Louvre as the director calls for a police station to be set up inside the Paris museum.

The thieves who snatched millions of dollars' worth of jewelry in a daring daylight heist at the Louvre museum on Sunday left behind numerous DNA samples.

Investigators found ""more than 150 DNA, fingerprint and other traces"" at the scene, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told French news site Ouest-Franceon Thursday.

These came from a helmet, angle grinders, gloves, a vest and other items used and abandoned by the four burglars, Beccuau said.

""The analyses take time, even though they are a priority for the labs. We are expecting results in the next few days, which may provide us with leads, particularly if the perpetrators were on file,"" she said.

The hooded and masked thieves clambered up an extendable ladder onto a Louvre balcony on Sunday and broke into the first-floor Apollo Gallery, home to France's remaining crown jewels.

They made away with eight pieces of jewellery once owned by French queens and empresses worth an estimated ‚Ç¨88 million ($102 million).

But the thieves initially failed to open the jewelry display cases with angle grinders, Le Parisien news site reported on Wednesday, citing museum surveillance footage.

The perpetrators finally managed to break small openings in the cases with other tools and pull out the jewelry by hand, the paper said.

According to Le Parisien, the CCTV footage also shows that the internal alarm systems worked perfectly and immediately.

The first alarm went off at 9:34 am (0734 GMT) on Sunday when the burglars used a power tool to destroy the window of the balcony door.

Two museum employees tried to chase away the burglars before they could break open the display cases, the footage shows, Le Parisien said. But the footage shows the staff retreating, possibly out of fear that the burglars were armed.

The Louvre's director, Laurence des Cars, on Wednesday admitted that the thieves had taken advantage of a blind spot in the security surveillance to scale the museum's outside walls.

Speaking to the French Senate, des Cars said she would push for a police station to be set up inside the Louvre and restrict parking around the Louvre to stop vehicles parking directly next to the museum.

She also pledged to upgrade the CCTV network of the world's most visited museum.

Despite the CCTV failings at the museum, prosecutor Beccuau noted on Thursday that public and private security cameras elsewhere had allowed detectives to track the thieves ""in Paris and in surrounding regions.""

She said she hoped that, with all the media attention on the robbery, ""the robbers will not really dare move with the jewels."" ""I want to be optimistic,"" she said.

Germany's Finance Ministry said Berlin would pay 11,000 local employees at US military bases who might not receive salaries due to a US federal government shutdown.

Germany plans to pay some 11,000 local employees at US military bases in the country who might not receive salaries in October because of the government shutdown in Washington, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday.

""The [German] federal government will initiate an unscheduled expenditure to ensure that October salaries are paid on time,"" a ministry spokeswoman said.

A ministry spokeswoman told AFP news agency on Wednesday that it was still unclear whether the US government would send through the money but that the German government would ensure that salaries would be paid anyway.

She said the German government anticipates being reimbursed once the US side does make payment.

Berlin's contribution is ""a sign of solidarity with the US armed forces stationed in Germany and their civilian employees,"" she added.

Germany and the US are both members of the NATO military alliance and engage in substantial defense cooperation.

The US federal government shut down on October 1 after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a stopgap funding bill.

If no budget is passed, the government cannot approve new spending, which has a broad impact on several federal institutions.

Under the shutdown, federal workers are furloughed or continue to work without pay.

Earlier this month, the White House began carrying out mass layoffs of federal workers.

US President Donald Trump has blamed the impasse on his political rivals, saying: ""The Democrats are causing the loss of a lot of jobs.""

While the Democrats want more concessions from Republicans on health policy, they are under pressure from voters to come to an agreement and end the shutdown.

The US president said he's ending trade talks with Canada because of a ""fraudulent"" television ad opposing US tariffs.

US President Donald Trump said Friday he was cutting off ""all trade negotiations"" with Canada because of a ""fraudulent"" ad campaign against US tariffs.

Trump was referring to a television advertisement aired by the government of Ontario province that featured former President Ronald Reagan's warnings about the long-term risk of tariffs.

Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also said wanted to double his country's exports to countries outside the US because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs.

""The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is fake, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs,"" Trump posted to Truth Social.

He then continued, saying: ""Tariffs are very important to the national security and economy of the USA. Based on their egregious behavior, all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who has played a key role in trade negotiations with the US, announced the ad campaign earlier this month.

In a post on X late Thursday, the foundation said Ontario used and edited remarks from Ronald Reagan's ""Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade"" without permission. In the post, it said the views had been misrepresented, although it did not specify in what manner.

The foundation said it was ""reviewing legal options in this matter"" and invited the public to view the unedited version of Reagan's April 25, 1987, speech.

Reagan viewed free trade as compatible with using tariffs to defend American jobs and industries. His administration imposed a temporary 100% tariff on Japanese electronics and additional duties on other industrial goods, prompting criticism from some free market supporters who saw the measures as protectionist.

Ronald Reagan was an advocate of free trade and first proposed a ""North American accord"" during his 1979 presidential campaign, envisioning open trade between the US, Canada, and Mexico.

Though initially dismissed, the idea gained traction once Reagan took office. He later signed a trade agreement with Canada that laid the groundwork for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was finalized under Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. 

In the speech in question, Reagan said tariffs could sometimes work for a ""short time"" in protecting US workers' jobs. 

Longer term, he said, ""such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.""

""High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.""

Some 85% of cross-border trade between the United States and Canada remains tariff-free under an existing agreement, but Washington's global tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos have put pressure on Canadian industries.

The measures, introduced under Trump, have led to job losses and rising costs for Canadian manufacturers.

Carney has voiced optimism about progress toward easing trade restrictions in those sectors but has acknowledged that Trump appears determined to maintain tariffs on foreign-made vehicles.

One of the largest health care worker unions is spearheading the push to get the proposal on the November 2026 ballot.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A coalition of frontline healthcare workers, unions, and economists launched an effort Thursday to build support for a proposed ballot measure in California that would impose a one-time tax on the state's billionaires to avert a looming crisis spurred by national Republicans‚Äò unprecedented Medicaid cuts.

The proposed ballot initiative, titled ‚ÄúThe 2026 Billionaire Tax Act,‚Äù would levy a single 5% tax on the wealth of California's roughly 200 billionaires to offset healthcare funding shortfalls caused by the roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts that US President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans approved over the summer.

Service Employees International Union‚ÄìUnited Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), one of the largest healthcare worker unions in the country, is spearheading the organizing push to get the proposal on the California ballot in November 2026. The union expects support for the measure to grow quickly in the coming weeks, and organizers said they hope the effort can serve as a ‚Äúplaybook‚Äù for other states working to mitigate the increasingly devastating impacts of the GOP assault on Medicaid.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Dave Regan, the president of SEIU-UHW, said during a press call Thursday that ‚Äúit is a 100% certainty that we have the ability to put this on the ballot in 2026, and we intend to do so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe know what's going to happen if we don't do this,‚Äù Regan added, alluding to the hospital closures, healthcare job cuts, and other havoc the Trump-GOP Medicaid cuts are already causing across the nation.

Supporters of the new initiative warn that if Medicaid funding cuts aren't offset with new revenue, California could lose around 145,000 healthcare jobs and see hospital closures across the state, a disaster for vulnerable families.

‚ÄúWe are already short-staffed, and every week more patients walk through our doors with fewer places to go,‚Äù said Mayra Castanada, an ultrasound technologist in Lynwood, California. ‚ÄúIf these cuts take effect without replacement funding, it won't just mean longer lines ‚Äî it means people won't be able to get care when they need it.‚Äù

Experts estimate that the one-time tax would raise $100 billion ‚Äî a fraction of the staggering $2 trillion in combined wealth controlled by the 200 wealthiest Californians. Billionaires impacted by the tax would include Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang, two of the richest men in the world.

Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a leading expert on wealth inequality, voiced support for the initiative, saying that ‚Äúthe wealth of California billionaires has exploded in recent years while health and education in California are getting defunded by the Trump administration.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe tax is small relative to the massive gains billionaires have made, yet large enough to preserve programs that are crucial for California's economy and its continued success,‚Äù said Saez.

Former US Labor Secretary Robert Reich also backed the initiative, saying the GOP Medicaid cuts have sparked a ‚Äúmanufactured crisis.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese federal cuts didn't happen by accident ‚Äî they were designed to shield billionaires from contributing while pushing the consequences onto patients and workers,‚Äù said Reich. ‚ÄúA time-limited emergency tax on the ultra-wealthy is a practical way to keep the healthcare system functioning.‚Äù

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

The report stated that, unlike the Supreme Court, lower courts are ‚Äúengaged in a bipartisan fight for the rule of law.‚Äù

A new report on rulings from judges at different levels of the judicial branch indicates that the Trump administration receives more favorable rulings from the Supreme Court than it does from district or circuit courts, indicating a ‚Äúbipartisan fight for the rule of law‚Äù at lower courts and more ‚Äúideologically driven‚Äù outcomes at higher levels.

The report from Court Accountability, an organization that ‚Äúworks to combat corrupt abuse of government power and support movements in advancing a thriving democratic future,‚Äù examined hundreds of cases dealing with the Trump administration, including executive orders or actions taken by President Donald Trump himself. 

Legal challenges to the administration at the district court level won around 60 percent of the 240 orders judges have issued. That includes their winning 55 percent of the time when Trump-appointed judges were rendering the decisions.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

At circuit courts of appeals, there was a similar win rate, with challengers to Trump winning around 59 percent of the time in the 90 orders examined by Court Accountability. However, there were more partisan outcomes: Republican-appointed judges sided with the president in 84 percent of the cases, while Democratic-appointed judges sided with the challengers in 85 percent of the cases. 

At the Supreme Court, however, the rate was unquestionably pro-Trump ‚Äî among the 23 rulings and temporary orders made and examined by Court Accountability relating to the administration's actions, Trump had a 90 percent win rate. 

Most of these wins for the president came from the court's ‚Äúshadow docket‚Äù slate of opinions ‚Äî where the court has typically, in the past, only ruled on administrative measures. However, in recent years, the Supreme Court has been making announcements on cases, issuing injunctions or allowances of actions to remain in place, that have the same effect, essentially, as a final decision. Shadow docket rulings are also made without full oral arguments delivered before the justices of the Supreme Court. 

Court Accountability's report suggested that judges at the district court level were engaged in more rigorous examination than judges and justices in higher courts.

‚ÄúOur findings reveal that the district courts are engaged in a bipartisan fight for the rule of law ‚Äî but when cases against the administration reach the circuit courts, Republican-appointed judges have largely voted in Trump's favor, often writing ideologically driven dissents that their MAGA allies on the Roberts Court have then adopted to enable Trump's autocratic rule,‚Äù the report stated. 

It added: 

On the Roberts Court, Republicans rule. And as the Roberts Court begins its first full term of the second Trump administration, Trump has already amassed a 21-2 record on the so-called ‚Äúshadow docket‚Äù to prevent lower court orders against the administration's lawlessness from going into effect. 

The use of the shadow docket obscured the legal rationale of the rulings, the organization said.

‚ÄúThe justices have left us to guess why they are letting Trump persist in his lawlessness across a wide range of issues from immigration to federal spending, while leaving lower courts without guidance on how to carry out the high court's unexplained orders,‚Äù the report said.

The report calls for reforms to ‚Äústop the Supreme Court's abuse of its outsized power to abase itself before an anti-constitutional executive.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Trump's second term, it's clear that the courts Congress created to be closest to our country's cases and controversies are demonstrating far more respect for the Constitution and the democratic processes it protects than their right-wing appellate overlords sitting on ‚Äî or auditioning for ‚Äî the ‚Äòone supreme Court' ordained by the document that Trump, with their blessing, defies daily,‚Äù the organization concluded in its report. 

Court Accountability isn't alone in its criticism of the Supreme Court ‚Äî polling shows that American voters themselves are not happy with how the court has performed in recent years.

According to a Gallup survey published this month, a majority of respondents, 51 percent, say they have distrust in the high court, maintaining a level of skepticism that arose in 2022, following the controversial and anti-precedential anti-abortion ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health. 

A plurality of respondents in that poll, 43 percent, also said the Supreme Court is ‚Äútoo conservative.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs the Supreme Court prepares to open its 2025-2026 term, it does so with Americans' opinions of it near record lows,‚Äù Gallup stated in its analysis. 

Other polling suggests that trust in the Supreme Court could be restored with judicial reforms, including installing term limits for justices. According to a fall 2024 poll from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, nearly 7 in 10 U.S. voters (68 percent) backed the idea, with only 17 percent opposed to it.

Term limits for justices were also well-received across political lines, with 79 percent of Democratic-leaning voters and 58 percent of Republican-leaners backing the reform, the survey found. 

Establishing a stronger ethics code for justices ‚Äî including stronger mechanisms for enforcing such a code ‚Äî could also go a long way toward restoring trust, as some liberal justices of the court have recognized.

‚ÄúIt seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that we comply with our own code of conduct going forward in the future. It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we're doing exactly that,‚Äù Justice Elena Kagan said in 2024.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 How Nigeria and South Africa Can Lead the Continent to Prosperity and Stability

 Amaka Anku

As U.S. President Donald Trump dismantles the post-1945 liberal international order, some analysts insist that the disruption could be positive for countries that have found themselves on the periphery of the old regime. According to this logic, African countries would be more likely to attract investment and trade opportunities in a system less concerned about issues of democracy and good governance. But Trump's world, one in which raw coercion shapes geopolitics, is dangerous for states that have limited influence in the global economy. Succeeding in a deal-making era requires leverage that most African countries lack: the continent is home to about 20 percent of the world's population but only five percent of its economic activity.

African countries would stand a better chance of thriving in the postliberal international order if they came together. Closer coordination among even just a few influential African states could quicken the pace of economic integration on the continent, foster larger markets, and accelerate industrialization. Greater cohesion would also give the region more leverage in trade and investment negotiations with outside powers.

Such coordination is difficult to engineer, but not impossible. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, as former colonies gained independence from receding European empires, African countries united around a shared commitment to self-determination. Leaders across the continent exchanged ideas, financial resources, and weapons in support of one another's independence movements. When Ghana won self-rule in 1957, its leader, Kwame Nkrumah, declared that the country's independence would be ‚Äúmeaningless until it is linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.‚Äù And in 1963, the leaders of 32 newly independent African states met in Addis Ababa to create the Organization of African Unity. The OAU, the continent's first multilateral institution, became instrumental in coordinating support for African independence movements and forging an international consensus in support of African liberation.

African unity during this period was propelled by moral purpose and championed by the leaders of the first states to gain independence, including Ghana, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia. That ethos united elites across borders, ethnicities, and languages, forging a powerful consensus in favor of independence. In today's more transactional era, African unity is best advanced by a common economic agenda. Two of the continent's most powerful countries, Nigeria and South Africa, are best equipped to lead the charge. Together, they can amass the geopolitical clout, financial resources, and cultural influence needed to rally a plurality, if not a majority, of African countries behind a global vision. A more cohesive African bloc could extract more concessions from its trading partners and have more say in shaping global trade rules. To be sure, Africa is a vast and diverse continent, and its many states often have competing interests and foreign policies. But success in the dog-eat-dog world of Trumpian transactionalism won't come from African countries' ruggedly pursuing their own national interests; they will prosper only if they work together.

South Africa and Nigeria, the two largest economies on the continent, are best positioned to assume the mantle of African leadership in this new era. Nigeria, the most populous country with over 230 million people, wields significant cultural influence across the region and internationally. Its musicians dominate the globally popular genre of music known as Afrobeats, its films are watched all over the continent, and its fashion trends influence global brands. South Africa, Africa's most industrialized economy, has comparatively less cultural influence across the region. But it has greater global geopolitical heft than Nigeria, owing to its stronger and deeply rooted financial markets, which could help it raise funds to invest across the region. South Africa is already an important global actor, as a member of the G-20 and an early member of the BRICS grouping alongside Brazil, Russia, India, and China.

Partnership between Nigeria and South Africa is not unprecedented. In the early years of the twenty-first century, the two countries helped reshape the continent's institutional frameworks. Their presidents at the time, Nigeria's Olusegun Obasanjo and South Africa's Thabo Mbeki, shared a pan-African vision of advancing ‚ÄúAfrican solutions to African problems.‚Äù In 2002, they championed the replacement of the Organization of African Unity with the African Union, with the mandate to deepen regional integration‚Äîrecognizing that economic interdependence would help preserve unity. Mbeki and Obasanjo also worked together to form auxiliary AU institutions: the New Partnership for Africa's Development, focused on economic growth; the Pan-African Parliament, the legislative organ advising and exercising oversight over the AU; and the Peer Review Mechanism, which monitors progress in key governance indicators across the continent.

Since then, domestic pressures in both countries have undermined these pan-African initiatives. South Africa has been stuck in a low-growth trap since the 2008 financial crisis, averaging just above one percent GDP growth annually. This slump has accentuated racially based inequalities in income and wealth and fueled frustration with the political establishment. The subsequent rise of economic populism has heightened fiscal risks, as governments feel obliged to increase public spending in order to win elections. That pressure has also narrowed the space for pan-African initiatives: amid domestic discontent, South African leaders had neither the fiscal room nor the ambition to pursue projects abroad. In the past two decades, Nigeria struggled to sustain economic growth at a pace that could propel the country to middle-income status. That sluggish growth deepened religious and ethnic fault lines and allowed political opportunists to foment violence, forcing the authorities to focus on maintaining stability rather than spur economic transformation. As slow growth dampened ambitions in both countries, the AU slumbered without strong leadership. Today, the institution has little influence over the behavior of states and is not seen as a leader on any critical regional economic or political issue.

Greater economic integration would better position the continent to navigate a more transactional global order. Trump's tariffs have raised calls in South Africa and Nigeria to strengthen bilateral and regional ties to compensate for the potential loss of the U.S. market. In August, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his country would seek to broker more trade deals with other countries to offset the impact of Washington's 30 percent tariffs on South African exports. A subsequent South African trade delegation to Nigeria brought business leaders and policymakers from both countries together to discuss opportunities for cooperation across key sectors, including mining and manufacturing. Participants agreed that deepening intra-African trade would help drive industrialization across the continent. This should be an attractive proposition for South African companies: the country's exports to the African continent are already three times more than those to the United States. Nigeria is also more likely to export value-added or manufactured goods to other African countries, compared with the mostly raw commodities it currently exports to Europe and the United States.

Current leaders in Nigeria and South Africa are poised to drive such deeper integration. Under its current president, Bola Tinubu, Nigeria has demonstrated more ambition in its foreign policy than it has in nearly two decades. For example, it led the region's response to the 2023 coup in Niger, campaigned for membership in the G-20 and BRICS blocs, and cultivated economic partnerships with key countries in the global South, notably Brazil and India. Ramaphosa has also championed continental causes such as a permanent G-20 seat for the AU and increased global funding for African scientists. If South Africa and Nigeria meld their complementary strengths, they could wield greater economic power and revive continental cohesion to advance national and pan-African interests. Together they can rally African countries behind common positions on climate policy, trade, and regional security, strengthening the continent's geopolitical leverage.

Together, Nigeria and South Africa constitute about a third of Africa's economic activity. They are home to many of the continent's largest companies: for example, South African telecom and retail firms are dominant across the continent, and Nigerian banks and payment firms operate widely across the region. Access to a more integrated continental market would allow these companies to scale up production and lower operating costs, offering consumers more options at lower prices. Greater collaboration between Nigerian and South African firms could strengthen capital-intensive industries such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and steel and attract more foreign direct investment in both countries.

Both countries are desperately in need of an economic boost. Nigeria, set to be the world's third most populous country by 2050, must create greater economic opportunities for its young people. Over half of its population is under 20 years old, and about three million Nigerians enter the workforce annually. Nigeria needs investment to accelerate industrialization and avoid the worst-case scenario of its demographic boom: millions of unemployed and frustrated youths turning to criminal activity. Similarly, 30 years after South Africa's transition to multiracial democracy, citizens have grown frustrated by the slow pace of economic transformation and the integration of the country's Black majority into the white-dominated economy. A failure to boost growth in either country would exacerbate existing sociopolitical fissures and encourage radical political movements that seek a hurried overturn of the status quo.

To achieve closer economic cooperation, leaders in both countries should first improve basic bilateral coordination. South Africa would benefit from Nigeria's public backing of its diplomatic priorities, including support for Palestinian self-determination. In February, Trump disparaged reforms aimed at addressing the legacy of the apartheid era, falsely accusing South Africa of engaging in ‚Äúland grabs.'' The United States subsequently halted public health assistance to the country. Nigeria should have issued a statement reiterating its support for South Africa's efforts to address historical land inequities. Similarly, South Africa should coordinate more closely with‚Äîand champion‚ÄîNigeria's bid to join the G-20 and BRICS.



Implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area should also be a major focus of cooperation between the two countries. The agreement encompasses 54 African countries and 1.4 billion people and aims to eliminate tariffs on 90 percent of goods traded among member states‚Äîcreating a single $3.4 trillion market for goods and services across the continent. But trading under its auspices has been limited since it took effect in 2021, largely because of low productivity in member states and weak regional infrastructure. As a result, few products can credibly benefit from the removal of tariffs. Closer cooperation between Nigeria and South Africa to standardize regulatory requirements and develop complementary industrial strategies could encourage more intracontinental trade.

If the continent's two largest economies demonstrated a strong commitment to regional integration and trade, investors would be more inclined to take advantage of the accord and commit to production in the region, stimulating further cooperation across the free trade area. Both the Nigerian and South African governments could also pool capital to support startups and industrial research in priority sectors, such as advanced intelligence, defense, medical science, and mining technology. The project of regional integration should start with these basic bilateral steps. But over time, South Africa and Nigeria should seek buy-in from other continental power brokers, such as Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria.

As Trump's transactionalism reshapes geopolitics, it might seem natural for Abuja and Pretoria to resort to rivalry. But they have come together to lead the continent before and should do so again‚Äînot out of altruism, but as the best path to secure their interests. If Nigeria and South Africa can recognize their complementary strengths, they can lead Africa into a new era.

Live Updates


‚Ä¢ Entering a plea: New York Attorney General Letitia James has entered pleas of not guilty at her Norfolk, VA, federal court arraignment on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. A trial was set for Jan. 26 and James was released with no special conditions.
    


            ‚Ä¢ Trump's retribution campaign: James is among those that President Donald Trump has long sought retribution agains. James won a civil suit against Trump, his adult sons, and the Trump organization for inflating the value of his properties to obtain favorable interest rates on loans and insurance.
    


            ‚Ä¢ The charges: Prosecutors allege James misled a bank when she obtained a mortgage on a Norfolk, Virginia, property by stating it would be a second home, not an investment property. They say doing so allowed her to save $18,933 over the life of the loan. James calls the charges baseless, and a person familiar told CNN her grandniece and the woman's children live there and James has never collected rent.
    


            Friends and family filled the courtroom in Norfolk, Virginia, for Letitia James' arraignment Friday morning. When James entered through a side door she leaned forward and smiled at them.
    


            After the hearing, two of her friends told CNN they came to court to show support to James and that family members lined the back row of the courtroom.
    


            At the start of the hearing, Judge Jamar Walker called James to the podium with attorney Abbe Lowell to read her her rights. James replied ‚Äúyes judge‚Äù that she understood her right to remain silent and her right to an attorney. Back at the defense table, the judge asked Lowell how James would plead and he said James wanted to enter the plea herself.
    


            ‚ÄúNot guilty judge to both counts,‚Äù James said.
    


            Roger Keller, a US attorney out of Missouri, represented the Justice Department.
    


            Lindsey Halligan, the interim US Attorney for Northern Virginia who secured the indictment, sat in the third chair at the prosecution table and did not address the judge. She spoke only once to inform her colleague that they did have a copy of a pretrial report.
    


            The Virginia federal prosecutor who resisted bringing mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James sent investigative files with James' personally identifying information to her own private email account, according an email reviewed by CNN.



            The prosecutor, Beth Yusi, was dismissed earlier this month at least in part because of the mishandling of the personal information, people familiar with her termination said.
    


            Yusi's attorney Margaret Donovan, however, told CNN that the former prosecutor ‚Äúhas no record of any such email‚Äù and ‚Äúhas never used her personal email account for any portion of any investigation.‚Äù
    


            ‚ÄúMs. Yusi is a well-respected prosecutor, a leader among her peers, and a consummate professional with nearly two decades of experience,‚Äù Donovan said.
    


            Before her ousting, Yusi authored an internal memo that explained why prosecutors believed there was not enough evidence to bring charges against James. Her firing drew immediate criticism from those who have accused the Justice Department of following directives from the White House to target Trump's political opponents.

            After her arraignment in federal court, New York Attorney General Letitia James said she ‚Äúwill not be deterred‚Äù by her prosecution.
    


            ‚ÄúThere's no fear today, no fear,‚Äù James said in a brief statement outside the Norfolk, Virginia, federal courthouse as protesters chanted alongside her.  ‚ÄúBecause I believe that justice will rain down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.‚Äù
    


            She decried the case she faces, saying the justice system was being used as a ‚Äútool of revenge‚Äù and a ‚Äúweapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law.‚Äù
    


                    ‚ÄúI will not be distracted. I will do my job each and every day ‚Ä¶ there's work to be done standing up for the rule of law.‚Äù
                


                    Letitia James
                


            The motion from James to have the case against her dismissed based on President Donald Trump's appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim US Attorney in Northern Virginia will be combined with a similar motion from former FBI Director James Comey.
    


            Both sides have agreed to file a motion to combine the issue with Comey's case.
    


            The president handpicked Halligan to serve as interim US attorney in the Virginia district and see through the James and Comey prosecutions amid questions internally over whether there was evidence to indict either of them.
    


            Comey's defense attorneys are saying that Halligan can't serve as interim US attorney because that position hit its 120 day limit. They also say Halligan's new role does not appear to fit two exceptions for appointments to such vacancies under the law: She is not Senate confirmed nor is she someone who has been employed in Justice Department for at least 90 days.
    


            James' attorney told the he expects to file a motion to dismiss the case against her based on claims that the Justice Department is engaging in vindictive and selective prosecution.
    


            The judge said they must file it by November 7 and the Justice Department must respond by November 21, with a further response from James by November 28. A hearing on the motion would happen on December 5.
    


            New York Attorney General Letitia James was released on personal recognizance after entering her not guilty pleas. The hearing has ended.
    


            A small group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse where Letitia James is being arraigned.
    


            The judge said the trial could take five days and he didn't believe there was much complexity to the case that would require more time.
    


            The Justice Department said it has eight to 10 witnesses it may call.
    


            New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.
    


            ‚ÄúNot guilty judge to both counts,‚Äù James told the judge.
    


            The federal judge in Virginia overseeing New York Attorney General Letitia James' case has a long history of public service in the Commonwealth.
    


            US District Judge Jamar Walker was nominated to the Eastern District of Virginia in 2022 by then-President Joe Biden and confirmed to the lifetime position by the Senate with bipartisan support the following year.
    


            Walker was randomly assigned James' case after a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted her this month on two felony charges. Though the judge has maintained a low profile since taking the bench, all eyes will be on his courtroom in Norfolk when he presides over the first court proceeding in the matter.
    


            Prior to becoming a federal judge, Walker worked in the same US Attorney's Office in Alexandria that is now handling James' case. While there, he served for a time as a top prosecutor in the office's Financial Crimes and Public Corruption Unit, according to a court biography.
    


            After graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law, Walker clerked for Judge Raymond A. Jackson, whose seat he now occupies. Following the clerkship, he worked in private practice in Washington, DC, for several years.
    


            Walker's confirmation made him the first openly gay federal judge to serve in Virginia.
    


            Lindsey Halligan, a fierce Trump ally, assumed the job of top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia last month Within days, she pursued indictments against the former FBI Director James Comey and then James.
    


            Halligan's predecessor, Erik Siebert, was pushed out of the job amid political pressure to indict James, CNN reported.
    


            Halligan, a former insurance attorney from Florida, served as one of Trump's personal attorneys during the initial investigation into whether Trump was illegally keeping classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago estate.
    


            The president handpicked her to serve as interim US attorney in the Virginia district and see through the James and Comey prosecutions amid questions internally over whether there was evidence to indict either of them.
    


            Halligan, who had no previous prosecutorial experience,  was the only prosecutor to sign the two indictments against Trump's perceived enemies.
    


            Halligan faces new scrutiny this week after contacting a reporter - Lawfare's Anna Bower - on the messaging platform Signal two days after securing the grand jury indictment against James about the case.
    


            James attorneys filed a motion Thursday evening asking a federal judge to bar Halligan and other prosecutors from making public statements outside of court referencing Halligan's recently revealed conversations with Bower. The prosecutor offered her thoughts on the ‚Äúcredibility and general strength of the evidence presented to the grand jury.‚Äù
    


            Those comments ‚Äì which Bower reported earlier this week - represented ‚Äúa stunning disclosure of internal government information,‚Äù attorneys for James said in the filing Thursday.
    


            James' defense team also wants the judge to require prosecutors to keep a list of all contacts they have with members of the media.
    


            For months, President Donald Trump has openly discussed his plans to have a list of his perceived political enemies prosecuted.
    


            Now his Justice Department has been making good on that promise in recent weeks with the indictments of Letitia James, former FBI Director James Comey and former Trump adviser John Bolton.
    


            Comey, a longtime adversary of the president, was the first senior government official to face federal charges. He's pleaded not guilty to two felony counts for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony he gave in 2020.
    


            Former national security adviser John Bolton faces an 18-count federal indictment on counts of transmission of national defense information and retention of national defense information. He has also pleaded not guilty.
    


            The indictment came down days after James was charged though Trump has been calling for charges against his former ally since the release of Bolton's 2020 memoir that was highly critical of the president. The US Attorney's office has been quietly building a case against Bolton for years, CNN has reported.



            All three of Trump's indicted political foes have said they're victims of his weaponization of the Justice Department.
    


            And more indictments could be coming.
    


            The Justice Department, led by its weaponization working group head, Ed Martin, is reportedly investigating Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and the former Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over potential mortgage fraud, CNN previously reported.



            Trump has also publicly said he thought billionaire George Soros, known for backing liberal causes, could be another ‚Äúlikely candidate‚Äù for an investigation.
    


            New York Attorney General Letitia James is facing one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution.
    


            Prosecutors allege James misled a bank when she obtained a mortgage on a Norfolk, Virginia, property by stating it would be a second home, not an investment property.
    


            According to the indictment, the lower interest rate for a second home mortgage allowed James to save $18,933 over the 30-year life of the loan. It also alleges James filed a tax form indicating she received thousands of dollars in rental income.
    


            James has called the allegations baseless. A person familiar with the property says James' grandniece and her three children live at the home. James never gave up control of the property, never received rental payments and stays there during the year, the person said.
    


            New York Attorney General Letitia James has arrived at the federal courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia, to be arraigned on charges related to alleged mortgage fraud.
    


            Lindsey Halligan, President Donald Trump's handpicked interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is also present at the courthouse.
    


            The hearing is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m.
    


            James and Trump have a long history of animosity toward each other.
    


            James campaigned for New York attorney general in 2016 vowing to ‚Äúshine a bright light‚Äù into Donald Trump's real estate business. In 2022, she filed civil fraud charges alleging Trump, his adult sons, and the Trump organization inflated the value of hotels, golf courses, and other properties to obtain favorable interest rates on loans and insurance.
    


            A judge found Trump liable and ordered him to pay $454 million, including interest. A panel of appeals court judges upheld the fraud finding but dismissed the penalty, finding it excessive. Both sides have appealed.
    


            Trump has called James ‚Äúracist‚Äù and ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù and in 2024, while campaigning for president, said ‚Äúshe ought to be looked at.‚Äù
    


            Last month, Trump posted publicly on Truth Social a message, which was allegedly supposed to be private, to Attorney General Pam Bondi calling on her to move quickly. ‚ÄúNothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‚ÄòShifty' Schiff, Leticia??? They're all guilty as hell,‚Äù the president wrote.
    


            New York Attorney General Letitia James is set to be arraigned Friday at a federal courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia, two weeks after she was indicted on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.
    


            During the proceeding, which will take place before US District Judge Jamar Walker, James will be formally charged and will enter a plea.
    


            She is expected to plead not guilty to the two felony charges.
    


            The judge will also inform James of her rights and decide whether she will be detained as she awaits trial or set conditions of her release.
    


            The judge could also chose a trial date during Friday's arraignment.
    


            The proceeding is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. ET and could be brief. The arraignments this month of former FBI Director James Comey and ex-Trump national security adviser John Bolton both lasted less than 30 minutes.
    


            Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell is the lead attorney representing James in the investigation.
    


            Lowell is well known for defending politicians and has won acquittals or mistrials for several high-profile clients, including former Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. John Edwards, who was charged with campaign finance violations.
    


            A long-time Washington insider, Lowell served as counsel to House Democrats during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. He also represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner during the special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, and later Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges.
    


            After years working at a large DC law firm, earlier this year  Lowell set up his own shop driven by ‚Äúthe Trump administration's attempts to use the legal system to silence perceived opponents and critics.‚Äù
    


            His roster of clients includes former national security adviser John Bolton, whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security Miles Taylor, and several former FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors who were fired from their positions.

            President Donald Trump has canceled trade negotiations with Canada over what he called a ‚Äúfake‚Äù ad that featured parts of an anti-tariff speech delivered by conservative hero and former President Ronald Reagan. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute also said the ad misrepresented the former president's words.
    


            It wasn't fake. It was edited. But Reagan really did spend a five-minute speech ‚Äî an April 25, 1987, national radio address that the Reagan Library has published on YouTube ‚Äî railing against tariffs. It was a full-throated expression of support for free and fair trade.
    


            The ad, purchased by the government of Ontario and broadcast on major US television networks, aired clips of the address, delivered from Camp David, where Reagan was soon to meet the prime minister of Japan at a time when American attitudes toward Japan were hardening. In the recent past, Japanese companies like Toyota and Sony had flooded America's market with high quality but inexpensive cars and electronics, harming the business of great American brands, including General Motors and RCA.
    


            Shortly before delivering the radio address, Reagan had placed higher tariffs on various Japanese products in retaliation for the influx of cheap Japanese semiconductors to America. He had some harsh words for Japan ‚Äì not included in the ad ‚Äì criticizing it in terms that resembled Trump's frequent trade missives.
    


            ‚ÄúWe had clear evidence that Japanese companies were engaging in unfair trade practices that violated an agreement between Japan and the United States,‚Äù Reagan said. ‚ÄúWe expect our trading partners to live up to their agreements.‚Äù
    


            Reagan said he would remove the tariffs only when there was evidence Japan was treating American businesses and workers fairly ‚Äì also seemingly channeling one of Trump's go-to lines.
    


            But Reagan was clear: He was ‚Äúloath‚Äù to place trade barriers on Japan and believed high tariffs were damaging to American workers and the economy. He noted that economists widely believe that high tariffs of the Smoot-Hawley era had exacerbated the Great Depression, which he and others of his generation lived through ‚Äì a painful memory that, he said, remained ‚Äúdeep and searing.‚Äù
    


            The bulk of Reagan's address ‚Äì and the part the ad drew from most heavily ‚Äì was his description of why advanced economies had largely abandoned tariffs as an economic tool by the time he became president: They increase domestic companies' reliance on government intervention, they reduce competition, they kick off trade wars that lead to more tariffs, they raise prices and they ultimately lead to job losses.
    


            Reagan then criticizes the Democratic-controlled Congress for proposing legislation that could place more trade barriers on other countries. And, despite ‚Äúcertain select cases like the Japanese semiconductors,‚Äù Reagan said his administration had embraced free trade.
    


            It's not clear why Trump called the ad ‚Äúfake,‚Äù but his Truth Social post included a critical message about the ad posted online by The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute. It said the ad campaign used ‚Äúselective audio and video of President Ronald Reagan‚Äù and ‚Äúmisrepresents the Presidential Radio Address.‚Äù The foundation didn't say what it believed to be misrepresented.
    


            In a separate Truth Social post Monday, Trump incorrectly stated that Reagan supported tariffs.
    


            ‚ÄúThey fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,‚Äù Trump posted. ‚ÄúThank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.‚Äù
    


            The Ronald Reagan Foundation & Institute also claimed the government of Ontario didn't seek permission to use or edit Reagan's speech, although it's not clear it was legally required to. The foundation said it was reviewing its legal options and encouraged people to watch the unedited speech.
    


            The ad has run many times during high-profile events, including during the American League Championship series that featured the Toronto Blue Jays. Starting Friday night, the Ontario-based team will play in the World Series ‚Äì a great source of national pride for Canadians.
    


            Ontario Premier Doug Ford in a speech on October 14 said his government had placed the ad on virtually every major US network because he wanted to ‚Äútake Ronald Reagan's words and let's blast it to the American people.‚Äù
    


            ‚ÄúThat ad, it's not a nasty ad,‚Äù Ford said. ‚ÄúIt's very factual. And coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.‚Äù
    


            ‚ÄúHe was just the best president America has ever seen in my opinion,‚Äù Ford, a conservative politician, said.

            ‚ÄúThe shutdown is stifling our ability to grow,‚Äù said Grant Richardson, who founded a wine import company, Pangea Selections, in 2019.
    


            Richardson can't close on a six-figure Small Business Administration loan while the federal government is shut down, but the impasse hasn't given him a break on the roughly $20,000 in tariffs that he expects to fork over this month.
    


            The entrepreneur from Austin, Texas, is still waiting to receive roughly $10,000 in business tax credits for the quarter. And he can't seal a deal with a California winemaker to launch a new product line because the government is not approving new labels for bottles during the funding lapse.
    


            ‚ÄúThe government is still taking money from us, but it's not paying out what it owes,‚Äù he said, referring to the tax credits.
    


            The shutdown has frozen many of the government's key functions, such as lending and processing tax credits. And now without pay, hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country have pulled back on spending, creating economic ripple effects.
    


            From restaurants in Washington, DC, to businesses around national parks, the shutdown's impact is spreading through the US economy, with no relief in sight.
    


            Sean Han, chef manager at Market to Market, a cafeteria at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, said foot traffic has declined about 20% to 30% since the government shutdown began ‚Äî during a year that has already been tough because of mass federal layoffs.
    


            The business hasn't reduced employees' hours yet, he said, but that could happen ‚Äî in addition to the possibility of layoffs ‚Äî if the shutdown drags on for longer. With fewer customers, Han said he directed workers to focus on giving whoever comes in a better dining experience.
    


            ‚ÄúWe've been around for about 20 years, so we've seen this before,‚Äù Han said. ‚ÄúBut it took us nine months to recover after the pandemic and we'll have to rebuild again once this ends.‚Äù
    


            Restaurant reservations in Washington were down 9% last week compared to the same week a year earlier, according to data from OpenTable.
    


            In North Carolina, Pam Anderson is caring for only a handful of dogs at her Ocean Sands K-9 Resort in Kill Devil Hills.
    


            Some of her local clients have been calling off or shortening their vacations because the impasse has affected the national parks, or they are federal employees who are not being paid. At the same time, she is not getting any bookings from tourists, which she suspects is because the popular Wright Brothers National Memorial has shuttered.
    


            Just this week, a local family who planned to leave their two dogs with her for a few days in mid-November pulled out, which will cost her $500 in lost revenue. The couple works for the federal government.
    


            Although the kennel had a ‚Äúrocking September,‚Äù reservations are down 40% for October and 60% for November so far compared to last year, leading Anderson and her husband to tighten their belts. They have stopped going out to dinner a few times a week and are holding off on their charitable giving.
    


            ‚ÄúI told my husband the other day, ‚ÄòDon't spend any money',‚Äù said Anderson, 70, who is thinking of getting a night job.
    


            Last March, restauranteur Fran Bolden opened a cafeteria at the Redstone Arsenal, a US Army base near Huntsville, Alabama. It was a profitable side venture for Bolden in a town whose economic lifeline is the military, defense and aerospace industries.
    


            But that restaurant, Arsenal Eats, is now shuttered until the government reopens. Bolden said they usually expect around 150 people a day for breakfast and lunch; the past two weeks saw only between 25 to 30.
    


            ‚ÄúThe volume is just not there,‚Äù she said.
    


            Businesses all over downtown Huntsville and beyond are feeling the pinch, she said, and small businesses bear a big brunt of the burden.
    


            ‚ÄúThe local economy is in a military city. With people not out, not spending money, not sure what to do ‚Äì we rely on the business of these people in order to be able to sustain ourselves,‚Äù Bolden said.
    


            For the past two years, toddlers at Bernard Jackson's swim and wellness center in Washington, DC, have learned to float for the first time, and seniors in their eighties have practiced gentle exercises to stay strong.
    


            But the shutdown has taken a heavy toll. With fewer families able to afford lessons and operating costs on the rise, Jackson has had to make difficult choices just to keep his doors open. Many of his clients are federal employees directly affected by the lapse in pay.
    


            ‚ÄúSince people are not getting paid, they aren't coming to their lessons,‚Äù Jackson told CNN as he was leaving an unemployment center.
    


            ‚ÄúI can tell you at least 40% of my revenue has gone down.‚Äù
    


            Even as attendance drops, Jackson is finding ways to support his clients. He continues to send instructions and exercises for them to practice at home.
    


            ‚ÄúThe pool is still open,‚Äù he said.

TORONTO (AP) ‚Äî The leader of Canada's most populous province posted remarks by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan on social media on Friday showing Reagan opposed tariffs, hours after President Donald Trump announced he's ending ‚Äúall trade negotiations‚Äù with Canada because of a television ad that Trump said misstates Reagan's opposition to tariffs.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford didn't back down and said Canada and the U.S. are friends, neighbors and allies and Reagan knew that both are stronger together. Ford then provided a link to a Reagan speech where the late president voices opposition to tariffs. 

A spokesperson for Ford said the ad will run Friday night during Game 1 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers.

On Thursday Trump posted, ‚ÄúThe Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.‚Äù

Trump doubled down on his criticism of the Ontario ads again on Friday and accused Canada of trying to influence an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on his global tariff regime.

Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations has further inflamed trade tensions between the neighbors and longtime allies. 

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said this week he aims to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. Canadian officials remain ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors, he said. 




‚ÄúWe can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,‚Äù Carney said Friday morning before boarding a flight to Asia. ‚ÄúWe have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can't control.‚Äù

Carney is trying to secure a trade deal with Trump, but tariffs are taking a toll in the aluminum, steel, auto and lumber sectors.

White House spokesman Kush Desai said talks with Canada have not led to any constructive progress. 

‚ÄúOntario's taxpayer-funded ad campaign on American TV networks ‚Äì that misleadingly edited President Reagan's 1987 radio address about trade ‚Äì is the latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration,‚Äù Desai said in a statement. 

‚ÄúAs President Trump made clear on Truth Social, further talks are a futile effort if Canada can't be serious.‚Äù

The Ontario government has said it would pay about $75 million Canadian (US$54 million) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of former president Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987.

Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that an ad created by the government of Ontario ‚Äúmisrepresents the ‚ÄòPresidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.‚Äù

Ford said earlier this week he had heard that Trump had seen the ad. 

‚ÄúI'm sure he wasn't too happy,‚Äù Ford said. 

He said the aim is to ‚Äúblast‚Äù the pro-trade message to Americans. 

‚ÄúIt's real, because it was coming from the best president the country's ever seen, Ronald Reagan,‚Äù Ford said. ‚ÄúI feel the Reagan Republicans are going to be fighting with the MAGA group, and let's hope, Reagan Republicans win.‚Äù

Ford is a populist conservative who doesn't belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal. 

Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew backed Ford. 

‚ÄúIt's clear that these ads are working. If you throw a rock at a lake and you don't hear a splash, you probably missed. So to my good friend Doug Ford, keep the ads on TV. They're effective, and this country is behind you,‚Äù Kinew said. 

But Daniel B√©land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said the ad has backfired ‚Äúbig time.‚Äù

‚ÄúCarney probably needs to speak to Ford and other premiers to bring some sense of public unity to Team Canada,‚Äù B√©land said. 

Trump has been threatening Canada's economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be ‚Äúthe 51st state.‚Äù

Jason Kenney, a former Conservative cabinet minister under ex-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, called Trump's posts ‚Äújust embarrassing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Ontario ad does not misrepresent President Reagan's anti-tariff radio address in any respect whatsoever. It is a direct replay of his radio address, formatted for a one minute ad,‚Äù Kenney posted on social media.

‚ÄúEverything that Reagan said in his pro-free trade April, 1987 radio message is consistent with the ad.‚Äù

Kenney also took aim at the Reagan foundation.

‚ÄúThey know perfectly well that the Ontario ad captures precisely President Reagan's opposition to tariffs, and support for free trade. But it is obvious that the Foundation now has gormless leadership which is easily intimidated by a call from the White House, yet another sign of the hugely corrosive influence of Trump on the American conservative movement,‚Äù he posted

President Donald Trump says he doesn't feel bad ordering U.S. strikes against suspected drug vessels, saying he is ‚Äúsaving‚Äù lives.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, in the latest escalation and buildup of military forces in the region, the Pentagon announced Friday.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to deploy to U.S. Southern Command to ‚Äúbolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,‚Äù Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a social media post.

The USS Ford is currently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea along with three destroyers. It would likely take several days for the ships to make the journey to South America.

Deploying an aircraft carrier is a major escalation of military power in a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela.

Hours before Parnell announced the news, Hegseth said the military had conducted the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead and bringing the death count for the strikes that began in early September to at least 43 people.

The Pentagon told reporters it had nothing further to add beyond the statement.

Hegseth said the vessel struck overnight was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. It was the second time the Trump administration has tied one of its operations to the gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison.




The pace of the strikes has quickened in recent days from one every few weeks when they first began to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people since September. Two of the most recent strikes were carried out in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding the area where the military has launched attacks and shifting to where much of the cocaine from the world's largest producers is smuggled.

In a 20-second black and white video of the strike posted to social media, a small boat can be seen apparently sitting motionless on the water when a long thin projectile descends, triggering an explosion. The video ends before the blast dies down enough for the remains of the boat to be seen again.

Hegseth said the strike happened in international waters and boasted that it was the first one conducted at night.

‚ÄúIf you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda,‚Äù Hegseth said in the post. ‚ÄúDay or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.‚Äù

The strike drew parallels to the first announced by the U.S. last month by focusing on Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization and blamed for being at the root of the violence and drug dealing that plague some cities.

While not mentioning the origin of the latest boat, the Republican administration says at least four of the boats it has hit have come from Venezuela.

The attacks and an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela have raised speculation that the administration could try to topple Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.

In the latest move, the U.S. military flew a pair of supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela on Thursday. 

The Trump administration maintains that it's combating drug trafficking into the United States, but Maduro argues that the operations are the latest effort to force him out of office.

Maduro on Thursday praised security forces and a civilian militia for defense exercises along some 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) of coastline to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. attack.

In the span of six hours, ‚Äú100% of all the country's coastline was covered in real time, with all the equipment and heavy weapons to defend all of Venezuela's coasts if necessary,‚Äù Maduro said during a government event shown on state television.

The U.S. military's presence is less about drugs than sending a message to countries in the region to align with U.S. interests, according to Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region.

‚ÄúAn expression that I'm hearing a lot is ‚ÄòDrugs are the excuse.' And everyone knows that,‚Äù Dickinson said. ‚ÄúAnd I think that message is very clear in regional capitals. So the messaging here is that the U.S. is intent on pursuing specific objectives. And it will use military force against leaders and countries that don't fall in line.‚Äù

Hegseth's remarks around the strikes have recently begun to draw a direct comparison between the war on terrorism that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration's crackdown on drug traffickers. 

President Donald Trump this month declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the U.S. was in an ‚Äúarmed conflict‚Äù with them, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11.

When reporters asked Trump on Thursday whether he would request Congress issue a declaration of war against the cartels, he said that wasn't the plan.

‚ÄúI think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We're going to kill them, you know? They're going to be like, dead,‚Äù Trump said during a roundtable at the White House with homeland security officials.

Lawmakers from both major political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details. Democrats have insisted the strikes violate international law.

‚ÄúI've never seen anything quite like this before,‚Äù said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., who previously worked in the Pentagon and the State Department, including as an adviser in Afghanistan.

‚ÄúWe have no idea how far this is going, how this could potentially bring in, you know, is it going to be boots on the ground? Is it going to be escalatory in a way where we could see us get bogged down for a long time?‚Äù he said.

But Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who has long been involved in foreign affairs in the hemisphere, said of Trump's approach: ‚ÄúIt's about time.‚Äù

While Trump is a president who ‚Äúobviously hates war,‚Äù he also is not afraid to use the U.S. military in targeted operations, Diaz-Balart said.

‚ÄúI would not want to be in the shoes of any of these narco-cartels,‚Äù he added.

BANGKOK (AP) ‚Äî China said Friday it is creating a new holiday called the Commemoration Day of Taiwan's Restoration, as part of its claims over the self-ruled island.

The standing committee of its rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress, said the new holiday will mark Oct. 25, the day in 1945 when Taiwan, then a Japanese colony, was handed over to an official of the then-Republic of China.

‚ÄúEstablishing Taiwan Restoration Day and holding commemorative activities at the national level will help highlight the indisputable historical fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,‚Äù said Shen Chunyao, director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

The Republic of China was ruled by the Kuomintang Party, which later fled to the island of Taiwan from China in 1949 after losing in a civil war to the Communist Party. The Communists then established the People's Republic of China in 1949.

The Kuomintang Party ruled over Taiwan after the civil war, and remains one of two major political parties today.

Oct. 25 is already marked in Taiwan as a national holiday, under the name of Taiwan's Retrocession Day. Retrocession refers to giving a territory back to a country or government. 

China routinely states that Taiwan independence is a ‚Äúdead end‚Äù and that annexation by Beijing is a historical inevitability. China's military has increased its encircling of Taiwan's skies and waters in the past few years, holding joint drills with its warships and fighter jets on a near-daily basis near the island.

HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî Doris Brown was nearly asleep when a neighbor knocked on her door, telling her to look outside. ‚ÄúThere were no lights, nowhere,‚Äù said Brown, recalling the power outage that summer night in 2023. ‚ÄúI didn't even know it.‚Äù

Brown's solar panel and battery system was keeping her power on. She'd prepared for a night like this. ‚ÄúCall everybody,‚Äù she told the neighbor. 

Soon around 15 ‚Äúneighbors and neighbors' neighbors‚Äù were inside Brown's three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in Northeast Houston. They charged phones, cooked, and showered before work and school. Some slept over. 

‚ÄúThere were people sleeping everywhere,‚Äù said Brown, 75. She was happy to be ‚Äúa port in a storm,‚Äù despite one downside: ‚ÄúThey ate all my snacks.‚Äù 

Brown's house is a ‚Äúhub home,‚Äù one of seven in a Northeast Houston pilot program meant to create emergency safe havens ‚Äî not at shelters or community centers, but inside neighbors' houses. 

The idea was a grassroots response to decades of community disinvestment and neglect that got neighbors talking about what they could do to be ready for extreme weather and power outages.

‚ÄúIt's us helping us,‚Äù said Brown.

The project was set to reach 30 more homes, until the Environmental Protection Agency in August canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program which would have funded its expansion. Harris County, which includes Houston, is now a plaintiff in one of multiple lawsuits over the cancellation. 




People involved with the program acknowledge hub homes are unconventional ‚Äî requiring trust and community cooperation and impacting fewer people than a larger resilience center. 

But they also say they're effective in creating pockets of preparedness in communities confronting more extreme weather but lacking resources to do more.

‚ÄúIt was a way to increase resilience in those neighborhoods that are often forgotten,‚Äù said Sam Silerio, Texas program director at Solar United Neighbors, one of the nonprofits involved with the pilot program which is also suing over the cuts.

The hub homes idea started after Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when freezing temperatures crippled Texas' power grid for five days and led to 246 storm-related deaths, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.

Power loss contributed to many of the deaths, as people with health conditions couldn't refrigerate medicines or run life-sustaining medical devices. Nineteen people died from carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly using generators and grills to stay warm.

‚ÄúWe were like, ‚ÄòShoot, power grid failure is a serious thing that we are not prepared for',‚Äù said Becky Selle, co-director of disaster preparedness, organizing, and operations at West Street Recovery, a Northeast Houston nonprofit founded after Hurricane Harvey in 2017.

WSR bought some generators for residents willing to share the resource. Brown, who almost froze to death herself in Uri, stepped up. 

WSR added more supplies to the hubs, like life jackets and kayaks for flood evacuations, and held preparedness trainings for members.

When the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Solar United Neighbors approached them with a private grant from the Hive Fund to add free solar panels and batteries to several houses, WSR knew exactly where to install them.

The pilot had its challenges ‚Äî some roofs had to be repaired before they could hold solar panels, and hub captains had to learn how to manage their batteries to not deplete them. 

Success also required neighborly connection that modern communities often lack.

‚ÄúYou have to build that trust,‚Äù said David Espinoza, a hub home captain and West Street Recovery's co-director of community organizing and language access. The 34-year-old went door-to-door on his block, introducing himself to sometimes wary neighbors. ‚ÄúI got to know my neighborhood a lot better,‚Äù he said. 

About a dozen people are signed up on Espinoza's ‚Äúroster,‚Äù but he said the hub is there for anyone in need, prioritizing older neighbors and those with children or medical conditions.

There are other upsides, too: The solar and battery system reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and cut Espinoza's utility bill in half.

Espinoza, who is bilingual, said that for neighborhoods like his with mixed-status, Spanish-speaking, and medically vulnerable households, hub homes are useful even with other shelters nearby. 

‚ÄúThey can access me a little easier,‚Äù he said. 

Efforts to bolster local resilience have grown in recent years as extreme weather, power outages, and electricity prices overburden communities.

Average annual power interruption hours across the U.S. have jumped in the last decade, largely due to extreme weather, according to Sarah Kotwis, senior associate at the clean energy nonprofit RMI. 

‚ÄúCommunities do need to be thinking more strategically about resilience,‚Äù said Kotwis. 

That preparedness begins with connections between neighbors, said Renae Hanvin, CEO and founder of Resilient Ready and an expert on ‚Äúsocial capital,‚Äù or the ‚Äúconnections, trust and cooperation between people.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt's the missing link in the disaster resilience ecosystem,‚Äù said Hanvin. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, the first thing you need (in an emergency) to help you is a person.‚Äù 

As disasters worsen, first responders simply can't help everyone at once, she said, so neighbors must think of themselves as ‚Äúzero responders.‚Äù

Many communities have also turned to ‚Äúresilience centers,‚Äù or locally trusted institutions like community centers or churches that are outfitted with backup power, emergency supplies, and even year-round social services.

Ideally, resilience investments aren't an either-or decision, said Dori Wolfe, SUN senior Texas program associate. ‚ÄúHub homes are one piece of the web, and there should be a resilience center at the center of each of these nodes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe need all of it.‚Äù

Solar United Neighbors and West Street Recovery planned to expand the program this fall as part of a $54 million grant awarded to Harris County by the EPA.

They intended to grow the number of hub homes to 30, and add more batteries to existing ones to better run heating and air conditioning during outages. The money would have also funded a local resilience center.

In August, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled the EPA's Solar for All program, intended to support residential solar for more than 900,000 lower-income households. Zeldin said authority for the ‚Äúboondoggle‚Äù program was eliminated under Trump's tax-and-spending bill.

‚ÄúIt's a huge letdown,‚Äù said Silerio. Both Solar United Neighbors and Harris County sued the EPA in separate lawsuits this month over the cuts, as did over a dozen state attorneys general. 

The termination ‚Äúpulls the rug out from the very people the federal government should be protecting,‚Äù Harris County Interim County Administrator Jesse Dickerman said in a statement to The Associated Press.

West Street Recovery isn't giving up on more hub homes. The nonprofit intends to fundraise through the community and seek other grants.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump announced he's ending ‚Äúall trade negotiations‚Äù with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs that he said misstated the facts and was aimed at influencing U.S. court decisions.

The post on Trump's social media site came Thursday night after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he aims to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations could further inflame trade tensions that have been building between the two neighboring countries for months. 

Trump posted, ‚ÄúThe Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.‚Äù

The ad was paid for by the Ontario provincial government, not the Canadian federal government. The Ontario government said it planned to pay $54 million (about $75 million Canadian) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of then-President Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987.

‚ÄúThey only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,‚Äù Trump wrote on his social media site. ‚ÄúTARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.‚Äù

Ontario Premier Doug Ford didn't back down, posting on Friday that Canada and the U.S. are friends, neighbors and allies ‚Äúand Reagan knew that both are stronger together.‚Äù Ford then provided a link to a Reagan speech where the late president voices opposition to tariffs.




Carney said his government remains ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors.

‚ÄúWe can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,‚Äù he said Friday morning before boarding a flight for a summit in Asia. Trump is set to travel to the same summit Friday evening. 

‚ÄúWe have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can't control,‚Äù Carney said. 

Ford is a populist conservative who doesn't belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal.

Trump, on Friday morning, furiously posted on his social media site that ‚ÄúCANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!‚Äù on the tariff ad. 

‚ÄúTHE UNITED STATES IS WEALTHY, POWERFUL, AND NATIONALLY SECURE AGAIN, ALL BECAUSE OF TARIFFS!‚Äù he wrote in a separate post on his Truth Social account. ‚ÄúTHE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER IS IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!‚Äù

Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that an ad created by the government of Ontario ‚Äúmisrepresents the ‚ÄòPresidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.‚Äù It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission ‚Äúto use and edit the remarks.‚Äù 

The foundation said it is ‚Äúreviewing legal options in this matter‚Äù and invited the public to watch the unedited video of Reagan's address. 

As for the Supreme Court, Trump is referring to a case scheduled for early November in which the justices will consider the legality of his sweeping tariffs. Two lower courts have determined that Trump cannot unilaterally impose wide-ranging tariffs under an emergency powers law. His administration argues otherwise, saying he can regulate importation and that includes tariff policy. 

Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on.

More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.

Trump said earlier this week that he had seen the ad on television and said that it showed that his tariffs were having an impact.

‚ÄúI saw an ad last night from Canada. If I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also,‚Äù he said then.

In his own post on X last week, Ford ‚Äî the leader of Canada's most populous province ‚Äî posted a link to the ad and the message: ‚ÄúIt's official: Ontario's new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched.‚Äù

He continued, ‚ÄúUsing every tool we have, we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.‚Äù

Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs.

The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas.

Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois.

This story has been corrected to show that Trump noted in a social media post that the ad cost $75 million, not $75,000.

Federal immigration agents were greeted by protests Thursday in the San Francisco Bay Area on their way out to a century-old, government-owned artificial island that houses a U.S. Coast Guard base.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents began arriving at Coast Guard Island to support federal efforts to track down immigrants in the country illegally. The Coast Guard is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, along with Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

A statement provided to the news media by the Coast Guard said that ‚Äúthrough a whole of government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.‚Äù

President Donald Trump then said Thursday that he is backing off a planned surge of federal agents into San Francisco after speaking to the mayor. It was not clear if the president was canceling a National Guard deployment or calling off immigration enforcement by CBP agents.

Coast Guard Island is a 67-acre human-made island formed in 1913 in the Oakland Estuary between Oakland and Alameda. It is federally owned, does not allow visits from the general public without an escort or specific government identification, and it has been home to the current base, Base Alameda, since 2012, according to a Coast Guard document from 2016.

Base Alameda provides a variety of services for Coast Guard activities throughout the West Coast.

The island came to be partly because of an effort to deal with sanitation problems in Alameda through an 1873 proposed tidal canal. By 1918, the island that was built using reclaimed mud from dredging was ready to be occupied. Its first tenant was the San Francisco Shipbuilding Company, which made two ships before closing in 1921.




The state Supreme Court awarded the island to the city of Alameda in 1926. The federal government acquired each tract of land by 1948.

The Coast Guard first came to the island in 1926 when it established a base there. The Coast Guard used the land for various purposes, including a training center set up in the 1940s and closed in 1982. That year, the Coast Guard established Support Center Alameda and the island was renamed Coast Guard Island.

Ultimately, in February 2012, the Coast Guard set up Base Alameda on the island, combining several existing operations to set up departments in the base.

According to the 2016 Coast Guard document, Coast Guard Island employs more than 1,200 people during the workday, including active duty military, Coast Guard Reserve, civilians, contractors and occasional Guard Auxiliary personnel.

The island has a perimeter of about 1.25 miles.

The base is the home port for four so-called national security cutters ‚Äî ships that are 418 feet long, 54 feet wide, with a top speed over 28 knots, a range of 12,000 nautical miles, endurance up to 90 days, and capacity for a crew of up to 170, according to the Coast Guard.

One of them just recently returned from an Arctic deployment of more than 21,000 nautical miles.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on the latest in the New Jersey gubernatorial race on 'Special Report.'

The Democrat Party is not doing enough outreach with Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters and could risk the party's gubernatorial election in the deep blue state of New Jersey ‚Äî home to one of the nation's largest Asian American populations, a Democratic National Committee (DNC) official warned. 

""We lost ground with many of our communities,"" DNC Vice Chair Shasti Conrad told Fox Digital of the Democrat Party following its 2024 election losses. ""The Asian American community was one of them. Where we found that ‚Ä¶ more votes that did go towards Donald Trump, not overall, but in terms of a change from, you know, 2020 to 2024 there was a dip in the support for Democrats.""

""I've certainly seen there's been a greater play from the Republican Party to reach Asian American voters, particularly in these last several years,"" Conrad added. ""And, you know, while there's also been a lot of anti-Asian rhetoric and anti-Asian hate that has come from the Republican Party, there's also been a real sort of tapping into fears around the economy, around the impact of taxes on the Asian American community, and that there have been more Republicans that have actually, you know, gone to Asian community spaces."" 

The year 2025 is an off-season election year, with only Virginia and New Jersey holding gubernatorial elections, and New York City holding a highly-anticipated mayoral race.

New Jersey is a longtime Democrat stronghold, previously voting for a Republican presidential candidate during former President George H.W. Bush's 1988 election. Trump, however, made inroads with New Jersey voters in the 2024 election, sparking renewed enthusiasm among Republicans to flip the state red. 

New Jersey voted to elect former Vice President Kamala Harris as president in the 2024 race, but post-election data showed Trump and the GOP flipped five counties red. All in, Trump cut his 2020 loss from 16 points to six in 2024. 

Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill was elected the party's nominee for governor and will face off against Republican Jack Ciattarelli at the polls Nov. 4. 

FORTNIGHT TO ELECTION DAY: 5 KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH

New Jersey has a massive Asian American population at just more than one million people in a state of roughly 9.5 million total residents. The 2024 voting data shows there were 584,236 eligible Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters in the state. 

Conrad, who is also the chair of the Washington State Democratic Party, told Fox Digital that the lack of outreach to the voting bloc could hurt the Democrat Party's efforts to retain the governorship. She said she reminds party members that ""there are a million Asian Americans in New Jersey"" and that ""we as Democrats, have not invested as much as we could have into the community at our own peril.""

AAPI voters ""are the fastest growing demographic in this country, and we are growing in states that we need to win in,"" she added. ""We are growing in the South. We're a growing population in North Carolina, in Georgia, in Texas."" 

On the national stage, 57% of Asian voters backed Harris in 2024, but Trump also improved his margins with the voting bloc compared to 2020. Trump saw one-in-four Asian votes cast in his favor in 2024 compared to earning 30% of the Asian vote in 2020, according to Pew data. 

The DNC leader said the party needs to meet AAPI voters in their community, whether it be at temples and churches or Asian-owned businesses, and hear their concerns directly. 

The voting bloc brings a multitude of cultural backgrounds and, subsequently, is a very nuanced group. Conrad noted the diversity of the group when listing off common top voting concerns among AAPI voters, including the economy and immigration ‚Äî most notably how it relates to H-1B visas. 

Conrad said Republicans have met with Asian voters at their churches and businesses and at other cultural events in recent history, with the party increasingly throwing its support behind Asian candidates, as well. 

""They've just have done more,"" Conrad said about the GOP. ""And they've also been running more Asian candidates, which is ‚Ä¶ sometimes it's confusing to voters, in particular the Asian American community, where there's a lot of pride in having leadership that, you know, that is from the community."" 

She called on Democrats to include Asian voters in their common campaign platforms focused on Black, Latino, rural and young voters.

""When we're talking the importance of really building that coalition, we have to continue to say and include Asian Americans in that as well,"" she said. ""And I think sometimes we get left off, as you know, not even considered or thought about or remembered as a really important community to engage with."" 

Sherrill campaign spokesperson Sam Chan told Fox News Digital when asked about their AAPI outreach that ""throughout the campaign, Mikie has partnered directly with Asian communities, and shared her vision to lower costs, bolster support for small businesses, and ensure people have the opportunity to achieve the American dream here in New Jersey.""

""As governor, Mikie will work to ensure Trenton serves everyone,"" Chan continued. ""Mikie will work to make it easier to start and grow a small business and lower costs, ensure our schools are fully funded, and stand up for our constitutional rights and uphold the law. Mikie's Save You Time and Money Agenda will help business owners launch and expand their ventures, while her State of Emergency on Utility Costs will end the rate hikes and reduce electric bills."" 

Chan also took a shot at Trump in the remarks, saying Ciattarelli ""cheers along Trump as he attacks our communities, rips away billions from our schools and transit system, and jacks up prices with his unaffordable tariffs, Mikie is running to fight for all New Jerseyans.""

Fox News Digital also spoke with Parul Khemka, a New Jersey Democrat running for re-election on the Livingston Board of Education, who said the Sherrill campaign has increasingly attended cultural events, including a Diwali celebration.

""Even within Bergen County, there's a big east Asian population, so she's tapped into that as well. It's just, New Jersey is a little bit funky. You'd think that it's one party, one thing ‚Ä¶ But different counties have their own different attributes, so you have to figure it out as you go along.""

Sherrill, she added, was involved in cultural events in her congressional district, which includes portions of Essex, Morris, and Passaic Counties in North Jersey, and that her office has historically been approachable. 

TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT, BUT PRESIDENT FRONT AND CENTER IN 2025 ELECTIONS

Khemka said that top priorities for the AAPI community commonly include education, immigration and visas, and the economy and affordability, while also noting the massive voting bloc is nuanced and diverse. She said AAPI voters have always leaned more to the left, from her view, but that voters moved more to the right as Trump campaigned on getting the economy back on track following spiraling inflation.

Democrats, Kehmka said, are positioned to better appeal to AAPI voters as they understand the nuances of the voters' political concerns as opposed to broad issues.  

""The Democratic Party obviously does a little bit better than the Republican Party to understand these nuanced issues, and they do not paint everybody in the same brush,"" she said, adding that the AAPI community in New Jersey could make or break Democrats retaining the governor's mansion. 

The Sherrill campaign, for example, has deployed multilingual phone banking and canvassing programs in towns with high levels of Asian voters, with Sherrill, herself, also meeting with voters in their communities. 

Conrad said that the Sherrill campaign has built more inroads with AAPI voters in recent months, pointing to outreach events over the weekend that included DNC chair Ken Martin also traveling to the Garden State to rally support for the ticket.

""We did an AAPI oriented canvas. And then ‚Ä¶ DNC Chair Ken Martin hosted an AAPI roundtable to meet with AAPI leaders and to show that engagement. I have heard, even just in a month's time, I had heard a big change from the community about feeling like they were, you know, being engaged more directly by the Sherrill campaign, and we're feeling better about it,"" Conrad said. 

""I do think that that work is happening,"" she added, praising efforts by the DNC's AAPI caucus, specifically South Asians for America, rallying Democrat support ahead of New Jersey's and Virginia's high-stakes elections. 

The New Jersey gubernatorial election is slated for Nov. 4. Fox News Digital reached out to Ciattarelli's campaign Thursday for comment on AAPI outreach and has yet to receive a reply.

A Florida man's response to a neighborhood game of ding-dong ditch has reportedly landed him behind bars after police say he pointed a gun at a teenage prankster.

The incident occurred at around 8 p.m. on Oct. 16, when homeowner Santiago Cairo, 40, noticed a group of people at the front door of his Boca Raton house and believed they were attempting to break in, according to WPTV.

Cairo reportedly called 911 before arming himself with a gun and confronting a 14-year-old outside his home.

According to arrest records obtained by WPTV, Cairo told authorities he did not aim his gun at the teenager, and instead kept it at a ""low ready position"" as he waited for authorities to arrive.

However, the young prankster alleges Cairo acted more violently than originally believed.

While the teen admitted to ding-dong ditching Cairo's home, he told investigators that Cairo confronted him holding a flashlight and a gun, yelling, ""You messed with the wrong guy,"" WPTV reported.

The teen said Cairo then ordered him to get down on his knees, and at one point grabbed his shoulder in an attempt to push him to the ground ‚Äì ultimately leaving him feeling threatened, according to WPTV.

Investigators later determined the young prankster never attempted to break into Cairo's home, with Cairo admitting to police that he ""went too far"" when responding to the situation.

‚Äã‚Äã""All I can say is that Mr. Cairo never in fact pointed his firearm at anyone or put his hands on anyone,"" Cairo's attorney told WPTV.

Cairo's attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

Cairo was arrested on charges of aggravated assault with a firearm, the outlet reported. He was released from jail on a $10,000 bond.

However, his neighbor, Mary Elizabeth Hall, reportedly expressed her support for Cairo while adding that she felt disappointed how the events unfolded.

""I witnessed the mother drive away with her children in the back,"" Hall told WPTV. ""While my neighbor, Santiago, was sitting handcuffed in the back of the car.""

Hall added that their South Florida neighborhood has seen an influx in car break-ins, while defending her neighbor's actions.

""I question if it was a prank, or if they were trying to steal something,"" Hall said, according to WPTV. ""My neighbor did the right thing, and the outcome was not the right thing.""

Hall is set to appear in front of a judge next month.

""I hope the outcome is that the young man learns a very serious lesson,"" Hall added. ""And that my neighbor, Santiago, his name is cleared.""

A body has been found during the search for a missing Vermont college student who was last seen on campus about a week ago.

Lia Smith, 21, was last seen on Middlebury College's campus on the night of Oct. 17 and was reported missing that Sunday, the school announced. Smith, a trans woman from California, is a senior double majoring in computer science and statistics and a former Middlebury women's swimming and diving team athlete.

On Thursday afternoon, around 1:30 p.m., Vermont State Police said they located an unidentified body in a field west of the Middlebury College campus. The location where the body was found is in the town of Cornwall near The Knoll, the college's organic farm, the agency said.

VERMONT POLICE SEARCH FOR STUDENT WHO VANISHED FROM MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE

Police said they secured the area and began a death investigation. At this time, officials are awaiting an autopsy to confirm the identity of the victim and to determine the cause and manner of death.

That autopsy is scheduled to take place on Friday in Burlington, Vermont. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Vermont Department of Health for comment.

At this time, investigators said they do not believe the death is suspicious.

Police initially said they would hold a live press update on Thursday afternoon, but canceled it shortly before it was set to begin. The Middlebury Police Department called in additional agencies, including the Vermont State Police, New York State Police and the FBI, to help after trying to find Smith using ground searches and drones for several days.

Middlebury College President Ian Baucom said in a statement on Instagram Thursday that the college is ""doing all we can to support our community right now.""

""I know that this is extraordinarily difficult news to receive as we continue to hold Lia and all her family and friends tight in our hearts,"" he wrote. ""As ever, please care for yourselves and one another.""

War Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced another deadly strike on alleged narco-terrorists in the Caribbean Sea.

President Donald Trump directed a nighttime U.S. strike on a suspected Tren de Aragua vessel in the Caribbean Sea, killing six alleged narco-terrorists, the administration announced.

""Overnight, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO), trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean Sea,"" War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on X, sharing an accompanying video of the strike. ""The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics."" 

""Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters ‚Äî and was the first strike at night,"" he said. ""All six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.""

Hegseth further warned, ""If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat [al Qaeda]. Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you."" 

The strike marks the 10th strike targeting suspected drug trafficking boats since Trump returned to office. The president has made combating the nation's drug crisis a central policy focus.

The first strike took place on Sept. 2, and since then, 43 suspected drug traffickers have been killed and two have survived, officials said. The pace of the strikes has increased from one every few weeks in September to three so far this week. 

The operations have mostly targeted vessels linked to Venezuela's Tren de Aragua network. The missions have ranged from attacks on smuggling boats to the destruction of a submersible. Footage of several operations have been released by Hegseth and Trump on social media.

When reporters asked Trump on Thursday whether he would request that Congress issue a declaration of war against the cartels, he said that wasn't the plan.

""I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We're going to kill them, you know? They're going to be like, dead,"" Trump said during a roundtable at the White House with Homeland Security officials.

Trump this month declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the U.S. was in an ""armed conflict"" with them.

Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle are questioning Trump's decision to launch the operations without first consulting lawmakers. Several Democrats are warning that the strikes could breach international law.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has also raised concerns about killing people without due process, and in a recent interview, Paul cited Coast Guard statistics that show a significant percentage of boats boarded for suspicion of drug trafficking are innocent.

The administration has targeted boats in recent weeks that it claims are transporting drugs for the Venezuela-linked Tren de Aragua gang. The senator has also argued that if the administration plans to engage in a war with Venezuela, it must seek a declaration of war from Congress.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has also slammed the strikes, calling for a criminal investigation against Trump and other officials involved. He said an innocent Colombian fisherman was killed in one of the operations. 

Venezuelan leader Nicol√°s Maduro has accused the Trump administration of using the strikes to try to force regime change in his country.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., have backed the strikes, calling them a justified show of force against narco-terrorists.

National Cattlemen's Beef Association Vice President of Government Affairs Ethan Lane joins ‚ÄòFox & Friends' to discuss how the latest round of reciprocal tariffs may impact the U.S. beef industry.

While President Donald Trump's proposal to import more beef from Argentina is billed by the administration as a way to bring down prices for American consumers, critics say it misses the real issue driving costs at the grocery store: corporate concentration in the U.S. meatpacking industry.

Four corporations ‚Äî Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef ‚Äî anchor the U.S. beef supply chain, with pricing power that reaches from pasture to plate. As a result, the gap between what producers are paid for cattle and what consumers spend on beef has remained wide, a reflection, economists say, of how market power is distributed along the supply chain. 

Fox News Digital reached out to all four companies for comment but did not receive a response as of publication.

The frustration extends beyond farm country ‚Äì Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., says the dominance of multinational meatpackers is hurting both producers and consumers.

""Four corporations control 85% of the meat sold in the United States. One of these corporations is Chinese-owned and one is Brazilian-owned. American farmers are being squeezed and American consumers are being gouged,"" Massie told Fox News Digital.

Massie, who raises cattle on his Kentucky ranch, warned that expanding beef imports from Argentina would only worsen those structural problems.

""Flooding the market with Argentinian beef is not the answer to these problems. An America First solution to rising beef prices is to pass my PRIME Act, which would empower American farmers to sell directly to consumers without interference from global corporate middlemen,"" Massie said.

Under current federal law, beef processed at small, state-inspected facilities can't be sold across state lines, even if it meets the same health standards as federally inspected meat. Massie's PRIME Act would remove that barrier, a change supporters say would let local ranchers reach more consumers and compete with the big packers.

Economists agree the beef market is highly consolidated, but say the forces shaping prices go well beyond any one trade deal.

Glynn Tonsor, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, told Fox News Digital that strong consumer demand continues to drive beef prices higher, regardless of supply fluctuations.

""There's nothing that forces me or you or anybody else when we go into the grocery store to pay more for beef. People are choosing to,"" he said. ""The consumer desire for beef is strong and, regardless of the supply-side situation, that has the effect of pulling prices up.""

He also noted that the large-scale structure of the U.S. meatpacking industry, often criticized by ranchers and lawmakers, has economic benefits for consumers.

""I would argue that those economies of scale benefit consumers,"" Tonsor said. ""The ability to operate at a cheaper cost per head and, ultimately, per pound produced gives us the ability to offer beef and every other item we're talking about at a cheaper price. Anything we do that loses those economies of scale actually hurts consumers in the form of higher prices.""

FROM CATTLE TO CRUDE: HOW TRUMP'S TARIFFS ARE RATTLING THE LONE STAR STATE

Derrell Peel, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, said that even if U.S. imports from Argentina increase, the impact on overall prices would be negligible.

""Most of what we import is lean, processed beef trimmings used for ground beef,"" said Peel, who specializes in livestock marketing. ""We're not talking about the kind of beef that affects steak prices. Even if we doubled imports, it would be such a small share of the total supply that we wouldn't detect any real impact.""

Peel added that there's no quick way to ease pressure on cattle prices, since it takes roughly two years to bring animals to market and several years to rebuild herds.

""The fact of the matter is there's really nothing anybody can do to change this very quickly,"" he said. ""We're in a tight supply situation that took several years to develop, and it'll take several years to get out of it.""

Meanwhile, the White House defended the plan, saying it's aimed at balancing relief for consumers with long-term support for U.S. cattle producers.

""The president loves our ranchers, and he also loves American consumers, and he wants to do right by both,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.

Leavitt said Trump's immediate goal is to lower beef prices by increasing supply through additional imports, while a separate, long-term plan will focus on strengthening the domestic cattle industry.

She pointed to a three-part plan announced by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which includes expanding grazing access, easing regulations for new ranchers, cutting inspection costs and improving ""Product of USA"" labeling to ensure consumers know when they're buying American-made beef.

A man in Alabama says he was shot 10 times while trying to protect his friends from a gunman who fatally shot Kimber Mills, a high school cheerleader.

Mills, 18, was shot early Sunday in Pinson, Alabama, in a heavily wooded area referred to as The Pit, according to AL.com. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said that the suspect, 27-year-old Steven Tyler Whitehead, showed up at around 12:24 a.m. and fired his gun several times after a verbal and physical fight. WVTM reported the shooting took place at a bonfire.

Prosecutors charged Whitehead with three counts of attempted murder and he is being held on a $180,000 bond.

Ashley Mills, the victim's sister, shared on Facebook that Kimber died on Wednesday night. Kimber was a senior at Cleveland High School, where she ran track and was also a cheerleader.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump ally touts new grand jury possibly targeting Obama, Biden officials","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3860488/trump-administration-eyeing-conspiracy-case-obama-biden-officials/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Top Trump administration officials from multiple agencies are taking steps behind the scenes toward further exposing what they say was a far-reaching scheme to weaponize the government against President Donald Trump, as one of his top allies hints the evidence could soon come together before a grand jury in Florida.

Federal prosecutors in South Florida are quietly preparing a new grand jury that could set the stage for criminal charges against former Obama- and Biden-era officials accused of orchestrating an alleged yearslong conspiracy to undermine Trump during his first presidency and after his 2020 election defeat. A recently-posted order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Sept. 26 shows that Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga authorized a grand jury to convene in Fort Pierce beginning Jan. 12, 2026. The order does not specify the subject of the proceedings.

  2025-74  by  reportoftheday  

But a top Trump ally has publicly said the grand jury will be used to look at evidence related to an alleged weaponization conspiracy. The new panel will convene as multiple arms of the administration appear to be coordinating fresh efforts to revisit the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and alleged intelligence abuses during the Obama years.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced over the summer that the DOJ had assembled a ‚Äústrike force‚Äù to look into claims that senior national security officials ‚Äúmanufactured and politicized‚Äù intelligence during the 2016 transition to tie Trump to Russian election interference. She also authorized the convening of a federal grand jury, triggered by a criminal referral from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who has suggested the evidence released by him and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard show that officials under former President Barack Obama made a coordinated attempt to invent allegations that Trump's campaign had colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.

‚ÄúWe will leave no stone unturned to deliver justice,‚Äù Bondi said at the time.

Earlier this week, Gabbard revealed that since April, a so-called Interagency Weaponization Working Group, coordinating officials at ODNI, DOJ, FBI, and CIA, among others, had been meeting biweekly to ‚Äúshare information, coordinate, and execute,‚Äù though the group has no clear connection to the planned grand jury proceedings in Florida.

Obama spokesman Patrick Rodenbush dismissed the allegations as ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù and ‚Äúa weak attempt at distraction,‚Äù while former intelligence officials rejected Gabbard's conspiratorial claims.

The Washington Examiner previously reported in August that the DOJ could benefit from convening a grand jury in South Florida‚Äîa venue more politically favorable to Trump than Washington, D.C., where most predicate conduct from the 2016 Russia investigation occurred.

‚ÄúThere's no doubt South Florida is a more logical venue for this kind of case,‚Äù former federal prosecutor James Burnham posted to X at the time, noting that U.S. Attorney Jason Reding Qui√±ones, confirmed by the Senate in July, would likely oversee such a proceeding.

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani previously warned that choosing a venue so far from the locus of the original events ‚Äúcould invite scrutiny,‚Äù though he acknowledged it could also help prosecutors avoid the perception of anti-Trump bias among jurors in alternative venue options like Washington, D.C.

Proponents of using the Florida venue for a hypothetical conspiracy case argue the 2022 Mar-a-Lago raid provides a jurisdictional ‚Äúhook,‚Äù connecting the alleged conspiracy's origins in 2016 to later actions by federal agencies. 

‚ÄúThe conspiracy didn't end in 2016,‚Äù said former prosecutor David Gelman, a previous Trump 2024 campaign legal surrogate. ‚ÄúIt's a continuation‚ÄîObama-era officials embedded in the FBI and DOJ were still trying to block Trump's reelection years later.‚Äù

The push to hold Obama-era leaders accountable may explain recent remarks by one of Trump's most prominent legal allies.

Mike Davis, president of the Article III Project and a former Senate Judiciary counsel, said on The Charlie Kirk Show last week that U.S. Attorney Jason Reding Qui√±ones, a Trump appointee, had received court approval to seat the Fort Pierce grand jury. ‚ÄúIt should be fully up and running by January,‚Äù he said, calling the order ‚Äúa public document.‚Äù Davis made similar remarks earlier this month on Fox News, telling Maria Bartiromo that the grand jury would be an ideal venue to ‚Äúinvestigate what they did to President Trump,‚Äù adding that the August 2022 ‚ÄúMar-a-Lago raid is the hook.‚Äù

Mike Davis @mrddmia nails it: ""I think it goes all the way up to the top, to President Obama, to Vice President Biden, to Hillary Clinton, Comey, Brennan, Clapper, so many players within the Obama and Biden administration. And I think it also includes the Lawfare Democrats, these‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/4M03E5CbpW

‚ÄúI think it goes all the way up to the top,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúPresident Obama, Vice President Biden, Hillary Clinton, Comey, Brennan, Clapper‚Äîso many players within the Obama and Biden administration. And I think it also includes the Lawfare Democrats who coordinated with the Biden White House to bring these indictments against President Trump.‚Äù

Gelman said Davis's comments about the Fort Pierce grand jury should be taken seriously. ‚ÄúI know Mike personally ‚Ä¶ and he has his pulse on everything really well,‚Äù Gelman told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIf Mike thinks there's going to be a grand jury impaneled, I would take that as word. And if it is in Fort Pierce, that's a much better venue ‚Äî obviously a lot less liberal, a lot less left-leaning ‚Äî and it would have jurisdiction because Mar-a-Lago is right there. So I think it's a very relevant and appropriate place for this kind of investigation.‚Äù

He added that the breadth of any potential case could surprise even close observers. ‚ÄúIn a grand jury, you can be king or queen for a day, a lot of things can come out that weren't known at the beginning,‚Äù Gelman said. ‚ÄúIt's not a fishing expedition ‚Ä¶ but there are a lot of moving parts. You could see new individuals implicated, maybe even some heavy hitters, depending on what the evidence shows.‚Äù

Ratcliffe and Gabbard's revelations this summer came with a trove of declassified materials, including a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report that exposed falsehoods at the core of the Russia collusion narrative. The report concluded that ‚Äúno credible evidence‚Äù supported the assertion that Russian President Vladimir Putin explicitly sought to help Trump win, and that former CIA Director John Brennan pushed to keep the allegation in the intelligence community's public assessment despite internal objections.

A separate review by CIA Director John Ratcliffe supported that finding, alleging that Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey fought to include unverified opposition research from the Steele dossier, funded by the Clinton campaign, in official intelligence assessments.

Former U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins, a Trump ally, told the Washington Examiner in July that the disclosures expose a pattern of ‚Äúabuse of prosecutorial powers to eliminate political opponents.‚Äù

‚ÄúRichard Nixon's sins pale in comparison to what is suspected in this saga,‚Äù Cummins said. ‚ÄúAs Americans, we cannot tolerate this, and it must be investigated.‚Äù

The expansion of the DOJ's investigation comes amid a string of high-profile indictments targeting figures who have become known as some of Trump's biggest political enemies. Since July, prosecutors have charged former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former national security adviser John Bolton in separate cases.

Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) referred Brennan to the Justice Department for criminal investigation this week, a move largely symbolic absent evidence of contempt or obstruction, underscoring rising GOP pressure for accountability. The committee has also demanded hearings and testimony from former special counsel Jack Smith, whose classified documents case against Trump was brought in the same venue, and is now at the heart of speculation about a sweeping conspiracy case against former Democratic administration officials.

Trump, while meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in late July, accused Obama and his senior aides of ‚Äútreason‚Äù and said his administration had uncovered ‚Äúirrefutable proof that Obama was seditious.‚Äù

Legal experts caution that while the declassified evidence may be politically explosive, criminally charging a former president or his aides presents formidable obstacles, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's decision last year that found former presidents enjoy some immunity for official acts taken while in office.

Gelman, however, said the immunity issue may not be as absolute as some assume. ‚ÄúThe immunity decision only talks about things that happen while you are president,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIf Obama participated in certain things after leaving office, policy decisions, political meddling, anything illegal, he does not enjoy that protection. So yeah, Obama could potentially be a subject of an indictment if the evidence points that way. It's early, but where there's smoke, there's fire.‚Äù

HOUSE JUDICIARY REFERS OBAMA CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN TO THE DOJ FOR PROSECUTION

Additionally, a potential conspiracy case, rather than discrete charges, could allow prosecutors to argue that the alleged conduct forms part of a criminal scheme, effectively eliminating statute-of-limitations barriers that might otherwise protect Obama-era figures.

Whether the Fort Pierce grand jury ultimately results in criminal charges against former high-ranking officials remains to be seen. But with the court order now public and Trump allies openly discussing its implications, expectations are mounting that 2026 could bring the first-ever criminal case alleging a coordinated Democratic conspiracy against a sitting or former president.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What Hollywood Gets Wrong About Springsteen","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/10/springsteen-deliver-me-from-nowhere-review/684670/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The new Boss biopic robs his music of its mythic American qualities.

When the first trailer for Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere was released this summer, skeptical viewers immediately seized on a monologue delivered by Jon Landau (played by Jeremy Strong), Bruce Springsteen's longtime manager, explaining that the young Boss grew up with a hole in the floor of his childhood bedroom. ‚ÄúWhat he's doing with this album is, he's repairing that hole in his floor,‚Äù Landau says, somewhat literally, about Springsteen's creative process. ‚ÄúHe's repairing that hole in himself.‚Äù

The speech was wisely excised from the final theatrical cut, but the ‚Äúhole‚Äù line lingers over the writer-director Scott Cooper's film, in which Springsteen's childhood is an open wound‚Äîthe abyss he gazes into as he writes the songs that would appear on his 1982 album, Nebraska. Deliver Me From Nowhere follows Warren Zanes's book of the same title in emphasizing Nebraska as a personal breakthrough, one that was followed by a near‚Äìmental breakdown. But in this totalizing autobiographical framing, the majesty of the record is reduced to paternal conflict and blocked masculinity as the film undersells the scope of Springsteen's engagement with American iconography and musical traditions.

Deliver Me From Nowhere opens in black and white, in the 1950s, as young Springsteen's mother drives him to the local bar to retrieve his father, a frustrated working stiff impatient for his boy to become a man. As portrayed by Stephen Graham, one of the stars of Netflix's hit drama Adolescence, Springsteen's father is an intimidating figure, capable of violent outbursts and equally frightening silences. The movie then jumps forward to the adult Springsteen (Jeremy Allen White) in 1981: a rock god in tight jeans and sweat-soaked work shirt, closing out his tour in support of The River, his first LP to top the Billboard charts.

But he feels restless and creatively stagnant, and once he's settled in a house that his management has rented for him, he begins to write a new batch of songs, recording them in solo acoustic arrangements initially intended as demos. Springsteen's rental is close enough to his childhood home that he can drive by, as he occasionally does, lurking outside and steeping himself in the bad vibes, before going home to write another song. The film settles into a rhythm: Springsteen writes Nebraska more or less sequentially, some songwriting sessions interspersed with flashbacks to his father coming home in a drunken rage or melancholic mood. A memory surfaces; he records a song to tape, then sends it along to Landau, who listens and then describes its ‚Äúdark‚Äù and ‚Äúcondemned‚Äù tone to his wife (Grace Gummer, in the comically thankless role of a woman listening patiently while her guy analyzes classic rock at her).

Released as is‚Äîin those spare acoustic arrangements, in defiantly uncommercial packaging‚ÄîNebraska would be Springsteen's least characteristic and most critically lauded album, a collection of stripped-down ballads about desperate working-class characters that stood out like a mile marker on an empty highway. ‚ÄúNebraska is the most punk thing Bruce ever did,‚Äù Cooper told The New York Times, ‚Äúnot in sound, but in spirit‚Äù‚Äîa frustrating statement because Nebraska actually does sound like the only punk song heard in the film, Suicide's ‚ÄúFrankie Teardrop.‚Äù That track blew Springsteen's mind when he was making his record, and it has a similarly hollowed-out and reverb-haunted soundscape, in which a rock-and-roll whoop sounds like a distant banshee wail. Nebraska is the only time Springsteen made something that sounded so lo-fi and eerie, but that spirit infuses the rest of his work‚Äîto the extent that the subject of Suicide's song, a flailing factory grunt who got married too young, could be a figure from any of Springsteen's albums.

Cooper's screenplay is full of these missed connections. The film seems interested in the creative process‚Äîone of Landau's critical riffs concerns the elusive Proustian quality of tape hiss‚Äîbut largely skips over the unsuccessful full-band recording sessions that convinced Springsteen to release the demos as they were. What it gives us in the studio instead is ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.,‚Äù also originally composed and recorded as an acoustic demo during the Nebraska period, with White muscling his way through the definitive arena-rock version‚Äîa shimmering anthem that was successfully arranged for the band based on Springsteen's demos, but was eventually held back for his 1984 album of the same name.

This crowd-pleasing break from the moodiness of Nebraska is understandable in the film's context. Just as music documentaries must necessarily involve, and often directly originate from, the holders of a given artist's publishing rights, the biopic is likewise an investment in a back catalog. Last year's Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, was preceded by a blockbuster transaction in which Dylan's catalog was sold to Universal for more than $300 million; similarly, Springsteen's catalog got about $550 million from Sony Music Entertainment, in 2021. It's perhaps no surprise, then, that the artist biopic tends to be a Great Man narrative, a tacit acknowledgment that the musician at its center is also very much a brand. A Complete Unknown mitigated the tendency to focus entirely on personal turmoil with a cryptic lead performance by Timoth√©e Chalamet that mystified genius more than humanizing it, but both films struggle to imagine where art might come from, if not real life.

The limitations of this genre matter in the case of Springsteen, specifically, because his music has been a conduit for American energies much larger than himself. A Baby Boomer born in 1949, Springsteen as a child would have been more spectator to than participant in the great youthquake of postwar America. Consider 1973's hot-rod period piece American Graffiti, marketed with the tagline ‚ÄúWhere were you in '62?‚Äù That year, Springsteen was turning 13, too young to drive‚Äîbut he still ended up dressing like James Dean and making music about the open road and fast cars. His signature songs promoted an ideal of escape via horsepower that was drawn from a common store of nostalgic imagery built up during his childhood; his greatest composition, ‚ÄúRacing in the Street,‚Äù quotes '60s Motown and Brian Wilson's drag-racing songs while telling a story about the specter of thwarted dreams.

Springsteen was, and is, an evangelist for the vitality of American rhythm and blues, beginning with his days playing bar-band boogie on the Asbury Park boardwalk. You could see the utopian promise of the early rock revolution in his epic-length live shows, which were notable for the way he led sing-alongs, worked the crowd, and urged on his E Street bandmates in a self-conscious, quasi-religious exhortation‚Äîself-conscious because he was a 20-something kid carrying old music into a post-Vietnam decade of industrial decline and vanishing prosperity. His retro energy turned out to be a good fit for sour times: His songs of fading youth and broken promises conjured a lost innocence and reflected on that loss with bitter hindsight.

Before and after Nebraska, Springsteen wrote songs about the bone-weariness, shattered dreams, throttled rage, and creeping existential fear often felt in small-town America. But Nebraska was his most direct invocation of the grammar on which rock and roll was built: rockabilly rave-ups, folk laments, Delta harmonica, Gospel imagery. If the inspiration came in part from the closed-off doominess of the Springsteen line of men, it was nevertheless conveyed through lyrics about archetypal figures with troubles as timeworn as the blues: wanting money or acquiring it through illicit means; leaving and being left; escaping drudgery or avoiding jail. The title track is an outlaw ballad, a straightforward narrative account of an infamous crime‚Äîthe exploits of the 1950s spree killer Charles Starkweather, portrayed by Martin Sheen in Terrence Malick's 1973 classic, Badlands. In the lineage of standards such as ‚ÄúFrankie and Johnny‚Äù and ‚ÄúStagger Lee,‚Äù the song is drawn directly from contemporaneous news reports and secondhand embellishments.

In Deliver Me From Nowhere's rendition, Nebraska went deeper than anything Springsteen had ever done before. It was also what he had to get out of his system so that he could get the E Street Band back together to make the album that‚Äîas one of the final title cards reminds us‚Äîmade him a generational superstar. In actuality, Nebraska is not just a personal triumph but also an artistic one. It endures as the centerpiece of a career spent channeling the myths of modern America and cementing them in the national memory. Just consider Starkweather's resemblance to James Dean, which Malick and Sheen emphasized in Badlands‚Äîsurely as relevant to Springsteen, and this album, as whatever reminded him of his dad.

Many in the party say it needs a wider range of candidates to run. Does that include people with Nazi tattoos?

For the first few months of his U.S. Senate campaign, Graham Platner looked like just the kind of candidate that many Democrats say they want right now. The party has been bleeding working-class men for decades, including in the two elections it lost to Donald Trump. Donors are desperately searching for a ‚ÄúJoe Rogan of the left‚Äù who will help liberals reach disaffected, internet-poisoned men in their 20s and 30s. Platner seemed like he could help the party reach those men, and others who feel disappointed, disillusioned, or left out in the current political and economic landscape. He served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine and Army infantryman; now he's a 41-year-old oysterman living in Sullivan, Maine. His voice is a gravelly baritone, which he uses to vent frustrations about how working people are being swindled.

After announcing his candidacy in August, Platner was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and received praise (and at least one donation) from other senators. He won the backing of three labor unions, filled town halls, and raised millions of dollars from small donors in his effort to defeat Republican incumbent Susan Collins.

Last week, though, CNN released a report revealing Platner's Reddit history under the username ‚ÄúP-Hustle.‚Äù In 2021, he referred to himself as ‚Äúa communist,‚Äù and said that all cops are bastards. Other news outlets soon found additional posts: Platner suggested in 2018 that semiautomatic rifles are necessary to ‚Äúfight fascism,‚Äù and in various posts from 2013, made insensitive remarks about sexual assault and asked, ‚ÄúWhy don't black people tip?‚Äù Then, on Monday, to get ahead of opposition research, Platner's campaign released a video showing that he had a tattoo on his chest resembling the ‚ÄúTotenkopf‚Äù skull associated with the Nazis‚Äîa connection that Platner said he wasn't aware of when he got the tattoo in 2007, and that he only recently learned about. ‚ÄúI am not,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúa secret Nazi.‚Äù By Wednesday morning, he'd gotten the tattoo covered up by a Celtic knot with a dog motif.

I'm not a political reporter, but I live in Maine, so I took special interest in this story. I spoke with Platner about his past, first in a roughly 90-minute-long video call on Sunday, and then in a shorter phone conversation on Tuesday, after the tattoo story broke. In our initial interview, he seemed eager to explain his old Reddit posts, some of which he said he regrets, some of which he said he wanted to contextualize, and some of which he did not apologize for. ‚ÄúI am still angry at the government,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I'm very, very angry at the political establishment that, honestly, sent me to fight in these goddamn wars. And it's still the same political establishment. Many of the people that I'm kind of up against at the moment are the people who voted to send me to Iraq in the first place.‚Äù Some of Platner's allies, including Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, have said that they view the timing of the release of the Reddit posts as a strategic move from the Washington establishment to keep Platner out.

Platner has received extensive criticism for the revelations. The podcaster and writer Wajahat Ali wrote, ‚ÄúIt's time to drop Platner.‚Äù The Wall Street Journal published an editorial with the headline, ‚ÄúOops, I've Had a Nazi Tattoo for 18 Years.‚Äù Zach Schwartz, the director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Jewish Community Alliance of Southern Maine, denounced Platner's tattoo, along with his refusal to take donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which Schwartz said ‚Äúplays into familiar, harmful tropes that Jews or organizations like AIPAC control the government.‚Äù Jordan Wood, another candidate in the Maine race, said, ‚ÄúGraham Platner's Reddit comments and Nazi SS Totenkopf tattoo are disqualifying and not who we are as Mainers or as Democrats.‚Äù Republican incumbent Susan Collins, said last week that she was ‚Äúappalled‚Äù by what he had written online. ‚ÄúThese were not comments that he made when he was in high school,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThese are comments that he has made quite recently.‚Äù

But for now, at least, the Democratic party is not calling on Platner to step down. Ken Martin, the head of the DNC, said that Platner's online comments were ‚Äúhurtful‚Äù but not ‚Äúdisqualifying,‚Äù and that the choice is up to primary voters. Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who is neutral in the race, said, ‚ÄúEveryone has a right to grow and grow out of their stupidity.‚Äù Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said, ‚ÄúGraham has made a lot of mistakes in his life. He's had a very long journey to the place where he is today, but he's owned those mistakes, owned up to them, and he's evolved.‚Äù Khanna called the tattoo ‚Äúhorrendous,‚Äù but said: ‚ÄúDo we want our political governing class to be like the classmates I had at Yale Law School, some of them who dreamed of being president of the United States from the age of twelve?‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúOr do we want normal people also having a chance at these offices?‚Äù Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said, ‚ÄúHe went through a dark period. He's not the only one in America who has gone through a dark period.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúI'm confident that he's going to run a great campaign and that he's going to win.‚Äù A poll released yesterday, conducted as the news about Platner's past was breaking, found him leading his Democratic primary opponent Maine governor Janet Mills by 34 points.

Democrats' apparent willingness to stick with Platner may be an acknowledgment that the question of which behavior is disqualifying to voters is more uncertain now than it used to be. Where is the line on internet speech and basic decency, for example, when the White House conducts politics by meme, and the governor of California's X account has resorted to open trolling? Where is the line on tattoos when the head of the Defense Department has tattoos associated with the Crusades, and the head of the National Counterterrorism Center has the word Panzer‚Äîthe infamous Nazi tank‚Äîinked on his arm?

Whatever the reasons for it, the support for Platner feels like a departure from a time, not too long ago, when a controversy like this might well have sunk a politician, especially an upstart‚Äîand especially a Democrat. (Since at least the #MeToo movement, some Democrats have groused about how their party is quicker to force out otherwise-qualified candidates over perceived transgressions than MAGA Republicans, who seem to view disqualifying behaviors as badges of honor.) Platner's candidacy looks like a test‚Äîof how ‚Äúbig tent‚Äù the Democrats want to be, and how willing its voters are to accept baggage, from social media and beyond, that less polished candidates can carry.

In our first conversation, Platner told me about the environment he was coming out of in the early 2010s, and how it affected the way he used to speak and think online. ‚ÄúViolence and aggression are seen as virtues,‚Äù he said, describing the world he was in as an infantryman. ‚ÄúEverything is crude and offensive.‚Äù Platner seemed to struggle to find the right words to explain why the Marines' social norms are this way. ‚ÄúIt's such a‚Äîand I don't want to‚Äî‚Äù he faltered. Then he said: ‚ÄúIt's because we kill people.‚Äù Dark humor, irony, and inappropriate comments, he told me, are coping strategies. ‚ÄúHow do you get through watching your friends get blown to fucking pieces?‚Äù Platner said. ‚ÄúHow do you get through watching the aftermath of a bomb dropped on a house that was actually full of civilians? How do you do any of that shit in a healthy way?‚Äù In his case, he didn't. He told me that as he looks back on his internet history from the period, he sees a person who was lost, lashing out, and sometimes posting inflammatory comments simply to offend others.

‚ÄúEverything just went sideways,‚Äù is how Platner described the time in his life when he began posting online heavily. It was 2012, and he was in his late 20s and living in Washington, D.C., where, he said, civilian life and a GI Bill stint at the George Washington University didn't agree with him. Platner said he couldn't shake the shadow of his last deployment. ‚ÄúI wanted to be a soldier since I was 2. It's all I ever wanted,‚Äù he told me. But if anything remained of that childhood dream, Platner's last tour had thoroughly disabused him of it. ‚ÄúI spent a year in the mountains of Afghanistan in 2010 and '11,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI partook in, and personally witnessed, an immense amount of violence.‚Äù

He told me that these experiences left him feeling ‚Äúunmoored,‚Äù ‚Äúwildly isolated,‚Äù and ‚Äúfull of rage‚Äù back in the real world. ‚ÄúI was angry at the country for making me go do this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was angry at the military for not figuring out how to do it right. I was angry at civilians who didn't understand at all what I had just been through.‚Äù Primed by military culture to believe that ‚ÄúPTSD is for the weak‚Äù; left hanging, he said, by an understaffed and overburdened Veterans Affairs office; and with nowhere else to put his anger, Platner stewed in it. And like many aggrieved men, he turned to posting online.

When we spoke, he did not back away from everything he wrote on Reddit: His question about racial differences in tipping was, he insisted, a genuine question, informed by his experiences as a bartender. He disavowed other comments, though. I asked him about the 2013 entry in which he asked, in a thread about rape-prevention underwear, whether people should ‚Äútake some responsibility for themselves and not get so fucked up they wind up having sex with someone they don't mean to?‚Äù His face reddened and he told me, ‚ÄúI read that post and I was like, I'm fucking embarassed.‚Äù In another post from 2013, he downplayed the possibility that the military was covering up sexual-assault allegations. ‚ÄúThe way that we used to talk and look at the world,‚Äù he said, referring to the culture of the Marines and Army, ‚Äúis deeply fucked up.‚Äù He told me that he never viewed sexual assault as acceptable, but he said that he used to be skeptical of its pervasiveness. Platner offered the questionable explanation that he had served in a time before women were allowed in the infantry, so ‚ÄúI didn't have any context so I was willing to make stupid jokes about it.‚Äù

Platner told me that his experience as an older, nontraditional university student helped him start viewing things differently. ‚ÄúI got exposed to a lot of people,‚Äù he said. He continued, ‚ÄúI met a lot of women who, at some point in their life, had been sexually assaulted.‚Äù This evolution appears to be backed up by his Reddit history. In a 2017 post, Platner criticized the members of the Facebook group Marines United who were caught posting nude photos of female service members. He called the posters ‚Äúlosers who hid behind a computer and ‚Äòcamaraderie' to justify their hatred of women‚Äù and said, ‚ÄúNail these fucks to the wall.‚Äù

I came away from my initial conversation with Platner largely convinced by the story he told about his Reddit posts‚Äîlots of guys end up in dark places online, and Platner did seem to have moved beyond that period of his life. Then the tattoo news broke. The way Platner explained it to a co-host of Pod Save America is that he got the tattoo in Croatia when he was young, drunk, and on shore leave. He said he and his soldier friends picked the design because they ‚Äúthought it looked cool.‚Äù

The story of how he got the tattoo seemed plausible enough to me. But did Platner, a self-described student of history, really never figure out what it meant? According to a Jewish Insider article, he did: An anonymous source said that in 2012, Platner referred to the tattoo as ‚Äúmy Totenkopf.‚Äù Platner's former political director, who resigned after the Reddit comments came to light, did not buy his story either. ‚ÄúGraham has an anti-Semitic tattoo on his chest. He's not an idiot, he's a military history buff,‚Äù she posted on social media. ‚ÄúMaybe he didn't know it when he got it, but he got it years ago and he should have had it covered up because he knows damn well what it means.‚Äù

When I spoke with Platner on Tuesday, he reiterated his claim that he didn't know what the tattoo meant when he got it in 2007. He told me that in the nearly two decades since, he hadn't encountered anyone who saw it as a Nazi symbol until three weeks ago, when someone asked him about it. When I asked him about the Jewish Insider piece, he said, ‚ÄúIt's an anonymous source‚Äù; when I asked if it was true that knew his tattoo was a Nazi skull, he said, ‚ÄúThe answer is no.‚Äù He told me that after he got the tattoo, he had two full-body screenings for tattoos as a requirement for government work, including screening for ‚Äúhate‚Äù tattoos, in both the Army and as part of his State Department work, and that the skull was not flagged either time. He told me that members of his family are Jewish, and that he has had his shirt off around them many times without anyone objecting to the tattoo. ‚ÄúEighteen years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's never come up.‚Äù

Really? How could Platner go so long without noticing the resemblance between his tattoo and the Nazi symbol? At the same time, the idea that Platner might have knowingly had a Nazi tattoo is hard to square with comments I found in the P-Hustle Reddit archive, which I was able to access through a website that preserves deleted posts. Over the years, P-Hustle expressed enthusiasm for the civil-rights movement; railed against homophobia, anti-Muslim hatred, anti-immigration sentiment; and criticized the militarization of the police. The archive also includes posts that praise American GIs for killing Franz Ziereis, a Nazi SS leader at the Mauthausen concentration camp (‚ÄúFuck him. And good on the GI's who murdered him‚Äù); lambaste ‚Äúthe rampant anti-Semitism that was the cornerstone of Nazi rhetoric‚Äù; and commend the television series Band of Brothers because ‚Äúit's all about killing Nazis.‚Äù The first of these posts came in 2012, the same time period when the anonymous source said that Platner knew about his Nazi tattoo.

I reached out to an acquaintance who saw combat overseas around the same time that Platner did. I asked if Platner's story about not knowing the tattoo resembled a Nazi skull passed the smell test for him. ‚ÄúThis sounds totally believable,‚Äù the acquaintance texted me. ‚Äú‚ÄòIt looks cool, more skulls,' is like 99% of military logos.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThis guy just sounds like a 23 year old dumbass, i.e. normal.‚Äù On Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that a Marine who served with Platner, whom the campaign put the reporter in touch with, got a similar tattoo with him and corroborated his story: The Marine said they got the tattoos while intoxicated, to commemorate a deployment after many of their friends were killed or injured. In the Marine's telling, they liked the image because it was more unique than the other skulls.

When I talked to Platner about the Reddit posts, a pattern emerged: His most troubling messages seemed to come after he spent time overseas. The posts about sexual assault, for example, came in 2013, following his 2010‚Äì11 Afghanistan deployment and 2012 departure from the Army. Platner's last spell in a combat zone was as a contractor working on the ambassador's security detail in 2018. He described it as maybe his most disillusioning. He found the juxtaposition between the luxurious calm of embassy life and the reality of the war going on in the country beyond disturbing. ‚ÄúI'm watching people go into a swimming pool and eating,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúThere are people out there, right now, fighting this fucking war. There are Afghans out there right now, getting their houses bombed and burned out. And you people are here, just fucking swimming?‚Äù He left after six months with a shoulder injury.

Some posts from the final phase of his Reddit years, stretching from 2018 to 2021, Platner insisted to me were ironic‚Äîor, as he put it, ‚Äúme talking shit on the internet.‚Äù He was adamant that his post referring to himself as a communist was a joke. ‚ÄúIf you fight for anything for working people in this country, they're going to call you a communist,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey called Hillary Clinton a communist.‚Äù Platner said that his comment agreeing that cops were bastards after George Floyd's murder was not serious either. ‚ÄúI was in the Marine Corps and the Army, and I was a private-security contractor for the State Department. Many of my friends are cops,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are guys I fought in the war with.‚Äù

Platner repudiated his 2018 comments about political violence. In one such post, he wrote that Americans can't expect to ‚Äúfight fascism without a good semi-automatic rifle.‚Äù He told me that now, he doesn't believe violence works. ‚ÄúI lived the life of violence,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand it didn't get me anywhere. It only got me disillusioned and angry.‚Äù I asked him if he could see why the sentiment he expressed on Reddit might concern voters, rightly disturbed by Charlie Kirk's recent assassination and rising political violence. He said that of course he could.

His position on guns hasn't changed, however. I asked Platner, a firearms instructor and competitive pistol shooter, if he agreed with the interpretation of the Second Amendment‚Äîpopular in the NRA and among Republican congressmen‚Äîwhich holds that the right to bear arms is primarily about the prevention of government tyranny. His answer was unequivocal: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Read: The wrong way to win back the working class

Platner told me he doesn't remember consciously deciding to stop posting on Reddit. As he fell in love with the woman who became his wife and got more embedded in his local community‚Äîhe sits on Sullivan's planning board and serves as the town harbormaster‚ÄîPlatner gradually stopped feeling the internet's pull. ‚ÄúBeing an asshole doesn't make your life easier,‚Äù he told me. It's his message for men who find themselves in the kind of headspace, and online space, that he was in. ‚ÄúIt doesn't make people like you. It's certainly not going to make women like you. It's certainly not gonna make your neighbors like you. And in some ways, you got a choice.‚Äù His last post was in 2021. According to a Politico article, the old posts were removed three months ago; Platner told me that he doesn't remember when, precisely, he deleted his archive but said it had not been recently. ‚ÄúI didn't delete it with any of this in mind,‚Äù he said, referring to the recent controversy. ‚ÄúI knew that I'd said some dumb shit over the years.‚Äù

This ‚Äúdumb shit‚Äù is continuing to haunt Platner's campaign. The Advocate pointed out on Wednesday that Platner posted a homophobic slur in a 2018 post, and used ‚Äúgay‚Äù as a punchline in 2020. (Platner called these comments ‚Äúindefensible.‚Äù) These posts add to the contradictions that defined Platner's Reddit presence. In a 2012 comment critiquing the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act, for example, P-Hustle wrote: ‚ÄúWho fallen soldiers chose to love is their business, and the services should recognize that whether they be male or female, gay or straight.‚Äù Another comment from a 2018 thread responding to the struggles of a gay Marine reads: ‚ÄúJust know this: I can't imagine how much it must suck not being able to share who you are with the people who are supposed to be your comrades.‚Äù

Since Donald Trump's reelection victory in November, many in and around the Democratic Party have seemed to recognize that change is in order. A widespread theory holds that candidates with a tougher image may help the party win back disaffected voters. ‚Äú‚ÄòWeak, Woke, and Whiny' No More,‚Äù was the headline on an August New York Times opinion piece about the ‚Äúnational security moms‚Äù seeking office, including Abigail Spanberger, an ex-CIA case officer running for governor of Virginia, and Mikie Sherrill, a Naval Academy grad and former helicopter pilot running for governor of New Jersey. Spanberger and Sherrill are impressive, with their elite educations, graduate degrees, and political experience. But candidates whose edges are not so smooth may be able to reach beyond the suburbs and into rural towns.

Fielding candidates who have not spent years preparing for a life in politics is almost certain to come with questions about past behavior. The questions that Platner's candidacy poses are not easy ones, and, candidly, I don't know exactly what to think of his explanations for his past. I do come to this story, however, having been raised by a combat veteran and knowing that the psychological aftershocks of war can linger. I believe that we owe those who have served particular grace.

I also have a sense of relative risk‚Äîthe stakes for democracy if Democrats can't win are dire. As a registered voter in Maine, I'll need to make a decision about how to vote in this election. I know that still more information could emerge that might change my views about Platner. I also completely understand why someone couldn't stomach voting for him after this. But for now, based on the information currently available, this is where I land: If the way for the Democrats to win is with Platner, I'm willing to look past the ugly Reddit posts and the tattoo.

Here was a dreamy little crime in which no one really got hurt.

To the world, the news was astonishing, bordering on incomprehensible: Four Parisians were up and about early on a Sunday morning (well, 9:30). And not only that‚Äîthey had robbed the Louvre.

The people of France, upon learning that two tiaras, two brooches, two necklaces, and 1.5 pairs of earrings had been stolen, reacted with humiliation and apoplexy. The director of the Louvre called the theft a ‚Äúterrible failure.‚Äù The French president labeled it an ‚Äúattack.‚Äù The crime, the minister of justice said, had given the country an ‚Äúimage terrible‚Äù‚Äîthis last remark raising uncomfortable questions: How exactly do French people imagine the rest of the world conceives of their hexagonal nation? As a futuristic police state where the rule of law is rigorously enforced? Surely, to everyone outside the republic, a pair of cat burglars cleverly robbing a museum in broad daylight and escaping‚ÄîBeep! Beep!‚Äîon mopeds is very nearly the Frenchest thing that could have happened.

The Louvre, it turns out‚Äîat least certain nooks of the ancient former palace‚Äîis something like an anopticon: a place where no one is observed. The world now knows what the four thieves (two burglars and two accomplices) realized as recently as last week: The museum's Apollo Gallery, which housed the stolen items, was monitored by a single outdoor camera angled away from its only exterior point of entry, a balcony. In other words, a free-roaming Roomba could have provided the world's most famous museum with more information about the interior of this space. There is no surveillance footage of the break-in.

The Paris prosecutor's office has suggested that the operation was likely conducted by members of an organized-crime syndicate, though the evidence for this is thin at present. The assumption seems to be that none but a highly experienced criminal architect could have come up with a plan to access an unmonitored second-floor balcony via a ladder. If the thieves are professionals, organized surely refers more to the nature of their fellowship than the style of their work; Le Parisien reported that the group, as they fled the scene, left behind the angle grinders they used to cut holes in the jewelry display cases, a yellow high-visibility vest that one of them wore to pose as a construction worker, gloves, a blanket, a blowtorch, gasoline, a talkie-walkie‚Äîthe humiliating French term for a walkie-talkie‚Äîand, obviously, quite a bit of DNA evidence. Apparently, they had intended to use the blowtorch and gasoline to set fire to their ladder truck, but abandoned the plan after a museum security guard confronted them on the ground in the middle of their getaway. They also dropped a crown bearing 1,354 diamonds‚Äîthe sort of item most people would really kick themselves for dropping.

Initially, France's minister of the interior gave the value of the eight pieces the thieves spirited away as ‚Äúpriceless.‚Äù How disappointing, then, when Louvre officials later updated the jewels' combined value to about $102 million. One hundred two million dollars is not nothing, of course; it's slightly less than half of what the Oakley-sunglasses baron sold his home for last year‚Äîand that was a super nice house, and it was in Malibu‚Äîbut still. Priceless sounds more like, you know, $900 trillion. And this was not that.

It is true that the heart of a small French boy might never again threaten to plummet through his chest cavity, weighed down with pride, as he gazes through glass at a second-empire decorative bow once owned by the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew. But that gar√ßon's loss is our gain. This theft is a gift for the entire world.

How thrilling, upon hearing the news, to put oneself in the shoes of the thieves, and imagine making off with the diamonds scot-free. How inspiring to be reminded of what fun and potential profit there is to be had when one ditches one's phone for a morning, and embarks on an outing with friends. How democratic the possibility that, if the pieces are disassembled (as they almost certainly will be)‚Äîtheir gold melted down like margarine, their gems sliced into new facets‚Äîany of us might, one day, through the actions of an unscrupulous jeweler, come to own a piece of French history. How nice to read about a heist rather than a massacre.

The irony, of course, is that these trinkets have garnered far more attention now than they would have had they remained on view at the Louvre for 5,000 years. The world's major news outlets are cranking out reams of text just to have an excuse to publish a sumptuously detailed photograph of a tiara studded with milky pearls the size of apricot pits, or a necklace (from‚Äîcan you believe it?‚Äîa larger set of items made for Napoleon's second wedding) festooned with globs of mint-jelly emeralds. Interpol blared in a press release that it had added the items to its database of stolen artwork. ‚ÄúWho,‚Äù the BBC asked in a headline from its live blog of theft coverage, ‚ÄúWas Empress Eugenie‚ÄîThe Wife of Napoleon III?‚Äù (Here is the BBC contact page for anyone with information.)

This was to be expected. Stealing artworks tends to make them more famous. The Mona Lisa, for instance, was little known outside the art world until it was stolen from the Louvre in 1911. (It took more than a day for anyone to notice it was missing.)

Here was a dreamy little crime: No one was hurt. No beloved painting was damaged. Some out-of-the-box thinkers have perhaps earned a handsome paycheck for their ingenuity. And jewelry, really, is meant to be worn, not stored in sterile boxes. One hopes that the thieves take a moment to at least try on the rather subdued sapphire necklace of Queen Hortense (yes‚Äîthe famous Queen Hortense) before taking pliers to it.

Would that all thefts were such blithe occurrences. Compare this chain of events with the robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris in 2016. Assailants dressed as police burst into her hotel room and held a gun on her while rummaging through her belongings. They bound her wrists and ankles with zip ties. They wrapped duct tape around her head. Earlier this year, Kardashian testified in a French court that she was ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù certain she was going to be killed. She prayed for her sister, whom she feared would be the person to discover her dead body lying in her hotel-room bed. The value of the jewelry that Kardashian's captors took from her was less than one-tenth that of the Louvre thieves' haul. But no sane person could believe that the museum crime was worse.

The gravest offense of this week's incident, one could argue, was committed not by the thieves but by the museum officials, who closed the entire Louvre to visitors for two days after the incident, effectively cutting a perfect circle into thousands of travelers' vacation plans and coldly excising the crown jewel of their itineraries. To add chaos to injury, the director of the Louvre has now called for a police station to be installed inside the museum, though it defies logic to suppose such a feature would have helped in this case‚Äîpolice arrived just three minutes after being called, by which point the robbers had already fled.

One hopes that, after the embarrassment dies down, museum officials will adopt the mindset of Fran√ßois Chatillon, the Louvre's chief architect. ‚ÄúWe're not going to put armored doors and windows everywhere because there was this burglary,‚Äù Chatillon told Le Monde.

Thank God. (Maybe stick one camera inside the gallery?)

Vance Just Called an Israeli Parliament Vote ‚ÄòStupid' and an ‚ÄòInsult'","https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/10/why-j-d-vance-just-called-an-israeli-parliament-vote-stupid-and-an-insult/684676/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:49:41 GMT","

And why it matters for the future of U.S.-Israel relations

J. D. Vance's visit to Israel this week hit all of the usual beats, at least at first. The vice president met with Israeli politicians and the families of released hostages. He trumpeted the U.S.-Israel alliance and advocated for the continued implementation of President Donald Trump's Gaza agreement. Everything went according to script‚Äîuntil Vance torched his hosts on the way out.

Before boarding Air Force Two, the vice president was asked by a reporter about a vote that had been held the day before in Israel's Parliament. Hard-right lawmakers from Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition had advanced a measure calling for Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians claim for their future state. The measure was a farce‚Äîit did not change Israel's policy on the ground, and half of the Knesset's members did not even participate in the vote. But the legislation was a symbolic slap in the face to the president of the United States. Last month, Trump's Arab allies had made clear that annexation would risk unraveling the Abraham Accords, and so the president had promised in the Oval Office that ‚ÄúI will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank.‚Äù The message, it seemed, had not gotten through.

Asked about the Knesset vote on the tarmac, Vance acknowledged that it was symbolic, but he was not amused. ‚ÄúIf it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally take some insult to it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy.‚Äù That same day, Time published an interview with Trump in which the president was asked about annexation. ‚ÄúIt won't happen, because I gave my word to the Arab countries,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúIsrael would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.‚Äù Netanyahu didn't take long to shift into damage-control mode. He put out a statement that falsely attributed the parliamentary vote to the opposition, and pledged that his party, Likud, would not advance the legislation.

This dustup will not harm the U.S.-Israel relationship in the near term, but it portends more consequential conflict to come. That's because the Israeli hard right‚Äîa crucial and dominant component of Netanyahu's coalition‚Äîis at war with Trump's regional agenda, and its aspirations are incompatible with the president's ambitions. Previously, the Trump administration was divided between accordists, including the envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who were more aligned with the Gulf states, and annexationists, such as Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who were more sympathetic to the Israeli right. But in recent weeks, the president has made his decision: The accordists have won in a rout, and that outcome has implications well beyond the West Bank.

Read: Can Trump contain Israel's hard right?

Simply put, the president wants more diplomatic deals and more countries to enter the Abraham Accords, not more wars and more land grabs. In his Time interview, Trump claimed that Saudi Arabia‚Äîwhose crown prince will reportedly visit the White House next month‚Äîwould normalize relations with Israel by the end of the year. But Saudi Arabia has demanded a path to Palestinian statehood, however limited, as its condition for such a move‚Äîand, as Wednesday's annexation vote showed, the Israeli settler right will do all it can to block this.

‚ÄúIf Saudi Arabia tells us ‚Äònormalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friends, no thank you,‚Äù Bezalel Smotrich, Netanyahu's far-right finance minister, said at a conference yesterday. ‚ÄúKeep riding camels in the desert in Saudi Arabia.‚Äù The remark, which Smotrich was later forced to walk back, was almost certainly not an accident. Its casual racism can be construed as an act of sabotage‚Äîan effort to derail the Middle East‚Äìnormalization train.

Smotrich and his anti-Arab allies‚Äîsuch as his fellow lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech, who boycotted Trump's victory speech in the Knesset‚Äîlikely see the president's agenda as an existential threat to their project. That's because it is. The more political and economic influence the Gulf states have over Trump and Israel, the more demands they will be able to make of both. Heading off formal annexation of the West Bank is the first ask, but it won't be the last. Ultimately, the far right's program of unfettered settler expansion and violence, unending war and eventual settlement in Gaza, and no negotiations with the Palestinian Authority is irreconcilable with a more regionally integrated Israel and an expanded Abraham Accords.

In practice, this means that as long as Israel's settler right holds power over Netanyahu, it will continue to threaten the Trump administration's agenda. This dynamic may be more of a problem for Netanyahu than for Trump, however. Polls show that most Israelis, unlike Netanyahu's unpopular minoritarian coalition, support Trump's goals. One September survey found that 72 percent of Israelis believe that preserving the Abraham Accords and deepening regional alliances with moderate Arab countries is in Israel's ‚Äúsupreme interest.‚Äù Another survey in August found that 73 percent of Israelis would support a normalization deal that includes recognizing a Palestinian state.

Trump is astronomically popular in Israel today following his Gaza deal, far more so than Netanyahu himself. Should the president publicly make the case for his plans, he will be pushing on an open door‚Äîand might even push Netanyahu and Israel's far right out of it.

The sports gambling reckoning is finally here.

Sports betting has become so ubiquitous and so massive in the US that it can be difficult to remember that at the start of 2018, it was only legal in four states, and only in Nevada could you bet on individual games.

All that changed in May of that year, when the Supreme Court stuck down the federal law that barred most forms of sports gambling. Since then, the legal sports gambling industry has spread to 38 states plus Washington, DC, with revenues of nearly $14 billion in 2024, much of which has come from burgeoning and highly addictive mobile apps like DraftKings and FanDuel.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

The reason why sports betting was off-limits for so long was because of concerns that the sheer money involved could lead to scandals that would call into question the integrity of sports games.

Well, guess what? On Thursday, as part of a joint federal, state, and city investigation, the FBI announced at a Brooklyn press conference indictments of three current and former NBA players ‚Äî including one well-known coach who's in the Hall of Fame ‚Äî for alleged involvement in apparent Mafia-driven theft, fraud, and robbery schemes that include detailed bets involving inside information‚Ä¶that calls into question the integrity of NBA games. And just in time for the start of the NBA season this week.

The indictments are only the latest betting scandal to hit pro sports, but it is shaping up to be by far the worst, and may well implicate other players. Yet the only really surprising thing is that it took this long after the legalization of sports gambling for a scandal of this scale to finally break. And that inevitability has as much to do with how sports gambling works today as it does with the sheer number of dollars at stake.

If you're not one of the estimated 20 or so percent of US adults who placed a sports bet last year or held an online betting account, you may not realize just how much legalization and digitization have changed gambling. Not only can gamblers place a bet easily through apps, but they can also make prop or micro bets that might mean thousands of dollars are riding on something as small as who makes the next shot in an NBA game.

Micro bets heighten impulsivity and elevate the risk of problem gambling, and can open the door to damaging the integrity of the games themselves. While it's difficult to imagine any pro athlete actively colluding with criminals to alter the outcome of a game, 1919 Chicago Black Sox-style, pulling yourself out of a game early with a feigned injury or simply missing the next shot isn't too hard to do. Among the charges in this week's indictment was that Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier told gamblers in advance that he would leave a game early, allowing them to make hundreds of thousands of dollars from inside prop bets.

Crooked sports bets don't have to become widespread for fans to start questioning the integrity of games across the board. Which is precisely why pro sports leagues used to be squarely against legalized sports betting, so much so that all four major leagues and the NCAA jointly sued New Jersey in 2012 to stop that state's push to legalize sports gambling, which in turn ultimately led to the Supreme Court decision that allowed states to decide on legalization for themselves.

Once the Supreme Court had made its decision, though, the possibility of earning billions off legalized gambling proved more than enough to convince pro sports leagues not just to drop their opposition, but to start wholeheartedly embracing the betting industry. Every major sports league has an official betting partner; individual teams have their own deals, and some have even put betting lounges in their stadiums. Betting lines are a major part of sports media now, which might not even exist without the utterly ubiquitous gambling ads that surround every broadcast.

Legalized sports gambling has come with other costs, not least the growing social and financial cost of problem gambling ‚Äî one paper linked reduced household savings and worse credit to gambling legalization, while calls to problem gambling hotlines have spiked.

The Supreme Court made its 2018 decision for dry, technical reasons ‚Äî something about how it was unlawful for federal legislation to dictate to state legislatures what they could or couldn't authorize. But whether you're a sports bettor or a sports fan, that decision ‚Äî paired with the simultaneous growth of mobile apps that remove all the friction from gambling ‚Äî has changed American society enormously. And Thursday's indictments indicate that we're only just beginning to see the consequences.

Philip Pullman's new book finishes the story The Golden Compass started.

If you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy was one of the most beloved children's book series of the 2000s ‚Äî and one of the most frequently banned, too. Tragic, philosophical, and fervently opposed to classic Christian dogma, Pullman's series sparked widespread outcry and religious boycotts.

This week, Pullman released The Rose Field, the final volume in the Book of Dust trilogy, a companion series to His Dark Materials. (The first book takes place 11 years before the events of His Dark Materials, and the second two books take place eight years later.) In this new series, the big conflict begins with a book every bit as dangerous as Pullman's critics used to claim his were. Two of them, actually.

Lyra, Pullman's scrappy and charismatic heroine, has become infatuated with two books by modern philosophers who preach a kind of post-truth moral relativism. Nothing, they tell her, is real, and nothing means anything. Under the sway of their clever wording, Lyra becomes estranged from her daemon Pantalaimon, the animal companion who accompanies her everywhere ‚Äî which is to say, within the metaphysical constructs of Pullman's world, she becomes estranged from her soul.

Book recommendations ‚Äî both old and new ‚Äî that are worth your time, from senior correspondent and critic Constance Grady.

Ironically, that used to be the religious right's line about His Dark Materials: that it put children's souls in danger. Conceived as Paradise Lost for teens, it is, after all, a series that metaphorically denounces the Catholic Church for child abuse and ends with two children literally killing God, then saving the multiverse by falling in love with each other. In 2008, the series ranked second on a list of the most-banned books in the US. A planned series of film adaptations puttered out after just one release in 2007, in part due to pressure from the anti-defamation group the Catholic League.

Pullman pulled no punches when it came to his thoughts on religiously motivated censorship. ‚ÄúReligion grants its adherents malign, intoxicating and morally corrosive sensations,‚Äù he wrote for The Guardian in 2008. ‚ÄúDestroying intellectual freedom is always evil, but only religion makes doing evil feel quite so good.‚Äù

Pullman's new series doesn't call for censorship. But it does make it clear that he believes that there are such things as dangerous books and dangerous ideas, and that they can both put us in danger of becoming estranged from our fundamental selves.

What exactly those dangerous ideas are is what's at stake in the center of Pullman's two Lyra trilogies ‚Äî and in all the debates about which ideas children should be exposed to.

In a way, the whole story begins with the danger of a bad book. Pullman's His Dark Materials books were written in response to and as a reaction against C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia and their Christian allegory.

According to Pullman, the Narnia books are ‚Äúpropaganda in the cause of the religion [Lewis] believed in.‚Äù Moreover, they are filled with the kind of values children should be taught to abhor, not to aspire to. ‚ÄúIt is monumentally disparaging of girls and women,‚Äù Pullman said at The Guardian's Hay festival in 2002. ‚ÄúIt is blatantly racist. One girl was sent to hell because she was getting interested in clothes and boys.‚Äù

The Narnia books, it is true, do not mesh nicely with today's sexual and racial politics. Lewis's girls are always taught to stay out of the action during battles, while the boys are given swords and fight in duels to the death. Susan Pevensie, as Pullman said, is declared ‚Äúno longer a friend to Narnia‚Äù and thus ineligible to be transported to heaven with her family at the end of the series because she is ‚Äúinterested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations.‚Äù As for the plot about the swarthy brown people in turbans who worship a god who turns out to be the devil ‚Äî well, it's probably best not to think about it too much.

What seems to have bothered Pullman most about Narnia, though, was not just the racism and the sexism but Lewis's idea that heavenly Narnia is more real and more important than the ordinary world of England.

‚ÄúThis world is where the things are that matter,‚Äù Pullman wrote in 2021 in the children's literature periodical the Horn Book ‚Äî not the other world of the spirit and the soul, but our own world of the physical body. ‚ÄúIf the Narnia stories had been composed in that spirit, the children who have passed through all these adventures and presumably learned great truths from them would be free to live and grow up in the world, even at the price of engaging with the lipstick and the nylons, and use what they'd learned for the benefit of others. That would be the republican thing to do. That's why Lewis doesn't let his characters do it, and why the Narnia books are such an invaluable guide to what is wrong and cruel and selfish.‚Äù

In His Dark Materials, meanwhile, while the spirit and the soul and other worlds are all very real, they are not what is most valuable. Instead, Pullman's characters are taught that what really matters is our own material world, our bodies, and the things that we can experience through them. Those are our greatest sources of pleasure and joy, and they are the tools through which we can create the utopia Pullman calls the Republic of Heaven.

One of his most lyrical passages comes when a woman is able to slow the entropy of the universe by drawing on her memories of physical sensation: ‚ÄúThe delicate dancing of her fingers on a computer keyboard. ‚Ä¶ Tasting an iced margarita in California, sitting under the lemon trees outside a restaurant in Lisbon, scraping the frost off the windshield of her car.‚Äù These were ‚Äúall the sensations that made up being alive,‚Äù and they are, for Pullman, what makes life so precious to experience ‚Äî not the promise of dying and being reborn in another, better world, but the reality of being alive in our own world, right now.

Moreover, in Pullman's world, unusually for children's literature, becoming an adult is more a gift than it is a loss. As a child, Lyra has a supernatural knack for reading her alethiometer, the titular golden compass and ‚Äútruth meter‚Äù that mystifies grown-ups but always answers all of Lyra's questions. At the end of the first trilogy, however, Lyra abruptly loses her old ability, the unthinking ease of childhood.

She can learn how to read the alethiometer again, an angel tells her, by working at it for a lifetime. ‚ÄúBut your reading will be even better then, after a lifetime of thought and effort, because it will come from conscious understanding,‚Äù the angel says. ‚ÄúGrace attained like that is deeper and fuller than grace that comes freely, and furthermore, once you've gained it, it will never leave you.‚Äù

The value of experience over innocence, body over spirit, earth over heaven: The whole original trilogy is written in service of this deeply held belief, and in a kind of outrage at all the children's literature that ever came before it and told children otherwise.

Pullman's books were immediately controversial, especially in the US, where his publishers weren't above trying to cut off any outcry at the root. When 13-year-old Lyra goes through her sexual awakening in The Amber Skyglass, her physical sensations are a lot clearer and more specific in the UK (‚Äúshe felt a stirring at the roots of her hair: she found herself breathing faster‚Äù) than they are in the US (‚ÄúLyra felt something strange happen to her body‚Äù).

Bowdlerizing Lyra's adolescence wasn't enough to address the bigger issue, however. In the late 2000s, the religious right was caught up in debates over whether there were coded Satanic messages in the Harry Potter books. When it came to His Dark Materials, no decoding was necessary. Outraged articles in the religious press were frequent, but they ramped up significantly in 2007, when Hollywood adapted The Golden Compass into a film. The Golden Compass movie rejiggered Pullman's plot significantly in order to stay away from the child murder and the wicked Christian church. Nonetheless, the religious right was unfooled. The Catholic League called for a boycott.

‚ÄúIt is not our position that the movie will strike Christian parents as troubling,‚Äù the Catholic League had said in a statement. ‚ÄúThen why the protest? Even though the film is based on the least offensive of the three books, and even though it is clear that the producers are watering down the most despicable elements ‚Äî so as to make money and not anger Christians ‚Äî the fact remains that the movie is bait for the books. To be specific, if unsuspecting Christian parents take their children to see the movie, they may very well find it engaging and then buy Pullman's books for Christmas. That's the problem.‚Äù

Protests against an inoffensive film because of the books became protests against the books themselves. By the end of the decade, it would be No. 8 on the top 100 banned books of 2000‚Äì2009, below Harry Potter but above The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. 

Despite the outcry, Pullman remained sanguine on the power of provocation. In 2010, he published a new novel titled The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, with the premise that Jesus Christ was two brothers, one holy and one obsessed with worldly power. Faced with a reader at a live event who found the idea offensive, Pullman responded, ‚ÄúNo one has the right to spend their life without being offended. Nobody has to read this book. Nobody has to pick it up. Nobody has to open it.‚Äù

If a person did read and dislike Pullman's book, he went on, ‚ÄúYou don't have to remain silent about it. You can write to me, you can complain about it, you can write to the publisher, you can write to the papers, you can write your own book. You can do all those things, but there your rights stop. No one has the right to stop me writing this book. No one has the right to stop it being published, or bought, or sold or read.‚Äù

Plenty of people felt that they did have the right to stop Pullman's books from being kept in school libraries. But the fight over Pullman's books would come to seem quaint in the wake of the culture wars that were about to ignite.

In the first half of the 2020s, the far right has mounted a series of campaigns to ban books deemed overly progressive from school libraries. Conservative groups have astroturfed school board meetings, decrying books about LGBTQ issues as ‚Äúpornographic‚Äù and books that dealt with structural racism in America as crypto-commie critical race theory. ‚ÄúNever before in the life of any living American have so many books been systematically removed from school libraries across the country,‚Äù a report earlier this month from free speech advocacy group PEN America said.

The right's embrace of book banning comes after a decade of complaints that the left had become too censorious and obsessed with progressive purity tests. Few protests from the left turned into attempts to ban books from shelves, but it is true that messy controversies in the YA sphere saw some authors bullied into withdrawing their books from publication after allegations that they were insufficiently antiracist. Those books may not have been banned by the state, but they weren't on shelves where readers could look at them, either. Partisans on both sides of the aisle began to fight over which side could be said to really, truly be on the side of free speech, and which side owned book bannings.

In the midst of this arguing, a consensus emerged. Most people did agree that there were limits to what ideas children should be exposed to, and that, for instance, while adults might have a legal right to read hardcore pornography and Nazi propaganda if they wanted to, such books did not belong in elementary school libraries.

Moreover, it was clear that school libraries did not have infinite space or the ability to store all possible books for their children, just as publishers did not have the capacity to publish every book submitted to them. Some books would have to be excluded, because kids weren't interested or because they weren't age appropriate or because they were filled with false information ‚Äî or, perhaps, because they were somehow found to be immoral.

But where are librarians supposed to draw the line? And who decides what it is?

In Pullman's new companion trilogy, books really can do what the Catholic League feared His Dark Materials would do: they put people's souls in danger.

The two books that enchanted Lyra make the argument that daemons aren't real, which Lyra regards as a thrilling but ultimately silly provocation. While Lyra discards the idea in 2019's The Secret Commonwealth and embarks on a quest in search for her estranged daemon, in the final book in the new trilogy, The Rose Field, we see a world in which people have embraced this teaching.

First, fashionable young people begin to ignore their daemons. The trend spreads, and more people begin to ignore their daemons or even to abuse them. Gradually, the daemons lose their names and power of speech, and begin to drop dead in a kind of spiritual murder.

These anti-daemon ideas haven't spread just on their own, however. They're the result of a campaign by powerful people ‚Äî church, state, and industry, all united by the power of money ‚Äî to consolidate their own power and reshape the world for their convenience. They spread books denying the existence of absolute truth or of the existence of daemons on purpose, to render the populace too confused to fight back until it's too late.

Here, daemons are refigured as not just our souls but as the irrational and bodily part of ourselves, the part that understands metaphor and revels in corporeal sensations, the part that Pullman has been championing all along. We get long passages from the point of view of Pantalaimon as he revels in the experience of running outside and indulges in stormy emotional tirades. Lyra, without him, retains her logical mind but has lost the scrappy force of will that saw her through the experience of His Dark Materials ‚Äî ‚Äúthat lost rebellious part of her,‚Äù Pullman writes, ‚Äúthat woodland-smelling self who'd set off in anger.‚Äù Without our souls, our rational animating spirits become alienated from both our bodies and the material world, because powerful people find us more compliant that way.

Pullman's target is less religion here than it is power more broadly ‚Äî especially power as guided by modern capitalism, which he describes as ‚Äúthe universal solvent,‚Äù which dissolves all bonds with its implacable force.

The antidote to this problem, Lyra learns, is to tell true stories, and specifically to tell them to children. Stories express the grounded, embodied details of day to day life. Metaphors express the connectedness of things. Together they show us how to be alive and what to value.

But then, after all, there's that problem again: what do we value? Which truth is that? And who gets to decide? ‚ÄúWe have the truth,‚Äù a Christian commenter declared back in 2002, in response to a debate over what to do with His Dark Materials, ‚Äúso why worry and fret when someone challenges that?‚Äù

Pullman's response to this problem is that of a classic liberal. He has never argued in favor of banning the Narnia books, and Lyra doesn't suggest that the books that so enchanted her should be banned. Instead, Pullman argues for answering one person's true story with your own, for fighting it out in the marketplace of ideas. A bad book might endanger a child's soul, he suggests, but a good book can save it again. (A Christian might well agree, capitalizing the G and the B.)

6 questions about the East Wing's sudden demise, answered.

President Donald Trump has demolished the East Wing of the White House to make way for his planned $300 million ballroom.

From start to finish, it only took a few days to destroy the more than century-old structure, which was built in 1902 and substantially renovated and expanded in 1942. As of Thursday, the whole thing is gone. This has, understandably, inspired some questions. High on the list: Is this legal?

Vox collected a few of those questions below, and took our best swing at answering them. Here's what we know:

Trump wants a ballroom on the White House campus, part of his campaign to gradually Mar-a-Lagoify the People's House (previous highlights including paving over the historic Rose Garden with a patio that he's dubbed the Rose Garden Club, gilding the Oval Office from floor to ceiling, and installing a pair of 88-foot flagpoles on either lawn of the White House).

All of those changes bring the White House closer to the aesthetic of Trump's beachside Florida club. In 2006, for example, he fought the town of Palm Beach over his decision to erect a similarly sized 80-foot flagpole at Mar-a-Lago.

The ballroom in particular is a longtime fixation of Trump's, one that predates his time in office. In 2010, he reportedly reached out to the Obama White House about building a similar structure, an offer that ultimately went nowhere.

By and large, no. The official White House announcement of the ballroom project, in July, did let on that the East Wing might be in trouble, writing, ‚ÄúThe site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits.‚Äù But Trump himself told the press that the new ballroom ‚Äúwon't interfere with the current building.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt'll be near it but not touching it,‚Äù he said in July. ‚ÄúAnd pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of.‚Äù

Even as late as this week, as work began on the East Wing facade, the full scope of the demolition was unclear; the plan to destroy the entire structure was only confirmed on Wednesday, less than 24 hours before it was completed.

The surprise demolition closely resembles a story from Trump's early career, when he was building Trump Tower on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. To do so, he demolished the existing Bonwit Teller building, including a pair of beloved Art Deco sculptures high on its exterior face.

Trump had previously said he might give those bas-relief figures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which had hoped to display them. Instead, he took museum officials by surprise by jackhammering them to pieces, falsely claiming under the pseudonym of ‚ÄúJohn Baron‚Äù that the pieces were ‚Äúwithout artistic merit.‚Äù (Met officials and other experts disagreed.)

As with so many Trump actions, it's unclear at best ‚Äî but it's equally unclear who could have stopped him. There are at least two commissions, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Commission of Fine Arts, that are usually involved in changes to the White House. At the moment, both are shuttered due to the government shutdown, and neither has had a chance to weigh in.

The White House has also argued that a submission to the NCPC is required ‚Äúonly for vertical construction,‚Äù not for demolition, though a former committee chair told the Washington Post on Wednesday that that has not historically been the case. The NCPC says it will review the ballroom plan before it's built, but it's already too late to save the East Wing. In any case, the board is now controlled by Trump's allies ‚Äî its chair, Will Scharf, is also serving as White House staff secretary ‚Äî and it's unlikely to block his plans.

Ultimately, the demolition may prove to be a question of norms more than statute. It's hard to imagine any other president moving so quickly and so secretly to bulldoze a portion of America's most famous building, particularly amid a government shutdown when federal employees aren't getting paid and funding for major food assistance programs is on the verge of running out.

The Trump administration claims that construction of the new ballroom, including the East Wing's demolition, will be paid for by private donations, plus a few other sources. Trump himself has said he'll contribute, though it's anyone's guess whether he'll make good on that.

Trump has touted this model ‚Äî which he also used to fund the Rose Garden patio and the flagpoles ‚Äî as a benefit, posting on Truth Social that the ballroom would be built with ‚Äúzero cost to the American Taxpayer.‚Äù While that may prove true, it's not without its downsides: There are obvious ethical issues attached to private donors paying for a president's pet project, which become abundantly clear when you glance through the donor list the White House shared on Thursday, which includes major US tech companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google and individuals like crypto megadonors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

In the modern era, previous modifications to the White House have largely either been strictly necessary or far more modest.

Many of those donors have business interests touched by the Trump administration, such as Apple's concerns over semiconductor tariffs; given Trump's mercurial tariff policy to date, it's not hard to see how a donation ‚Äî or failure to donate ‚Äî could skew his approach. As one ethics expert, Penn Carey Law professor Claire Finkelstein, told the Wall Street Journal regarding a fundraising dinner for the ballroom: ‚ÄúEvery company that is invited to that dinner that either doesn't show or doesn't give knows now they will be out of favor with the Trump administration.‚Äù

Additionally, private funding makes it easier for shocks like the lightning demolition of the East Wing to take place; under normal circumstances, a presidential administration would need to secure funding from Congress for significant renovations to the White House, a process that would play out in public.

This is one of the administration's chief defenses of the East Wing demolition: They're just doing what any other president might. ‚ÄúThere have been many presidents in the past who have made their mark on this beautiful White House complex,‚Äù White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.

While that's true, strictly speaking ‚Äî the White House is a constantly evolving, changing building that has to keep up with the pace of technology and the demands of the presidency ‚Äî it elides the point critics of the demolition are trying to make. In the modern era, previous modifications to the White House have largely either been strictly necessary or far more modest; the last truly major change was under President Harry Truman, and that was because the first family was literally in danger of falling through the White House floor: One leg of a piano belonging to Truman's daughter, Margaret, did in fact break through the floor.

The Truman renovation, which required the first family to move to the nearby Blair House for several years, amounted to a complete gutting and reconstruction of the residence. Even then, however, the building's exterior walls were preserved, outwardly retaining its historic appearance.

Since then, modifications to the White House have been more minor, including the additions of a bowling alley and a swimming pool and multiple updates to the White House Situation Room beneath the complex.

Trump's second and final term in office will end on January 20, 2029. As you can imagine, he wants to use it beforehand. The White House announcement in July said that the ballroom would be ‚Äúcompleted long before the end of President Trump's term,‚Äù but no specific date has been set.

Taxes used to work. That was before the loopholes.

Beginning in the early 20th century, a new ethos for taxes took hold: Taxes should be imposed on the basis of means, with the greatest burden falling to those with the greatest capacity to pay.

Such ‚Äútax the rich‚Äù sentiments informed the design of the two tax rules at the core of the modern tax system: the income tax, adopted in 1913, and the estate tax, adopted three years later, in 1916. The income tax had ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù tax rates, meaning taxes were higher for people with more taxable income; and it exempted many lower-income Americans altogether. And the estate tax was designed to impose a separate tax on the richest Americans as they pass their wealth to the next generation.

These two taxes originally applied to only the very wealthy, leaving more than 95 percent of Americans unaffected. But even when the income tax system was expanded to apply more broadly to fund World War II (which is sometimes described as moving it from a class tax to a mass tax), the focus on the rich was maintained.

Our income and estate taxes are still structured the same way, with progressive income tax rates and an estate tax that only applies to the richest Americans. Yet evidence shows that these taxes are not doing what they purport to do.

The capacity of the income tax to take the most from people who can most afford it has been undermined by wealthy people's avoidance of taxable income. Economists and tax experts have long recognized the ability of the wealthy to avoid taxable income, but with secrecy around tax returns, it was difficult to uncover real-world examples. This all changed in June 2021, when journalists at ProPublica published a series of articles based on actual tax returns leaked by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) contractor (his name: Charles Littlejohn, like the Robin Hood character). These tax returns confirmed that many of the richest Americans ‚Äî like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Michael Bloomberg ‚Äî were able to avoid income taxes altogether by avoiding taxable income.

The other plank of the tax code, the estate tax and gift tax (along with the generation-skipping transfer tax, adopted to fortify the estate and gift tax in 1986), was explicitly designed as a bulwark against large intergenerational transmissions of wealth. They promised to preserve an egalitarian American society for many decades they largely did.

But the estate tax, like the income tax, is no longer doing what it was designed to do. While there is no Charles Littlejohn-style cache of elite tax returns to substantiate how the tax isn't working, the American economy itself provides the proof. Concentrations of wealth have moved from historic lows in the 1970s to heights not seen since before the advent of the modern US tax code. And while the richest Americans control more wealth than ever, the amount of money raised by the estate and gift tax is minuscule, providing less than one-half of percent of total federal revenue. The channels to avoid the estate tax are not just well known; they are thriving, and the result has been the safe passage of wealth within families across decades.

The tax life of America's rich is, by nature, unique to each individual. But a few core themes have emerged in the new school of tax avoidance and the building of dynastic wealth ‚Äî that is, wealth passed down through families.

Most Americans depend on heavily taxed earnings from work to support themselves and their families. Meanwhile, many of the richest Americans avoid taxes by avoiding salaries ‚Äî with many like Larry Ellison (Oracle) and Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) having taken $1 a year, while others, like Elon Musk (Tesla), have taken zero, causing the state of California to charge Tesla with violating its minimum-wage laws. In some cases, these billionaires paid no income taxes at all despite their shared status as some of the wealthiest people in the world.

Avoiding salaries provides other tax benefits as well since avoiding salaries also avoids payroll taxes, which are used to fund the country's biggest expenses, Social Security and Medicare.

When the wealthy avoid salaries, these individuals are not eschewing financial gains from their businesses altogether. Instead, they are counting on the growing value of their stock holdings to build their wealth. Relying on growth instead of income helps them avoid significant taxes because that growth is not subject to tax until and unless they sell the stock. And if they hold it until their death, all the gains are washed away, never to be taxed. Then, their heirs are treated as if they bought the stock at market value, so they don't pay taxes on any of the deceased's gains, either. Meanwhile, by using these assets as collateral for loans, the wealthy can enjoy all of the financial benefits of selling without the burden of taxes.

Separate from the question of how to share the costs of government fairly, the failure to tax the rich also allows for that wealth to grow at warp speed, producing ever-greater concentrations of wealth.

The ability to avoid taxable income is not limited to billionaire entrepreneurs. Many ‚Äúregular‚Äù rich people can also enjoy the benefits of borrowing tax-free against their growing investments instead of selling their stock or receiving dividends. What is relatively new, though, is the widespread reliance on increases in stock value, as opposed to salary or dividends, as a means of acquiring wealth.

Before 1982, this path was not generally available, because corporations typically shared profits by paying salaries to top executives and other workers, and stock dividends to shareholders. Both salaries and dividends were generally subject to tax at the highest rates. However, after 1982, due to a change in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, many companies stopped using profits to pay dividends to shareholders ‚Äîand instead used profits to purchase their own stock on the open market (called stock buybacks), which had the effect of raising the value of said stock. The shift from dividends to stock buybacks eliminated a significant source of tax revenue (taxes on dividends) and gave wealthy investors an easy way to grow their assets tax-free.

In terms of the raw volume of taxes being paid, no group pays more than the working rich of the United States: the people working high-paying jobs (and thus paying high income taxes on top of payroll taxes) and not benefiting from the tax-avoidance devices of those who can afford to live without salaries. This amounts to a crucial difference between America's working rich and its plutocratic rich: The former work and have to pay taxes; the latter might work but have the means to circumnavigate the system to avoid paying taxes in ways the working rich can't.

A frequent refrain of those defending the status quo is that the income tax system already heavily burdens the rich because the top 1 percent of earners pay 40 percent of all income taxes while 40 percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all. This is partially true: Individuals with the most taxable income do pay the most income tax. However, this statistic is about people who have high incomes, typically from work; it tells us nothing about the tax liability of those with the most wealth. Studies have shown that there is only about a 50 percent overlap between America's wealthiest people and those who earn the most income. Moreover, as the leaked tax returns of several of the wealthiest Americans reveal, the ability of wealth owners to avoid taxable income means that they are just as likely to be among the 40 percent of nonpayers as they are the top 1 percent of earners.

Although the estate tax ‚Äî a tax paid on inherited wealth over a certain threshold ‚Äî still officially exists, its efficacy and public perception was severely damaged as part of a 1990s public relations campaign to portray it as a ‚Äúdeath tax‚Äù and ‚Äúan unfair double tax that hurt family farms and businesses.‚Äù The campaign, financed by some of America's wealthiest families, achieved only limited success in its goal of repealing the estate tax altogether ‚Äî they managed a one-year suspension, in 2010 ‚Äî but its more fundamental success was turning public sentiment negative against the tax. Since then, public antipathy, along with pressure from rich donors, has deterred lawmakers from doing basic upkeep to close the tax's loopholes.

Indeed, since 1990, Congress has not taken a single step to close any loopholes in the estate tax. As a result, the tax stands in name only, and wealthy Americans and their financial planners avoid taxes through a virtual alphabet soup of loopholes: names like SLATs, SLANTs, GRATs and GRUTs, CRATs and CRUTs, QTIPs and QPRTs and NIMCRUTs and Flip CRUTs.

The US income tax system‚Äîdeveloped on the assumption of a well-operating estate and gift tax‚Äî continues to impose no income taxes on people who receive gifts, inheritances, or life insurance distributions, no matter how large.

The rich are frequently celebrated for their charitable largesse, but their philanthropy often imposes significant costs on the federal government in terms of forgone revenue, and it often provides uncertain benefits to the public. People who work for their money receive few, if any, tax benefits from charitable giving, despite most people's assumptions to the contrary. Indeed, 90 percent of Americans get no tax benefits for their charitable donations. In contrast, those with wealth who plan their philanthropic gifts well ‚Äî as most wealthy people do ‚Äî can save on income taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate and gift taxes by making charitable donations of appreciated property, including stocks, real estate, cryptocurrency, and other property interests that have gone up in value. Taken together, these tax savings can save the donor, and thereby cost the federal government in forgone revenue, as much as 74 percent of the value of the donation. This makes American taxpayers, who must cover this forgone revenue, the unwitting and principal funders of the philanthropy of the very rich.

While some donations provide benefits to the public, there is no certainty that this will be the case. The reason is that the wealthiest Americans frequently donate their money not to food banks or homeless shelters (or even already-rich alma maters) but to their own private family foundations or donor-advised funds. These charitable intermediaries provide wealthy donors all the immediate tax benefits of charitable giving without imposing any time frame for the funds to be spent toward charitable ends. As a result, there is no certainty that the public will ever benefit from the donations.

The future of the United States and its economy depends on decisions the country makes today about taxing the rich.

Separate from the question of how to share the costs of government fairly, the failure to tax the rich also allows for that wealth to grow at warp speed, producing ever-greater concentrations of wealth. As others have noted, extreme concentrations of wealth threaten the continuing existence of American democracy. This is not only because wealth confers power ‚Äî over companies, the media, philanthropy, and politics ‚Äî but also because democracy demands that elites and regular people are united in the shared endeavor of a democratic republic.This is an issue not just for Democrats or Republicans, but for all Americans.

The overlooked impact of Trump's tariffs, explained.

In the heart of southern India's centuries-old textile industry, tens of millions of garment workers spin cotton fibers into yarn each year.

They then dye large swaths of that yarn a dusty indigo hue before weaving it into a denim fabric that will eventually be cut and sewn into your favorite pair of light-washed low-rise jeans. They're the kind that fit in that particular way so that you too can look like a member of the girl group Katseye, decked out in Gap denim at a cost of $90 apiece. Made in India.

But after President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on Indian goods went into effect this August, those $90 jeans effectively now have to pay a $45 toll just to get into the United States.

That is, if India ‚Äî the world's second-largest textile manufacturer ‚Äî gets to make them at all.

The export-heavy factories once bustling across the country's textile belt have all but come to a standstill since tariffs took hold. Garment workers have been rationing their shifts. And suicide rates are rising among the cotton farmers who supply the factories with raw materials ‚Äî as a result, thousands of farmers have taken to the streets to protest their government's tariff response.

Trump's slate of double-digit export fees has battered global supply chains across a map that seems to be all but gerrymandered against the global poor. The tariffs aren't just going to raise prices on your favorite Gap jeans, Nike shoes, or Costco Lululemon dupes ‚Äî they are also poised to threaten decades of progress in countries where exports have collectively lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades.

‚ÄúTrump has basically blown up all of the rules of the game,‚Äù said Jayati Ghosh, a development economist and professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Not that those rules were very fair to begin with, she said, but ‚Äúhaving some rules is better than having no rules, where the big bully can come and beat you up in the playground.‚Äù

There are millions of people whose ability to feed their families and send their kids to school depends on the often meager wages they earn stuffing your Labubus or even assembling your Mercedes-Benz. And in places where global trade has been a major driver of economic growth, these tariffs could reverse decades of substantial but often fragile progress.

For decades after gaining independence in 1947, India mostly kept to itself when it came to global trade. For much of the bell-bottomed jeans era, its exports hovered around just 5 percent of its GDP.

Then, in the early '90s ‚Äî the original age of baggy jeans and politically tinged celebrity denim ads ‚Äî India hit a currency crisis that eventually led to short-term financial assistance from the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which helped support a domestically-led opening of India to trade and foreign investment. The ‚Äúfree market‚Äù conditions that came with that help remain contentious: the IMF sees them as key to spurring economic growth ‚Äî and by extension, swift debt repayment ‚Äî even though they often hurt the country's poorest, at least in the short term.

By the time jeans got skinny in the mid-2000s, companies like Gap had begun to see India as a promising manufacturing hub. In China, which dominated American clothing manufacturing at the time, wages were rising ‚Äî meaning $4 to $8 per day. But in India, Gap's subcontractors could pay workers, some of them children, closer to just $2 per day. That might seem miserly, but it's worth noting that most low-skilled women workers in India at the time earned under $0.50 per day.

So, as exploitative as those garment industry wages could be, they also unlocked a lot of prosperity for the country and job opportunities for a mostly female workforce.

Over a decade, Indian exports ballooned ‚Äî at an annual pace of 26 percent in 2006. Today, the country is one of the largest textile manufacturers (second only to China) and the second-largest single cotton producer in the world. Along the way, rates of extreme poverty in India ‚Äî once home to one-third of the world's poor ‚Äî plummeted.

A child living in India today is nearly three times more likely to finish high school, over five times more likely to have basic plumbing, and 11 times less likely to die from hunger than just a few decades ago.

Most economists credit trade liberalization ‚Äî and the economic growth it can bring ‚Äî for propelling those changes.

‚ÄúYou can't eat GDP, but you can enjoy a lot of the benefits of human development that come with higher incomes,‚Äù said Cullen Hendrix, an expert in development at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That means ‚Äúmore kids making it to their fifth birthday,‚Äù and ‚Äúmore women being able to attend secondary school.‚Äù

When you buy a pair of jeans, the money that you spend trickles down the supply chain. The top of the chain ‚Äî in this case, Gap shareholders ‚Äî make the most money, but your cashier gets a cut too. Whatever's left goes to the subcontractor to divvy among the Indian garment workers who stitched the pants. And the farmer who grew the cotton ‚Äî the one trading in raw materials ‚Äî earns the least of all.

But as brutal as the garment industry can be ‚Äî women are often forced to work overtime in unsanitary conditions and many face harassment from their supervisors ‚Äî it is still seen as the first rung in climbing up the ladder of the global supply chain and away from exporting raw materials like cotton or cobalt.

Today, 45 million textile workers live in India, where textile and apparel exports rose by about 7 percent to $21 billion in 2024. The country is now Gap's second-largest manufacturing hub, with 88 factories in total, eight of them added between 2021 and 2024. Other major apparel brands like Zara, H&M, and Primark manufacture their clothing there, too.

But the 50 percent tariff from India's largest trade partner ‚Äî which is so high on tight-margin products like clothing that it is an effective embargo ‚Äî has been a blow to this growing industry. Indian exports to the US plunged by a whopping 40 percent over the past four months. Gap recently told investors that the tariffs will cost the company up to $175 million, and it has already halted shipments from India.

That is a catastrophe for workers who are often paid per piece of clothing sewn.

Every lost order of blue jeans means less money for workers and ‚Äútheir children, their education, their health,‚Äù and even basics like food, shelter, and clean water, said Revathy Rugmini, regional director for Asia at the advocacy group Transform Trade.

‚ÄúThere are things that you can control and there are things that you can't control,‚Äù Gap CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in August. ‚ÄúThe things that we can control, we're doing really well.‚Äù The company did not respond to a request for comment from Vox.

Talks to reach a trade deal between India and the US are ongoing, but India's garment industry is nevertheless bracing for an up to 10 percent drop in revenue this year as companies like Gap shift production elsewhere.

‚ÄúTime is of the essence here,‚Äù said Rugmini, who noted that the poorest families ‚Äî to whom export-driven gains have not been evenly distributed ‚Äî could easily slip back into poverty if production remains slow.

Three decades ago, more than half of Vietnam's population lived on less than $3 per day.

But like India, the still officially communist country began to slowly liberalize its economy in the 1990s, culminating in a historic trade deal with the United States in 2001. The deal slashed US tariffs on Vietnam from a high of 40 percent to just 4 percent, opening the doors to a wave of foreign investment.

Enter Nike.

The shoe juggernaut was one of the earlier international companies to begin manufacturing in Vietnam in 1995. At the time, Bugs Bunny and basketball icon Michael Jordan Nike ads for the new Air Jordans were everywhere, sneaker sales were skyrocketing, and Nike suddenly needed a lot of new factories to make a lot of new shoes.

As a carrot for trade skeptics in Vietnam, the company promised to boost the portion of its shoes made in the country if the trade deal was approved. In 2000, Nike employed just 45,000 workers at five factories in Vietnam, but the company now makes over half of its shoes in Vietnam, employing nearly 450,000 workers at 135 independent factories.And as the number of companies manufacturing in Vietnam ballooned ‚Äî and as workers got jobs, cities got factories, and Americans got sneakers ‚Äî the level of extreme poverty in the country fell at one of the fastest rates the world has ever seen. Today, just over 1 in 100 people in Vietnam live in extreme poverty.

Along the way, foreign companies like Nike regularly came under fire for exposing garment workers to toxic fumes, restricting toilet access, and employing children as young as 14.

Still, even the sweatshops' meager wages were often much higher than what workers could earn elsewhere. As exploitative as they could be, whenever a foreign factory moved in, incomes consistently rose and poverty fell.

But Vietnam's explosive export-driven growth did have a catch. The country's economy now revolves largely around the whims of foreign factory owners from Taiwan and Singapore, who subcontract for even further-flung global conglomerates like Nike.

‚ÄúForeigners play a huge role in Vietnamese production,‚Äù said Edmund Malesky, a professor at Duke specializing in economic development in Vietnam. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of positivity about what global integration has given Vietnam,‚Äù he says, but that dependence has also left them vulnerable.

‚ÄúIf you put all your eggs in this export basket, then you become critically dependent on your export markets,‚Äù said Ghosh.

In this case, Vietnam's largest market is an increasingly protectionist United States. Trump's threat to slap a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam in April sent Nike executives into a tailspin. The company's stock nosedived more than 14 percent and Nike warned that its losses could add up to $1 billion, costs that the company would likely look to offset within its supply chain ‚Äî namely, by lowering wages.

One messy trade deal rollout later, Trump eventually lowered tariffs on Vietnam to 20 percent, plus a vaguely defined 40 percent fee for the roughly one-third of Vietnamese exports that pass through China first. (Many export manufacturers shifted parts of their production line to Vietnam as a way to sidestep the steep tariffs Trump placed on China during his first administration.)

Nike stocks recovered somewhat, but what remains is still a very large tariff. Large enough that the United Nations just estimated the 20 percent blanket fee ‚Äî compared with a pre-Trump tariff of less than 10 percent ‚Äî could cost the nation up to $25 billion in lost exports to the US, a nearly 20 percent drop, which would make Vietnam the second-hardest-hit by tariffs in the world after China.

And if the 40 percent tariff is eventually applied on any so-called transshipments originating overseas, the impact could be even more dramatic. Huge swaths of Vietnam's export manufacturing sector are intertwined with Chinese supply chains.

‚ÄúWe have a very expansive and diverse global supply chain that we've built over 50 years,‚Äù Nike CEO Elliott Hill recently told CNBC. ‚ÄúWe're working through some of the levers that we have to offset those tariffs,‚Äù including ‚Äúworking with our factory partners‚Äù overseas.

Vox reached out to Nike about the tariffs, and in response, the company emphasized its commitment to ethical labor practices and noted that it was actively exploring new options for sourcing its products.

Even with the reduced tariff, sneaker sales are already slipping. Vietnam's all-important footwear exports to the US plunged by 27 percent in September, while textile exports dropped by 20 percent. The World Bank recently cut its GDP forecast for the country because of the tariffs, which could unravel decades of economic progress.

‚ÄúThe real lesson is that you really should not tether your entire economy to another one, even if it's as big as the United States, because there's simply too much unpredictability,‚Äù said Karen Mathiasen, an expert at the Center for Global Development. ‚ÄúOne policy change in the United States has thrown the economy into turmoil.‚Äù

Just before he slapped the tiny, landlocked African nation of Lesotho with the highest tariff in the world this April, Trump mocked the country as a place that ‚Äúnobody has ever heard of.‚Äù

He must have never read the label on his own Trump-branded golf polos, some of which are manufactured by Lesotho's fragile but vibrant garment industry.

And though the US eventually reduced Lesotho's tariff to 15 percent, down from 50 percent in his initial declaration, the damage was already done in the textile sector, which employs around 30,000 people, most of them women earning less than roughly $40 per week.

Lesotho has been a poster child for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which allowed sub-Saharan African countries ‚Äî which include some of the poorest nations in the world ‚Äî to trade duty-free with the US for the past quarter-century.

The program, signed into law in 2000, aimed to recreate in Africa the same kind of export-driven growth that had begun to nudge countries like Vietnam into the global middle class.

Without export fees, cocoa farmers from C√¥te d'Ivoire could suddenly compete more easily to get their products into Hershey's chocolate bars. Kenya's vast fields of rose flowers could find their way into your Valentine's Day bouquets. And Namibian cattle herders could ship Philadelphians their beef (for cheesesteaks, presumably).

But the biggest beneficiaries of AGOA were countries like Lesotho, Madagascar, and Ethiopia, where the program offered a way to break into the global fast-fashion market, and away from mining, farming, and extracting raw materials for export.

The idea was that African countries won't grow if ‚Äúwe just continue to consume their oil and their diamonds and their cobalt and their food exports,‚Äù said Hendrix.

And few countries embraced the program as doggedly as Lesotho, which exported over $237 million worth of goods like golf polos, Levi's jeans, and Walmart tees to the US last year.

But the fate of AGOA, which expired at the end of September, now seems bleak. Even if the US eventually revives the program, it's unclear how new tariffs across the African continent would coexist with it.

The International Monetary Fund predicts that those tariffs will lower GDP across Africa. And they come at a time when foreign aid is also being slashed ‚Äî a double whammy against development.

But, while the evisceration of aid has gotten most of the attention, experts say that tariffs could be significantly more destructive over the long term.

‚ÄúThe tariffs are going to be the big, big, shock to that system,‚Äù said Abhijit Banerjee, a Nobel Prize-winning economist for his work studying the contours of global poverty. ‚ÄúThe US trade policy may well be much more damaging to the world than aid cuts.‚Äù

Of course, Trump can easily manufacture his polo shirts outside of Lesotho. At a recent visit to his store in midtown Manhattan, most Trump-branded clothing showed labels from Vietnam, Taiwan, and El Salvador.

Lesotho's garment workers, though, have no such flexibility. The country went so far as to declare a state of disaster after the tariff took effect.

The textile industry in Lesotho was a pillar ‚Äúthat has been driving that country's economy,‚Äù said Shimukunku Manchishi, senior policy officer at the African Future Policies Hub. The tariffs will stifle broader investment and development in a country where most adults only live into their late 50s and almost one-third of kids are so chronically hungry that they never fully grow.

Why? Because the US ‚Äúdoesn't see Africa as a big trading partner that would have a ripple effect, a big economic shock, on the USA,‚Äù Manchishi said. More and more, African countries feel likewise, experts say, with most instead prioritizing their trading relationships with China, the European Union, and each other over an increasingly hostile US.

‚ÄúThey're going to be looking less to the west ‚Äî at least the far west, the United States,‚Äù Hendrix said. ‚ÄúAnd more towards the east.‚Äù

But for a nation like Lesotho, which had become a small manufacturing powerhouse for Levi's jeans in recent years, it seems unlikely that denim will be the path to development anytime soon. Most African countries already trade more with China than they do with the US, but China's still the world's largest textile exporter ‚Äî and it's unlikely to become a big market for African-made garments anytime soon.

‚ÄúThis is a policy that is going to have adverse effects for some of the poorest people on Earth,‚Äù Hendrix said, ‚Äúand provide limited, if any, benefit to the US economy.‚Äù

America's retirees will get an extra $56 in their wallets monthly, as Social Security checks adjust to keep up with rising prices.

Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment, which is tied to a key inflation measure, will be 2.8% for 2026. That will shake out to an additional $56 a month for nearly 71 million beneficiaries starting in January, according to the Social Security Administration, with Supplemental Security Income recipients getting their beefed-up checks starting at the end of December.

""Social Security is a promise kept, and the annual cost-of-living adjustment is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security,"" Frank Bisignano, the Social Security Administration commissioner, said in a release.

The adjustment is based on third-quarter consumer price index data. Inflation continued accelerating in September, reaching 3%. That matches January's rate.

The cost-of-living adjustment skyrocketed to 8.7% in 2022 for 2023, when inflation was much higher than it has been.

The adjustment ‚Äî and the data it's based on ‚Äî comes as other federal functions and data remain in a holding pattern. The Bureau of Labor Statistics didn't publish its September jobs report earlier this month because of the ongoing government shutdown, and it has yet to be released. Initially, the inflation data and Social Security adjustment were scheduled to be released on October 15, but were delayed by the shutdown; the Bureau of Labor Statistics reportedly recalled staffers to prepare the inflation report.

""No other releases will be rescheduled or produced until the resumption of regular government services,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in an October 10 statement. ""This release allows the Social Security Administration to meet statutory deadlines necessary to ensure the accurate and timely payment of benefits.""

While older Americans can take some solace knowing that their payments should proceed on time ‚Äî and with requisite increases ‚Äî other social safety net programs are floundering during the shutdown, which could cause ripple effects.

Some states have warned that they'll need to pause distributing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in November, meaning that many low-income Americans may struggle to afford groceries with smaller or nonexistent monthly checks. As of fiscal year 2022, about 7.2 million Americans aged 60 and over participated in SNAP, and, as of fiscal year 2023, that group made up around a fifth of SNAP participants.

All of that could exacerbate some of the financial strains that older Americans are already facing. Around 44% of Americans 65 and older have incomes of $30,000 or less in 2024, per a Business Insider analysis of Census data. That could mean even the 2.8% increase may not be enough for some: An AARP survey of 1,001 American adults ages 50 and up, conducted between September 18 and 23, found that 77% disagreed that a COLA of around 3% would be enough to keep up with rising prices.

Meta chopped 600 employees from its Meta Superintelligence Labs group this week. Google is removing managers again. Broadcom cut staff recently, too.

These 3 companies have one thing in common: They are growing quickly and minting money from the AI boom. So why are they still shedding employees?

I asked Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology. He's been analyzing the tech industry for decades.

""The Meta cuts are a perfect example of AI working too well not failing. These aren't demand-driven layoffs; they're the result of a massive internal restructuring as AI changes the cost structure of tech itself.""

This is perfectly illustrated by another scoop this week from Business Insider's Jyoti Mann. She reported that Meta executive Michel Port recently told some employees that their jobs were being replaced by new automated processes.

Here's the rest of Brad's take, edited for clarity and length:

""In Meta's case, it looks like a consolidation and reprioritization issue. Meta has hundreds of separate AI initiatives spanning Llama, infrastructure, content moderation, recommendation systems, and ad optimization. The 600 jobs being cut are largely from overlapping research or support teams as Meta shifts from ""AI research mode"" to ""AI productization mode."" Once the models are trained and deployed, you simply don't need the same headcount to maintain that velocity, especially when internal tools are now automating much of the work engineers used to do manually.

Think of it like the moment after an airplane reaches cruising altitude: you need fewer hands in the cockpit. The heavy lift training, data labeling, model architecture is done. Now the focus is on efficiency, inference, and monetization.

More broadly, all the major AI players ‚Äî Meta, Google, Microsoft, Broadcom ‚Äî are demonstrating the same pattern. They're investing billions in infrastructure while trimming the human layers that are being displaced by those very systems. It's not layoffs because business is bad; it's because AI is doing exactly what it promised: automating middle-tier technical and operational roles.

If the industrial revolution replaced muscle, AI is replacing repetition and coordination. It's not that Meta or Google suddenly need fewer ideas; they just need fewer people to execute them.""

Billionaire Michael Dell has joined in the fanfare around the opening of JPMorgan's new Park Avenue office.

But rather than praising the state-of-the-art gym, futuristic AI monitoring systems, or the architectural prowess of the $3 billion skyscraper, Dell pinpointed another feature ‚Äî rows and rows of his company's monitors.

""Congratulations JPMorgan on the opening of your new headquarters!"" Dell tweeted on X on Thursday, alongside a photo of what appears to be a trading floor.

The bank officially opened its $3 billion headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan on Tuesday. The 60-story skyscraper stands at 1,388 feet tall, and will house 10,000 JPMorgan staffers by the end of the year, though it has capacity for 14,000.

Experts previously told Business Insider that the building's design sends a clear message about JPMorgan's tough expectations for work-life balance and putting in face time. With a 24/7 grab-and-go food and an on-site pub, it's clear that ""there'll be people there at night, there'll be people on the weekends,"" said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates.

Alluring well-being perks aside, the four-screen setup seen in Dell's photo is perhaps a clearer indicator of the hustle culture expected when you come to work at America's biggest bank.

Congratulations @jpmorgan on the opening of your new headquarters! üéâüá∫üá∏üôè pic.twitter.com/Dnhw2SkbYe

Dell has played a key part in the technology experience at the Park Avenue headquarters, said Larry Feinsmith, the head of global technology strategy at JPMorgan Chase, during an appearance onstage with Michael Dell at Dell Technologies World 2025, the tech company's annual conference, in May.

""Dell has been such a strategic partner for us as we think about our next-gen modern workspace,"" he said.

The headquarters features ""Dell thin clients and peripherals, and with tremendous efficient desk power as low as 125 watts,"" as well as Dell servers on the backend, which enable the ""immersive audio video, which is going to be everywhere in that building,"" Feinsmith said.

Dell Thunderbolt for monitors, a fast-connectivity docking port, has been installed across stations to create ""a flexible experience so that you can either bring your own device or for our traders, who have very complex configurations with four monitors,"" Feinsmith said.

Dell and JPMorgan have a partnership stretching back nearly thirty years, during which Dell has provided solutions for the bank's private cloud storage, compute hardware, software device storage, and GPUs. Dell and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment.

Dell is one of the leading enterprise technology hardware providers in the US. The company's total annual revenue was up 8% in its 2025 financial year, and Dell's stock has been up 11% since January.

Dell's CSG division ‚Äî responsible for selling hardware like the monitors seen in JPMorgan's office ‚Äî is the company's biggest revenue driver, but the division's revenue has declined for the last three years.

Revenue from Dell's infrastructure solutions group (ISG) ‚Äî which sells the servers and data infrastructure that companies need to harness AI ‚Äî has shot up. ISG's annual revenue was up 29% in Dell's last full financial year.

Walmart is shaking up its approach to reviews and raises for frontline hourly workers at its US stores.

The retail giant is moving to a new performance-based plan that accounts for factors like attendance, teamwork, and overall store performance, EVP of store operations Cedric Clark said in a memo to managers last week that was shared with Business Insider.

The new approach marks a shift from the across-the-board raises that were based on years of service with the company, which Clark said rewarded loyalty but not other individual factors.

""It's about recognition, accountability, and growth,"" Clark wrote. ""Associates asked for more control over their earnings, more recognition for great work, and clearer expectations.""

Walmart is the largest private employer in the US, with a workforce of about 1.6 million and 4,600 stores. More than half a million of those people are in non-supervisory hourly roles, making this one of the largest-scale changes for worker pay in the country.

The changes also come as companies across the economy increasingly emphasize worker performance and efficiency, and workers look for a stronger sense of loyalty from employers, in addition to a paycheck.

Years of service are still the most significant factor in determining raises, but now worker and store performance can nudge that number up or down by as much as one percentage point, according to additional internal documents obtained by Business Insider.

Workers who joined in the last six months are eligible for a 1% baseline raise, while those who have been at the company for five years see a baseline of 2%, followed by 2.5% for up to 10 years. Workers with 10 or more years of service have a baseline raise of 4%, the documents said.

From there, three factors are equally weighted to account for an employee's attendance and completion of scheduled shifts, their behavioral contributions to the team, and the overall store performance in both sales and customer satisfaction ratings.

In each of these three areas, employees receive a rating of ""exemplary,"" ""successful,"" or ""opportunity,"" and a new dashboard shows how they are tracking in real time. An employee who scores the highest rating ‚Äî exemplary ‚Äî in all three factors would receive the highest performance-related adjustment of one percentage point, according to a chart included in the documents.

The share of employees rated opportunity is typically small. For example, in separate guidance for corporate managers, Walmart estimates that one in 20 employees would likely get the lowest rating, ""opportunity,"" two would likely get the highest rating, ""exemplary,"" and most would default to ""successful."" A spokesperson said there is no such guidance for store managers and there are no quotas or caps for ratings.

The spokesperson also said the final raise percentage only affects employees' base pay, not any bonuses or other compensation.

Walmart said the system is now active and will gather data for the fiscal year until January 31, after which raises will be calculated.

Clark's memo also says the new structure enables team leaders and coaches to provide clearer feedback to workers. For workers, this means their pay will now be linked more closely to their day-to-day performance.

Correction ‚Äî October 24, 2025: An earlier version of this story misstated the scope of the ratings distribution guidance. It is for corporate employees, not store workers. It also misstated the dates of the review period for store workers, which runs until January 31.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kay Richards, a woman in her 60s, who lives in Manassas, Virginia. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider reached out to Amazon for comment, but did not receive one prior to publishing.

When my husband and I moved into our home over a decade ago, there were no data centers to be found. It was just an idyllic little neighborhood full of trees. It was our dream place.

Today, there are 14 data centers within a mile radius of our home, belonging to various companies.

The constant buzzing and smell of what I believe is diesel make it hard for me to even go in my backyard. It's disheartening to see our community transformed by these industrial warehouses, but we're not going anywhere.

We'll continue to fight the developers as they try to build more. I will die on this hill and stay in this house.

Amazon was one of the first to start building its data center in our immediate area several years ago, and it's still the closest one to us. The company tore down so many trees to build what looks like an industrial park ‚Äî rows and rows of one-story concrete boxes. It's ugly.

There's a small buffer of green space, about two blocks, between our backyard and the data center, but we sit directly in its line of fire. At night, I can see its lights through my windows.

The whole back of our house used to be filled with green space, and it was really beautiful. Thank god there's still some left, but it's just not the same. It feels like everywhere I turn in the neighborhood, there's another data center. There's even an elementary school just a few blocks away from an Amazon data center.

I noticed the noise straight away. It's a constant electrical hum that I can almost feel behind my eyes. Some people seem to notice it more than others.

If I'm inside my home on the first floor, I have a bit of a buffer from the noise, but when I'm upstairs, I feel and hear it the most. We have a lovely deck and backyard, but I can't spend much time outside anymore. It's even worse when the diesel generators kick on, and we have to deal with that smell.

The light pollution is also very prevalent. The lights from a nearby Amazon data center shine directly into my kitchen. It's not as bad during the summer, but in the winter, it's like somebody is shining a spotlight through our window.

So many people in our community are going to county supervisor meetings, making noise, and doing anything they can to take a proactive stance against the development of future data centers. I think the way it has brought our community together is the only positive effect of them.

Unfortunately, our advocacy has not been very successful. We're currently trying to change the noise ordinance to account for the buzzing of the data centers, but we'll see.

No matter what happens, this is still our dream home. It's not just the property that we love, it's also the neighborhood and the people in it. We're not moving, so we'll just have to stand our ground and keep fighting.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

President Donald Trump said late last night that he is ending all U.S. trade negotiations with Canada over an ad aired by Ontario's provincial government featuring the voice of former President Ronald Reagan.

In the ad, Reagan is heard speaking negatively about tariffs and their impact on Americans. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said the ad misrepresents Reagan's 1987 remarks, which it said were edited without permission.

Trump accused Canada of trying to use the ad to influence the pending Supreme Court case that could determine the fate of many of his tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said earlier this month that the province was spending $75 million to run the ads in the U.S.

It's finally here. After a nine-day delay thanks to the ongoing government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release September's consumer price index report this morning. The index, which tracks a broad basket of goods and services, is closely followed by both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve as a gauge of inflation.

Here's what to know:

Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs, its first major layoffs in a decade.

The retailer will lay off about 1,000 employees and cut 800 open positions, a company spokesperson told CNBC's Melissa Repko. Together, the equates to about 8% of the retailer's workforce.

Target has been fighting to return to growth after years of sluggish sales. The cuts also come as incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke prepares to take the reigns from Brian Cornell next year.

Ford Motor sped past Wall Street's expectations on both lines for the third quarter. Investors took the results well, with shares jumping more than 4% in extended trading.

However, the automaker slashed its full-year outlook, citing the impact of a fire at one of its aluminum suppliers in New York. Ford said the fire, which has hampered production of its large trucks and SUVs, is expected to cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.

Elsewhere in the auto industry, electric vehicle maker Rivian told employees it is laying off about 4.5% of its workforce. A source confirmed to CNBC's Michael Wayland that more than 600 jobs will be cut.

In this article

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, lifted by higher demand for its beauty and grooming products.

Despite higher costs from tariffs and what CEO Jon Moeller called a ""challenging consumer and geopolitical environment,"" P&G reiterated its forecast for all-in sales and earnings for the fiscal year, which began in July.

Here's what the company reported for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

P&G reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $4.75 billion, or $1.95 per share, up from $3.96 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding certain items, including costs associated with incremental restructuring, the consumer giant earned $1.99 per share.

Net sales rose 3% to $22.39 billion. Organic sales ‚Äî which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency ‚Äî increased 2% in the quarter.

Though revenue metrics were higher, P&G's volume was flat compared with the year-ago period. Volume excludes pricing, which makes it a more accurate reflection of demand than sales. Like many consumer companies, P&G has seen demand for some of its products fall as inflation-weary consumers seek out deals.

""The consumer environment is not great, but stable,"" CFO Andre Schulten said on a call with media, adding that shoppers have behaved similarly in the last few quarters.

In the United States, the company's largest market, consumption across P&G's broad swath of products has slowed ""a little bit,"" according to Schulten. Like Coca-Cola, P&G is seeing a bifurcation in how consumers are shopping based on their incomes, often described as a ""K-shaped"" economy.

Shoppers who are less cash constrained are buying bigger pack sizes from club and online retailers, Schulten said.

""That's their way to look for value,"" he said.

But U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck are looking to stretch their money further by using every bottle of detergent or shampoo to the last drop and exhausting their pantry inventory before shopping for more, according to Schulten.

At the same time, private label brands are losing market share, bucking previous shopping trends during economic downturns, executives said on the company's conference call. After the recession in 2008, P&G shifted its strategy to create more premium products that couldn't be easily substituted with cheaper private label versions.

P&G reported Friday that volume for both its health care and fabric and home care divisions, which include Tide and Swiffer, fell 2% during the quarter.

The company is seeing ""heightened competition"" in those categories, fueled by promotions and discounting from rivals, executives said on the conference call. To win back customers, P&G is focusing on innovation that can justify higher prices and convince shoppers that its products are superior. For example, Schulten said that Tide is starting shipments of its ""biggest upgrade to liquid detergent in 20 years.""

The company's baby, feminine and family care segment reported flat volume for the quarter. That division includes brands like Pampers and Tampax.

P&G's beauty business was a bright spot. The division, which includes Olay and SK-II, reported volume growth of 4% and overall sales growth of 6%. Olay's Super Serum line was the brand's top performer, showing that customers were willing to pay more for premium skincare.

And P&G's grooming business, which includes Gillette and Venus razors, saw volume rise 1% in the quarter for a sales increase of 5%.

For fiscal 2026, the company is now projecting that President Donald Trump's tariffs will result in $400 million in after-tax costs, down from its prior outlook of $800 million. When P&G originally formulated its forecast, it included retaliatory tariffs on Canada, which have since been rescinded. As a result, the company is now planning a smaller raise in prices than it expected, Moeller said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday morning.

However, Trump said on Thursday evening that he is terminating all trade talks with Canada over a TV ad, which could mean higher costs ahead for P&G.

P&G also reiterated its fiscal 2026 forecast of sales growth between 1% and 5% and earnings per share in the range of $6.83 to $7.09.

The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said on Friday that it had preliminarily found both TikTok and Meta in breach of its transparency rules.

It accused the U.S. tech giants of breaching their obligation to give researchers ""adequate access"" to public data under the Digital Services Act (DSA) ‚Äî the EU's landmark tech legislation.

""The Commission also preliminarily found Meta, for both Instagram and Facebook, in breach of its obligations to provide users simple mechanisms to notify illegal content, as well as to allow them to effectively challenge content moderation decisions,"" it added in a statement.

The Digital Services Act is among a handful of EU legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check. The Commission has also opened numerous investigations under another landmark law known as the Digital Markets Act.

""We disagree with any suggestion that we have breached the DSA, and we continue to negotiate with the European Commission on these matters,"" Meta spokesperson Ben Walters said in a statement.

""In the European Union, we have introduced changes to our content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force and are confident that these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU,"" he added.

A TikTok spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it ""is committed to transparency and values the contribution of researchers"" to its platform and social media industry as a whole.

""We have made substantial investments in data sharing and almost 1000 research teams have been given access to data through our Research Tools to date,"" the spokesperson said.

""We are reviewing the European Commission's findings, but requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR in direct tension. If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,"" they added.

The EU says researchers should have access to social media platforms' data, as this enables the public to scrutinize any potential physical or mental health impacts of the technology.

The Commission said in its preliminary findings that Facebook, Instagram and TikTok ""may have put in place burdensome procedures and tools for researchers to request access to public data. This often leaves them with partial or unreliable data, impacting their ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.""

The tech companies are now invited by the Commission to examine its findings and reply in writing.

If the Commission's preliminary findings are upheld, it has the power to issue a non-compliance decision which could carry with it a fine of up to 6% of the total worldwide annual turnover ‚Äî a hefty amount for Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance.

Meta also faced a 200 million euros ($228.4 million) fine under the Digital Markets Act in April, as the Commission flexed its new competition powers for the first time. The fine was related to how users consented to data collection.

Meanwhile, TikTok's transfer of data to China also resulted in it being handed a 530 million euros fine by the protection authority in Ireland earlier this year.

India's largest private oil refiner Reliance Industries is reportedly halting purchases of Russian crude, following the U.S.' decision to sanction Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.

Reliance has become a major buyer of Russian crude. In September, it purchased around 629,590 barrels of Russian crude per day from the two firms, out of India's total imports of 1.6 million barrels per day, according to data by commodities data analytics firm Kpler.

Over the same month last year, Reliance purchased around 428,000 barrels per day of oil from the Russian companies.

In fact, India's Russian crude imports used to account for less than 3% of its total crude import basket, but today account for one-third of India's crude imports, experts say.

Reliance has not responded to CNBC requests for comment on reports that it is stopping the purchase of Russian crude.

It comes as the U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday levied sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's ""lack of serious commitment"" to ending the war in Ukraine. The sanctions aim to ""degrade"" the Kremlin's ability to finance its war, the U.S. department said, signaling more measures could follow.

If Reliance does halt Russian purchases, it will have ""negative impacts on [Reliance's] margin and profitability as Russian crude constitute more than 50% of [its] crude diet,"" Pankaj Srivastava, SVP of commodity oil markets at market research firm Rystad Energy said in emailed comments.

He added that the availability of ""similar crude is not an issue"" and can be sourced from West Asia, Brazil, or Guyana, but Reliance is unlikely to get the same price as it does on Russian crude, as it has long-term deals with suppliers like Rosneft.

Last December, Reliance Industries signed a deal to import crude oil worth $12 billion-$13 billion a year from Russia's Rosneft for 10 years, which would translate to roughly 500,000 barrels per day, according to a report by Reuters.

The purchase of Russian oil by Indian refiners was ""opportunistic buying"" driven by discounts versus comparable grades, said Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights.

India bought 38% of Russia's crude exports in September, second only to China at 47% according to Helsinki-based think tank Centre for Energy and Clean Air.

Hari added that Indian refineries can easily pivot to buying from sources with the trade-off being ""pressure on refining margins.""

Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler, said the Indian refining giant might face some short-term issues as it looks to replace the Russian crude.

""Given the large volumes under the Reliance-Rosneft deal, we expect some short-term friction for Reliance in securing replacement barrels,"" says Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler.

She added that ""Russia's medium-sour Urals remains about $5‚Äì6/bbl [barrel] cheaper than Middle Eastern crude of similar quality.

A report by Jefferies last month indicated that the impact of Reliance Industries moving away from Russian oil was ""manageable.""

The brokerage said in September that it had received queries from investors about the possible financial impact on Reliance if it halts its imports of Russian oil due to sanctions.

The benefit of Russian crude accounts for around 2.1% of the firm's estimated consolidated EBITDA of 2.05 trillion rupees ($ 22.8 billion) for fiscal year 2027, the brokerage said.

Reliance's consolidated EBITDA for the six months of fiscal year 2026 was 1.08 trillion Indian rupees ($12.3 billion), of which 295 billion rupees were from its oil-to-chemicals segment, while its telecom and retail ventures together contributed to nearly 500 billion rupees.

Other Indian refiners are also looking to cut imports of Russian oil. Weaning off Russian oil might raise India's import bill, but it won't be ""as big a sticker shock as [it] might have been if crude was in the $70 or $80 range,"" said Hari of Vanda Insights.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were trading around $61.83 a barrel on Friday.

Experts also say the benefits of India cutting back on Russian oil purchases outweigh the downsides.

According to Natixis' Senior Economist Trinh Nguyen, the arbitrage that Russian oil offered during the energy crisis has tapered off, and there is no need for India now to have significant purchases of Russian oil.

India's Russian crude purchase has been a sore point in its trade relations with the U.S., which culminated in the U.S. imposing a total 50% tariff on Indian goods exported to the U.S..

With both state-owned and private refiners expected to halt purchase of Russian crude ‚Äî a long-standing demand of U.S. President Donald Trump ‚Äî the chances of India negotiating a mutually beneficial trade deal with the U.S. have increased.

U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week as part of his trip to Asia, as the world's top two economies seek to dial down tensions in search for a trade deal that has so far been elusive.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that Trump will meet his Chinese counterpart on Oct. 30 on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, Summit.

""I think we are going to come out very well and everyone's going to be very happy,"" Trump said later on Thursday about his panned meeting with Xi.

South Korean presidential security advisor Wi Sung-lac confirmed Thursday the state visits by Trump and Xi during the APEC summit, although China has not officially made a statement about it.

It will be the first in-person meeting between the two heads of states since Trump returned to the office in January. The leaders, who have had at least two phone calls this year, last met in 2019 during Trump's first presidential term.

The high-stakes meeting comes as a delicate trade detente between the economic superpowers nears its expiration on Nov. 10 if they fail to agree on another extension. Trump has also set Nov. 1 as the deadline for additional 100% tariffs announced earlier this month.

The trade truce has been threatened in recent weeks by a fresh wave of restrictive measures, ranging from hefty port fees on each other's vessels, expanded export controls on technology and rare earth minerals.

The two economic powers have also tussled over lingering issues including tariffs, agricultural purchases, fentanyl flows, and geopolitical flashpoints such as Taiwan.

""This will be a high-risk, high-reward leaders' meeting,"" said Han Shen Lin, China director of global consultancy firm The Asia Group. ""Both sides will try to hit the 'reset' button"" for a relationship rattled by the latest round of tit-for-tat restrictions, he added, while avoiding ""any big headline concession.""

The two countries may agree to resume the ongoing trade talks, rather than a sweeping trade deal, Han said, stressing that deeper structural disputes have not been resolved and ""may never be.""

Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday that rare earths, fentanyl, soybeans and Taiwan were among U.S.' top issues for discussion with China. A senior Taiwanese foreign affairs official said Tuesday that Taipei is in close contact with Washington and will monitor closely the Trump-Xi meeting.

In a press briefing on China's economic development plan on Friday, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao stressed that the U.S. and China could still find ways to talk and work together, rather than slide toward a decoupling.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation on Xi's trip to South Korea.

Chinese commerce ministry said Thursday that a delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, also the country's top trade negotiator, will meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Malaysia this week to discuss trade and economic issues.

Tensions between Washington and Beijing have flared up again in recent weeks, with both sides seeking to amass leverage ahead of critical negotiations.

Yet the confirmation of a Trump-Xi meeting signals an intent to de-escalate tensions and put negotiations back on track, analysts said.

The fact that the meeting will happen suggests China will commit to making certain concessions, such as agricultural purchase or investment in America, and prioritize rare earth approval for the U.S., said Dan Wang, China director at political consultancy Eurasia Group, while Washington could consider relaxing tech curbs on China.

Beijing in early October dramatically expanded its restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals and related technologies, and Trump retaliated with threats of an additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. Bessent blasted China's move as an attempt at weakening the global economy and wanting to ""pull everyone else down with them.""

The Trump administration has also been considering limiting exports of large swaths of products built with American software to China, and reportedly plans to launch a trade investigation into China's failure to uphold the terms of a trade deal signed in Trump's first term.

New York Times reported Thursday that the investigation could be announced as soon as Friday, paving the way for more tariffs on Chinese goods.

Earlier this month, the U.S. president had floated the possibility of scrapping his meeting with Xi amid anger over Beijing's widened export controls on rare earth minerals. But in recent days Trump has softened his rhetoric, touting his ""great relationship"" with Xi, saying he expected the talks to deliver a ""good deal"" on trade.

The president said Wednesday that he has a ""long"" meeting scheduled with Xi during the upcoming trip to South Korea, where he expects to reach a deal with the Chinese leader over soybean purchases and limits on nuclear weapons.

Facing sweeping U.S. tech restrictions in recent years, China has pledged to deepen its self-reliance on technology over the coming five years, the ruling Communist Party said in a new economic blueprint released Thursday.

In the press briefing Friday, Chinese leaders pointed to the complex external challenges, underscoring Beijing's drive to reduce reliance on the U.S. while advancing its own technological ambitions.

While both sides retain significant leverage, Beijing appears ""more willing to walk away from a deal that does not satisfy its objectives,"" said Gabriel Wildau, managing director at advisory firm Teneo, while Trump might want to avoid enforcing the 100% tariff threat.

Despite the recent escalation, the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting will be key to restoring ""a measure of calm to the bilateral relations"" and set the stage for a final negotiating push toward a trade deal in early 2026, Wildau added.

Trump is scheduled to travel to Tokyo on Oct. 27 for a meeting with Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new prime minister, before heading to South Korea.

LONDON ‚Äî European stocks reversed course to close higher on Friday as investors reacted to a delayed U.S. inflation print and a flurry of corporate earnings reports.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 0.2% higher at the end of Friday's session, paring earlier losses, with major bourses and sectors broadly in positive territory. London's FTSE 100 extended gains that saw it close at a record high on Thursday, with the U.K. index ending Friday up 0.7%.

Across the Atlantic, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday said that America's annual inflation rate hit a lower-than-expected 3% in September. U.S. stocks rose following the print, which had grown in importance due to it being the only federal data allowed to be released during the ongoing government shutdown.

With earnings season well underway, investors also monitored a swathe of quarterly reports out of Europe. Saab, ENI, Sanofi, Volvo Group, and Porsche were among the companies updating shareholders on their financial performance.

Swedish defense contractor Saab was among the major movers on Friday, closing the session up 6.1% after the firm upgraded its 2025 sales guidance, riding the tailwinds of Europe's defense boom.

U.K. lender NatWest filed early in the day. Its pre-tax profits reached ¬£2.18 billion ($2.9 billion) in the third quarter, comfortably beating analyst expectations of ¬£1.84 billion.

The London-listed bank's quarterly results showed net interest income came in at ¬£3.3 billion, in line with consensus forecasts, according to LSEG. The lender ‚Äî which raised its full-year guidance for 2025 income to ¬£16.3 billion, up from just over ¬£16 billion ‚Äî saw its shares rise 0.5%.

Elsewhere, the European Union and U.S. announced complementary sanctions packages targeting Russia, in what could be a high point in an otherwise thorny relationship for the two states this year. 

Investors will also be watching tariff news coming from Canada, after an ad featuring former U.S. President Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs, aired by the Ontario provincial government, sparked backlash from President Donald Trump. Trump said on Thursday night that he was terminating all trade negotiations with Canada. 

South Korea's Kospi hit a record high on Friday, amid regional gains after the White House said that U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping were set to hold talks next week.

China on Thursday concluded its ""Fourth Plenum,"" a meeting aimed at setting out the country's development agenda for the next five years. Beijing will focus on domestic consumption, self-reliance in technology as well as the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.

In the U.S. economy and markets ‚Äî generally considered the exemplar of free-market capitalism ‚Äî the government's handprints have started becoming visible, if you squint a little.

Trump, who terminated trade negotiations with Canada over an ad, pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, the White House said Thursday. Zhao was convicted in April 2024 for enabling money laundering at Binance.

The Wall Street Journal reported in August that the Trump family's crypto venture has been helped by ""a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance.""

Even corporate earnings had the mark of the White House.

Intel reported third-quarter revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, helping the stock jump 7.7% in extended trading.

But it's hard to ignore the elephant in the room, that is, the U.S. government's 10% stake in the company, acquired in August. The company's stock has seen a massive surge since that acquisition, with President Donald Trump saying the government has made $30 billion to $40 billion on its stake. The transaction, however, complicates Intel's accounting practices for its income, the company suggested in a press release.

Trump's proclivity for acquiring stakes in U.S. companies and his other dealings that seem to blur the personal with the professional raise the question: are we seeing a four-year U.S. economic plan ‚Äî with a twist ‚Äî unfold?

Trump terminates trade talks with Canada. The U.S. president appeared to take umbrage with an ad, aired by Ontario provincial government, featuring Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Trump also accused Canada of attempting to influence the U.S. Supreme Court's case regarding tariffs.

Trump pardons Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. The move came two months after The Wall Street Journal reported on the Trump family's crypto venture, which appeared to have links with a trading platform ""administered by Binance.""

China softens rhetoric ahead of Trump-Xi meeting. Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Friday said that both countries can ""find the right path for getting along,"" in comments translated by CNBC. The White House said Trump will meet Xi at the APEC summit next Thursday.

U.S. stocks advanced Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, thanks to tech stocks. Asia-Pacific stocks rose Friday. South Korea's Kospi hit another record, while Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed amid data showing the country's core inflation rose in September, as expected.

[PRO] Time to consider dividend stocks, CIO says. As interest rates come down, in accordance with market expectations, such stocks should get a boost, according to Kevin Simpson, founder and chief investment officer at Capital Wealth Planning.

Everyone is waiting for Friday's big inflation report. Here's what to expect

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the consumer price index's monthly all-items reading to increase by 0.4%, the same as a month ago. That would put the 12-month inflation rate at 3.1%, or 0.2 percentage point higher than the August level.

While the actual numbers are expected to land about where they've been in recent months, the dearth of official economic reports, thanks to the government shutdown, means even a slight deviation could cause an outsized impact.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to allow institutional clients to borrow against their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings, according to Bloomberg reports.

The $4 trillion institutional asset manager announced that it will allow clients to use BTC and ETH directly as collateral for loans by the end of 2025.

The program, available globally, will use a third-party custodian to secure the pledged tokens, according to sources familiar with the matter.

This move builds on a June announcement, in which Cryptonews reported that JPMorgan would test crypto collateral loans with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with plans to expand access to other funds after launch.

JPMorgan has already begun integrating crypto into its core lending operations.

In September, Cryptonews reported that Trimont LLC, a commercial real estate loan servicer managing roughly $730 billion in assets, began using JPMorgan's Kinexys Digital Payments network.

The system streamlines payment workflows by identifying incoming payments, verifying amounts, and distributing funds to lenders. Tasks that previously took up to two days can now be completed in minutes.

Earlier this year, JPMorgan began accepting crypto-linked ETFs as collateral. The new program allows clients to pledge the cryptocurrencies themselves rather than ETF shares.

JPMorgan also launched its digital deposit token, ‚ÄúJPMD,‚Äù on Coinbase's Base network following a June 15 trademark application. JPMD is fully backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars and is available to institutional clients only.

By July, JPMorgan had started testing a blockchain-based platform for carbon credits through Kinexys, developed with S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry, and the International Carbon Registry.

A recent regulatory change has also allowed firms like BlackRock to accept investors' Bitcoin and swap it for ETF shares tracking the token.

Aside from BTC and ETH-backed collaterals, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) unveiled an initiative to let stablecoins like USDT and USDC serve as tokenized collateral in derivatives markets.

Acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham announced on September 23 that the agency would ‚Äúwork closely with stakeholders‚Äù on the directive, calling it the ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù to modernize markets by adopting non-cash collateral.

In an exclusive interview with John Glover, Ledn's CIO, Cryptonews asked how the demand for Bitcoin-backed loans has evolved over the past few years, and what key trends or factors influenced this change.

John Glover responded that the most fundamental factor over the past few years has been a major shift in public perception of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate financial instrument.

‚ÄúThe current bull run, coupled with the new administration in the U.S., which is much more pro-crypto than the previous one, and the continued influx of institutional capital and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, have massively legitimized digital assets,‚Äù he said.

As a result, with Bitcoin being the biggest, most recognizable, and most secure crypto, it's natural that demand for BTC-backed loans continues to grow across the board.

He added that institutional investors play a major role in turning Bitcoin-backed loans into a legitimate financial instrument.

Additionally, JPMorgan began exploring lending against Bitcoin in 2022, but the project was later shelved, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the bank's plan is not yet public.

Since then, client demand for cryptocurrency support across Wall Street has spiked as the market has grown and regulations have eased.

Other major financial firms have also been accelerating similar offerings, and regulators' evolving stance has helped clear a path.

Morgan Stanley, State Street, BNY Mellon, and Fidelity have recently expanded their crypto custody, trading, and product lines.

Meanwhile, legislative moves in the U.S., including work on a crypto markets structure bill, have reduced some compliance friction for banks weighing crypto exposure.

Investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase plans to let institutional clients use their bitcoin BTC$110,317.69 and ether ETH$3,885.96 holdings as collateral for loans by year-end, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The tokens pledged under the global program will be safeguarded by a third-party custodian and extends JPMorgan's earlier move to accept crypto-linked ETFs as loan collateral.

This development reflects the rapidly growing integration of digital assets into Wall Street's core lending infrastructure. With Bitcoin hitting record highs this year and regulatory hurdles easing under the current administration, major banks like JPMorgan are shifting from skepticism to actively incorporating crypto into their financial services.

Other leading firms, including Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Fidelity, are also deepening their crypto offerings, launching retail access and custody solutions, the report said.

The accumulation pattern has bolstered institutional participation and enhanced liquidity within Ethereum markets, creating positive momentum for the asset.

A newly established wallet has purchased $32 million in Ethereum through the OKX exchange at an average entry price of $3,824, according to Arkham intelligence data. The acquisition signals sustained institutional interest as corporate entities continue building positions in Ethereum despite mixed sentiment across broader markets.

SharpLink and Bitmine Immersion Technologies disclosed accumulations of 203,826 and 19,271 Ethereum, respectively, last week. These purchases carry values of $792 million and $74.9 million at current pricing levels, with Ethereum trading around $3,882 following a 1.2% daily increase.

Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, suggested the fresh wallet's purchase likely stems from digital asset treasury inflows. The accumulation pattern has bolstered institutional participation and enhanced liquidity within Ethereum markets, creating positive momentum for the asset.

Corporate and whale interest in Ethereum contrasts sharply with exchange-traded fund flows recorded this week. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $335.43 million in weekly inflows as of Wednesday, while Ethereum products experienced net outflows totaling $22.80 million over the identical period, according to SoSoValue tracking.

A Solana whale that acquired tokens four years ago has transferred 515,000 coins valued at approximately $93 million to an exchange over the past four months. On-chain analysis from EmberCN revealed the address maintains holdings of 828,000 Solana worth $150 million despite the substantial distribution activity.

Elkaleh interpreted the Solana selling pressure as indicating waning whale confidence in the asset, potentially driven by scalability concerns or increasing competitive pressure. The movement implies a market preference shift toward Ethereum ecosystem opportunities rather than alternative layer-1 platforms.

A Bitcoin whale that established a 1,107 coin short position on Oct. 22 closed the trade one day later, securing $835,000 in profits. Analytics platform Hyperdash reported this marked the investor's seventh consecutive winning trade, accumulating over $6.6 million in gains throughout the past week alone.

The Bitcoin short closure coincides with technical signals suggesting the leading digital asset has entered an undervalued zone. Elkaleh noted this positioning could indicate a potential market bottom, though broader recovery across digital asset markets would be necessary to confirm a sustained reversal in price trends.

The altcoin market is $800 billion smaller than past cycles would suggest ‚Äî and a shift in retail sentiment may have killed it. 

A new estimate from 10x Research argues that the complex of non-Bitcoin tokens has been starved of capital this cycle, largely because retail investors, especially in South Korea, have turned to crypto-linked equities instead, while Bitcoin boomed on institutional flows.

Despite growing expectations of an imminent altcoin season, industry insiders are pointing to capital flowing back into Bitcoin and corporate cryptocurrency treasuries, raising doubts about the traditional crypto market cycle.

Corporate digital assets treasuries (DATs) have drained about $800 billion worth of retail investor capital from the altcoin market, according to crypto market intelligence company 10x Research.

‚ÄúLiquidity, momentum, and conviction have all migrated elsewhere, leaving the altcoin market eerily quiet,‚Äù 10x Research wrote in a Friday blog post. ‚ÄúOur models show a decisive rotation back into Bitcoin, even as Korean retail traders, once the heart of altcoin speculation, shift their focus to U.S. crypto stocks.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAltcoins have underperformed Bitcoin by roughly $800 billion this cycle ‚Äî a shortfall that would have largely benefited retail investors,‚Äù 10x said, adding that this is leading retail to seek ‚Äúalternative avenues for quick returns.‚Äù

Technical indicators signal crypto capital rotation back into Bitcoin

Despite continued calls for an altcoin season, a key altcoin indicator suggests that investors may be seeking more Bitcoin exposure rather than smaller cryptocurrencies.

The ‚Äútechnical altcoin model‚Äù cited by 10x Research suggests that crypto investments are rotating back to Bitcoin, indicating that the $19 billion crypto market crash has disrupted the momentum previously gained by altcoins.

‚ÄúThe model's pivot back toward Bitcoin came at a critical moment, two weeks before altcoins suffered a sharp sell-off on October 11, 2025,‚Äù 10x said.

Despite rising hopes for an altcoin season, most indicators are signaling the opposite.

CoinMarketCap's altcoin season indicator currently stands at 23, which still signals ‚ÄúBitcoin season‚Äù until the gauge surpasses the 75 level.

In a silver lining to the correction, investors may view the record $19 billion liquidation event as a buying opportunity in a dynamic that may fuel Bitcoin's rise to $200,000 before the end of the year, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph.

Oops, something went wrong

Donald Trump has officially granted a presidential pardon to Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, wiping away his criminal charges related to the Bank Secrecy Act. The news sparked a wave of optimism across the Binance ecosystem, leading to strong accumulation in several altcoins.

Which altcoins are seeing this surge, and how might it affect their prices?

The pardon acts as a political endorsement of crypto, particularly benefiting projects linked to Trump. WLFI's USD1 stablecoin is involved in a $2 billion Abu Dhabi‚ÄìBinance deal, creating revenue streams tied to Binance's growth.

Critics warn that such political ties could blur the line between finance and politics. Still, markets reacted positively. WLFI's price jumped nearly 14% within 24 hours, while daily trading volume exceeded $300 million ‚Äî double its previous average.

The simultaneous rise in price and volume signals renewed accumulation. Data also shows that the number of holders began to recover after a month-long decline.

Charts indicate WLFI's holder count fell from 124,520 to 124,380 over the past week, but the news helped it rebound to 124,450. This small uptick marks an early sign of returning investor confidence after WLFI had dropped nearly 30% since last month.

Aster is a perpetual DEX built on the BNB Chain. YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs) supports the project, and CZ has publicly endorsed Aster on X.

Positive news surrounding CZ has revived bullish sentiment among Aster investors. On-chain data reflects clear accumulation through exchange outflows and price movement.

According to Nansen, ASTER's price rose by more than 12%, while nearly 10 million ASTER tokens were withdrawn from exchanges. Following the news, many investors appear motivated to hold their ASTER long-term.

‚ÄúJust withdrew 50 ASTER again from my profits to my personal wallet for long-term holdings and will keep doing this until it reaches $5‚Äì$10. Is anyone else doing this, or is it just me? I'm extremely bullish on ASTER because of CZ,‚Äù investor AltcoinsGuy said.

On October 23, Aster also launched its Rocket Launch campaign, a liquidity initiative combined with a buyback plan. The campaign, coupled with the pardon news, has boosted investor confidence even further.

4 is a meme token created on the four.meme platform with a market capitalization of roughly $120 million.

The recent ‚ÄúBNB Season‚Äù sentiment has driven investors toward small-cap tokens within the Binance ecosystem for higher returns. The positive news about CZ's pardon has further strengthened confidence among meme investors on four.meme.

Nansen data shows that the top 100 wallets holding 4 increased their balances by 6.86%, while exchange reserves fell by nearly 8% following the pardon announcement. The token's price surged more than 30% in the last 24 hours.

Additionally, 4 has appeared on the Binance Alpha listing, raising speculation that it might soon debut on Binance Spot. Current accumulation by holders could represent a strategic position if a listing does occur.

These three altcoins share direct or indirect connections to the Binance ecosystem and CZ. As October's market remains largely subdued, BNB and its surrounding projects stand out as rare bright spots in the broader crypto landscape.

As the crypto world moves toward regulated, enterprise-grade applications, a new question is rising across boardrooms and blockchains: Can privacy, compliance, and interoperability truly coexist?

For Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of ZKsync, the answer lies in zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. The company's latest breakthrough, the Prividium initiative, could change how institutions adopt blockchain infrastructure altogether.

In a recent conversation with CCN, Gluchowski discussed ZKsync's collaboration with over 30 major global institutions, including Citi, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, and two central banks, to explore how enterprises can operate private yet connected blockchains within Europe's new regulatory environment.

For years, banks and major financial institutions have faced a dilemma.

They could either build private blockchains, which are fully controlled, compliant, and secure but isolated from the broader financial ecosystem, or public blockchains, which offer openness and interoperability at the expense of privacy and data control.

That trade-off, says Gluchowski, may finally be over.

He discussed ZKsync's new whitepaper, the Prividium Initiative, developed in collaboration with more than 30 global institutions, including Citi, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, and two central banks.

The initiative outlines how enterprises can use zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to operate private, permissioned blockchains that remain connected and interoperable with others without compromising compliance.

‚ÄúFor the first time, it's possible to bridge the gap between private and public domains using ZK technology,‚Äù says Gluchowski.

‚ÄúEach institution can run its own chain, fully under its control, yet directly connected to others and secured by cryptography, not by trusted intermediaries.‚Äù

Institutional hesitation toward blockchain adoption has long centered on one issue: how to balance privacy with regulatory transparency.

ZKsync's Prividium model addresses that tension head-on through a combination of granular access controls and zero-knowledge proofs.

‚ÄúInstitutions can define who can see what, down to individual contracts and accounts,‚Äù Gluchowski explains.

‚ÄúRegulators or compliance partners can have view-only access to specific elements of the system, and receive cryptographic proofs confirming rules were followed, without exposing user data.‚Äù

Enterprises can integrate familiar tools like Google Workspace or Okta for authentication, giving them fine-tuned control over visibility rights.

Regulators can then verify that AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance were observed, while only receiving the minimum necessary data.

‚ÄúIt's privacy with accountability,‚Äù says Gluchowski. ‚ÄúInstitutions disclose only what's necessary: no more, no less.‚Äù

Among all the applications discussed in the Prividium report , tokenized bank deposits, or institutional stablecoins, stand out as the most immediate and in-demand.

Large corporations often manage funds across multiple jurisdictions, moving capital between subsidiaries and banks ‚Äî a process that can still take two to five business days.

Prividium's model enables instant settlement by allowing banks to issue tokenized representations of deposits that can circulate within and across enterprise networks.

Here's how it works:

‚ÄúIt's programmable, interoperable cash,‚Äù says Gluchowski. ‚ÄúAnd it works directly with banks, not through third-party stablecoin providers.‚Äù

This model aligns with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which encourages tokenized payment systems while demanding compliance and consumer protection, two areas where ZK-based systems naturally excel.

When asked whether this signals a move toward an ‚Äúinstitutional Ethereum,‚Äù Gluchowski disagrees.

He envisions a future built on connection, not segregation.

‚ÄúEach institution will have its own permissioned chain, hosting tokenized deposits and other assets, but they'll all settle on Ethereum,‚Äù he says.

Imagine a government tax system running on @zksync  Prividium.

Citizens file taxes privately on a permissioned chain, while regulators can selectively verify data when needed ‚Äî all anchored to Ethereum for integrity.

‚ÄúEthereum is the only truly decentralized and resilient settlement layer, a neutral ground where everyone can meet,‚Äù Gluchowski stresses.

Over its ten-year history, Ethereum has recorded zero downtime, which Gluchowski highlights as proof of its reliability as a ‚Äúcredibly neutral‚Äù settlement layer.

He envisions a network of networks: each organization running its own chain, connected through ZK proofs and synchronized by Ethereum's trustless infrastructure.

Zero-knowledge cryptography is often portrayed as complex, but Gluchowski compares its security model to that of aviation or healthcare, multiple fail-safe layers designed to protect critical systems.

‚ÄúZK is a new cryptographic layer that sits on top of traditional enterprise security,‚Äù he explains.

‚ÄúEven if a system is compromised, the proof layer ensures that no invalid transactions can be confirmed.‚Äù

ZKsync calls this ‚Äúincorruptible financial infrastructure,‚Äù an architecture where human errors or security breaches cannot alter the truth recorded on-chain.

All of this runs on the ZK Stack, the same foundation that powers the public ZKsync Era network.

Private deployments simply use a different configuration, keeping data within enterprise systems rather than publishing it to Ethereum.

In September 2025, ZKsync announced Atlas , its most advanced upgrade yet, reaching over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and sub-cent transaction costs.

Atlas isn't just another update, it's @zksync  growing into its final form.

It's the upgrade that makes ZKsync OS modular, smoother for devs, and ready to scale Ethereum like it actually means business.

Before Atlas, building a ZK chain felt like wiring your own console from‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/wK3wGELCTi 

‚Äî chobby (@idontmintrugs) October 23, 2025 



‚ÄúAtlas brings unprecedented performance,‚Äù says Gluchowski.

‚ÄúWe've seen real-world tests hitting 15,000,20,000 TPS, at around $0.001 per stablecoin transfer. It's not just theoretical anymore, it's production-ready.‚Äù

Gluchowski's stance on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is pragmatic: he says zero-knowledge technology could easily power privacy-preserving CBDCs. Still, private stablecoins are likely to remain more agile and competitive.

‚ÄúIn many ways, stablecoins already behave like CBDCs,‚Äù he explains.

‚ÄúThey're just more efficient and innovation happens faster in the private sector.‚Äù

He points out that the U.S. has publicly distanced itself from direct CBDC issuance. It preferred to let private entities develop regulated digital currencies instead.

‚ÄúPrivate money will always have a technological edge,‚Äù Gluchowski says. ‚ÄúAnd networks like Prividium give businesses the architecture to use it safely and compliantly.‚Äù

At its core, Gluchowski believes ZKsync's mission and Prividium's architecture  represent a new kind of financial trust: one verified by mathematics, not intermediaries.

‚ÄúThe future isn't about choosing between privacy and compliance,‚Äù he says.

‚ÄúIt's about building systems that deliver both and proving it cryptographically.‚Äù

As MiCA comes into full effect, ZKsync's approach may offer a blueprint for how Europe's institutional blockchain ecosystem evolves. Not by abandoning decentralization, but by reengineering it for the enterprise era.

ZKsync's Prividium initiative marks more than a technological milestone. It represents a shift in how institutions think about trust, compliance, and connectivity in the blockchain era.

By merging zero-knowledge cryptography with enterprise-grade infrastructure, ZKsync is proving that privacy and regulation no longer need to exist on opposite ends of innovation.

As Europe's MiCA framework reshapes how financial institutions interact with digital assets, projects like Prividium offer a realistic path forward. Banks, regulators, and developers can participate in the same network without sacrificing control, transparency, or scalability.

If the past decade of crypto was about building open systems, the next one will be about bridging them.

‚ÄúThe foundation of a truly incorruptible financial infrastructure lies in that bridge, which is secured by mathematics, powered by Ethereum, and guided by zero-knowledge proofs,‚Äù Gluchowski concludes.

What is the Prividium?


The Prividium is a research and development project led by ZKsync in collaboration with over 30 global institutions, including major banks, payment providers, and central banks. It explores how enterprises can use zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to run private blockchains that are still interoperable and compliant with public networks like Ethereum.




Why is Prividium important for financial institutions?


Until now, banks and corporations faced a trade-off: build private blockchains that are secure but isolated, or use public blockchains that are open but harder to regulate. Prividium bridges this gap by allowing institutions to maintain privacy, meet compliance standards, and still connect with the broader blockchain ecosystem.




How does ZKsync's technology enable privacy and compliance at the same time?


ZKsync uses zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic method that allows systems to prove that a transaction or rule is valid without revealing any sensitive data. Enterprises can define who can see what, give regulators view-only access, and prove compliance (like AML or KYC) without exposing confidential information.




How does Prividium relate to Ethereum?


Each institution using Prividium runs its own permissioned blockchain, but all networks are anchored to Ethereum, the most decentralized and resilient blockchain to date. Ethereum acts as the neutral settlement layer, synchronizing data and ensuring transparency without compromising institutional privacy.

ALEC Communications and Technology Senior Task Force Director Jake Morabito and Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development Task Force Director Alan Jernigan were recently invited to testify before the Kansas State Legislature Special Committee on Commerce regarding state cryptocurrency considerations.

Additional coverage was highlighted in a local news piece by WIBW News, covering highlights from their testimonies.

You can read both of their testimonies below and watch the recording here.

Chairman Tarwater, Vice Chair Alley, and Members of the Special Committee:

I am Alan Jernigan, Director of the Commerce, Insurance, and Economic Development Task Force at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today and share ALEC's nonpartisan research and analysis on digital assets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.

ALEC is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization headquartered in Virginia, made up of state legislators from across the country. Our mission is to promote the principles of limited government, free markets, and federalism‚Äîcore values that strengthen both states and their citizens. In support of your state's efforts, I'll be highlighting two key ALEC model policies developed by ALEC's Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development (CIED) Task Force. These models can help Kansas build a forward-looking and resilient foundation for its digital economy.

The ALEC CIED Task Force is comprised of state legislators and policy experts that believe that overregulation of financial tools harms consumers and businesses alike. They believe these financial tools can open the doors of economic opportunity and should prioritize protecting consumer privacy.

Cryptocurrency is continuing its rise in our modern-day society. Bitcoin now has a market cap exceeding $2 trillion, higher than companies such as Meta and Tesla. You can use the currency in a similar manner to other purchasing options at retailers such as Home Depot and Whole Foods. It allows anyone in the world with internet connection to store and exchange value. Cryptocurrency is here to stay, and it has left federal and state governments to implement oversight.

With any emerging technology, there are always concerns about individuals that look to capitalize on these developing landscapes for their own nefarious intentions. There are currently many enforcement measures and laws that provide sound protection, but it is key for states to lead on the constantly changing landscape without stifling innovation.

As mentioned in previous presentations, many of the topics discussed today are issues being addressed at the federal level. This gives states like Kansas, an opportunity to become a national example of principled policy solutions that promotes limited government and free market solutions.

A CBDC, or a central bank digital currency, is not the same as other cryptocurrency which are decentralized forms of currency that are not issued by the government. A CBDC is a purely digital form of money that is issued, controlled, regulated by a central bank (the Federal Reserve in the case of the United States). It would be a direct liability of the Federal Reserve.

CBDCs would allow the Federal Reserve to increase surveillance on financial transactions and give the government unprecedented insight and control over the finances of Americans. In 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order which called for the federal government to explore and research the potential use of a central bank digital currency. President Trump has since signed an executive order directing federal agencies to terminate CBDC initiatives. There is no guarantee that future administrations will hold the same stance.

Last year, the U.S. House passed the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which would have prohibited the Federal Reserve from directly or indirectly issuing a CBDC in the United States. At least nine states have followed Congress' lead and passed reforms that prohibit CBDCs. There is an opportunity for additional states like Kansas to further protect their citizens financial privacy.

The ALEC Reject CBDCs and Protect Financial Privacy Act, one of the ALEC Essential Policy Solutions for 2025, opposes adopting and developing a CBDC and resolves that state agencies will not accept or require CBDC payments. This model policy protects the current banking and financial system, as well as the rights and liberties of individuals and businesses. Currently, private banks are regulated by market competition and government regulation. However, if we move towards a singular CBDC, this competition would dissipate into the hands of a singular institution.

The next model policy that I would like to discuss was a reform passed in Kansas earlier this year. ALEC named Representative Patrick Penn and Senator Stephen Owens as ALEC Policy Champions for their success in leading legislation that reduces barriers to innovation by bringing a universal regulatory sandbox program to Kansas. The ALEC Policy Champion award recognizes state legislators that advance policy solutions built on the pillars of free markets, limited government, and federalism in their states. This reform makes it easier for innovators and entrepreneurs to test products faster than current regulations allow, while protecting public health and safety.

Programs, like those enabled by the Kansas reform, have already seen success around the country. Arizona and Hawaii, for example, have successfully implemented regulatory sandboxes in the fintech space. In 2020, Hawaii created a regulatory sandbox known as the Digital Currency Innovation Lab. It was created to explore regulations and potential economic opportunities created by cryptocurrency. Following the conclusion of the sandbox in 2024, several recommendations ensured that focus on deregulation that help make Hawaii a more attractive destination for businesses.

Innovation leads to greater liberties and economic mobility and creates brand new technologies, some of which fall into heavily regulated fields. To ensure that innovation can occur, benefiting society as a whole, another of the ALEC Essential Policy Solutions for 2025, the ALEC Universal Regulatory Sandbox Act, like Kansas' reform, establishes the framework for innovators, under the observation of regulators, to launch and trial innovative products, services, and models while temporarily bypassing laws or regulations that may conflict with the technology. This primes Kansas to be a leader in emerging technologies and industries for years to come.

Just recently, the Federal Government has looked to follow states like Kansas lead, as Sen. Ted Cruz introduced the SANDBOX Act, which would create a federal regulatory sandbox program.

Outside of the ALEC policy solutions that I have shared, there is another policy idea moving in the states that the Committee should be aware of. One idea introduced in several states enabled state investments into cryptocurrency through cryptocurrency reserves. New Hampshire, for example, passed a first in the nation bill that enables the Treasurer to invest up to 5% of the state's total funds into cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $500 million. Currently, only Bitcoin meets this threshold, but it opens the door to other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, which is not far behind.

New industries and opportunities have placed Kansas in a unique position to continue to lead on innovation. With strong reforms already in place, the state is well positioned to continue to attract businesses and protect consumers as technology and products continue to develop. By prioritizing consumer protection and a light-touch regulatory approach, as well as following the Jeffersonian principles of limited government, free markets, and federalism, Kansas can serve as a nationwide example of sound, cryptocurrency reforms. Thank you for the opportunity to speak in front of the Committee this morning, and I look forward to answering your questions.

Respectfully submitted,

Alan Jernigan

Director, Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development Task Force

American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)

 

Chairman Tarwater, Vice Chair Alley, and Members of the Special Committee:

My name is Jake Morabito, and I serve as Senior Director of the Communications and Technology Task Force‚Äîas well as the Energy, Environment, and Agriculture Task Force‚Äîat the American Legislative Exchange Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak before your committee today to share more about ALEC's nonpartisan research and analysis, as well as the efforts of our members across all 50 states on digital assets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency policy. I hope you find this testimony valuable as Kansas considers its own approach in this area.

Members of ALEC's Communications and Technology Task Force include legislative leaders and policy experts who believe in the proven light-touch regulatory approach that solidified the United States as the clear global leader in emerging technology. ALEC legislators lead the charge with pragmatic policies that grow the digital economy, increase economic opportunity for all, and ensure the next wave of tech innovation happens here on American shores‚Äînot overseas in Europe, Asia, or elsewhere.

ALEC members have played a critical role in shaping the governance of emerging technology and telecommunications policy, and the same has held true for digital assets, as states increasingly consider how to separate signal from the noise in the cryptocurrency community. In recent years, inaction at the federal level in Congress, combined with a ping-pong of federal rulemaking depending on the Administration, has made it difficult for innovators and businesses to confidently adopt these tools. While President Trump and the current leadership at agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission may have a more optimistic stance about the role of Bitcoin and digital assets in our nation's financial ecosystem, there is no guarantee that a subsequent Administration will not upend the table once again and enact a regime of burdensome regulation.

Therefore, states like Kansas are in a unique position to provide that regulatory clarity within your jurisdiction on the pressing tech policy and regulatory questions of our time, whether it's navigating policy questions surrounding artificial intelligence and its use across the economy and government, to digital assets and whether they should be used in state investment funds or for everyday consumer transactions.

My colleague mentioned several examples of market-oriented, light-touch policy solutions to make Kansas a leader in the burgeoning digital assets ecosystem. Perhaps equally as important is what not to do. Some states like New York are pursuing a different path by heavily regulating the technology, proposing new and discriminatory taxes, or even banning crypto mining operations in certain situations.

As the digital landscape evolves and the barrier to entry for digital assets and cryptocurrency continues to fall, states should balance the need to protect consumers from emerging threats, primarily by modernizing and updating existing laws, not creating more regulatory burdens. Instead of jumping the gun with punitive regulations like New York has done, a better approach is to provide some measure of certainty to the digital asset industry and promote responsible adoption.

And that can be accomplished with ALEC's model Smart Cryptocurrency Rules Act, which lays the groundwork to foster digital asset innovation at the state level. ALEC's Smart Cryptocurrency Rules Act has five main components.

First, our model policy establishes key definitions in state code for terms such as ‚Äúdigital assets,‚Äù ‚Äúcryptocurrency,‚Äù ‚Äúvirtual currency,‚Äù and ‚Äúmining.‚Äù Harmonizing these definitions across state law early will provide much-needed regulatory clarity for individuals and businesses, while some of these questions remain unresolved at the federal level. The model policy makes clear that for the purposes of state law and regulation, virtual currencies and digital assets are considered to be personal digital property and should therefore follow the rules established by your state's Property Code.

Next, to streamline the regulatory process and ease the burden on innovators in the digital assets space, our model policy provides for mutual recognition of money transmitter licenses across states for virtual currency exchanges, brokers, and other digital asset-related companies. These firms are typically required to apply for money transmitter licenses across the 50 states to offer their services. Instead of mandating that emerging crypto and digital asset businesses submit to a duplicative licensure regime before they can even open their doors, our model offers a more permissive approach that allows businesses who already have an active money transmitter license from any state to begin services in this state, provided that sufficient proof is provided and accepted as a reciprocal license within 30 days.

Finally, the ALEC model expressly preempts all municipal or county-level regulations and restrictions relating to digital assets, and declares that public utilities should not penalize, discriminate, or differentiate between crypto mining and other commercial or industrial zoned uses of electricity.

Turning to another example of how states can encourage innovation in emerging technology, states are increasingly considering legislation that recognizes an inherent ‚ÄúRight to Compute‚Äù either in statute or by constitutional amendment. First signed into law in Montana earlier this year, and as the subject of ongoing debate in New Hampshire, ALEC's model Right to Compute recognizes the fundamental right of your state's citizens to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes. Any government restriction on the lawful use of technology must be narrowly tailored and fulfill a compelling government interest. Whether it is novel artificial intelligence tools, digital assets, or a future technological innovation we haven't even dreamed of yet, the Right to Compute puts the onus on government to prove why new regulations limiting otherwise lawful use of technology are necessary.

However, I encourage you not to misinterpret the Right to Compute as a blank check for technology companies or bad actors to get away with harmful or illegal conduct. ALEC's model Right to Compute clarifies that a compelling government interest includes legislative and regulatory efforts to combat scams and fraud; protecting adults and minors from harm caused by deceptive deepfakes and other synthetic content; monitoring the risk management practices in place at your state's critical infrastructure facilities; and addressing common law nuisances created by physical data center infrastructure.

Some states, like Arkansas, Montana, and Oklahoma, have taken this concept a step further by also considering distinct ‚ÄúRight to Mine‚Äù legislation, which would establish key protections in state law for Bitcoin and digital asset holders. Examples of the protections provided in such laws are a guarantee of the right to self-custody, preventing discriminatory taxes on the use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies for transactions, and creating a regulatory environment that would streamline adoption for more mainstream uses of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions. ALEC does not yet have model legislation on Right to Mine, but many liberty-minded policymakers and stakeholders are recognizing the need to restrain government overreach at home as nations like China pioneer the use central bank digital currencies for invasive citizen surveillance and as a tool to tightly control access to the financial system.

Consumer protection is another critical element of this conversation. I, too, am concerned at the prospect of bad actors leveraging cryptocurrency to scam Americans, perpetuate fraud, commit financial crimes, or otherwise engage in illegal conduct. Especially in the context of artificial intelligence legislation, I have observed that many states are pursuing new regulations on technology with the goal of preventing bias and discrimination in outcomes. State lawmakers may be operating in good faith when proposing such legislation, but these frameworks would often create an immense regulatory burden for your state's businesses, schools, hospitals, and more by increasing compliance costs and requiring frequent ‚Äúrisk assessments‚Äù to prove technology is not being used to discriminate.

In many cases, the robust body of federal and state consumer protection, anti-discrimination, and civil rights laws already have the enforcement mechanisms and regulatory framework to deal with emerging challenges‚Äîit is simply a matter of adapting the existing framework.

If there are any genuine gaps or loopholes in the law that could be exploited, it could be appropriate to pursue targeted legislation to address those concerns, similar to how nearly three-quarters of the states at this point have adopted legislation to crack down on the risk of AI CSAM and the distribution of non-consensual intimate images. Law enforcement will also need to get up to speed on the ins and outs of this industry to help distinguish the legitimate actors and use cases from the fraudulent ones.

With this in mind, ALEC recently approved new model legislation that could help Kansas and other states tackle consumer protection and anti-discrimination concerns head-on without limiting innovation or ballooning the role of government. This model legislation, which we call the Technology-Neutral Anti-Discrimination Clarification Act, would make a surgical edit clarifying in your state's existing civil rights statutes that illegal conduct is still illegal, no matter which technology is used‚Äîincluding digital assets and cryptocurrency. ALEC's model policy has gained traction in Colorado, where it is being considered by the State Senate and the Governor as a solution to fix its problematic AI law before it is scheduled to take effect in 2026.

In closing, Kansas has already done phenomenal work promoting responsible entrepreneurship and innovation in your state. This committee has the opportunity to build on that momentum by becoming a leader in the burgeoning digital assets and AI marketplace. Following the proven, light-touch, harms-based approach to regulation is the key to securing another century of American economic might. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak this morning, and I welcome any questions.

Key Takeaways

Meteora is a liquidity protocol built on Solana to solve critical issues of capital inefficiency and fragmentation plaguing DeFi.

Its goal is utilizing a suite of innovative mechanisms, ensuring liquidity is concentrated precisely where it is needed.

Meteora's core mission is to provide the infrastructure for deep, sustainable, and composable capital flows across all dApps for the Solana ecosystem.

The platform also introduces mechanisms to ensure fair token launches and protect communities from market manipulation.

Meteora stands as a pioneering liquidity infrastructure, purpose-built on the Solana blockchain to maximize capital efficiency and sustainability in decentralized finance.

 It transforms the static, passive nature of traditional automated market makers (AMMs) into a dynamic, responsive system. 

Meteora is a comprehensive DEX and liquidity protocol that is foundational to the Solana DeFi ecosystem. It functions as a liquidity layer, not just a simple swap interface, powering transactions for other major protocols, such as Jupiter Swap. The protocol's ultimate vision is to create a secure, highly efficient, and composable liquidity environment.

Source: Meteora

Meteora's key positioning is centered on leveraging Solana's high-throughput and low-cost environment to introduce liquidity primitives previously considered too complex or gas-intensive for other chains. Its focus is not merely on accumulating Total Value Locked (TVL) but on achieving capital efficiency, which is the ability to process massive trading volume with the least amount of capital.

Its success is measured by its rapid integration and adoption across the Solana landscape, establishing itself as a top-tier DEX by volume and TVL.

Source: Defillama

Meteora achieves its unprecedented liquidity efficiency and yield optimization through a sophisticated, multi-pronged architecture that continuously manages capital across two primary innovative engines: the DLMM for active trading and the Dynamic Vaults for idle capital. These two systems work in tandem to ensure that liquidity providers' assets are always deployed in the most profitable and efficient manner possible.

The DLMM is Meteora's flagship technology and a major evolution in the Automated Market Maker (AMM) landscape. It draws inspiration from concentrated liquidity models (like Uniswap V3) but introduces a critical architectural innovation: zero-slippage price bins and dynamic fees.

Unlike traditional AMMs, where liquidity is spread evenly (Constant Product AMM) or across a single continuous range (Concentrated Liquidity AMM), the DLMM organizes liquidity into discrete, individual ‚Äúprice bins‚Äù.

To protect LPs from Impermanent Loss during volatile market conditions, the DLMM employs a dynamic fee structure.

The DLMM allows LPs to implement various customized strategies, going beyond the rigid 50/50 token ratios of older AMMs.

Source: Meteora

Meteora's second core innovation is the Dynamic Vault, an engine designed to utilize any capital that is idle (i.e., not currently being used in an active trade) within the system. This feature is what truly creates a dual-yield opportunity for LPs.

Beyond the DLMM, Meteora maintains a robust suite of tools that form its comprehensive liquidity architecture, including the Dynamic AMM (DAMM) and its launch protection mechanism, Alpha Vaults.

Source: Meteora

Meteora's infrastructure is a testament to the fact that high-performance DeFi requires more than just smart contracts; it demands a full-stack commitment to a high-speed base layer and novel token distribution mechanics.

Meteora leverages its entire technical stack on the Solana blockchain, which is a strategic choice.

A key architectural component is the Liquidity Distributor, a mechanism that reconfigures how tokens are distributed to align user incentives with the long-term health of the protocol.

Meteora's current architecture is rooted in a fundamental reset of its history, known as the ‚ÄúPhoenix Rising Plan‚Äù.

Meteora's technology addresses several of the most persistent and painful inefficiencies in the decentralized exchange and yield generation landscape.

Fragmented liquidity often characterizes traditional DeFi, where similar assets spread across dozens of different pools, leading to poor execution prices.

For new projects, bootstrapping liquidity is a major challenge that often results in unfair launches or excessive reliance on venture capital.

The dilemma for LPs has always been the trade-off between earning swap fees (high risk, high return) and mitigating impermanent loss (IL).

MET is the native utility and governance token of the Meteora protocol with the 1,000,000,000 tokens in total supply.

MET serves three primary functions:

The token launch strategy, known as a Liquidity Generation Event, came with a high initial circulating supply to reduce the high FDV common in low-float projects. Below is Meteora's token distribution:

Source: Meteora

The Liquidity Distributor distributed approximately 10% of the circulating supply. This mechanism distributed tokens as LP positions, which automatically earn trading fees, thereby coupling the token distribution with the necessity of providing and sustaining liquidity.

Meteora launched in 2023 following the December 2022 announcement of a rebrand from its original entity, Mercurial Finance. The core team demonstrated resilience by not selling a single token during the challenging period post-FTX collapse. The transition was a strategic necessity to create a ‚Äúclean, unambiguous token setup‚Äù and to distance the project from the uncertainties and association with the defunct exchange.

While Meteora's founding team has maintained a lower public profile compared to some other mega-projects, their focus has been on continuous product delivery, building battle-tested products like the dynamic vaults/AMM, and innovating on foundational DeFi primitives. The team's emphasis on community-driven growth and a non-VC-centric model reflects in their token distribution.

Is Meteora an EVM-Compatible Chain?

No, Meteora is a liquidity protocol built on the Solana blockchain, which uses the Rust programming language and its own virtual machine, the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). It is not EVM-compatible like Ethereum or Monad.

How Do Dynamic Vaults Earn Dual-Yield?

Dynamic Vaults earn dual-yield by combining two revenue streams: swap fees from trading activity and lending yield from automatically and continuously rebalancing idle assets across various high-yielding Solana lending protocols every few minutes.

What Was Meteora Before the Rebrand?

Meteora was formerly known as Mercurial Finance. The rebrand was part of the ‚ÄúPhoenix Rising Plan‚Äù to reset its tokenomics and move beyond the market uncertainties associated with the collapse of the FTX exchange.

How Does Meteora's Liquidity Distributor Mechanism Prevent Immediate Sell Pressure?

Instead of a traditional airdrop of liquid tokens, the Liquidity Distributor gives recipients a non-transferable Liquidity Position NFT. These NFTs are active and immediately earn trading fees, which effectively turns airdrop recipients into long-term liquidity providers who sell their initial exposure gradually through collected yield rather than a large immediate token dump.

Cambria is launching its Islands NFT collection on Ethereum, offering governance, sub-island hosting, and in-game revenue opportunities. Minting starts October 23 on OpenSea.

By Eliza Crichton-Stuart

Updated October 24th 2025

Cambria, the risk-to-earn MMO, is expanding its in-game ecosystem with the launch of a new NFT collection called Cambria Islands. Scheduled for minting on Thursday, October 23, the collection will be available on OpenSea and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. The mint price is set at 0.1 ETH per NFT, and the sale will proceed in several phases, starting with a Treasury allocation, followed by priority whitelist, first-come-first-served whitelist, and concluding with a public mint. To prevent early monopolization, each wallet is limited to holding 333 NFTs.

The collection consists of 3333 unique Islands that give holders a form of territorial governance within the Cambria universe. These NFTs are designed not just as collectibles but as interactive components that directly tie into the game's economy and mechanics. Island owners will be able to host sub-islands called Islets, which other players can rent or purchase, generating in-game revenue.

Each Cambria Island NFT represents a persistent, player-controlled dominion in the Archipelagos off the coast of New Cambria. These territories are the only locations where major in-game infrastructure can be built, including trade docks, dungeons, administrative hubs, and capital settlements. The NFT metadata determines the Island's size class, biome, productivity, and land seed, which affects procedural map generation and layout.

Island owners are expected to actively manage their domains, balancing taxation and infrastructure upgrades to attract and retain settlers. Sub-islands allow other players to participate in the economy, paying fees that flow into the Island treasury. Owners can then reinvest in infrastructure, distribute rewards, or expand their influence within the game. Governance decisions, such as tax rates and resource allocation, are central to maintaining a thriving community.

Cambria Islands NFTs are connected to multiple game modes, including Archipelagos, Gold Rush, and Duel Arena. In Archipelagos, Islands generate resources that are consumed in supply activities, which in turn affect rewards in ETH, NFTs, and in-game currency. The yield of an Island is tied to overall player activity, meaning that gameplay in other modes indirectly affects the economic potential of each NFT.

The system also includes a Royal Audit mechanism, which triggers when an Island is sold or transferred. This process may result in partial degradation or loss of certain infrastructure elements, reflecting the risks associated with political transitions. This design encourages long-term engagement and careful management rather than short-term speculation.

The collection includes five Island classes, each with varying influence and infrastructure potential. These range from Crown Dominion, the rarest class with 25 NFTs, to Cove, which makes up the largest portion of 2158 NFTs. Higher-class Islands can support more structures, accommodate more Islets, and hold greater sway in governance and in-game economic activity.

Other traits, such as land seed, biome, and port affiliation, will be revealed after minting and help differentiate Islands in both strategic and visual aspects. Future plans may include bridging these NFTs from Ethereum to Ronin, expanding their utility within the broader Cambria universe.

Minting begins with the Treasury phase at 2:00 PM UTC, followed by priority whitelist access at 3:00 PM UTC, FCFS whitelist at 4:00 PM UTC, and a one-hour public mint at 5:00 PM UTC. Prior to reveal, buyers receive a placeholder ‚ÄúWrit of Dominion‚Äù NFT. The final Island assignment, including location and metadata traits, will be disclosed after this phase. Participants will need an Ethereum wallet connected to OpenSea and must cover the mint price plus gas fees. Whitelisted users receive early access, while public participants can mint within inventory limits.

What is the Cambria Islands NFT collection?Cambria Islands is a set of 3333 NFTs on Ethereum that give players ownership over in-game territories called Islands. Each Island allows players to host sub-islands, manage infrastructure, and earn revenue through in-game taxes.

When is the minting date for Cambria Islands?Minting begins on Thursday, October 23, 2025, with multiple phases including Treasury allocation, priority whitelist, FCFS whitelist, and a public mint.

How much does each Island NFT cost?Each NFT is priced at 0.1 ETH, plus gas fees for the Ethereum network.

What gameplay features are tied to Islands?Island NFTs integrate with Cambria modes such as Archipelagos, Gold Rush, and Duel Arena. Owners can manage infrastructure, collect taxes, host sub-islands, and influence economic outputs.

Can Island NFTs be transferred or sold?Yes, Island NFTs can be transferred or sold. Transfers trigger a Royal Audit, which may result in partial degradation of facilities to reflect governance risk.

Are there different types of Islands?Yes, the collection is divided into five classes: Crown Dominion, Dominion, Admiralty, Harbor, and Cove. Each class has different infrastructure capacity, influence, and economic potential.

Do Island NFTs provide long-term benefits?Yes, Islands provide ongoing utility through revenue from player activity, governance influence, and priority participation in token distributions.

Which platform hosts the mint?The mint is hosted on OpenSea and is executed on the Ethereum blockchain.

With NFTs becoming more common in the gaming world, it seems we have to now think about privacy and security issues. Yes, NFTs can let you own in-game assets and easily move them around, but they come with baggage that can expose a user's data and identity. This article will dig into what could go wrong with NFT identities and how they can leak private information, along with the difficulties with minimizing data.

NFTs have often been praised for providing proof of ownership for digital items. But here's the catch: the blockchains they exist on can make certain private data public. While the NFT content can be encrypted, the metadata‚Äîlike the time stamps of transactions and wallet addresses‚Äîare pretty much out there for everyone to see. This can unintentionally share the player's activities and habits, potentially even linking their virtual self to their real life.

What's more is that once a player is linked to an NFT, it's almost impossible to erase or change their link. This raises a lot of questions about how that would align with laws like GDPR. Players might find they can't control their personal info anymore, and that could have lasting effects on their privacy.

Developers can step up by using sophisticated cryptographic techniques, like zero-knowledge proofs. These allow for verification without exposing the actual data. But let's be real‚Äîthese methods are complex and still not mainstream in gaming. Developers should focus on privacy and make it clear to players how their data is handled.

NFTs also come with their own data security risks that can threaten player identities and their assets. It's crucial to recognize these dangers for both developers and gamers in the decentralized gaming scene.

NFT ownership hinges on private keys. If a player loses their key or it falls into the wrong hands‚Äîthanks to phishing, malware, or just bad key management‚Äîtheir identity and assets can be lost for good. Unlike traditional gaming accounts, there's no one to go to for help, making private key management essential for NFT safety.

NFTs depend on smart contracts, which can have bugs or security issues. Any exploits in these contracts can lead to unauthorized access, identity theft, or even asset loss. High-profile hacks in crypto have shown the real-world fallout from these vulnerabilities. Developers need to audit their contracts and have solid security measures to protect user data and assets.

Many NFT platforms are not fully decentralized. Centralized marketplaces or custodial wallets can become targets for hackers. A breach there can expose a lot of user data and assets. Players should be wary of using centralized services and consider decentralized options.

Phishing and social engineering tactics are rife in the crypto world, and players are prime targets. To reduce the risk, education on common scams and good online security practices are vital. Things like two-factor authentication and hardware wallets can help keep NFTs safe.

With all this NFT stuff in gaming, developers have to navigate some tricky regulations. Finding the balance between decentralization and compliance is key for the health of gaming ecosystems.

The introduction of tradable tokens and NFTs means games must adhere to securities laws, AML, and KYC rules. Ignoring compliance can result in regulatory crackdowns, loss of player confidence, and missed chances for investment. Developers need to build compliance into the foundation of their games from the start.

Developers should proactively engage with regulators. They must keep up with changing regulations and work with policymakers to create frameworks that encourage innovation while also protecting users. Transparency and compliance can help reconcile decentralization with regulatory requirements.

To get a wider audience, decentralized gaming platforms must ensure smooth experiences for those who aren't familiar with crypto.

User-focused design can make decentralized gaming platforms easier to use. Intuitive navigation, clear onboarding, and familiar visuals can help non-crypto users adjust. Including progress indicators can simplify complex blockchain tasks, making them less daunting.

Educating players about blockchain and its advantages can boost their confidence and engagement. Developers should offer resources and support to help users learn how to navigate decentralized platforms, manage assets, and protect privacy.

Using community feedback to guide design can result in experiences that are easier for players to use. Developers should take input from players to identify issues and areas for improvement, ensuring the platform meets user needs.

NFTs in gaming open up possibilities, but they also pose serious privacy and security risks. By anticipating these issues and putting up strong protections, developers and players can find their way through the decentralized gaming world. As the landscape evolves, user experience and regulatory compliance will be critical for building trust and ensuring a sustainable future in Web3 gaming.

Solana (SOL) is trading around $185, hovering just above a key support band between $178‚Äì$182, even as DeFi protocols and NFT markets powered by the network pick up steam. With volume surging and institutional interest growing, analysts are increasingly eyeing SOL's next move. Meanwhile, rising demand for practical crypto infrastructure has sparked attention on projects such as Remittix, which offers a crypto-to-fiat payment bridge and is priced at $0.1166, hinting at a new layer of utility-first crypto.

Solana's resilience is capturing attention again as the Solana price consolidates between $180 and $195, respecting its mid-term uptrend. Buyers have stepped in at every minor dip since early October. They have defended the $178‚Äì$182 band that serves as the base of a larger accumulation zone. A confirmed daily close over $195 would then open the next leg up to $210-$220 and analysts have already charted longer-term targets at $350.

Recent on-chain data reinforces the bullish narrative. Solana inflows of stablecoins have increased by more than 37% in Q3 with DEX trade volumes increasing by 7%. Meanwhile, NFT marketplace volume jumped 45 % in Q3. 

Institutional interest is following suit. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission recently approved ChinaAMC's Solana ETF, listed on the HKEX under ticker 3460. This listing allows trading in HKD, CNY, and USD, making Solana the first non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum token to achieve ETF status in Asia. Market observers say this could pave the way for U.S. equivalents once SEC backlogs clear, potentially flooding billions in fresh liquidity into the asset.

On-chain signals remain supportive. Stablecoin inflows on Solana grew by over 37 % in Q3, and DEX trading volumes rose 7 %. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD hint at bullish divergence on the daily chart. This suggests that buyers are quietly regaining control.

Still, the market remains at a pivotal point. Failure to reclaim $195 could invite a retest of $178, while a decisive breakout above that ceiling might catalyze the much-anticipated move toward $250‚Äì$300 in Q4. Traders continue to monitor volume surges as the likely trigger for confirmation.

While Solana fuels DeFi and NFT momentum, Remittix (RTX) is tackling another trillion-dollar opportunity: global remittances. Priced at $0.1166, Remittix offers users the ability to convert over 100 cryptocurrencies into fiat instantly, depositing funds directly into bank accounts worldwide. 

Through its PayFi off-ramp system, transactions settle in under 30 minutes. Businesses can integrate the Remittix Pay API to accept crypto payments and receive fiat settlements seamlessly. This provides them with exposure to the crypto economy without volatility risks. 

To engage its growing user base, Remittix launched an attractive referral program, giving participants 15 % USDT rewards on every referral. With over 30,000 investors and growing momentum, RTX continues to attract those seeking crypto with tangible utility rather than speculation.

The Information Commissioner's Office (‚ÄúICO‚Äù) has imposed a ¬£14 million fine on Capita for infringements of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (‚ÄúUK GDPR‚Äù) relating to a cyber security incident suffered by Capita in 2023.

In March 2023, Capita, a provider of professional services including pensions administration services, suffered a cyber security incident. An unauthorised person or persons (‚Äúthreat actor‚Äù) gained access to Capita's systems and removed data relating to over 6.6 million individuals, including data held by over 300 pension schemes. The threat actor subsequently deployed ransomware onto Capita's systems and reset all user passwords, preventing Capita staff from accessing their systems and network.

As of September 2025, the ICO had received 93 complaints relating to the incident. High Court proceedings have also been brought against Capita on behalf of 3,973 claimants, although no amount of damages has been specified to date (see here).

Following its investigation into the incident, the ICO concluded that Capita had breached its obligations under Article 32 of the UK GDPR to process personal data in a manner that ensures the security of that data and to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to respond effectively to the incident. In particular, Capita had:

Initially, the ICO proposed a fine of ¬£45 million. However, having considered representations from Capita, the ICO and Capita agreed a voluntary settlement under which Capita will pay a fine of ¬£14 million and waive its right to appeal that fine.

In light of the comments and statements from the ICO, trustees of pension schemes in the UK may wish to consider:

In considering the above, trustees will need to discuss and assess what arrangements they currently have in place with their scheme administrators and take advice as appropriate. They may also wish to leverage the technical expertise and resources of the scheme's employer(s), including participating in trainings or demonstrations.

When determining the level of fine to impose, the ICO took into account a number of mitigating factors which served to reduce the fine, including:

These give an indication of the types of action that trustees or administrators can take in the event of a cyber incident to mitigate impacts and demonstrate a robust incident response protocol to a regulator.

The Capita data breach has highlighted the importance for pension scheme trustees and administrators to ensure their data protection and information security arrangements are robust, both internally and with third-party suppliers.

On 20 October 2025, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued a statement outlining recent progress in its ongoing work to improve data protection standards across the UK public sector.

Background

The update follows a period of increased engagement with government departments, particularly in the wake of the Ministry of Defence data breach that exposed sensitive information relating to Afghan citizens back in July 2025. Information Commissioner John Edwards noted that ‚Äúfurther progress was a key action my office undertook‚Äù in response to the incident. This included writing to the Cabinet Office in the following week (25 July 2025), urging the government to do more to prevent public sector data breaches. 

Recognising that monetary penalties often take resource away from vital front-line services and risk re-victimising people who have been impacted by a breach, the ICO have sought to adopt a different approach to regulating the public sector. As part of the ICO's ‚Äòpublic sector approach,' the ICO and government have committed together to raise standards and ensure that lessons are learnt from incidents to prevent future breaches. 

New government measures to raise information security standards

According to the ICO, the government has now committed to a series of measures aimed at enhancing information security and accountability. These are set out in a letter dated 20 October 2025 from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to the Chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee and include:

Establishing a central, coordinated approach to managing data protection accountability and compliance across government;

The Government Digital Service (within DSIT) will be responsible for co-ordinating cross-government data protection risks and compliance.

The Government Chief Data Officer (GCDO) will be the accountable individual.

Creating a dedicated team under the GCDO to set consistent standards and respond to emerging risks;

Drawing up a joint commitment with the ICO to work together to raise standards; and

Establishing a cross-government Technology Risk Group to drive accountability for technology risk.

In addition, the government has set out that it is working on eleven additional measures across the following four key domains: (1) government policy and processes; (2) technology; (3) culture; and (4) relationship with the ICO.

For example, as part of the ICO update, Commissioner Edwards highlighted the rolling out of new information management training for all civil servants. This sits under the domain of ‚Äòculture.' The ICO has also been invited to the meetings of the Government Security Board which will track overall progress against these measures.

Future collaboration between the ICO and government

Alongside the above measures, the ICO also confirmed that it is working with the government to formalise their collaboration through a memorandum of understanding (MOU). This MOU is intended to ensure that the government's ambitions to modernise public services and adopt new technologies are pursued ‚Äúwith the appropriate safeguards in place.‚Äù The ICO expects to receive assurances from the government on the delivery and impact of this work. 

Comment

As the Information Commissioner puts it, this latest update represents ‚Äúa single step forward, but it is a crucial one.‚Äù It signals a more structured and proactive approach to public sector data governance and while the commitments outlined are promising, their effectiveness will ultimately depend on sustained implementation and oversight. The ICO recognises this, along with the importance of maintaining public trust, as it emphasises that:

‚ÄúGovernment must now carry through on these commitments, to ensure the public can trust and be confident when sharing their personal information with government, knowing that it will be handled responsibly and safely.‚Äù

The ICO notes that it is still working with the government to determine the extent of its involvement and how it will receive assurance on the delivery and impact of the changes - these mechanisms will be key to ensuring that the reforms translate into meaningful improvements in data protection standards in the public sector.

For advice on data protection compliance in the public sector, please contact Hamish Corner, Madelin Sinclair McAusland, Amanda Leiu, Justin Barrow or a member of Burges Salmon's Commercial & Technology team.

                            Nick Anthony cautions that CBDCs such as the digital euro could erode privacy, enable financial surveillance, and endanger economic freedom.                         

During Plan ‚Çø Lugano, Nick Anthony, policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and fellow at the Human Rights Foundation, sat down with CCN's Dr. Lorena Nessi (a journalist and a researcher) to discuss the power, control, and politics behind digital money.

Anthony, who has emerged as one of the most prominent critics of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), describes them not as financial innovation but as an existential shift in the relationship between citizens and the state.

‚ÄúAt the core, financial activity reveals who we are,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt reveals where we go, where we work, who we have relationships with. It just goes on and on. And I don't think people realize the gravity of governments having all that information in one place,‚Äù Anthony emphasized. 

He continued that ‚ÄúIn democracies, we're lucky that violations are not constant. There are controversies, there are problems, but not to the same extent as in authoritarian countries. That lack of experience creates a lull, a kind of ease. People walk into it thinking, ‚ÄòOh, it's not a big deal.' But it is. Because once that road is paved, once they have that access, it's very hard to stop.‚Äù

For Anthony, the risk isn't abstract. It's built into the very architecture of programmable money, where the rules of spending, saving, and access can be coded directly into the currency itself.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he says without hesitation when asked whether CBDCs could eventually be linked to personal identity. ‚ÄúOver time, they absolutely will. We've already seen it in the existing financial system, it starts small. Governments want records of certain transactions, or reports on specific activities, and it just increases over time.

‚ÄúLinking CBDCs to your digital identification, your digital persona, really is the natural conclusion of this,‚Äù Anthony noted.

Anthony traces his views back to fundamental rights. ‚ÄúFrom the American perspective, privacy is protected under the Fourth Amendment,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIt means you have control, you can consent to who can or can't see your information. And if law enforcement has a legitimate reason, they can go to a judge and ask for permission.

‚ÄúThat's the balance: privacy and accountability. But today, we've moved into an era of sweeping collection by default. Introducing a CBDC would take that to the next level. It wouldn't just be some transactions reported, it would be everything, stored in one central database.‚Äù

The distinction between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies, he argues, is not technical but structural.

‚ÄúAt the broadest level, there's a buffer between governments and individuals and that's the private sector,‚Äù Anthony says. ‚ÄúWith your bank account or a crypto exchange, the government has to go through that intermediary to get your data.

‚ÄúWith a CBDC, that buffer disappears. The information is in the government's hands automatically, by default. There's no knocking on a bank's door, no exchange, no you, they just open your file and go to town with it.‚Äù

That's where decentralized money, in his view, matters most. 

‚ÄúIf you're using Bitcoin and you're self-custodying, you have even more control. The government would have to come directly to you. And ultimately, you have the highest interest in protecting your own information,‚Äù Anthony said.

While most citizens remain unaware of these implications, Anthony believes the crypto community has already connected the dots.

‚ÄúOne of my favorite things to come out of this space is that more people than ever are asking, ‚ÄòWhat is money? What is privacy? What is sovereignty?'‚Äù he says. 

‚ÄúIt's through that curiosity that people see what's at stake that cryptocurrency paves the way toward a freer, more open society, while CBDCs claw back control.‚Äù

Anthony closely tracks CBDC developments worldwide through the HRF CBDC Tracker , which he manages. The country that concerns him most, he says, is the most obvious: China.

‚ÄúWhat worries me might be less obvious,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIf you go to China and try to use their CBDC, the digital yuan, you really can't. Shops don't accept it. Even government employees who get paid in it transfer it out immediately.

‚ÄúThe Communist Party derives much of its authority from being unquestioned. This is showing that people are questioning whether this initiative was a good idea. If the Party sees that as an embarrassment, I worry they'll clamp down harshly.‚Äù

But the deeper issue, he argues, isn't technical, it's political. ‚ÄúPrivacy isn't a technological limitation. It's a political choice. Governments choose surveillance. So if a country already violates financial rights, it'll do the same with a CBDC.‚Äù

There's a growing camp of researchers promoting the idea of a ‚Äòprivacy-minded CBDC', but Anthony is unconvinced .

‚ÄúIt's technically possible,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut not politically possible. Once it goes through the machinery of government, what comes out the other side is just a CBDC. You end up promoting the very thing you're trying to avoid. That's why I think it's better to oppose their creation entirely,‚Äù Anthony stressed.

CBDCs are often marketed as solutions for remittances, cross-border payments, or financial inclusion. Anthony is skeptical.

‚ÄúMost CBDCs launched so far are geo-fenced, limited to citizens of that country,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúAnd when you ask remittance companies why transfers are slow or expensive, they don't say it's a technical issue. They say it's regulatory.

‚ÄúGovernments created that problem, and now they're saying, ‚ÄòWe'll fix it with a CBDC.' But they could just fix the regulations,‚Äù Anthony said.

On a global level, he foresees tension rather than cooperation. ‚ÄúWe might see governments banning each other's CBDCs or taxing their use. But I don't see CBDCs changing the global order. People use the dollar or the euro because those economies are stable and uphold property rights, not because their money is digital.‚Äù

As for whether cryptocurrencies can outcompete state digital currencies, Anthony is cautiously optimistic.

‚ÄúAs long as crypto remains the opposite of CBDCs, including open, censorship-resistant, borderless, it can win hearts and minds,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut competing with governments isn't like competing with another business.

‚ÄúIf I'm competing with a shop next door, I can lower prices or make a better product. But when it's the government, they can change the rules of the game while playing. That's why Bitcoin's resistance to censorship is its greatest strength.‚Äù

Anthony admits his stance has evolved.

‚ÄúI used to think CBDCs were inevitable,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNow I think it's if, not when. The United States has taken a strong stance against launching one, and others are taking note. Some, like the European Central Bank, seem determined, but it's not unstoppable.

‚ÄúThe key is public awareness. In the U.S., people called their representatives, posted online, and spoke out. That made a difference. Once a CBDC is launched, it's almost impossible to undo. But before it hits the ground, you can still stop it.‚Äù

Looking ahead, Anthony's outlook for Europe is grim if the digital euro becomes reality.

‚ÄúI don't think the future is bright,‚Äù he says bluntly. ‚ÄúThe ECB has said it wants to push out foreign financial services, but Europeans use and like those services. From a civil liberties standpoint, it's also worrying. The EU has been moving deeper into control and censorship, and a CBDC would just be another tool.

‚ÄúAll it takes is one tragic event for policymakers to realize they have this surveillance system ready and they'll flip the switch. If that happens, people will move away from the digital euro, not toward it.‚Äù

He adds a final thought, part warning, part plea: ‚ÄúI hope members of the European Parliament are thinking hard about this before moving forward.‚Äù

                              October 24, 2025                            

KARACHI: A man in Karachi has alleged that digital currency worth $850,000 was stolen from his account after his mobile device was snatched at the city's airport last month.

The incident reportedly took place on September 30, when the victim, Faiz Yab, a resident of Keamari, was travelling to Peshawar.

According to the complaint filed in the District and Sessions Court, Malir, two men in plain clothes intercepted him at the airport and took him to an office, where his device containing digital currency access was seized. 

Shortly afterwards, he said, $850,000 was transferred from his digital currency account without authorisation.

The petitioner told the court that despite approaching the airport police, his complaint was not registered. He urged the court to order an inquiry into the incident and ensure his safety.

Following the petition, the court ordered SSP Malir to conduct a formal investigation through a DSP-ranked officer, and directed that a detailed report be submitted.

The police later presented a sealed report and a USB containing evidence to the court.

In a letter addressed to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sindh High Court chief justice, and senior police officials, the victim alleged that he was unlawfully detained and his digital wallet was accessed during that time.

He stated that some of the nominated suspects had contacted him and threatened to destroy the CCTV footage.

The letter further mentioned that within 48 hours, the airport station house officer (SHO) had shown him CCTV clips on a laptop, but he feared that the footage could be tampered with.

He requested that the recordings from the airport's CCTV system ‚Äî which retains footage for 28 to 30 days ‚Äî be preserved and sent to the trial court.

The victim also called for forensic verification of the footage by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) or National Database and Registration Authority's (Nadra) video laboratory to confirm there had been no tampering.

Following the court's directions, SSP Malir has initiated the investigation, with a DSP-ranked officer appointed as the investigating officer (IO).

The police confirmed that the victim had been contacted and his statement would be recorded on Monday.

According to the police, the robbery involved digital currency worth $850,000, stolen after the complainant's device was forcibly taken at Karachi airport.

                            Nick Anthony cautions that CBDCs such as the digital euro could erode privacy, enable financial surveillance, and endanger economic freedom.                         

During Plan ‚Çø Lugano, Nick Anthony, policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and fellow at the Human Rights Foundation, sat down with CCN's Dr. Lorena Nessi (a journalist and a researcher) to discuss the power, control, and politics behind digital money.

Anthony, who has emerged as one of the most prominent critics of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), describes them not as financial innovation but as an existential shift in the relationship between citizens and the state.

‚ÄúAt the core, financial activity reveals who we are,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt reveals where we go, where we work, who we have relationships with. It just goes on and on. And I don't think people realize the gravity of governments having all that information in one place,‚Äù Anthony emphasized. 

He continued that ‚ÄúIn democracies, we're lucky that violations are not constant. There are controversies, there are problems, but not to the same extent as in authoritarian countries. That lack of experience creates a lull, a kind of ease. People walk into it thinking, ‚ÄòOh, it's not a big deal.' But it is. Because once that road is paved, once they have that access, it's very hard to stop.‚Äù

For Anthony, the risk isn't abstract. It's built into the very architecture of programmable money, where the rules of spending, saving, and access can be coded directly into the currency itself.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he says without hesitation when asked whether CBDCs could eventually be linked to personal identity. ‚ÄúOver time, they absolutely will. We've already seen it in the existing financial system, it starts small. Governments want records of certain transactions, or reports on specific activities, and it just increases over time.

‚ÄúLinking CBDCs to your digital identification, your digital persona, really is the natural conclusion of this,‚Äù Anthony noted.

Anthony traces his views back to fundamental rights. ‚ÄúFrom the American perspective, privacy is protected under the Fourth Amendment,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIt means you have control, you can consent to who can or can't see your information. And if law enforcement has a legitimate reason, they can go to a judge and ask for permission.

‚ÄúThat's the balance: privacy and accountability. But today, we've moved into an era of sweeping collection by default. Introducing a CBDC would take that to the next level. It wouldn't just be some transactions reported, it would be everything, stored in one central database.‚Äù

The distinction between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies, he argues, is not technical but structural.

‚ÄúAt the broadest level, there's a buffer between governments and individuals and that's the private sector,‚Äù Anthony says. ‚ÄúWith your bank account or a crypto exchange, the government has to go through that intermediary to get your data.

‚ÄúWith a CBDC, that buffer disappears. The information is in the government's hands automatically, by default. There's no knocking on a bank's door, no exchange, no you, they just open your file and go to town with it.‚Äù

That's where decentralized money, in his view, matters most. 

‚ÄúIf you're using Bitcoin and you're self-custodying, you have even more control. The government would have to come directly to you. And ultimately, you have the highest interest in protecting your own information,‚Äù Anthony said.

While most citizens remain unaware of these implications, Anthony believes the crypto community has already connected the dots.

‚ÄúOne of my favorite things to come out of this space is that more people than ever are asking, ‚ÄòWhat is money? What is privacy? What is sovereignty?'‚Äù he says. 

‚ÄúIt's through that curiosity that people see what's at stake that cryptocurrency paves the way toward a freer, more open society, while CBDCs claw back control.‚Äù

Anthony closely tracks CBDC developments worldwide through the HRF CBDC Tracker , which he manages. The country that concerns him most, he says, is the most obvious: China.

‚ÄúWhat worries me might be less obvious,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIf you go to China and try to use their CBDC, the digital yuan, you really can't. Shops don't accept it. Even government employees who get paid in it transfer it out immediately.

‚ÄúThe Communist Party derives much of its authority from being unquestioned. This is showing that people are questioning whether this initiative was a good idea. If the Party sees that as an embarrassment, I worry they'll clamp down harshly.‚Äù

But the deeper issue, he argues, isn't technical, it's political. ‚ÄúPrivacy isn't a technological limitation. It's a political choice. Governments choose surveillance. So if a country already violates financial rights, it'll do the same with a CBDC.‚Äù

There's a growing camp of researchers promoting the idea of a ‚Äòprivacy-minded CBDC', but Anthony is unconvinced .

‚ÄúIt's technically possible,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut not politically possible. Once it goes through the machinery of government, what comes out the other side is just a CBDC. You end up promoting the very thing you're trying to avoid. That's why I think it's better to oppose their creation entirely,‚Äù Anthony stressed.

CBDCs are often marketed as solutions for remittances, cross-border payments, or financial inclusion. Anthony is skeptical.

‚ÄúMost CBDCs launched so far are geo-fenced, limited to citizens of that country,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúAnd when you ask remittance companies why transfers are slow or expensive, they don't say it's a technical issue. They say it's regulatory.

Trump is demolishing the East Wing of the White House to make way for a gilded grand ballroom. The president says taxpayers won't be footing the $300 million bill and that private donors, himself included, will pick up the tab.

Big Tech will be paying for a lot of it, if the list of donors released by the White House Thursday is anything to go by (though it does not say how much each contributed). Featured are some of the country's biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Google-owned YouTube has already agreed to pay more than $20 million to the project as part of a controversial settlement to end a lawsuit Trump filed in 2021 and the companies are big donors to Trump's ‚Äúnonprofits.‚Äù

Crypto is well represented, too, with donations from Ripple, Tether America, Coinbase, and both Winklevoss twins (Cameron and Tyler feature separately). Defense and telecom giants like Lockheed Martin, Comcast, T-Mobile, and Palantir also appear.

Data from Lookonchain shows an early bitcoin BTC$110,327.12 miner wallet holding 4,000 BTC (around $442 million) has become active for the first time in 14 years. The wallet, identified as 18eY9o, transferred 150 BTC (roughly $16.6 million) after years of dormancy. 

These coins were originally mined in 2009 and consolidated into the wallet in 2011. The movement may signal a rotation, potential selling, or simply a testing activity. A major narrative this year has centered on sell pressure from early ‚ÄúOG‚Äù holders, who have started moving or selling their bitcoin after it reached the symbolic $100,000 milestone.

Onchain data shows significant realized profits, suggesting old holders are taking advantage of high prices. Earlier in the year, about 80,000 BTC linked to an early whale, inactive since 2011, sold the entire stash, using Galaxy Digital as the broker.

Some analysts also point to rising concerns over quantum computing and its potential threat to early bitcoin addresses, which could explain the movement of older coins.

Bitcoin OG and Fragrant Board Director Nicholas Gregory told CoinDesk about the potential threat of quantum attacks. 

""It's true that OG holders have been selling; however, coins from this era (2011) may be vulnerable to potential quantum attacks if their public keys have been exposed (as is the case with early P2PK addresses or reused P2PKH addresses),"" he Gregory said.

""This could be a preemptive move to transfer coins to new, unexposed addresses that would be better sheltered from such quantum hacks"".

 Following the pardon, CZ said he would do ‚Äúeverything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance Web3 worldwide.‚Äù 

US President Donald Trump said he pardoned Binance founder Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao after lobbying and support from ‚Äúa lot of people‚Äù who told him CZ wasn't guilty. 

The pardon was signed on Wednesday, and Binance confirmed the presidential order to Cointelegraph in a statement.

During a news conference on Thursday, Trump said he chose to pardon the Binance founder because he ‚Äúwas recommended by a lot of people,‚Äù had a lot of support and ‚Äúpeople say that he wasn't guilty of anything.‚Äù

Zhao was given a four-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to one count of violating the US Bank Secrecy Act for failing to maintain an effective anti‚Äìmoney laundering program at Binance.

CZ's crypto attorney Teresa Goody Guill√©n on Thursday said the pardon was the right call because her client had ‚Äúa single charge of failure to have an effective compliance program. NO fraud, NO victims, NO criminal history. NO money laundering.‚Äù

‚ÄúCZ is the first and only known first-time offender in US history to receive a prison sentence for this single, non-fraud-related charge,‚Äù she said.

Following the pardon, CZ took to X and said he was ‚Äúdeeply grateful,‚Äù and would do ‚Äúeverything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance Web3 worldwide.‚Äù

As part of his plea deal with authorities, CZ was forced to step down as CEO of Binance and was prohibited from working at the exchange. A pardon could allow him to rejoin Binance.

 Bitcoin options open interest reached a record $63 billion, with bullish strike prices at $120,000 to $140,000 dominating. 

Bitcoin derivatives markets are signaling new bullishness with Bitcoin (BTC) options open interest (OI) at a record high of $63 billion, dominated by higher strike prices, according to CoinGlass.

OI also hit an all-time high of $50 billion on crypto options exchange Deribit, ‚Äúwith puts at $100K gaining traction,‚Äù reported the Coinbase-owned derivatives platform on Thursday. 

Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, with about 80% of the total OI. Open interest refers to the number or value of all outstanding options contracts that have yet to expire or be settled.

Record highs mean high engagement in crypto derivatives markets as traders are actively positioning for major price moves, suggesting heightened conviction about Bitcoin's near-term direction.

Deribit noted an increase in OI at the $100,000 strike prices, which is now around $2.17 billion, with bears betting on a fall in Bitcoin. 

However, there is much more OI at higher strike prices, with more than $2 billion at $120,000, $130,000 and $140,000 strike prices, according to Deribit.

When OI concentrates at strike prices well above current levels, it indicates traders are predominantly betting on or hedging for substantial upside. This suggests strong bullish sentiment and expectations for continued price appreciation.

‚ÄúWhile put OI has increased at key downside strikes, there's notable call activity building around 120K and above, suggesting traders are positioning for potential upside volatility or gamma exposure,‚Äù said Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit.

Around $5.1 billion worth of BTC options will expire on Friday on Deribit. They have a put/call ratio of 1.03, which means long and short contract sellers are evenly matched. 

There is a max pain point of $114,000, the strike price at which most contracts will make a loss.

‚ÄúPositioning is balanced, with puts outweighing calls a bit. Traders are hedging downside but not positioning for a major sell-off,‚Äù reported Deribit.

There really may be such a thing as a bad egg. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is urging people to avoid eating, selling or serving eggs from the Arkansas-based Black Sheep Egg Company that the firm recently recalled because of potential Salmonella contamination.

The eggs came in 12- and 18-count cartons and had ‚Äúbest by‚Äù dates of August 22 through October 31, 2025. The company issued a voluntary recall in late September. It also distributed the eggs to other companies, including Santa Fe, Tex.‚Äìbased Kenz Henz, which issued its own voluntary recall on October 16. Those eggs were sold in stores across Houston, Tex. Black Sheep also distributed eggs to Arkansas and Missouri, where companies may have repackaged them. This is the third Salmonella-based egg recall so far this year.

‚ÄúIn response to several consumer and customer inquiries, we want to confirm that all of our available eggs are safe to eat,‚Äù said the Black Sheep Egg Company in a post on its Facebook page on October 23. ‚ÄúWe want to emphasize that all eggs tested negative for Salmonella and showed no signs of contamination. Out of an abundance of caution and with our consumers' safety in mind, we voluntarily recalled certain lots of eggs in September. This decision reflects our company's unwavering commitment to providing safe, high-quality products.‚Äù

On September 29 the FDA had launched an inspection of Black Sheep's egg-processing facility and found 40 environmental samples that were positive for Salmonella, a bacterium that can cause serious foodborne illness.

A June Salmonella outbreak in organic and cage-free eggs sickened at least 134 people, but public health officials have not yet reported illnesses linked to this latest recall. Here's what you need to know about Salmonella and the illness it can cause.

Salmonella is a genus of bacteria that can sicken humans. The Salmonella bacteria that are most related to foodborne illness are found in the intestines, skin and fur of animals such as chickens and cows. And they spread through fecal contamination of surfaces that are improperly cleaned or of raw food that is handled without proper sanitary measures. Salmonella often spreads through eggs or chicken (the animals are frequently raised in crowded and unsanitary conditions), but there have also been outbreaks in peanut butter, raw pork, raw beef, cucumbers and raw flour (such as in cookie dough). Pets and backyard animals such as birds, hedgehogs, turtles, guinea pigs and bearded dragons can also carry Salmonella.

Salmonella infection can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting and fever. Symptoms usually come on between eight to 72 hours after exposure and last four to seven days. Children under age five, older adults and people with a weakened immune system are most vulnerable.

The FDA says you should not eat, sell or serve recalled eggs. You should also clean and sanitize anything the eggs have touched. If you have any recalled eggs, throw them away or return them to the store. When in doubt, throw it out!

Always, always cook eggs before eating them. Do not consume raw eggs, especially if you have a compromised immune system. Eggs should be cooked until they reach a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71.1 degrees Celsius)‚Äîusually this occurs when the yolks become firm.

Wash your hands, cooking implements and surfaces thoroughly with hot, soapy water before and after handling raw eggs or foods that contain them.

If you think you have symptoms of a Salmonella infection after eating eggs, contact your doctor. Most people get over their infections in three to four days. If you have diarrhea that lasts more than two days or a fever above 102 degrees F (39 degrees C), however, you should see a health care professional. There is no specific treatment, but it's important to stay hydrated to help the infection resolve itself.

Bird Flu Is Back. Here's What to Know

After a quiet summer, bird flu cases are rising again. Scientists expected the development, but what happens next is still uncertain

By Meghan Bartels edited by Tanya Lewis

After a summer lull in U.S. cases of avian influenza in both poultry and dairy cattle‚Äîand no human infections reported in the country since February‚Äîthe virus is back.

Bird flu's return threatens major economic losses for the U.S. agricultural system and raises a small but real risk of a human pandemic. Scientists expected bird flu to return. It was highly unlikely that, following three full years of infecting U.S. poultry and making the surprising leap into cows, the virus would simply disappear.

The currently circulating bird flu subtype H5N1 is here to stay. ‚ÄúWe've resigned to this phase,‚Äù says Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University. ‚ÄúNow we have to figure out what we're doing next.‚Äù

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Scientific American spoke with Lakdawala and other experts about why the virus has returned, what threats it poses, and what people need to know.

In poultry, bird flu is on the rise: according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 50 flocks of commercial and backyard poultry in the country had confirmed avian influenza infections in October. Farmers cull all birds on infected premises to reduce the virus's spread, and this month, more than three million animals have been killed to date.

Carol Cardona, a poultry veterinarian at the University of Minnesota, says she's worried by the fact that the state's board of animal health has already reported 20 flocks with confirmed infections since the beginning of September. ‚ÄúWe're definitely having a bad year here in Minnesota,‚Äù Cardona says.

The outbreak in dairy cattle, which was identified in March 2024, is also still ongoing. The virus is more difficult to track in cattle because, unlike poultry, the animals tend not to die after they are infected. The infection reduces cows' milk production, however.

Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a large animal veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin, notes that several states, including California and Idaho, are seeing ongoing infections in cattle‚Äîbut that he knows this only because of informal conversations with colleagues. Meanwhile last month the USDA confirmed Nebraska's first known dairy infection, suggesting the virus is still spreading among herds. But in general, reporting of infections in dairy cattle is slow and disorganized. ‚ÄúWe don't have enough information to know what our risk is, and that's a pretty precarious position,‚Äù Poulsen says. ‚ÄúWe don't know what we don't know.‚Äù

This month's nationwide poultry infection numbers represent a stark increase from those of the summer months: June, July and August each saw fewer than one million poultry culled to combat bird flu. But scientists expected that there would be an increase in the disease's prevalence in poultry as autumn arrived for two reasons. First, hotter temperatures seem to quell the virus, and the weather is getting cooler. ‚ÄúThe virus survives better in the cold weather,‚Äù says Rocio Crespo, a poultry veterinarian at North Carolina State University. ‚ÄúSo we are going to have more outbreaks than we have seen in the summer.‚Äù Second, avian influenza is widespread among wild birds, and many of those birds migrate south to warmer climates, carrying the virus with them.

Together, those two factors mean that bird flu cases in poultry have settled into an apparent annual cycle since the current outbreak was first identified in early 2022, with losses generally being lowest in June, July, and August and highest in December, January, February and March.

The federal government has been shut down since October 1, when the new fiscal year began with no funding measures covering standard operations. Across the government, only those employees deemed ‚Äúmission critical‚Äù at federal agencies continue to work.

Press personnel for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which maintains the agency's avian influenza dashboards, did not respond to Scientific American's requests for details about the office's staffing during the shutdown. Cardona says that she knows of agency staffers in Minnesota and nearby states who are continuing to work on bird flu, and the dashboards for poultry, dairy and wild bird cases all show updates dating to the month of October.

Much of the U.S. response to avian influenza was always at the level of individual states rather than that of the federal government, which means that surveillance and control plans are still being implemented, Poulsen says. ‚ÄúSurveillance is working,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe're finding positives, and we're dealing with them appropriately.‚Äù

Where he sees a key weakness now is in communication between the states, which the USDA facilitated via meetings that are now canceled, Poulsen says. He also says that the agency lacks the veterinarians and support staff to confront the reality of the current animal disease landscape in North America, which includes not just avian influenza but also New World screwworm infestation, foot-and-mouth disease and African swine fever.

The seasonal rise in avian influenza in poultry coincides with the beginning of human influenza season, raising scientists' fears that these flu viruses could mingle, with potentially devastating consequences.

Influenza viruses are prone to swapping their genetic material with each other‚Äîa process called reassortment. That's one major reason that, every year, scientists develop a new flu vaccine to target the specific strains they expect to circulate most. If a bird flu virus gains a seasonal flu's ability to easily infect humans, the result could be a novel pandemic disease‚Äîone to which people would have no existing immunity and that, scientists fear, would have an even higher mortality rate than COVID did during its initial emergence.

Amanda Monta√±ez

Cow udders may offer one venue for such a hybrid virus to develop. But scientists also worry about coinfection in humans‚Äîevents in which the same person is infected with both avian influenza and a seasonal flu virus at the same time.

Fortunately, it would likely take many such human coinfections for a dangerous virus to emerge because flu reassortment is relatively rare in people, Lakdawala says. ‚ÄúTwo viruses have to get inside of a single cell in your body of millions, billions of cells and replicate and make something new,‚Äù she says. Unfortunately, the more prevalent each virus is, the more likely such coinfections are, making the matched increase of bird flu and seasonal human flu dangerous.

Most people's risk from the current strain of bird flu is quite low, experts emphasize. Although the CDC has reported 70 confirmed cases in humans, almost everyone who has been infected had direct contact with infected animals, and most cases have been mild. That's in contrast to previous outbreaks of other bird flu strains that, estimates suggest, killed as many as half of the people who were infected.

For now, Poulsen is much more worried about how the nation's poultry and dairy agriculture systems will withstand the virus continuing to afflict the animals these industries rely on. He fears, for example, another spike in egg prices that will be similar to what the U.S. saw in late 2024 and early 2025. So far, milk prices have been more resilient to bird flu's upheaval, but there's no guarantee that will remain the case‚Äîparticularly in an economic landscape that is now shaped by tariff-driven price increases.

‚ÄúFor the general public, they're going to see more expensive food, or they might not be able to get food,‚Äù Poulsen says.

Although bird flu is not currently a high risk for most people, experts still recommend several measures to keep yourself and others safe from the virus:

Consume only pasteurized milk products. Sick cows have huge amounts of the bird flu virus in their milk, where it can remain infectious‚Äîeven in raw milk cheese aged more than four months, recent research found. Pasteurization has been proven to render milk containing the virus safe to consume.

Don't feed raw food or raw milk products to pets‚Äîespecially cats, which have been particularly susceptible to serious bird flu infections.

Stay away from wild animals and report dead ones to local health agencies.

Supervise pets outdoors to ensure they don't interact with animals that could be carrying the virus.

Get a seasonal flu vaccine to reduce the spread of viruses that are able to reassort with the avian influenza virus.

People who regularly interact with animals that are susceptible to bird flu should be more cautious. If you keep backyard poultry, be aware of bird flu rates in your area and handle your birds only while wearing personal protective equipment (masks and gloves) and clothing that stays outside the house. Farmworkers should also wear protective gear and follow biosafety protocols, although scientists are realizing that these workers need better tools to keep themselves safe. ‚ÄúWe have excellent personal protective equipment for individuals working in lab settings,‚Äù Crespo says. ‚ÄúBut many of those do not work that well on the farm.‚Äù She's heartened by a recent workshop held by the National Academy of Sciences to bridge this gap.

This year Cardona is particularly interested in how the virus will evolve. She's seeing evidence that avian influenza has been undergoing substantial reassortment in wild birds. Influenzas are identified by two surface proteins. The bird flu virus that is currently circulating is a subtype dubbed H5N1. But Cardona says she's now hearing of cases of the subtype H5N2, as well as cases of H5N1 with differing gene compositions. ‚ÄúThe virus is putting on its disguises,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThat can change the way the virus behaves in an animal species.‚Äù

Crespo is focused on the experience of poultry farmers who desperately want to know how the virus is infiltrating their flocks despite the fact that they have employed a host of measures meant to protect the birds.

And Poulsen wonders how the Trump administration's work in shrinking the federal government and attacking science will shape the U.S. response to bird flu‚Äîand our overall public health system.

But as worried as these experts are by the return of bird flu and the evolving challenges it poses, they're still in the fight. ‚ÄúOne advantage we have over this virus is: we are smarter than it is,‚Äù Cardona says. ‚ÄúWe really need to start using our brains and figure out how to get to a more manageable state.‚Äù

Searching for clues in the Epoch of Reionization, scientists discovered that the universe was quite a bit warmer before the ignition of the first stars.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Everyone is familiar with our universe's explosive beginnings‚Äîthings got really hot and really dense until there was a Big Bang. However, the sequel to this explosive preamble is decidedly different in tone. After the Big Bang, the universe rapidly cooled and expanded until finally‚Äî400,000 years later‚Äîprotons and electrons merged to form hydrogen atoms.

As Live Science notes, what followed is known as the ‚Äúcosmic dark age‚Äù when the universe was filled with this neutral hydrogen for about one billion years until the arrival of the first stars and galaxies. Once these primordial stars emitted UV light that stripped hydrogen atoms of their electrons, the cosmos entered the ‚ÄúEpoch of Reionization‚Äù and the universe began to resemble what we picture today. This is the universe's toddler days, so to speak. 

However, unlike an obsessive parent documenting every milestone of their drooling progeny, astrophysicists don't have such a wealth of evidence‚Äîinstead, they have to go looking for it. For example, we don't really know what the conditions of the universe were when it began to transition from the ‚Äúcosmic dark age.‚Äù While some theories suggest reionization developed from a ‚Äúcold start,‚Äù a new study from an international team of scientists provides evidence the universe was actually heating up prior to this major milestone in the universe's development. The results of the study were published in The Astrophysical Journal.

‚ÄúAs the universe evolved, the gas between galaxies expands and cools, so we would expect it to be very, very cold,‚Äù Curtin University's Cathryn Trott, lead author of the study, said in a press statement. ""Our measurements show that it is at least heated by a certain amount. Not by a lot, but it tells us that very cold reionization is ruled out.‚Äù 

Glimpsing something that far in the past isn't easy, and Trott and her team utilized the Murchison Widefield Array telescope located in Western Australia to facilitate the challenging observation. Operating at 70‚Äì300 MHz, the telescope is purpose-built to detect that aforementioned neutral hydrogen emission from the ‚Äúepoch of reionization.‚Äù Even so, the authors needed to perform a lot of subtraction in order to isolate what they were looking for from the cosmic noise of nearby stars, galaxies, and even Earth's atmosphere. 

Because the team was able to create this filtered data‚Äîas well as having the benefit of ten years worth of it‚Äîthey could make a discovery by omission. If the universe was cold at this time, it would emit a certain kind of signal, but the researchers found no evidence of it, suggesting that at least some warming was going on. The theory is that x-rays from early black holes and stellar remnants drove this heating around 800 million years after the Big Bang. They haven't found the tell-tale signal of that heating yet, but the researchers say that it's likely only a matter of time. 

‚ÄúAll these existing techniques will help us find what's missing,‚Äù Curtin University's Ridhima Nunhokee, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. ‚ÄúThe signal is definitely buried in there. It's just improving on our data, and getting more data, cleaner data, to reach it.‚Äù

Chery Automobile, a Chinese automaker, recently released a prototype solid-state battery that offers double the energy density of current EV batteries.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Energy density is the latest hot pursuit for unlocking more range and performance in electric vehicles. Measured in Watt Hours per Kilogram (Wh/Kg), energy density is effectively just the power-to-weight ratio of a battery system. Chery Automobile is one of many Chinese EV manufacturers leading the solid-state charge, no pun intended, recently unveiling its new prototype battery with an energy density of 600 Wh/Kg‚Äîdouble the energy density of most current EV batteries. For context, the nickel-cobalt-aluminum batteries, often found in Tesla's Long-Range and Performance models, have a 200-260 Wh/Kg energy density.

Increased energy density equals more available range and performance.

Thankfully, solid-state batteries offer several advantages over traditional liquid-electrolyte batteries beyond just energy density. Critically, solid-state batteries bring significantly less fire risk as a solid electrolyte (the medium that enables a battery to charge and discharge) isn't flammable. This new battery architecture also offers increased thermal stability, lowering the chances of thermal runaway‚Äîa process that ends with the battery bursting into flames. Last but not least, solid electrolytes will also allow the batteries of the future to be formed into much more complex shapes.

According to a number of Chinese news sites, the new battery could offer 1,300 kilometers (807.7 miles) of real-world driving range. For context, the Lucid Air Grand Touring is the current range king, able to do over 500 miles on a single charge. Regardless, solid-state batteries will also allow for faster charge times‚Äîfour to six times faster in some cases. Plain and simple, solid electrolytes provide a safer and more stable environment for lithium ions to move through, enabling faster charging. The keen among you will know that solid-state battery advantages span much further than just charging, discharging, and durability.

Reports show Chery's battery running flawlessly through a nail penetration test, also shaking off damage from a power drill without catching fire or producing any mystery smoke. However, even with a promising proof of concept, there's still some assembly required before we'll see these battery packs in production vehicles. Car News China reports that Chery plans to launch a pilot program in 2026, followed by a large-scale rollout in 2027. Should everything go smoothly, Chery could potentially jump major Chinese competitors like BYD and CATL to large-scale solid-state battery production. That would be tremendous, but we should clarify that this is far from a three-horse race.

Toyota is another major player in the solid-state battery game. While smaller companies like Chery Automobile are moving fast and iterating on prototypes, Toyota is leading the way in patent activity; as it stands, the Japanese automaker has 1,700 patents related to solid-state battery tech, with over 1,500 of them active. Despite the brand's current diversified approach to electrification, nailing solid-state batteries on the first try could make Toyota a major EV superpower‚Äîable to compete with the rock-solid competition coming from China.

Toyota recently announced a strategic partnership with Idemitsu Kosan, a Japanese energy company that can assist them with rolling out solid-state batteries as soon as 2027. Chery Automobile's prototype currently boasts the highest energy density, but it remains to be seen how the brand plans to integrate the technology into a production vehicle. 

Engineers faced considerable challenges getting solid-state batteries to work. Like any cutting-edge technology, development is a long and expensive process, with solid-state batteries costing up to 2.8 times more than a legacy liquid-electrolyte lithium-ion pack. The extra expense comes mostly from the sulfide materials these new batteries need under the skin and low production yields.

Like many engineering challenges, the payoff from the number crunching needed to get these batteries to behave will be well worth the effort; once dialed in, the batteries of the future will offer more range and better longevity while being considerably less incendiary than their legacy lithium counterparts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists finally see what sparks Parkinson's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251024041757.htm","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 14:59:15 GMT","

For the first time, researchers have directly seen and measured the protein clusters thought to spark Parkinson's disease, marking a major milestone in understanding the world's fastest-growing neurological condition.

These microscopic clusters, known as alpha-synuclein oligomers, have long been suspected as the starting point for Parkinson's, but they have remained undetectable in human brain tissue -- until now.

A team from the University of Cambridge, UCL, the Francis Crick Institute, and Polytechnique Montr√©al developed a powerful imaging approach that allows scientists to visualize, count, and compare these protein clumps in human brain tissue. One researcher described the breakthrough as ""like being able to see stars in broad daylight.""

Published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the findings could transform how scientists study Parkinson's, offering new insights into how it spreads through the brain and paving the way for earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatments.

Parkinson's: A Growing Global Health Challenge

More than 166,000 people in the UK currently live with Parkinson's disease, and the global total is expected to reach 25 million by 2050. While existing drugs can ease symptoms such as tremors and stiffness, none can halt or slow the disease's progression.

For over a century, doctors have identified Parkinson's by the presence of large protein deposits known as Lewy bodies. Yet researchers have long believed that smaller, early-stage oligomers may actually cause the damage to brain cells. Until now, these microscopic structures, just a few nanometers long, were impossible to observe directly.

Seeing Parkinson's at Its Earliest Stages

""Lewy bodies are the hallmark of Parkinson's, but they essentially tell you where the disease has been, not where it is right now,"" said Professor Steven Lee from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who co-led the research. ""If we can observe Parkinson's at its earliest stages, that would tell us a whole lot more about how the disease develops in the brain and how we might be able to treat it.""

To achieve this, the researchers created a method called ASA-PD (Advanced Sensing of Aggregates for Parkinson's Disease). This ultra-sensitive fluorescence microscopy technique can detect and analyze millions of oligomers in post-mortem brain samples. Because the oligomers are so tiny, their signal is faint, but ASA-PD enhances that signal while reducing background noise, allowing scientists to clearly see individual alpha-synuclein clusters for the first time.

Illuminating the Invisible

""This is the first time we've been able to look at oligomers directly in human brain tissue at this scale: it's like being able to see stars in broad daylight,"" said co-first author Dr Rebecca Andrews, who conducted the work when she was a postdoctoral researcher in Lee's lab. ""It opens new doors in Parkinson's research.""

The researchers examined brain tissue from people with Parkinson's and compared it to samples from healthy individuals of similar age. They found that oligomers were present in both groups, but in those with Parkinson's, the clusters were larger, brighter, and far more numerous. This difference suggests a strong connection between oligomer growth and disease progression.

Clues to the Earliest Signs of Disease

The team also identified a unique subset of oligomers found only in Parkinson's patients, which may represent the earliest detectable signs of the disease -- possibly appearing years before symptoms emerge.

""This method doesn't just give us a snapshot,"" said Professor Lucien Weiss from Polytechnique Montr√©al, wo co-led the research. ""It offers a whole atlas of protein changes across the brain and similar technologies could be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's.

""Oligomers have been the needle in the haystack, but now that we know where those needles are, it could help us target specific cell types in certain regions of the brain.""

A New Window Into the Human Brain

""The only real way to understand what is happening in human disease is to study the human brain directly, but because of the brain's sheer complexity, this is very challenging,"" said Professor Sonia Gandhi from The Francis Crick Institute, who co-led the research. ""We hope that breaking through this technological barrier will allow us to understand why, where and how protein clusters form and how this changes the brain environment and leads to disease.""

This research was made possible with support from Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP), the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Medical Research Council (MRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). The team expressed gratitude to the patients, families, and caregivers who donated brain tissue to research, enabling discoveries like this to advance understanding and potential treatment of Parkinson's disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Japanese scientists unveil a quantum battery that defies energy loss","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251023031612.htm","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 07:49:58 GMT","

Scientists from the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing and Huazhong University of Science and Technology have carried out a theoretical study showing how a ""topological quantum battery"" could be efficiently designed. This innovative concept uses the topological characteristics of photonic waveguides and the quantum behavior of two-level atoms to store and transfer energy. Their findings, published in Physical Review Letters, point toward potential applications in nanoscale energy storage, optical quantum communication, and distributed quantum computing systems.

The Promise of Quantum Batteries

As environmental sustainability becomes an increasingly urgent global concern, researchers are looking for new approaches to next-generation energy storage. Quantum batteries -- miniaturized theoretical devices that store energy using quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and coherence rather than traditional chemical reactions -- could redefine how power is stored and transferred. In principle, these batteries could deliver several advantages over conventional ones, including faster charging, higher capacity, and improved efficiency in energy extraction.

Overcoming the Challenges of Quantum Energy Systems

Despite years of proposals, practical implementation of quantum batteries has remained out of reach. In real-world conditions, these systems are particularly vulnerable to energy loss and decoherence, a process in which quantum systems lose essential properties like entanglement and superposition, leading to reduced performance. In photonic systems that use ordinary (non-topological) waveguides -- channels that direct photons but are sensitive to bends or imperfections -- energy efficiency drops sharply as photons disperse within the guide. Additional challenges such as environmental noise, dissipation, and structural disorder further erode stability and storage efficiency.

Harnessing Topology to Improve Battery Performance

To address these persistent problems, the international research team used analytical and numerical modeling within a theoretical framework. By taking advantage of topological properties -- material features that remain unchanged even when the structure is twisted or bent -- they showed it is possible to achieve both long-distance energy transfer and immunity to dissipation in quantum batteries. In an unexpected twist, the researchers also discovered that dissipation, which typically weakens performance, can temporarily increase charging power under certain conditions.

Breakthrough Findings and Future Implications

The study revealed several promising outcomes that bring topological quantum batteries closer to practical use. The team demonstrated that the topological nature of photonic waveguides enables nearly perfect energy transfer. When the charging source and battery occupy the same site, the system gains dissipation immunity limited to a single sublattice. They also found that when dissipation surpasses a critical level, charging power experiences a brief but significant boost, overturning the long-held assumption that energy loss is always detrimental.

Toward Real-World Quantum Batteries

""Our research provides new insights from a topological perspective and gives us hints toward the realization of high-performance micro-energy storage devices. By overcoming the practical performance limitations of quantum batteries caused by long-distance energy transmission and dissipation, we hope to accelerate the transition from theory to practical application of quantum batteries,"" said Zhi-Guang Lu, the first author of the study.

""Looking ahead,"" says Cheng Shang, the corresponding author of the international research team, ""we will continue working to bridge the gap between theoretical study and the practical deployment of quantum devices -- ushering in the quantum era we have long envisioned.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just changed the nature of matter with a flash of light","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251024041822.htm","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:42:07 GMT","

Imagine being able to alter a material so that it seems to transform into an entirely different one. No magic wand or special potion is needed -- only light. When light interacts with the material, it excites its magnetic states, setting off collective magnetic vibrations. These vibrations can transmit and store information at terahertz speeds. The entire process happens at room temperature and produces almost no heat. Even better, it doesn't rely on rare or exotic materials. Researchers observed the effect in common, naturally grown crystals that are widely available. Now imagine using the same approach to tap into quantum effects -- phenomena so delicate they are typically observed only near absolute zero (around -270 degrees Celsius) -- but doing it at room temperature, with no costly cooling systems required.

It might sound like science fiction, yet this breakthrough is real. A team of physicists at the University of Konstanz, led by Davide Bossini, has developed an experimental technique that makes it possible. By using laser pulses to coherently excite pairs of magnons (quanta of spin waves), the researchers achieved remarkable effects that could influence both information technology and quantum research. Their findings were published in Science Advances.

Technology based on magnons

Before diving deeper, it helps to understand what magnons are and why they matter. The modern world generates enormous amounts of data through artificial intelligence and the ""Internet of Things."" Our current information systems are already straining under the pressure, and a data bottleneck threatens to slow technological progress.

One proposed solution is to use electron spins -- or even better, waves of many spins moving together -- to carry information. These collective spin oscillations are called magnons. They behave like waves and can be manipulated by lasers, potentially allowing data transmission and storage at terahertz frequencies.

So far, however, scientists have only been able to excite magnons at their lowest frequencies using light, which limits their potential. To harness magnons for future technologies, researchers must be able to tune their frequency, amplitude, and lifetime. The team at Konstanz has now found a way to do exactly that. By directly exciting pairs of magnons -- the highest-frequency magnetic resonances in a material -- they discovered a powerful new form of control.

A huge surprise

""The result was a huge surprise for us. No theory has ever predicted it,"" says Davide Bossini. Not only does the process work -- it also has spectacular effects. By driving high-frequency magnon pairs via laser pulses, the physicists succeeded in changing the frequencies and amplitudes of other magnons -- and thus the magnetic properties of the material -- in a non-thermal way. ""Every solid has its own set of frequencies: electronic transitions, lattice vibrations, magnetic excitations. Every material resonates in its own way,"" explains Bossini. It is precisely this set of frequencies that can be influenced through the new process. ""It changes the nature of the material, the 'magnetic DNA of the material', so to speak, its 'fingerprint'. It has practically become a different material with new properties for the time being,"" says Bossini.

""The effects are not caused by laser excitation. The cause is light, not temperature,"" confirms Bossini: ""We can change the frequencies and properties of the material in a non-thermal way."" The advantages are obvious: The method could be used for future data storage and for fast data transmission at terahertz rates without the systems being slowed down by the pileup of heat.

No spectacular high-tech materials or rare earths are required as the basis for the process, but rather naturally grown crystals -- namely the iron ore haematite. ""Haematite is widespread. Centuries ago, it was already used for compasses in seafaring,"" explains Bossini. It is perfectly possible that haematite will now also be used for quantum research in the future. The results of the Konstanz team suggest that, using the new method, researchers will be able to produce light-induced Bose-Einstein condensates of high-energy magnons at room temperature. This would pave the way to researching quantum effects without the need for extensive cooling. Sounds like magic, but it is just technology and cutting-edge research.

The project was carried out in the context of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB 1432 ""Fluctuations and Nonlinearities in Classical and Quantum Matter beyond Equilibrium.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Popular cholesterol drugs may help prevent dementia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251024041815.htm","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 15:26:12 GMT","

Having lower cholesterol levels may help protect against dementia, according to a large-scale international study led by the University of Bristol. The research, involving data from more than one million participants, found that people with genetic traits that naturally reduce cholesterol are less likely to develop dementia.

The work was led by Dr. Liv Tybj√¶rg Nordestgaard during her time at the University of Bristol and at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital -- Herlev and Gentofte. The findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.

Genetic Clues and Cholesterol-Lowering Effects

Some individuals are born with genetic variants that affect the same proteins targeted by cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins and ezetimibe. To explore whether these drugs might influence dementia risk, the team used a technique called Mendelian Randomization. This method allows scientists to study how specific genetic variants mimic the effects of a treatment while minimizing the influence of outside factors like weight, diet, or lifestyle.

By comparing people with and without these cholesterol-lowering genetic variants, the researchers observed a clear difference in dementia risk. A small decrease in cholesterol levels (about one millimole per liter) was associated with up to an 80% reduction in dementia risk for certain drug-related genetic targets.

Lower Cholesterol, Lower Dementia Risk

""What our study indicates is that if you have these variants that lower your cholesterol, it looks like you have a significantly lower risk of developing dementia,"" said Dr. Nordestgaard, who now works in the Department of Clinical Biochemistry at Copenhagen University Hospital -- Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg hospital.

The results suggest that keeping cholesterol levels low -- whether through genetics or medical treatment -- may protect against dementia. However, the research does not yet confirm that cholesterol-lowering drugs themselves directly prevent the disease.

Why Studying Dementia Is So Challenging

Because dementia often develops late in life, studying its causes requires tracking participants for decades. This makes it difficult to establish cause and effect in traditional clinical trials.

It also remains unclear why high cholesterol raises dementia risk. One explanation, according to Dr. Nordestgaard, is that high cholesterol contributes to atherosclerosis -- the buildup of fatty deposits in blood vessels.

How Cholesterol May Harm the Brain

""Atherosclerosis is a result of the accumulation of cholesterol in your blood vessels,"" Dr. Nordestgaard said. ""It can be in both the body and the brain and increases the risk of forming small blood clots -- one of the causes of dementia.

""It would be a really good next step to carry out randomised clinical trials over 10 or 30 years, for example, where you give the participants cholesterol-lowering medication and then look at the risk of developing dementia,"" Dr. Nordestgaard added.

Global Collaboration and Funding

The study used data from the UK Biobank, the Copenhagen General Population Study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, the FinnGen study, and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium.

Funding was provided by the Medical Research Council, Independent Research Fund Denmark, and Research Council at the Capital Region of Denmark (LTN).

Before a cell can split into two, it must first copy all of its chromosomes so each new cell inherits a complete set of genetic material. For years, researchers believed that as this process unfolded, the genome's intricate three-dimensional shape temporarily vanished.

After division, scientists thought, the DNA would slowly rebuild its complex, folded structure, which is key to regulating which genes are active in a given cell.

Now, new research from MIT reveals that this long-accepted model isn't quite right. Using a powerful, high-resolution genome mapping method, the team found that small 3D loops -- connections between regulatory DNA elements and genes -- remain intact even during cell division, a stage known as mitosis.

""This study really helps to clarify how we should think about mitosis. In the past, mitosis was thought of as a blank slate, with no transcription and no structure related to gene activity. And we now know that that's not quite the case,"" says Anders Sejr Hansen, an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT. ""What we see is that there's always structure. It never goes away.""

DNA Loops That Help Cells ""Remember""

The researchers also discovered that these DNA loops actually strengthen as chromosomes condense in preparation for division. This tightening brings distant regulatory elements closer together, encouraging them to stick. According to the team, this could allow cells to ""remember"" which genetic interactions existed before division and reestablish them afterward.

""The findings help to bridge the structure of the genome to its function in managing how genes are turned on and off, which has been an outstanding challenge in the field for decades,"" says Viraat Goel PhD '25, the lead author of the study.

Hansen and Edward Banigan, a research scientist at MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, are senior authors of the study, published in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology. Co-authors include MIT professors Leonid Mirny and Gerd Blobel of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.

Mapping the Hidden Architecture of DNA

Over the last two decades, scientists have uncovered that DNA in the cell nucleus organizes itself into 3D loops. Many of these loops allow genes to interact with distant regulatory regions -- sometimes millions of base pairs apart -- while others form during mitosis to pack chromosomes tightly.

Most of this mapping has relied on a tool called Hi-C, a technique co-developed by MIT researchers and Job Dekker at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. Hi-C works by cutting DNA into small fragments and linking together those that are near each other in the cell nucleus before sequencing them to identify which regions interact.

While effective, Hi-C lacks the resolution needed to detect fine-scale interactions between genes and regulatory sequences known as enhancers. Enhancers are short DNA segments that activate genes by binding to promoters, the regions where transcription begins.

A Breakthrough Tool: Region-Capture Micro-C

In 2023, Hansen and colleagues developed a next-generation technique that can map genome structures with up to 1,000 times greater precision. The method, called Region-Capture Micro-C (RC-MC), uses a different enzyme to cut DNA into evenly sized fragments and focuses on a smaller portion of the genome. This allows researchers to create highly detailed 3D maps of targeted DNA regions.

Using RC-MC, the team identified a new structural feature they named ""microcompartments."" These are tiny, densely connected loops that form when nearby enhancers and promoters attach to one another.

Earlier work had shown that microcompartments formed by a different mechanism than larger 3D genome structures, but the team didn't yet understand how. To explore this, they decided to examine what happens to these structures as cells go through mitosis. During this phase, chromosomes compact dramatically to ensure they can be duplicated and evenly distributed between daughter cells. As this occurs, large genome domains known as A/B compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) typically disappear.

Unexpected Stability During Cell Division

The researchers expected microcompartments to vanish as well. To test this, they monitored cells throughout the entire division cycle to see how these loops behaved before and after mitosis.

""During mitosis, it has been thought that almost all gene transcription is shut off. And before our paper, it was also thought that all 3D structure related to gene regulation was lost and replaced by compaction. It's a complete reset every cell cycle,"" Hansen says.

To their surprise, the loops didn't disappear. In fact, they became even more pronounced as cells divided.

""We went into this study thinking, well, the one thing we know for sure is that there's no regulatory structure in mitosis, and then we accidentally found structure in mitosis,"" Hansen says.

Using their technique, the researchers also confirmed that larger structures such as A/B compartments and TADs do disappear during mitosis, as had been seen before.

""This study leverages the unprecedented genomic resolution of the RC-MC assay to reveal new and surprising aspects of mitotic chromatin organization, which we have overlooked in the past using traditional 3C-based assays. The authors reveal that, contrary to the well-described dramatic loss of TADs and compartmentalization during mitosis, fine-scale ""microcompartments"" -- nested interactions between active regulatory elements -- are maintained or even transiently strengthened,"" says Effie Apostolou, an associate professor of molecular biology in medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, who was not involved in the study.

Explaining a Mysterious Burst of Gene Activity

The discovery may also explain a long-observed burst in gene transcription that occurs near the end of mitosis. Since the 1960s, scientists believed transcription stopped entirely during cell division. However, studies in 2016 and 2017 revealed a brief spike of gene activity before it shuts down again.

In their new study, the MIT team found that during mitosis, microcompartments are more likely to be found near the genes that spike during cell division. They also discovered that these loops appear to form as a result of the genome compaction that occurs during mitosis. This compaction brings enhancers and promoters closer together, allowing them to stick together to form microcompartments.

Once formed, the loops that constitute microcompartments may activate gene transcription somewhat by accident, which is then shut off by the cell. When the cell finishes dividing, entering a state known as G1, many of these small loops become weaker or disappear.

""It almost seems like this transcriptional spiking in mitosis is an undesirable accident that arises from generating a uniquely favorable environment for microcompartments to form during mitosis,"" Hansen says. ""Then, the cell quickly prunes and filters many of those loops out when it enters G1.""

Because chromosome compaction can also be influenced by a cell's size and shape, the researchers are now exploring how variations in those features affect the structure of the genome and in turn, gene regulation.

""We are thinking about some natural biological settings where cells change shape and size, and whether we can perhaps explain some 3D genome changes that previously lack an explanation,"" Hansen says. ""Another key question is how does the cell then pick what are the microcompartments to keep and what are the microcompartments to remove when you enter G1, to ensure fidelity of gene expression?""

The research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the Gene Regulation Observatory of the Broad Institute, a Pew-Steward Scholar Award for Cancer Research, the Mathers Foundation, the MIT Westaway Fund, the Bridge Project of the Koch Institute and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, and the Koch Institute Support (core) Grant from the National Cancer Institute.

Nearly half of cannabis flower products sold in Colorado are inaccurately labeled for THC potency, with most overstating how strong they really are. In contrast, cannabis concentrates such as oils and waxes were found to be largely accurate, with 96% matching their listed THC content.

These findings come from a large-scale analysis of cannabis products purchased from licensed dispensaries across Colorado, the first state to legalize recreational marijuana. Published in Scientific Reports, the study represents the most detailed audit yet of legal-market cannabis labeling. It offers new insight into how potent today's cannabis has become, what testing and labeling practices are working, and where the system still falls short.

""Cannabis use has complex and wide-ranging effects, and we are working hard to better understand them,"" said senior author Cinnamon Bidwell, associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at CU Boulder and co-director of the Center for Health and Neuroscience, Genes and Environment (CU Change). ""While that research plays out, we should, at the very least, be providing accurate information about the amount of THC in these products.""

The project was funded by the Institute of Cannabis Research, Colorado's official state research institute, and carried out in partnership with MedPharm Research, LLC, a licensed testing facility, manufacturer, and retailer.

""We want to instill and foster trust in products, and the only way to do that is to continually evaluate and correct any issues that might be discovered,"" said Duncan Mackie, director of pharmacology at MedPharm and a co-author on the paper.

How the Research Was Conducted

Because federal law prevents university scientists from directly purchasing or handling cannabis from the legal market, industry collaboration was essential, explained first author Gregory Giordano, a professional research assistant in CU Boulder's Department of Psychology and Neuroscience.

A MedPharm ""secret shopper"" traveled throughout the state to collect 277 cannabis products from 52 dispensaries across 19 counties. The sample set included 178 flower products (loose flower and pre-rolled joints) and 99 smokable concentrates ranging from distilled liquids to Moroccan hash and waxy ""sugar."" Edibles were not part of this phase of research.

Photographs of each label were provided to Bidwell's team. The samples, identified only by number, were then tested by MedPharm chemists who did not see the original labels to ensure objectivity.

What the Tests Revealed

On average, cannabis flower products contained about 21% THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana. Concentrates averaged 71% THC, with some reaching as high as 84%. By comparison, marijuana in the 1980s typically contained around 8% THC.

""THC content has increased significantly, and we know that greater THC exposure is likely associated with greater risks, including risk of cannabis use disorder and some mental health issues,"" notes Bidwell.

Products were considered ""accurately labeled"" if they contained within 15% of the THC amount shown on the label -- the same threshold the state uses.

About 44% percent of flower products failed to meet that standard, with 54 of those products inflating their THC content on the label and 23 containing more THC than the label indicated.

Either is concerning, the researchers say.

For those using cannabis medically, adequate dosing can be critical. For those using cannabis recreationally, taking more than expected can be dangerous.

Some discrepancies were large -- one flower product was labeled as having 24% THC but had only 16%. But on average, the difference between labeled and observed THC was about 2%.

Only four concentrate products were labeled inaccurately.

""When it comes to concentrates, I would say Colorado gets a good grade for labeling accuracy, but there are some real issues with flower,"" said Bidwell.

Why Potency Labels Can Differ

Previous research in other states has shown that third-party testing labs often inflate THC potency, possibly to gain the business of marketers wanting to attract consumers seeking stronger products.

However, there are other potential explanations for the discrepancy: Concentrates are often made from homogenous oils that are easier to analyze, whereas plants are inherently heterogenous and harder to test.

Small changes in testing protocols could reduce mislabeling, the researchers said.

Beyond THC: Other Cannabinoids Matter Too

The study also looked at several other cannabinoids (active compounds found in the Cannabis sativa plant), including cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). Colorado law requires that companies put CBD levels on the label, a standard that 80% to 85% of products met.

But only 16% of products featured any information at all about other lesser-known cannabinoids.

Notably, CBG and CBGA, which have been associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety properties, was more abundant than CBD in products across categories.

""Focusing on THC on the label can actually do a disservice for consumers, because it creates an environment in which people buy based solely on THC content,"" said Bidwell. ""Our data suggests that multiple other cannabinoids should also be reported on there.""

Looking Ahead: Improving Cannabis Labeling

With continued support from the Institute of Cannabis Research, Bidwell and Mackie plan to expand their work to include edible cannabis products. As more states legalize marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes, they hope their research will help guide better regulatory standards.

Cold, hunger and disease killed some 60% of Napoleon's 500,000-strong army during its retreat from Moscow in 1812.Credit: R. Barbieri et al./Curr. Biol.

Some disease-ridden French soldiers have just received a new diagnosis ‚Äî although it comes about two centuries too late. While retreating from Moscow in 1812, French emperor Napoleon I lost most of his army to hunger, illness and the frigid Russian winter. Now, analysis of some of the fallen soldiers' DNA has uncovered two unsuspected diseases that plagued the troops1.

The results reveal that the reasons for the army's demise might be more complex than was once thought, the authors report today in Current Biology. ‚ÄúThis paper will be really interesting to history buffs,‚Äù says Anne Stone, who researches anthropological genetics at Arizona State University in Tempe. ‚ÄúThis study was done beautifully.‚Äù

Historians had long debated the factors that led to the collapse of Napoleon's army. Eventually, in 2006, researchers studying DNA in some of the soldiers' remains identified two disease agents2: Rickettsia prowazekii, which causes typhus, and Bartonella quintana, which causes trench fever. These two had already seemed likely culprits on the basis of symptoms described in historical records and the discovery of body lice, which spread typhus, on the soldiers' remains.

However, these identifications relied on the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) technique, which creates millions of copies of a short DNA segment. That technique allows researchers to detect DNA sequences for specific pathogens, so it excelled at verifying the presence of microorganisms that historians had already thought were present in the remains. But it isn't as well suited for identifying unsuspected diseases.

After 20 years, it felt like the right time to return to the mystery, says Nicol√°s Rascovan, a co-author of the new study and a palaeogenomicist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Armed with new techniques that can screen ancient DNA for any known pathogen, the team set out to identify other microbes that might have afflicted the troops. The researchers extracted DNA from the teeth of 13 fallen soldiers whose remains had been excavated in Lithuania in 2002. They then used next-generation techniques to sequence millions of different DNA fragments from a sample. That allowed the authors to look for a wide array of pathogens all at once.

AI's inclination to be helpful affects many of the tasks that researchers use LLMs for.Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty

Artificial intelligence (AI) models are 50% more sycophantic than humans, an analysis published this month has found.

The study, which was posted as a preprint1 on the arXiv server, tested how 11 widely used large language models (LLMs) responded to more than 11,500 queries seeking advice, including many describing wrongdoing or harm.

AI Chatbots ‚Äî including ChatGPT and Gemini ‚Äî often cheer users on, give them overly flattering feedback and adjust responses to echo their views, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. Researchers analysing AI behaviours say that this propensity for people-pleasing, known as sycophancy, is affecting how they use AI in scientific research, in tasks from brainstorming ideas and generating hypotheses to reasoning and analyses.

‚ÄúSycophancy essentially means that the model trusts the user to say correct things,‚Äù says Jasper Dekoninck, a data science PhD student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. ‚ÄúKnowing that these models are sycophantic makes me very wary whenever I give them some problem,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúI always double-check everything that they write.‚Äù

Marinka Zitnik, a researcher in biomedical informatics at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, says that AI sycophancy ‚Äúis very risky in the context of biology and medicine, when wrong assumptions can have real costs‚Äù. 

In a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 6 October2, Dekoninck and his colleagues tested whether AI sycophancy affects the technology's performance in solving mathematical problems. The researchers designed experiments using 504 mathematical problems from competitions held this year, altering each theorem statement to introduce subtle errors. They then asked four LLMs to provide proofs for these flawed statements.

The authors considered a model's answer to be sycophantic if it failed to detect the errors in a statement and went on to hallucinate a proof for it.

GPT-5 showed the least sycophantic behaviour, generating sycophantic answers 29% of the time. DeepSeek-V3.1 was the most sycophantic, generating sycophantic answers 70% of the time. Although the LLMs have the capability to spot the errors in the mathematical statements, they ‚Äújust assumed what the user says is correct‚Äù, says Dekoninck.

AI chatbots are already biasing research ‚Äî we must establish guidelines for their use now

AI chatbots are already biasing research ‚Äî we must establish guidelines for their use now

When Dekoninck and his team changed the prompts to ask each LLM to check whether a statement was correct before proving it, DeepSeek's sycophantic answers fell by 34%.

The study is ‚Äúnot really indicative of how these systems are used in real-world performance, but it gives an indication that we need to be very careful with this‚Äù, says Dekoninck.

Simon Frieder, a PhD student studying mathematics and computer science at the University of Oxford, UK, says the work ‚Äúshows that sycophancy is possible‚Äù. But he adds that AI sycophancy tends to appear most clearly when people are using AI chatbots to learn, so future studies should explore ‚Äúerrors that are typical for humans that learn math‚Äù.

Researchers told Nature that AI sycophancy creeps into many of the tasks that they use LLMs for.

Yanjun Gao, an AI researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, uses ChatGPT to summarize papers and organize her thoughts, but says the tools sometimes mirror her inputs without checking the sources. ‚ÄúWhen I have a different opinion than what the LLM has said, it follows what I said instead of going back to the literature‚Äù to try to understand it, she adds.

Zitnik and her colleagues have observed similar patterns when using their multi-agent systems, which integrate several LLMs to carry out complex, multi-step processes such as analysing large biological data sets, identifying drug targets and generating hypotheses.

Silicon is a promising negative electrode material for high-energy batteries, but its volume changes during cell cycling cause rapid degradation, limiting its loading to about 10‚Äâwt.% in conventional graphite/Si composite electrodes. Overcoming this threshold requires evidence-based design for the formulation of advanced electrodes. Here we combine multimodal operando imaging techniques, assisted by structural and electrochemical characterizations, to elucidate the multiscale electro-chemo-mechanical processes in graphite/Si composite negative electrodes. We demonstrate that the electrochemical cycling stability of Si particles strongly depends on the design of intraparticle nanoscale porous structures, and the encapsulation and loss of active Si particles result in excessive charging current being directed to the graphite particles, increasing the risk of lithium plating. We also show that heterogeneous strains are present between graphite and Si particles, in the carbon-binder domain and the electrode's porous structures. Focusing on the volume expansion of the electrode during electrochemical cycling, we prove that the rate performance and Si utilization are heavily influenced by the expansion of the carbon-binder domain and the decrease in porosity. Based on this acquired knowledge, we propose a tailored double-layer graphite/Si composite electrode design that exhibits lower polarization and capacity decay compared with conventional graphite/Si electrode formulations.

High-energy lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are pivotal to the electric vehicle revolution. However, graphite, the state-of-the-art negative electrode active material in LiBs, has a limited theoretical capacity (372‚ÄâmAh‚Äâg‚Åª¬π). Thus, battery scientists focused on silicon (Si), which offers nearly ten times higher theoretical capacity (3,579‚ÄâmAh‚Äâg‚Åª¬π). However, the practical implementation of Si in LiB negative electrodes is hampered by rapid capacity fading associated with detrimental volume changes during charge‚Äìdischarge cycling.

Nanostructured Si electrode active materials1,2 improve the cell's specific discharge capacities, but their high surface area leads to excessive electrolyte consumption, continuous formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low Coulombic efficiencies of the cell. Moreover, their fabrication processes are cost-intensive. A more scalable strategy consists of blending micrometre-sized Si (Œº-Si) with graphite, offering improved electrical conductivity, buffering of the Si volume expansion and electrode manufacturing compatibility. Yet, practical Si content is limited to ‚â§10‚Äâwt.% to guarantee adequate LiB's cycle life3,4. Porous Si (refs. 5,6) is reported to mitigate volume expansion, but the fundamental understanding of nanoscale effects is limited. Three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous graphite/Œº-Si electrodes (that is, structurally and compositionally varied architectures) are also considered as a viable alternative to conventional design. However, the electro-chemo-mechanical processes of these 3D-architectured electrodes are not yet fully understood despite various recent studies7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Operando transmission electron microscopy captures atomic-scale electrochemical lithiation17,18 but lacks electrode-level insight. Macroscopic techniques (for example, dilatometry19 and fibre-optic sensing20) capture global expansion but miss local heterogeneity. Operando X-ray computed tomography (CT) combined with digital volume correlation (DVC)21,22 enables 3D visualization of morphological changes and local strain11,23,24, yet has rarely mapped these phenomena to the heterogeneous distribution of Si, graphite, carbon-binder domain (CBD) and electrode's porosity. In particular, the role of CBD microstructure and phase-specific strain remains unclear and requires multimodal imaging for adequate investigations. Electrochemical techniques complement imaging25,26. For example, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are essential for assessing interfacial and charge-transfer processes27,28,29,30, but their interpretation generally relies on an equivalent circuit modelling approach31,32, which can be ambiguous. For this reason, the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method becomes popular for analysing raw EIS measurement data. Indeed, DRT assists in developing equivalent circuit models that are physically meaningful and less likely to be overparameterized33,34,35. In the case of Si-based electrodes, the DRT approach enables the distinction between SEI and charge transfer resistance and tracks their evolution during battery cycling36.

In this study, we present physics-driven, evidence-guided design of high-performance graphite/Œº-Si composite electrodes. Operando optical microscopy coupled with digital image correlation (DIC) captures strain heterogeneity and competing lithiation dynamics at the particle and electrode levels. Operando synchrotron X-ray CT with DVC examines 3D microstructural evolutions, highlighting how the CBD and electrode porosity affect lithiation and strain. Five key materials design challenges are identified: (1) CBD trade-offs between capacity and electronic transport, (2) porosity trade-offs between capacity and ionic transport, (3) silicon loss leading to lithium plating, (4) graphite enclosure delaying silicon lithiation and (5) silicon expansion blocking electrolyte access. These insights inform the fabrication of a double-layer (DL) graphite/Œº-Si composite electrode with more uniform lithiation, lower polarization and improved cycling performance (when tested against a lithium metal counter electrode using a Li-containing non-aqueous electrolyte solution) compared with conventional graphite/Œº-Si composite electrode architectures.

The morphological evolution of a graphite/Œº-Si composite working electrode (45‚Äâwt.% polycrystalline porous Si, 7‚Äì10‚ÄâŒºm, particle porosity 0.35) is first visualized using operando optical microscopy (pixel size 0.15‚ÄâŒºm) during lithiation at a current density of 2.5‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2, using Li metal as the counter electrode and a Li-containing non-aqueous electrolyte solution. The experimental set-up is detailed in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. Full lithiation timesteps are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Strain maxima identified by DIC align closely with Si particles (Fig. 1a‚Äìc,g,h, cyan arrows). Substantial electrode expansion is observed and quantified in Extended Data Fig. 1a. Strain develops gradually until graphite reaches stage III (dark blue), then increases linearly as it transitions to stage II (red), slowing again at a high state of charge (SOC) owing to SOC gradients in the low-porosity/large-thickness electrode.

a‚Äìr, The microstructural evolution at 40% SOC (a), 60% SOC (b) and 100% SOC (c) is shown alongside the differential (diff.) displacement field at 40% SOC (d), 60% SOC (e) and 100% SOC (f), and accumulative strain at 40% SOC (g), 60% SOC (h) and 100% SOC (i). j‚Äìr, The microstructural evolution at 40% SOC (j), 60% SOC (k) and 100% SOC (l) is shown alongside the differential (diff.) displacement field at 40% SOC (m), 60% SOC (n) and 80% SOC (o), and accumulative strain at 40% SOC (p), 60% SOC (q) and 80% SOC (r) as a function of charging for the second lithiation cycle (note the different scale bars of displacement and strain field between the first and second lithiation). Cyan arrows point at two representative Si particles experiencing volume expansion and fracture. s‚Äìz, In ROI 1, the evolution of particle morphology (s) and strain (t) during Cycle 1 is compared with the particle morphology (u) and strain (v) in Cycle 2. In ROI 2, the evolution of particle morphology (w), and strain (x) during Cycle 1 is compared with the particle morphology (y) and strain (z) in Cycle 2. The comparisons of the two ROIs reveal the competing reaction kinetics at the particle level as a function of SOC. Compared with ROI 1 (s‚Äìv), the central Si particle in ROI 2 (w‚Äìz) is tightly surrounded by the adjacent graphite particles.

The differential displacement fields (Fig. 1d‚Äìf) show expansion aligned with the lithiation direction and a displacement gradient due to electrolyte transport limitations. This gradient can cause particle decohesion and disrupt electrical integrity. Expansion rate decreases with SOC (Fig. 1d‚Äìf). Accumulative strain maps (Fig. 1g‚Äìi) reveal maximum strain (up to 1.5) near the electrode edge, where SOC is highest. Strain is heterogeneous, with Si particles (cyan arrows) showing local maxima (0.75‚Äì1.5), far exceeding that in graphite (approximately 0.2). These phase-specific strains are decoupled and presented in Extended Data Fig. 1b (more details in Methods, Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 and Supplementary Note 2). Both phases follow similar macroscopic trends, suggesting a coordinated and synchronous deformation during the first lithiation. High porosity (0.48) buffers large Si strain, limiting overall expansion of the composite electrode to 20%. At SOC >70%, reduced porosity and increased Si volume make Si's contribution to global strain more pronounced, as indicated by the similar trend in the expansion curves of the electrode and Si (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b), where the expansion of graphite particles reaches a plateau. Full lithiation and strain development are shown in Supplementary Videos 1 and 2, respectively. Minimal lithium-ion exchange is seen during relaxation (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6), and some Si particles become electrochemically inactive in the second cycle (Supplementary Video 3) due to electrical disconnection, also reflected by low initial cell's Coulombic efficiency (approximately 50%; Supplementary Fig. 7). This latter aspect is discussed in Supplementary Note 4.

Distinct lithiation kinetics are observed in the second lithiation (Fig. 1j‚Äìr and Supplementary Video 3): Si particles lithiate first, as shown by their heterogeneous expansion (Fig. 1j,m) preceding the colour change of the graphite particles. This shift is expected, because amorphous Si lithiates at higher potentials (0.4‚ÄâV) than graphite (0.2‚ÄâV)3,37. By 40% SOC, electrode expansion remains minimal due to reduced Si expansion‚Äîcaused by residual strain (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and mechanical damage from the first cycle (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Note 5). The mild localized Si strain is buffered by the static graphite matrix (that is, before lithiation onset) and accommodated by porosity recovery from the prior delithiation (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). The electrode tested in the optical cell shows limited global strain recovery, probably due to the absence of compressive constraints along the lithiation direction. After 50% SOC, strain develops in graphite (stage II, red), aligning with the onset of global expansion (Fig. 1k,n), implying its role as a mechanical backbone. These findings complement the results obtained from other techniques, such as dilatometry19,38 and X-ray diffraction39,40,41 that deconvolves the graphite and Si strains via Rietveld refinement. The strain evolution in the second cycle can be seen in Supplementary Video 4.

Local reaction kinetics between graphite and Si particles are examined in two regions of interest (ROIs) (Fig. 1s‚Äìz and Supplementary Fig. 10), where the central Si in ROI 2 is more tightly surrounded by graphite particles. After full delithiation, Si does not fully revert to its original size due to irreversible mechanical damage (Fig. 1u and Supplementary Note 5), leading to lower strain in the second cycle (Fig. 1v). Si expansion precedes graphite lithiation in the second cycle, but exceptions exist: in ROI 2, a central Si particle (Fig. 1y, red arrow) encapsulated by graphite remains inactive until 90% SOC (Fig. 1z and Supplementary Video 5), probably due to local electrolyte deficiency from densification. Li‚Å∫ initially intercalates into graphite before accessing the Si particle, underscoring the influence of spatial arrangement on lithiation kinetics. This could cause Si underutilization and premature graphite overcharging. Notably, the graphite transition from stage III (SOC 0.23) to stage I (SOC 0.95) completes merely within a 30% SOC window (Fig. 1y), indicating current redistribution due to inactive Si‚Äîraising the local lithiation current in graphite and lithium plating risk.

X-ray nano-CT (voxel size 64‚Äânm) reveals that the commercial ¬µ-Si particles (supplied by E-magy) possess unidirectional tubular porosity (Fig. 2a) formed during the material synthesis through a directional solidification process. Pore centrelines and size distribution are visualized in Fig. 2b, with 3D porosity rendering in Fig. 2c. Some particles also show mixed morphologies‚Äîtubular (green) and planar (blue) porosity‚Äîas seen in Fig. 2d and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy images (Supplementary Fig. 11). To assess how nanoporous morphologies affect cycling stability, three Si particles were tracked via operando optical imaging. Particle A, with horizontal tubular pores (Fig. 2e, xz plane), transitions from linear to uniform punctate porosity by 26% SOC. This reorganization, with decreased pore size and porosity (Fig. 2f), accommodates volume change and indicates a crystalline-to-amorphous transition. After 26% SOC, the transformation from heterogeneous to homogeneous porosity is complete. Further lithiation causes marked expansion and new pore formation. A major crack is observed at 100% SOC (highlighted in red). Particle B, with punctate pores (Fig. 2g, xy plane), shows stable morphology and no cracking. Particle C combines punctate and linear porosity (Fig. 2i, white arrow), with its 3D morphology shown in Fig. 2d. Linear regions undergo similar reorganization and cracking as particle A. The thickness maps demonstrate that the pore size and porosity increase in all three particles at high SOCs.

The corresponding pore size evolutions are compared between particle A (f), particle B (h) and particle C (j). Both particle A (e) and particle C (i) contain heterogeneous linear porous structures but with different orientations, whereas particle B (g) has homogeneous porosity. The evolution of particle contours and the long axis orientations are compared between particle A (k), particle B (l) and particle C (m). n, The change of particle size as a function of the SOC for the three particles. Red lines in e and i at 100% SOC highlight the crack formation.

Moreover, particles A and C exhibit highly anisotropic expansion, with maximum swelling perpendicular to their tubular pore orientation, while particle B (with punctate porosity) expands isotropically in the xy plane. This difference is visualized in Fig. 2k‚Äìm, with overlapping contours (blue and pink) indicating minimal expansion below 20% SOC. Figure 2n quantifies a three-stage expansion in particles A and C: (i) pore reorganization (0‚Äì20%), (ii) linear expansion (20‚Äì60%) and (iii) reduced expansion beyond 60% SOC, probably due to cracking-induced transport limitations. Particle B expands nearly linearly. These trends highlight how pore geometry influences the electrochemical cycling stability of Si particles: tubular porosity enables controlled swelling, while planar porosity leads to uneven, anisotropic expansion and cracking. A capped SOC of 60‚Äì70%, corresponding to the inflection point after linear expansion in Fig. 2n, is recommended to preserve structural integrity and prolong the cycle life.

While operando optical microscopy offers high-resolution insight into intra- and interparticle processes, synchrotron X-ray CT complements it with 3D visualization and clear phase contrast (voxel size 0.325‚ÄâŒºm; Supplementary Fig. 12). Here, three different graphite/Si composite electrodes (two graphite/Œº-Si composite electrodes with different Si loadings and one graphite/Œº-SiOx composite electrode) are compared to elucidate the interplay between microstructure, physical and electrochemical performance.

Figure 3a,b show the 3D microstructure of a graphite/Œº-Si electrode (5.7‚ÄâmAh‚Äâcm‚àí2, 17‚Äâwt.% Si) before and after charging, revealing approximately 20% thickness expansion and increased interparticle spacing (Supplementary Video 6). Cross-sections (Fig. 3c,d) illustrate crystalline Si (white) transforming into amorphous (dark grey), becoming indistinguishable from CBD (yellow circles). Most Si particles lithiate (Fig. 3e,f), though some remain pristine. Notably, CBD expansion (20‚Äâwt.%) remarkably contributes to electrode swelling (Fig. 3c,d, green circles). This feature is not caused by any unresolved submicrometre Si particles within the CBD (Supplementary Note 6). To support this, X-ray nano-CT (voxel resolution 0.064‚ÄâŒºm) of a Li||CBD laboratory-scale cell (Fig. 3g‚Äìj; potential profile in Supplementary Fig. 13) displays approximately 25% CBD thickening, accompanied by coarsening and porosity loss‚Äîlinked to SEI formation and electrolyte uptake42. This causes reduced Li‚Å∫ flux and connectivity (Fig. 3k‚Äìn). However, CBD expansion is not observed upon electrolyte solution immersion alone (Supplementary Fig. 14). Figure 3o,p compares Si utilization between the 8.5‚Äâwt.% and 17‚Äâwt.% Si composite electrodes, whereas Fig. 3q,r summarizes the microstructural evolution of the latter, which are discussed in Supplementary Note 7.

However, lithiation dynamics differ markedly in a densely packed graphite/Œº-SiOx composite electrode (4.5‚ÄâmAh‚Äâcm‚àí2, 5‚Äâwt.% SiOx) collected from a commercial 3.35‚ÄâAh INR18650-MJ1 cell, which has lower porosity (0.29) and trace CBD content. The 3D reconstructed volume is shown in Fig. 4a. An ROI near the separator containing four SiOx particles (A, B, C and D) is shown in Fig. 4b(i)‚Äì(iv). Surprisingly, particle A (‚àº10‚ÄâŒºm) lithiates first (indicated by the change of contrast in Fig. 4b(iii)) despite being larger than C and D. Particle B, with less graphite contact and closer to the separator, lithiates after A, confirming that electrical connectivity dominates over electrolyte access. At 100% SOC, particle D remains inactive (Fig. 4b(iv)), displaying strong lithiation heterogeneity. Figure 4c(i)‚Äì(iii) shows this heterogeneity across the x‚Äìz plane as SOC increases. Along depth, only the largest particle 1 reacts at 40% SOC (Fig. 4c(ii)); by 100% SOC, particles 2 and 3 are lithiated, while particle 4 remains inactive. The delayed lithiation of particle 2 is probably due to graphite enclosure hindering electrolyte access‚Äîconsistent with ROI 2 in Fig. 1y,z. The full dynamic evolution is shown in Supplementary Video 7.

Source data

The local microstructures are analysed to reveal the cause of the reaction heterogeneity between particle 1 (fastest) and particle 4 (slowest) (Fig. 4d(i)‚Äì(iv)). Particle 1 has an extensive SiOx‚Äìgraphite contact area (yellow voxels), which augments during lithiation, fostering electronic transport despite its distance from the current collector. Particle 4 remains physically isolated (Fig. 4c(i)‚Äì(iii)), limiting its lithiation kinetics. Thus, both initial contact area and its evolution‚Äîalongside particle enclosure‚Äîdrive heterogeneity. Pristine SiOx versus SOC is visualized in Fig. 4e(i)‚Äì(iii). Near the separator, more underutilized SiOx particles are limited by electron transport (Fig. 4e(iv) and Supplementary Note 8). The SiOx particles (red) and the graphite‚ÄìSiOx contact areas (yellow) are visualized in Fig. 4f and summarized in Fig. 4g. Most particles exhibit 0.4‚Äì0.8 surface coverage. Particles outside this range show minimal lithiation up to 60% SOC: low-contact particles lack electrons; high-contact ones are ion-blocked by graphite encapsulation. At 100% SOC, many top-half SiOx particles remain electrochemically inactive despite the good surface contact ratio between 0.4 and 0.8, caused by the volume expansion-induced disruption of electron-transport pathways formed by graphite particles (65 vol.% backbone), as the interfacial contact between graphite particles is reduced by 50% at 100% SOC (Supplementary Fig. 15). Figure 4g,h visualizes the size distribution of the porosity at 40% and 100% SOC, with quantitative analysis provided in Fig. 4i. This leads to deteriorating electrolyte transport and is characterized in terms of the resultant Li+ ion flux in the pore phase (Fig. 4j,k), and the volume-averaged porosity/tortuosity factor (Fig. 4l) as a function of SOC.

Figure 5a‚Äìc compares the volumetric strain measured by DVC technique43 in the graphite/Œº-SiOx and graphite/Œº-Si (17‚Äâwt.% Si) composite electrodes. The graphite/Œº-SiOx electrode exhibits relatively homogeneous strain, except near the separator, where higher strain correlates with electrolyte concentration gradients in the dense structure (porosity 0.29; Fig. 5a(i)‚Äì(ii)). This gradient is mild at 0.3‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2 but becomes pronounced at 4.5‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2 (Supplementary Fig. 16). By contrast, the graphite/Œº-Si electrode exhibit highly heterogeneous and larger strain across graphite, Si, and CBD (Fig. 5b,c). Some particles near the current collector remain electrochemically inactive due to delamination (Fig. 5b(ii); see evidence in Supplementary Fig. 17). A porous graphite particle exhibits a relatively low strain (Fig. 5b(ii), black arrow), suggesting internal porosity buffers expansion. In the second cycle, strain at 100% SOC decreases (Fig. 5c(ii)), primarily due to structural damage (that is, cracking), degradation and loss of active Si particles, which result in high residual strain and reduced capacity following the first cycle, as observed in the optical microscopy measurements. The porous graphite particles also exhibit lower strain in the second cycle (Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 9). Distinct strain versus depth profiles are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2 and discussed in Supplementary Note 9.

Note that the separator in the graphite/Œº-SiOx electrode in a and b is hidden to better visualize the strain gradient from the electrode‚Äìseparator interface into the deeper regions.

Source data

All three electrodes exhibit a two-stage expansion profile macroscopically (Fig. 5d). In graphite/Œº-Si electrodes, expansion rate increases beyond approx. 50% SOC. The underlying mechanism is elucidated through ROI analysis of the X-ray CT data (Fig. 5e). The macroporosity (black voxels) and the nanoporosity within the CBD (dark grey) are progressively filled by the expansion of CBD (yellow circle) and Si (green arrow) by 40% SOC, explaining the steady, linear global expansion below 50% SOC, primarily driven by the volumetric dominant CBD and graphite (65 vol.%). Si (approximately 5 vol.%) plays a local role early on, evident from the amorphous LixSi shell around shrinking crystalline Si (Extended Data Fig. 4). Hence, varying Si loading (8.5 versus 17‚Äâwt.%) has little effect on early-stage expansion, consistent with the graphite/Œº-SiOx electrode's strain despite different particle-level behaviour (70% versus 22% strain for Si versus SiOx). Above 50% SOC, expansion rises sharply as porosity is exhausted (Supplementary Video 8). Notably, the commercial graphite/Œº-SiOx electrode shows a reduced strain rate beyond 50% SOC, probably due to increased lithiation gradient (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and the early completion of SiOx particle expansion, as shown in Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 18, although a few particles with poor reactant access continue lithiation beyond this point.

The impact of heterogeneous porosity and CBD on the reaction and volumetric strain is visualized in Fig. 5g‚Äìk. CBD-rich, low-porosity regions (dashed orange circles) exhibit higher graphite strain than CBD-poor, high-porosity areas (blue circles) at 60% SOC (Fig. 5h,i), and becomes more serious at 100% SOC (Fig. 5j,k). This suggests that the CBD that ensures percolated electronic contact plays a critical role in lithiation homogeneity. Near the current collector, strain is lower due to limited electrolyte access, exacerbated by reduced nano- and microporosity from CBD and active material expansion. Notably, intraparticle strain separation (Fig. 5j, white arrows) is observed in less lithiated graphite, arising from its phase separation phenomenon44. In-plane and through-thickness strain variations are detailed in Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Note 10. However, Si strain could not be reliably measured due to greyscale changes during lithiation (Extended Data Fig. 4a), which obscure boundaries and compromise DVC algorithm21. This aspect may affect CBD segmentation (Supplementary Note 11 and Supplementary Fig. 19). Remaining crystalline Si cores (Extended Data Fig. 4b) indicate incomplete lithiation, probably due to limited reactant access in dense CBD regions.

The key challenges for material design in graphite/Œº-Si composite electrodes based on our findings are the following: (1) low CBD boosts energy content of the cell but limits Si utilization, while high CBD causes severe expansion and porosity loss, degrading rate performance; (2) high porosity fosters electrolyte transport but sacrifices energy and electrical contact/percolation; (3) Si loss during cycling overloads nearby graphite, which is risky and may trigger early lithium plating; (4) tight graphite enclosures delay Si lithiation, lowering its activity; and (5) Si expansion obstructs electrolyte access to deeper regions. Building on these insights, we develop a heterogeneous DL graphite/Œº-Si composite electrode, in which the top layer (separator side) consists of 82‚Äâwt.% graphite + 10‚Äâwt.% Si + 8% CBD (3% binder‚Äâ+‚Äâ5% C45) and the bottom layer consists of 20‚Äâwt.% graphite + 60‚Äâwt.% Si + 20‚Äâwt.% CBD (10% binder‚Äâ+‚Äâ10% C45). The total Si content is 35‚Äâwt.%. A homogeneous reference electrode (HM) with identical composition is also prepared (51‚Äâwt.% graphite + 35‚Äâwt.% Si + 14‚Äâwt.% CBD (7% binder‚Äâ+‚Äâ7% C45)). Figure 6a‚Äìd and Fig. 6e‚Äìh present a comparison of the morphological evolution of the same cross-sectional slice in the HM and DL electrode, respectively, obtained by operando X-ray CT, before and after charging at 0.45‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2 in a non-aqueous Li metal coin cell configuration.

Source data

The DL electrode exhibits a lower initial thickness due to the thinner, Si/CBD-rich bottom layer, which undergoes two cycles of drying and shrinkage processes and is more prone to shrinkage due to the smaller particle size. Most Si particles undergo lithiation, evident from the greyscale shift from white to grey (Fig. 6a,c versus Fig. 6b,d, and Fig. 6e,g versus Fig. 6f,h). However, some grainy Si remains underlithiated (Fig. 6d,h), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 20. Supplementary Fig. 20e,f reveals that Si capacity in the DL electrode mainly originates from the bottom layer, while in HM, lithiation is more evenly distributed, although a mild gradient is visible due to limited porosity, which may become more serious in the following cycles. Thickness expansion in HM is less (52%, 67‚Äì102‚ÄâŒºm) than that in DL (73%, 47.3‚Äì81.8‚ÄâŒºm) because the latter preserves top-layer porosity (Fig. 6f) to ensure electrolyte access to the bottom layer; by contrast, the porosity in HM is largely filled (Fig. 6b).

Electrochemical cycling data of Li metal cells at 0.9‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2 comprising DL and HM working electrodes are reported in Fig. 6i,j (for visual clarity, the first formation cycle, marked by a large crystalline-amorphous transition plateau, is not reported in Fig. 6i,j). A faster capacity fade is observed in the cell with the HM electrode at the end of 16th cycle (72% versus 15%; Fig. 6j). The Li||HM cell shows severe capacity fade from both graphite and Si, evident from the reduced area of all cathodic (lithiation) peaks in differential capacity curves (Fig. 6k), especially A‚Ä≤ and E‚Ä≤, indicating Si loss (see interpretations in Supplementary Note 12). Peak shifts (B, C and D to lower potentials; E‚Ä≤ to higher) also suggest increased polarization. These effects are minimal in the Li||DL cell (Fig. 6l), indicating a reduced microstructural and electrochemical degradation. Analysis of the EIS measurements (Fig. 6m,n) further substantiate this. Indeed, in the Li||HM cell, total impedance (Rohm‚Äâ+‚ÄâRsei‚Äâ+‚ÄâRct) rises from 11 to 23‚ÄâŒ© by the 13th cycle (50% SOC), while the one of the Li||DL cell remains stable (approximately 10‚ÄâŒ©), increasing slightly to 14‚ÄâŒ© by the 23rd cycle (Supplementary Fig. 21). DRT analysis reveals stable contact resistance and even a reduction in charge transfer and SEI resistance (Extended Data Fig. 5), attributed to improved local electrical contact, enhanced electrolyte accessibility in the bottom layer, better structural integrity provided by the graphite-rich top buffer layer and an increased parallel-connected reaction surface. Detailed interpretation is provided in Supplementary Note 13. This highlights the effectiveness of the DL composite electrode design to suppress the mechanical, microstructural and electrochemical degradation during battery operation at the Li metal coin cell level.

This study provides new insights into 3D microstructural and strain evolutions, spatial dynamics of heterogeneous lithiation and performance degradation in graphite/Œº-Si composite electrodes, assisted by multimodal multiscale operando imaging and advanced characterization techniques.

Anisotropic expansion and early cracking occur in Si particles with planar, heterogeneous nanoporosity, whereas those with homogeneous, tubular nanoporosity exhibit isotropic strain and structural integrity. Simultaneous Si and graphite deformation is observed during the first lithiation, whereas it is asynchronous in the following cycles. The impact of Si particle expansion on global strain is less pronounced at low SOCs, buffered by internal nanoporosity and static graphite particles (from the second cycle), but accelerates at high SOCs (>50%) due to electrode porosity exhaustion‚Äîdriven largely by 20% CBD expansion. Structural damage causes a high residual strain of Si particles (75‚Äì85%), leading to trapped lithium and loss of active material. A capped SOC (up to 80%) is necessary to limit particle damage. Microstructural heterogeneity influences both reaction kinetics and mechanics. Graphite-encapsulated Si lithiates slowly or remains inactive. High CBD/low electrode porosity correlates with higher lithiation/strain. Although counter-intuitive, larger Si particles can lithiate faster than smaller ones provided adequate electronic contacts. A Si‚Äìgraphite surface contact ratio of 0.4‚Äì0.8 is suggested as optimal to effectively balance electron and ion transport for efficient lithiation.

Our findings identify five major challenges in the microstructural design: (1) low CBD boosts energy content of the composite electrode in Li metal cell configuration but limits Si utilization, while high CBD causes severe expansion and porosity loss; (2) high electrode porosity fosters electrolyte transport but sacrifices energy and electrical percolation; (3) Si loss during cycling overloads nearby graphite, which is risky and may trigger early lithium plating; (4) tight graphite enclosures delay Si lithiation, lowering its activity; and (5) Si expansion obstructs electrolyte access to deeper regions of the electrode.

To overcome these issues, we design a DL heterogeneous graphite/Œº-Si composite electrode (35‚Äâwt.% Si), featuring a porous, graphite-rich, CBD-poor top layer (towards the separator) and a Si-rich, CBD-rich bottom layer. This architecture provides four key advantages: (1) spatial separation mitigates graphite overcharging and releases encapsulated Si; (2) the porous top layer maintains fast electrolyte transport; (3) the graphite-rich top buffers expansion from the Si-rich bottom, while compressive stress preserves the structural and interfacial stability of Si particles; and (4) the high CBD content in the bottom layer ensures robust electrical contact during cycling. Indeed, this design improves capacity retention compared with conventional electrodes tested in a laboratory-scale non-aqueous Li metal cell configuration (72% versus 15% over 16 cycles).

In summary, this study reveals the impact of intraparticle nanoporosity, CBD evolution, short- and long-range 3D architectures on the lithiation heterogeneity and cyclic stability of the graphite/Œº-Si composite electrode. Despite the low technology readiness level45, the proof of concept of the DL composite electrode design tested in Li metal coin cell configuration proposed in this work has shown promising results. Further optimization towards high-potential Li-ion cell architecture and evaluation of material scalability are required before this electrode design can be considered a viable candidate for practical large-area Li-ion batteries46.

For the homogeneous composite electrode, 2‚Äâwt.% carboxymethyl cellulose binder (CMC, molecular weight Mw‚Äâ=‚Äâ90,000, degree of substitution DS: 0.7, Sigma-Aldrich) was first added into a buffer solution with pH‚Äâ3 consisting of deionized water (Sigma-Aldrich, conductivity ‚â§4.3‚ÄâŒºS‚Äâcm‚àí1 at 25‚Äâ¬∞C), citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ‚â•99.5%) and KOH (Sigma-Aldrich, 45‚Äâwt.% in H2O). After sonicating (CREWORKS) and stirring (ANZESER Magnetic Stirrer) at 25.8‚Äâ¬∞C in air for at least 60‚Äâmin, 10‚Äâwt.% conductive carbon (C45, Timcal) was added into the slurry and sealed in a jar for 30-min mixing at 25.8‚Äâ¬∞C in air using a planetary centrifugal mixer (THINKY ARE-250); subsequently, graphite powder (LiFun Technology, average particle size 17.09‚ÄâŒºm, purity 99.99%) was added into the slurry and mixed at 2,000‚Äârpm for 15‚Äâmin, followed by the addition of Œº-Si powder (particle size 7‚Äì10‚ÄâŒºm, purity >99%, supplied by E-magy for optical measurements, and SILGRAIN Elkem ((D50: 5‚Äâ¬µm; 50% of the particle is smaller than 5‚Äâ¬µm), purity >98.25%) for X-ray CT), which was also mixed at 2,000‚Äârpm for 15‚Äâmin. The second binder styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR, Targray) was then added into the slurry (CMC/SBR ratio 2:1) and mixed at 2,000‚Äârpm in Thinky mixture for 15‚Äâmin. On the automatic coating machine, the slurry was then coated onto a 15-Œºm copper foil (MTI, purity ‚â•99.8%, non-dendritic, cleaned by isopropanol wipes after being attached to the coating plate) using a doctor blade with a gap distance of 250‚ÄâŒºm to obtain a final electrode thickness of 90‚ÄâŒºm (¬±2‚ÄâŒºm), after drying at 60‚Äâ¬∞C using the built-in heating function on the coating bench for 30‚Äâmin in air atmosphere, which was then calendered to the desired thickness using lab roller calendaring machine (MTI). Specifically, the electrode coating was passed through the gap between a rotating roller and a plate, which was collected at the outlet and fed through the gap again to ensure a uniform thickness. A gradual calendering process with three incremental steps was used: an initial large gap corresponding to 30% of the targeted thickness reduction, followed by a medium gap at 60% and concluding with a final gap achieving 100% of the reduction. At each intermediate and final step, the thickness was measured by a benchtop thickness gauge (DML).

For the DL electrode, the Si-rich bottom layer was coated using the same procedure without calendering; subsequently, the graphite-rich top layer was coated onto the dried bottom layer. The two layers were calendered together after drying. The mass loadings of Si for different electrodes used in this study have been specified in the corresponding context. Pure-CBD electrode coatings were prepared following the same procedure as for the graphite/Si composite electrodes, except that 90‚Äâwt.% C45 carbon was dispersed in a 10‚Äâwt.% binder solution (CMC‚Äâ+‚ÄâSBR) without graphite or Si. Owing to the fine particle size of C45, the slurry was coated using a 100-¬µm doctor blade gap, and no calendering was applied.

The graphite/SiO‚Çì composite electrode was harvested from a commercial 3.35‚ÄâAh INR18650-MJ1 cylindrical cell. The cell was first discharged to 2.0‚ÄâV using a constant current‚Äìconstant potential (CC‚ÄìCP) protocol at C/20. In an Ar-filled glovebox (H2O‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.5 ppm, O2‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.5 ppm), the metallic casing was carefully cut open and peeled off from the positive terminal with an insulated cutter, and then the spirally wound electrodes and separator were unrolled. The positive electrode, negative electrode and separator were separated and rinsed twice in dimethyl carbonate (DMC, 2‚Äâmin each) to remove residual electrolyte, followed by overnight drying inside the glovebox. On the negative electrode, the unwanted coating from one side of the double-sided Cu foil was removed by gently wiping with lint-free tissue moistened with isopropanol and deionized water. Finally, 15‚Äâmm discs of the single-sided graphite/SiO‚Çì composite electrode were punched out using a precision disc cutter.

A rectangular stripe of working electrode (9‚ÄâmAh‚Äâcm‚àí2, the mass ratio of Si, graphite, C45 and binder is 45:45:5:5, 2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚Äâmm2), Li metal counter electrode (MTI, 99.9% lithium, 250‚ÄâŒºm, diameter 15.6‚Äâmm), 260-Œºm-thick glass fibre separator (Whatman, 10‚Äâmm diameter, 1.6‚Äâ¬µm pore size) and other components were assembled into an ECC-Opto-Std optical cell (EL-cell), as can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 1. A 4‚ÄâK high-resolution Keyence VHX-7000 optical microscope with the depth-composition mode was used to capture the images from top view using the objective lens of 700√ó. The optical cell was charged at 2.5‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2 (lateral current density) at 25.8‚Äâ¬∞C using a potentiostat (Gamry Instruments). Images were taken at a frequency of 1‚Äâmin per frame.

Graphite/Œº-Si composite working electrodes (diameter 15‚Äâmm), Li counter electrode, Celgard 2325 separator (diameter 19‚Äâmm) were assembled into CR2032 coin cells (crimped at 560‚Äâtonnes‚Äâm‚àí2 (800‚Äâpsi) in an Ar-filled glovebox at 26‚Äâ¬∞C, with H2O and O2 content less than 0.5‚Äâppm). Sixty microlitres of 1‚ÄâM lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in 30 vol.% ethylene carbonate and 70 vol. % ethyl methyl carbonate‚Äâ+‚Äâ2‚Äâwt.% vinylene carbonate (VC)‚Äâ+‚Äâ15‚Äâwt.% fluoroethylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ‚â•99.5%, prepared within 2‚Äâmonths, stored in aluminium containers in Ar-filled glovebox at 26‚Äâ¬∞C, with H2O and O2 content less than 0.5‚Äâppm, transferred by polypropylene pipette tip) were used as the liquid electrolyte solution. The assembly of the Li||CBD coin cells followed the same procedure. Cyclic voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 0.1‚ÄâmV‚Äâs‚àí1 in a potential range of 0.005‚Äì1.0‚ÄâV versus Li|Li+. Potentiostatic EIS was conducted within a frequency range of 10‚ÄâmHz to 1‚ÄâMHz with an a.c. signal of 10‚ÄâmV. Ten points were taken per decade. After being charged to the targeting SOC at each step, the cells were relaxed at open circuit potential for 3‚Äâh before the EIS measurement was conducted. The lithiation test of the CBD electrode was conducted using a CC‚ÄìCP protocol with a lithiating current density of 0.028‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2 and a potential cut-off of 5‚ÄâmV. All electrochemical experiments were carried out under ambient laboratory conditions, with the environment air-conditioned to 25.8‚Äâ¬∞C. The raw data acquired from the EIS measurements are used for the DRT analysis using the open-source MATLAB code DRTtools available in the literature34. The inductance and diffusion frequency regimes are not included in the fitting of the raw data. The regularization parameter was set to 0.01 for all fittings. All electrochemical tests were performed on at least three cells to ensure consistency and reproducibility, with single-cell data representing the average of multiple cells plotted in this study. The specific capacity reported in this study is based on the total mass of the composite working electrode, including the current collector and non-electrochemical active materials.

The 100% CBD electrodes were cut into 2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚Äâmm2 strips and then immersed in the electrolyte solution for 6‚Äâh. After being rinsed by DMC for 30‚Äâs and dried in a glovebox overnight, the treated CBD electrode was examined by scanning electron microscopy and compared with the untreated CBD electrode. No inert-atmosphere transport sample holder was used.

X-ray nano-CT of the pristine and cycled CBD was performed using a Zeiss Xradia Ultra 810. The cycled CBD electrode after first lithiation was extracted from the coin cell, which was opened in the glovebox using a coin cell decrimper (Hohsen). The electrode was rinsed by DMC for 30‚Äâs to remove residual LiPF‚ÇÜ/solvent, and then taken out from the glovebox after overnight drying. The cycled CBD was brittle and easily peeled off from the copper current collector, where a tiny piece of approximately 100‚ÄâŒºm was glued onto the tip of a stainless-steel pin under the optical microscope and mounted onto the sample stage for X-ray nano-CT scanning. No inert-atmosphere sample holder was used during transport, as air exposure did not affect the scanning results. A total of 1,400 projections were acquired over a 180¬∞ rotation, with an exposure time of 60‚Äâs per frame, using a quasi-parallel beam at 5.4‚ÄâkeV. The resulting voxel resolution was 64‚Äânm. CBD was not exposed to X-ray radiation during the lithiation process. A 1/32‚Äù PEEK cell, with 1.5‚Äâmm wall thickness of the housing was used for the synchrotron X-ray CT, conducted at Beamline I13-2, Diamond Light Source, UK. The electrodes (8.5‚Äâwt.%, 17‚Äâwt.% Si, 35‚Äâwt.% Si and 5‚Äâwt.% SiOx) were cut to 0.85‚Äâmm diameter and stacked with Li foil; a 250-Œºm-thick glass fibre separator was placed vertically so that the X-ray beam transmitted in-plane for each layer. The representativeness of the cycling performance using the operando PEEK cell is compared with coin cell in Supplementary Fig. 22 and discussed in Supplementary Note 14. A pco.edge 5.5 camera with an objective lens of 10√ó was used to achieve an effective pixel size of 0.325‚ÄâŒºm and a field of view of 0.83‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ0.7‚Äâmm2. A total of 2,000 projections were collected for each tomographic scan, at a temporal resolution of 1.5‚Äâmin. The data were collected and reconstructed on-site with the built-in algorithm developed at the beamline. Electrochemical cycling between each scan was conducted in the 0.3‚Äì0.4‚ÄâmA‚Äâcm‚àí2 current density range remotely outside the experiment hutch using a Gamry potentiostat (Gamry 1010). Microstructural characterization of the reconstructed 3D data was carried out in commercial software Avizo V9.5 (Avizo, Thermo Fisher Scientific,). The marker-based watershed algorithm47 was used to segment the 3D microstructure into different phases. The segmentation uncertainty of Si particles and CBD, by comparing with the ground-truth manual segmentation using a representative volume, is 16% and 13%, respectively, with an offset of ¬±1 pixel locating at the phase boundaries. Tortuosity factor œÑc was measured by conducting diffusion simulation within the segmented porous structure in the electrode as the flow domain using Avizo Xlab Diffusion48 (ThermoFisher Scientific). A gradient of electrolyte concentration was applied between the inlet and outlet to drive the mass flow Qp. The effective mass transport parameter \(\frac{\varepsilon }{{\tau }_{c}}\) was obtained by dividing Qp by Qe (flow in the volume with porosity Œµ‚Äâ=‚Äâ1). Mathematics and schematics are introduced in Supplementary Note 15 and Supplementary Fig. 23. For the tortuosity characterization of CBD, only two X-ray scans (that is, pristine and final state) were conducted for the CBD cell, so a linear decreasing trend of porosity ŒµCBD and tortuosity œÑCBD were assumed based on the homogeneous microstructure of the CBD. These values are embedded in the computational domain (the cloudy phase in Fig. 3c,d) to obtain œÑelectrode.

Digital image and volume correlation were carried out using the 2D optical microscopic data and 3D X-ray CT data, respectively. The commercial software Davis v11 (LaVision) was used to extract the displacement field and strain map within the electrode as a function of SOC. The data were divided into patches of regular size (depending on the feature size of interest), and the displacement and strain were measured by tracking the movement of the morphological features represented by groups of intensity values within each patch. Details of the operating principles and the algorithms are detailed elsewhere43. A multistage image registration process was used, where each stage uses progressively smaller correlation window sizes, from coarse pass (128 voxels, detecting bulk deformation) to precise pass (48 voxels, detecting local deformation). This method improves displacement convergence and spatial resolution while maintaining robustness against noise. The final correlation window is 48 voxels, with 50% overlap (step size) to increase the spatial resolution, and the average correlation score is approximately 0.91 for DVC and 0.95 for DIC. The deconvolution of the electrode strain into Si and graphite strain from the DIC data was achieved by the following procedure: the optical RGB images of the composite electrode were first segmented into Si, pore and graphite phases using machine learning-based segmentation algorithm by open source software Ilastik. Two binary images (0 for background and 1 for the object of interest), one containing labelled graphite particles and the other labelled Si particles, were each pixel-wise multiplied (that is, masked) with the strain map from the DIC results to extract the strain associated with each phase.

Deuterium-labelled compounds play a crucial role in drug discovery as both diagnostic tools and deuterated pharmaceuticals. While hydrogen isotope exchange is well established for activated substrates, the catalytic deuteration of unactivated amides and esters remains underdeveloped, particularly under mild conditions suitable for sensitive pharmaceuticals and polymers. This limitation hampers the late-stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules and functional materials. Here we report a catalytic hydrogen isotope exchange method using cooperative catalysts‚Äîa silicon Lewis acid and a tertiary amine base‚Äîfunctioning as a frustrated Lewis pair. This approach enables highly selective deuteration under mild conditions. Our method achieves high deuterium incorporation in various functionalized pharmaceuticals and polyesters, including those typically unstable under basic conditions, demonstrating its broad applicability.

The increase in multidrug-resistant bacteria underscores an urgent need for additional antibiotics. Here, we integrate small-molecule high-throughput screening with a deep-learning-based virtual screening approach to uncover new antibacterial compounds. We screen ~2 million small molecules against a sensitized Escherichia coli strain, yielding thousands of hits. We use these data to train a deep learning model, GNEprop, to predict antibacterial activity, retrospectively validating robustness with respect to out-of-distribution generalization and activity cliff prediction. Virtual screening of over 1.4 billion synthetically accessible compounds identifies potential candidates, of which 82 exhibit antibacterial activity on the same strain, illustrating a 90-fold improved hit rate over the high-throughput screening experiment used for training. Many newly identified compounds exhibit high dissimilarity to known antibiotics, potency beyond the training bacterial strain and selectivity. Biological characterization identifies specific, validated targets, indicating promising avenues for further exploration in antibiotic discovery.

The initial validation of self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning of GNEprop was based on publicly available datasets that can be obtained from their respective sources. In particular, the initial public dataset is from Stokes et al.14 and GNEprop self-supervised representations leverage ZINC15 (ref. 28) and MoleculeNet32. While the HTS dataset and follow-up wild-type experiments cannot be made available because they are proprietary libraries of Genentech, we released a subset of the initial screen (GNEtolC dataset) to enable future research. The GNEtolC dataset, the full list of virtual hits, synthesized hits and confirmed hits, dose‚àíresponse analyses, MIC experiments, the list of known antibiotics and the nearest-neighbor-based virtual screening (which includes dose‚àíresponse experiments) are included as Supplementary Tables and also made available with the code release. GNEprop pretrained weights are included with the code release. DNA sequencing data were deposited to the Sequence Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (PRJNA1291804).

The code for GNEprop model can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/Genentech/gneprop).

Jim Sanborn couldn't believe it. He was weeks away from auctioning off the answer to Kryptos, the sculpture he created for the CIA that had defied solution for 35 years. As always, wannabe solvers kept on paying him a $50 fee to offer their guesses to the remaining unsolved portion of the 1,800-character encrypted message, known as K4‚Äîwrong without exception. Then, on September 3, he opened an email from the latest applicant, Jarett Kobek, which started, ‚ÄúI believe the text of K4 is as follows ‚Ä¶‚Äù He'd seen words like this thousands of times before. But this time, the text was correct.

‚ÄúI was in shock,‚Äù Sanborn tells me. ‚ÄúReal serious shock.‚Äù The timing was awful. Sanborn, who turns 80 this year, saw the auction as a way for someone to continue his work of vetting potential solutions while maintaining the mystery of Kryptos. He'd also been looking forward to getting compensated for his work. What came next was even more shattering. He quickly got on the phone with Kobek and his friend Richard Byrne, who gobsmacked him by reporting they did not find the solution by codebreaking. Instead, Kobek had learned from the auction notice that some Kryptos materials were held at the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art in Washington, DC. Kobek, a California novelist (one of his books is called I Hate the Internet), got his friend, the playwright and journalist Byrne, to photograph some of the holdings. To Kobek's astonishment, two of the images contained a 97-character passage with words that Sanborn had previously dropped as clues. He was staring at the full unencrypted text that CIA and NSA codebreakers, along with countless academics and hobbyists, had sought for decades.

The secret of Kryptos was out of the artist's hands, in the most humiliating way imaginable‚ÄîSanborn himself had mistakenly submitted it in readable form to the museum. For 35 years the Kryptos plaintext had been a summit that none had reached. Suddenly some had attained it‚Äînot by climbing to the peak but by hitching a ride to the top. Sanborn's grand vision for a piece of art that illuminated the idea of secrecy itself was imperiled‚Äîas was the auction. Now he had to figure out what to do about it.

The initial phone call had been friendly. Kobek and Byrne insisted that they did not want to mess up the auction. After he hung up, Sanborn called the auction house. That's when things started going sideways. As Sanborn tells me, ‚ÄúThey said, ‚ÄòListen, see if the guys will sign NDAs, and see if they'll take a portion of the proceeds.' And I said, ‚ÄòOh geez, man, I don't know about that. But I offered it.'‚Äù

Kobek and Byrne were uncomfortable with that arrangement and refused to sign. (RR Auction executive vice president Bobby Livingston didn't comment on the legal issue but says of an NDA, ‚ÄúIt's something that would be comforting to our clients.‚Äù) Sanborn told them his intent was to get the Smithsonian to freeze the archives‚Äîwhich it did. He assumed Kobek and Byrne would stay silent. ‚ÄúIf you don't release it, you're heroes to me,‚Äù Sanborn told them.

‚ÄúI thought everything was OK,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúAnd then all of a sudden [the journalist] John Schwartz calls me and says these guys want to publish it in The New York Times.‚Äù Kobek explains to me that they contacted Schwartz in part to relieve some legal pressure. ‚ÄúThere was threat after threat being sent to us from the auction house's lawyers, threatening to sue us for a multitude of things,‚Äù he says. (When I ask Livingston if his lawyers have been contacting Kobek, he says, ‚ÄúThere's lawyers talking to each other,‚Äù and adds that there may well be copyright concerns if Kobek and Byrne published the plaintext.) On October 16, Schwartz published his scoop, informing the world that the plaintext was out.

Sanborn tells me that Kobek shared the plaintext with Schwartz over the phone. When asked about this, Kobek says, ‚ÄúI cannot speak about that‚Ä¶I am under significant legal peril.‚Äù Schwartz says. ‚ÄúOnce my editors decided it would not be revealed in the story, I deleted the text from my interviews file. I don't know it.‚Äù (So don't bug him.)

RR Auction now has a disclaimer on the description of the Kryptos lot, noting the Smithsonian discovery. ‚ÄúThe researchers have stated they do not plan to release the solution,‚Äù it reads, though RR also acknowledges that there is no assurance that the solution won't spill at some point. ‚ÄúIt certainly has an effect on the auction,‚Äù says Livingston. ‚ÄúBut we're moving forward with it, with the disclosure of what happened.‚Äù

Livingston points out that the firm is auctioning off not just the K4 plaintext, but a set of objects that have worth on their own, including the coding charts, the original handwritten plaintext, a unique ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù copper plate, and Sanborn's CIA visitor badge. For collectors of cryptographic history, or even art fanatics, those goodies might be irresistible. Sanborn has also pledged to spend an afternoon walking the winner through the Kryptos story, with guidance on how to keep it going.

With the news that at least two people have the K4 plaintext, RR and Sanborn have shifted their focus to a different aspect of the Kryptos secrecy. In recent months, Sanborn has been talking more about the fact that the ultimate solution to Kryptos is not the decrypted plaintext but another mystery that will emerge when the plaintext is available. Kind of like finishing off the big boss in a video game and then finding out there's another villain to conquer. ‚ÄúI said years ago, there's something after Kryptos,‚Äù he now says. ‚Äú It's a riddle. It means something. It leads somewhere else. And then all of a sudden it started getting named K5.‚Äù Sanborn is vague on the nature of K5. Is it one of the test passages Sanborn made in 1988 when he was trying to see what would fit on the face of the sculpture? Something that involves other parts of the CIA installation? Or a different Sanborn puzzle altogether? In any case, Sanborn and his auction house are now touting the K5 solution as part of the prize.

That's not to belittle the fact that, despite Kobek's discovery, K4 is in no way solved. The Kryptos mystique has endured largely because for 35 years the ciphertext has confounded the world's best codebreakers. Elonka Dunin, a leader of the community devoted to endless speculation about the Kryptos solution, says she hasn't detected a slackening of interest after hearing about the Smithsonian discovery. She says that Kryptos-world is more upset about the fact that the solution will be auctioned off‚Äîadding uncertainty to the 35-year-old chase‚Äîthan at the fact that two random researchers found a copy of the plaintext. (Pretty much everyone thinks Sanborn deserves a better retirement nest egg.) To her, the real quest is to actually crack the code, a sentiment that Sanborn avidly shares. ‚ÄúThey only discovered it, they did not decipher it,‚Äù he tells me.

Right now, the parties have reached an uneasy stasis. The auction is now open; as I write this, the high bid has topped $43,000. The auction house hasn't changed its estimated $300,000 closing bid. Kobek says he wishes he had never sent Byrne to the Smithsonian in the first place. ‚ÄúIt's a sad story, in a way,‚Äù he tells me. Sanborn is in agony.

Still, I don't think the Kryptos saga has been irrevocably tarnished. I always saw Sanborn's artwork as a brilliant commentary on the shadow world of spookdom, where nothing is as it seems and outcomes often come without clarity. To date, the machinations of solving Kryptos‚Äîor even figuring out if it could be solved‚Äîhave been on a high level, a complex web of shadows that John le Carr√© might have spun. The anticlimactic discovery of the plaintext, due to Sanborn's slip, has shifted the narrative to the tragicomic purgatory of Mick Herron's Slough House series.

There's still a chance for a satisfying ending. Sanborn's hope in auctioning off the solution has always been that the winning bidder will continue the process of vetting guesses until someone finally arrives at the answer via math and grit. To help his successor, Sanborn's been working with technologist and entrepreneur Igor Jablokov to build an AI system that can autonomously sift through the guesses. Jablokov described it to me as a virtual Sanborn.

Jablokov is a rabid Kryptos fan; he even owns a unique replica of the sculpture that was created for an episode of the TV show Alias. He's also wealthy, having sold his first company to Amazon. He tells me that earlier this year when he heard of Sanborn's financial situation, he offered to buy the solution and take over the vetting. Sanborn could not explore that option because he'd already agreed to do the auction.

Hearing this, it dawns on me that I might be talking to the eventual winning bidder for the Kryptos secret‚Äîand the person who will continue to protect its remaining secrets. I ask Jablokov whether he is going to do just that. The pause after my question indicates I might have hit paydirt. ‚ÄúI'll leave that to ambiguity,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut obviously I'm an actor, an interested party.‚Äù We'll see what happens on November 20 when the auction closes. I suspect that no matter the outcome, ambiguity and mystery will still pervade one of the greatest art projects of our time.

With the price and quality of laptops these days, it can be difficult to recommend prebuilt desktop PCs‚Äîespecially when they aren't focused on gaming. The Dell Tower Plus straddles the line, offering strong performance in a more modern, office-friendly aesthetic. It's ideal as a mixed-use computer that can act as a work-from-home PC by day and a secret gaming rig by night.

The off-white color of the case makes this a handsome machine (it also comes in graphite), paired with the dual-tone silver front plate. The bottom half of the front plate has a grid of holes, adding both airflow and a touch of design. It's not flashy, but tasteful compared to competition like the Lenovo IdeaCentre Tower. The removable side panel also has perforations, giving you a subtle peek at the glowing light from the GPU‚Äîno RGB needed here. The Dell Tower Plus keeps it classy, despite being a fairly conventional, mid-sized tower.

I've always liked Dell's simple latch system for removing the panel and getting into your system. There's a single screw to loosen on the back, and that lets you pop off the side panel. Inside, you'll find a fairly roomy setup. There are removable plastic brackets on either side of the GPU. The slim, 750-watt power supply is held in place by a metal bracket with two screws, but the graphics card is simple to swap. There's a metal latch to pop down and a tiny, single screw. Once I unscrewed that, I was able to remove the graphics card without much trouble.

The Nvidia RTX 5070 is one of the top-of-the-line GPUs available to configure in the Dell Tower Plus, and while you can technically upgrade to the RTX 5080 to get some more VRAM (as the RTX 5070 only has 12 GB), you'll be bottlenecked by the power supply by getting anything faster. The real benefit is being able to swap it out in future generations of Nvidia graphics cards. For future-proofing purposes, you can always configure it with a 1,000-watt power supply, which Dell charges an extra $50 for.

The CPU cooler is a passive, tower heat sink. Once you get the GPU out of the way, this would be fairly simple to swap out for something more powerful, but it certainly keeps things quiet. The PC has two 120-millimeter fans: one for exhaust in the back of the case and one behind the front panel for intake. CPU temperatures are decent, averaging 83 degrees Celsius under full load, only spiking up to a max of 96 degrees in bursts. It can get loud, but even during gaming, I didn't find it distracting. The balance here is weighted more toward quieter operation, which is important in a system designed for work.

I love the I/O on the front panel. You get three USB-A ports (5 Gbps), as well as a 10-Gbps USB-C port. The inclusion of a headphone jack and an SD card slot is also super convenient. On the back, you'll find your usual assortment of ports, including one more USB-C port. That should cover all the bases, depending on what peripherals and accessories you use.

In addition to the video ports on the back of the GPU, you're getting upgraded port selection in the rear of the PC. For versions of the PC without discrete graphics, you now get HDMI 2.0 and a USB-C Thunderbolt 4 port, which lets you connect up to two 4K displays. You also have the usual assortment of four USB-A ports, an Ethernet jack, stereo audio ports, and a Kensington lock.

The Dell Tower Plus doesn't exactly use off-the-shelf parts, but it does give you fairly good upgradability, which is one of the main reasons for buying a desktop in the first place. As for extra expansion, there are two overhead empty storage bays for 3.5-inch SATA hard drives, as well as an extra M.2 for an additional SSD. There are two DIMM slots, which will allow you to pack up to 64 GB of DDR5 memory, if your heart so desires. My review unit came with two sticks of DDR5 RAM, 16 GB each, as well as a single-terabyte M.2 SSD.

Adding or replacing these components is fairly straightforward, and there are even some instructions printed on the inside of the side panel. No, it's not the Framework Desktop in terms of ease of use, but there's a lot more space for your hands when tinkering with components or troubleshooting something. This isn't a system inherently made for true DIYers. The custom motherboard makes upgrading the motherboard or CPU more difficult, but for the basics, Dell has done a good job of giving you a foundation you can build on.

My review unit is one of the more powerful configurations, with both the unlocked Intel Core Ultra 7 265K and RTX 5070. (You can upgrade to the Core Ultra 9 285K and RTX 5080.) The value for this desktop drops as you move down the configurations. The cheapest is $800 for Intel graphics, but it doesn't make much sense to buy that when you can get a Dell 14 Plus laptop with better specs for less money, especially given the added benefit of the display and portability.

I've seen discounts dropping the RTX 5070 configuration down to $1,050. If you can nab it at that price, that's a really strong value for an RTX 5070 desktop. The GPU alone costs over half the price of the PC at that price. Although the 5070 only has 12 GB of VRAM, this will get you well over twice the performance of the Framework Desktop, as compared in the 3DMark Steel Nomad benchmark.

This isn't our favorite GPU in the RTX 50 series, and if you aren't using any upscaling, you'll get the best frame rates if you stick to 1080p or possibly 1440p, depending on the type of game. 4K is possible, but only once you start tweaking settings and using some upscaling. For example, in Cyberpunk 2077, you can get 74 frames per second in 4K resolution at Ultra settings, but only if you set the DLSS upscaling to the ‚ÄúBalanced‚Äù preset. You can even crank it up to the path-traced RT Overdrive setting, so long as you drop the resolution to 1080p and keep DLSS at Balanced.

In a lighter game like Marvel Rivals, I was able to average around 75 frames per second in 4K without upscaling at all at High settings, or in 1440p at Ultra. But if you really want those fast frame rates (over 100 frames per second) for twitchy competitive games, you'll be playing either in 1080p or using upscaling. Neither of those is a bad solution necessarily, but I could see it being disappointing performance for your brand-new, fairly large desktop.

Either way, performance in the Dell Tower Plus feels within the ballpark of what you'd get in a gaming desktop at this price, so you're not making a substantial sacrifice by sticking with something more work-friendly. Gaming is not this PC's primary use case, but it's a good example of just what the Dell Tower Plus can do. A designer, video editor, music producer, or anyone who runs fairly heavy software for work will appreciate the combination of the RTX 5070 and Core Ultra 265K.

There's a lot to like about the Dell Tower Plus. (Even though there's not much new here over the previous Dell XPS Tower, outside of a name change.) The updated Intel CPU and Nvidia graphics are both appreciated, especially since some manufacturers are slow to keep these lower-profile systems up to date. It's a particularly good deal if you can snatch it up on sale.

Michael Calore: Hey, Lauren. How are you doing?

Lauren Goode: Hey, Mike. I'm great. It's so nice to be back in studio with you again, because our schedules were not aligning for the past few weeks.

Michael Calore: Nope. But the stars and the moon have aligned now, and here we are once again.

Lauren Goode: Here we are. And I'm sure all of our listeners have just been sitting here wondering, ""When are Lauren and Mike getting back together? When is the band getting back together?"" And I just went to yet another AI dinner last night. Everyone's talking about AI. Everyone is talking about whether or not we're in an AI bubble, and I think a lot of this is fueled by the news that we've been seeing trickling out about all of these AI infrastructure projects.

Michael Calore: Yes, data centers.

Lauren Goode: Data centers.

Michael Calore: Big warehouses, stuffed with computers.

Lauren Goode: Stuffed with server racks.

Michael Calore: And for sure we're going to be touching on all of that on today's show. But before we get into it, we have to welcome our guest, WIRED's senior writer and climate energy expert, Molly Taft is joining us today. Hello, Molly.

Molly Taft: Hello.

Lauren Goode: Hi, Molly. Is this your inaugural Uncanny Valley podcast?

Molly Taft: Yeah, and I'm a fan, so this is a big deal for me, frankly. I'm very excited to be here talking about my favorite topic and the thing people ask me the most these days about at parties.

Lauren Goode: And what is that?

Molly Taft: Data centers. It's data centers.

Lauren Goode: I thought you were going to say their electricity bills.

Molly Taft: Yeah, I mean, they're related, aren't they?

Michael Calore: Yeah.

Molly Taft: People are fired up about it.

Michael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. Today we're talking about the AI infrastructure boom. In recent years, tech giants like OpenAI, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers. These are large warehouses full of servers delivering the huge amounts of computing power needed to run AI models. Recent announcements like OpenAI's, new Stargate data center in Texas, or the AI startup's deal with the chip maker AMD, have only added to the hype and the capital surrounding the expansion of these data centers. But just as the deals keep piling up, the issues around this rapid expansion are becoming more worrisome. We'll dive into how these data centers work, what effect they're already having in some communities, and what they reveal about the current state of the AI industry and our economy. I'm Michael Calore, Director of Consumer Tech and Culture.

Lauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior correspondent.

Molly Taft: And I'm Molly Taft, a senior writer covering energy and the environment.

Michael Calore: I think it's safe to say that all of us, including our listeners, have heard of data centers somewhere in the news and they have a pretty good idea of what a data center is. But let's talk about why AI companies rely on them. To put it another way, how does a ChatGPT query on my computer end up in a data center?

Lauren Goode: This is an excellent question and I think we're going to nerd out a little bit.

Michael Calore: Awesome.

Lauren Goode: Okay. Say you type into ChatGPT that you want a few options for dinner recipes tonight, or ""What am I going to get Mike for his birthday next year?""

Michael Calore: Bless you.

Lauren Goode: You send your request through and then it goes to OpenAI servers. It goes through a few checkpoints first. Like there's authentication, are you a valid user? Moderation, is the prompt okay or aligns with their guidelines? And then some load balancing, which is, which data center should ultimately handle this? The words or the strings of texts that you write are broken down into these little chunks of text called tokens. They're kind of like these puzzle pieces that artificial intelligence models can process. And at this point, the request lands on specialized hardware, in most cases GPUs.

Molly Taft: Yeah. The next part is key. GPUs, which stands for graphic processing units, are essential to AI systems. They're electronic cards that are really good at parallel processing, which basically means they can perform many calculations at once. Data centers are full of metallic rows of servers that contain these GPUs, so once you send your query in, it gets processed by those GPUs. You've probably heard some of the most famous ones in tech headlines, like Nvidia's H100s.

Lauren Goode: Ah, the H100. The kids can't get enough of them.

Michael Calore: My old friend.

Lauren Goode: And then I guess to bring it back full circle to our query for what to eat for dinner tonight or Mike's birthday present next year, once that query arrives at the data center and the servers, the AI model starts working. This is called the inference time. The model is going to predict what words, in the form of tokens, should come next, one after another until it builds out this full answer. And then finally, the response is sent back through the same network path to your browser or app. This is a very summarized version of what happens, but on a high level, that's why your ChatGPT question or query needs to go through to these data centers.

Michael Calore: And this all happens in a matter of seconds.

Lauren Goode: It's pretty miraculous.

Michael Calore: Yeah.

Lauren Goode: Yeah.

Michael Calore: Well, I love the breakdown. It's also, just for the record, I have to say that I probably would never ask for ChatGPT for recipe recommendations. And Lauren, I really hope that you get a good answer as to what to get me from a birthday because I'm already very excited.

Lauren Goode: You might recall that I did this last year for your birthday, and I think I still haven't gotten you anything.

Michael Calore: Well, I think if there's a next question that everybody has about data centers, it's about how energy-intensive they are. Because even a simple query like that, we're talking about accessing multiple different servers. You're breaking up your query into different tokens, spraying them into this data center. How much impact do those computing requirements have on the environment? And Molly, I want to ask you this question because I know you've reported on this a lot, what does the energy consumption of a data center look like? And are we talking about just energy? Are we talking about water? What does it look like?

Molly Taft: Large data centers, there's a lot going on inside of them. They need cooling systems, they need to keep the lights on, they need to run their network equipment. That all creates a lot of energy. They don't run at the same energy level all the time. They often run in cycles based on when there's more queries. They'll take a break at night when the queries are lower. And the environmental footprint of a data center also depends on what type of energy they're hooked up to. If you're hooked up to a dirtier grid, a grid powered by fossil fuels, you're going to create more emissions. A data center that runs on solar power or wind power will have a lower environmental footprint. It's funny trying to calculate the footprint of a specific data center because a lot of the information about the environmental impacts is proprietary information, so a lot of what we're working with is stuff that companies volunteer themselves. You'll see headlines. Meta is building a data center they're calling Hyperion in Louisiana. It's part of their bigger build-out, and that's going to be huge. It says it's going to be about five gigawatts, which is massive. That's about half the peak power load of New York City. That's the biggest one under construction right now, but there's a lot more out there. There's also regional level approximations, and there are some places in the world that are starting to get worried about how much energy data centers are consuming or are set to consume. In Ireland, right now data centers use more than 20% of the country's electricity, which is crazy.

Lauren Goode: Wow.

Molly Taft: Virginia is also facing a huge cliff, and they're projected to use a lot more over the next couple of years. So as a group, there's definitely an energy trend that's going up.

Lauren Goode: You mentioned that each tech company, data center company, is reporting their energy usage. I'm curious how far down the stack they're going. For example, if they are using a certain number of GPUs and those components from GPUs have to be shipped from different parts of the world or manufactured in different parts of the world, that is also an emissions cost. So are any of them incorporating that?

Molly Taft: Yeah, the problem with climate stuff and the problem with emission stuff is you can keep going down this rabbit hole forever. What you're talking about gets into emissions reporting, which is what is the total environmental footprint of what you're doing? And this is something that climate folks and people who like to do math on emissions are constantly trying to figure out when it comes to specific companies. And many companies don't necessarily want to go down that chain. But I think when we talk about power use, we are talking about on-site power use. We're talking about just what it's going to take to turn that thing on and to run that thing. The total footprint of these things is probably a lot bigger than we think.

Lauren Goode: And when you mentioned people who like to do math and figure this out, I think of someone like a Sasha Luccioni who, she's pretty vocal out there. She's the climate lead at Hugging Face. And she tends to, to put it eloquently, call bullshit on a lot of the numbers that these tech leaders put out there.

Molly Taft: Yeah, and Sasha's been really good at calling out, especially when you have models where it's less transparent, as to how much energy is actually going into a query. There's numbers that kind of get tossed around, and Sam Altman put out a blog post this summer where he said the average query for ChatGPT uses about what an oven would use in a little over one second or a high-efficiency light bulb would use in a couple of minutes. It's about 0.34 watt hours of energy. But Sasha really correctly points out that these kinds of figures don't give us a lot to work on. When he says an average query, what does that mean? How many of those queries are happening? What are these data centers hooked up to? Are they hooked up to grids that are mostly renewables? Are they hooked up to grids that use coal? There are so many factors that go into the energy use of these products. And Sasha put it really, really well. She said that Altman ""pulled that figure out of his ass."" That's a direct quote. And she told me, ""It blows my mind that you can buy a car and know how many miles per gallon it consumes, yet we use all these AI tools every day and we have absolutely no efficiency metrics, emissions factors, nothing."" So just one number doesn't help us get to the bigger picture, and a lot of the times it may just help companies procrastinate on putting out more data.

Michael Calore: We don't have any clear indicators about how much energy each query is taking and how much energy these data centers are consuming, other than it's a lot and it's a problem. And even knowing that it's a problem, a lot of the big tech companies that are investing in AI infrastructure are continuing to build, build, build. We've talked about some of the big players and we should make sure that we mention as many of them as we can. Who are the other big names in this space?

Lauren Goode: Honestly, I think the biggest ones are the folks we've already mentioned, which is OpenAI, AMD, Nvidia, and the Stargate Project that's kind of an umbrella term for a bunch of different partnerships. The Stargate Project is a $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment between OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX, all of these interconnected relationships between the different hyperscalers and the chip makers. What's interesting is that there has been a little bit of a shift in the terminology or the way that these investments are being described, and that they're being described as gigawatt investments. So they're kind of staggered investments in many cases. They're based on the assumption that the demand for AI will continue to scale upwards, and that eventually more and more and more energy, or compute power, I should say, is going to be needed. It's not some kind of clear-cut, ""Well, in exchange for this amount of investment, this company is going to get X million number of GPUs."" It's not basic unit reporting.

Michael Calore: Okay, so there's one thing that you said there that I want to hear more about, and that's hyperscaling. Because it sounds like what we're already talking about is hyperscaling, but you're saying that there are companies that are interested in growing even more than what we've already talked about?

Lauren Goode: Well, they're all interested in growing more. Who among us, Mike? But the hyperscalers refers to this class of major tech companies or cloud service providers. So Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, they're all in that category.

Molly Taft: Yeah, and I think it's important to remember that these companies have so much money and they have an ability to raise capital like nobody's business. So they're able to do some really crazy stuff to build quick and to build-out really, really big. And they're getting pretty creative, because their goals right now are to build these things quickly and get them up and running so they can basically use this physical infrastructure to compete with each other.

Lauren Goode: I think that's right, Molly. I think there's a lot of frenemy building happening right now, and I would just love to be a part of their group chats when all of these announcements are being made.

Michael Calore: Yeah, and speaking of frenemies, the other sphere of influence that these companies are operating in is the political sphere. Obviously, in order to build a giant data center somewhere, you need to have the political will to do it, which means you need buy-in from the local residents, the local government, the state, the country. So what's happening in the political sphere with folks who want to build more data centers and people who oppose it, regulation? How is that playing out?

Molly Taft: That's a great question, and I think if you look at the national conversation, it's quite different than what's happening on the local level. You have Washington, you obviously have an administration that is very friendly to the idea of an American AI empire. Importantly for the energy conversation, the way that the Trump administration has approached this support has been through support of fossil fuels. They would really like for all data centers to be powered with oil and gas, a little bit of nuclear and coal. And this works out great for those industries as well. If you're going to have this massive expansion of power demand, it's really cool to be in the middle of that and be the one that everyone wants to turn to for energy resourcing. And then on the other side, there has been this influx of local opposition to these data centers for a variety of reasons, be it the water use, be it fears about rising electricity rates, be it noise, and some of the really big struggles have catapulted this issue to national conversation. I'm thinking about xAI in Memphis. When Elon Musk wanted to get xAI up and running, he installed a bunch of unpermitted gas turbines in order to get xAI working that he installed in a majority Black community in Memphis that already had severe issues with air pollution and asthma. And those folks made themselves known. Earlier this year, there was an attempt in DC to impose a moratorium on any state regulation around AI at all. It was an incredibly broad inclusion in the Big Beautiful Bill that ultimately didn't succeed. But one of the people who opposed it publicly was Marjorie Taylor Greene, who actually mentioned data centers in her opposition, and she compared AI to Skynet, the fictional AI from the Terminator movie franchise. So, this is getting some strange bedfellows in league with each other, I think this kind of contrast between what the administration is trying to push forward and some very powerful energy companies that stand to gain from it, versus some truly grassroots local movements and people concerned about the impacts of what these things are going to do in their communities.

Michael Calore: We are going to take a quick break right now, but when we come back we're going to dive into why AI companies' aggressive bet on scaling might come back to bite them. So stay with us.

                                  Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Today we're talking about the AI infrastructure boom. Now, Lauren and Molly, we just talked about why data center investments have been ramping up and what the known impacts are. So now comes another key question, is all of this aggressive expansion even a good idea?

Lauren Goode: It depends on who you ask, Mike. AI founders will typically tell you that there's nothing to worry about and that this is necessary to meet the current and future demand for AI. But the big elephant in the room is that for all of this investment, consumer spending on AI is not there yet. And some of the frontier model companies have seen a significant amount of their revenue coming from enterprise developers who are actually building for their companies and using AI for that reason. I have to imagine, and this is just my own theory, that unless we become a world where consumers essentially are developers, where consumers are using AI to the point where we're all building things and writing lines of code based on this, that I don't see how the revenues get there. I also found this really interesting, The Economist reported that AI hyperscalers, which are the cloud service providers I talked about who are the largest spenders on AI, are using some interesting accounting tricks to try to depress the reported infrastructure spending. Which, then of course has the effect of inflating the profits from that. So I think that's partly why there's a lot of people concerned that there could be an AI bubble. It's about supply and demand, and right now we are spending so much money as a nation on supply and just hoping that the demand continues to grow.

Michael Calore: Fingers crossed.

Molly Taft: I think when we talk about the demand for this, you have to understand that behind it, there's a lot more going on than just accurately reading the tea leaves. There was an incident in the late '90s and early 2000s, where there was all of a sudden this narrative about how much energy the internet was going to use. And there were a bunch of high-profile articles that made some claims about how by the 2010s, the internet was going to use half of the US's electricity. The internet was posed as this huge electricity suck, and we were going to need to make more coal-fired power plants to deal with it. There's a really smart researcher named John Koomey who dug into this, and he found that it was really being pushed by the industries that stood to gain from such a build-out. And of course, that didn't end up happening. Efficiency gains were great. The internet doesn't actually use that much energy. I think we're in this weird moment where US energy use has stayed pretty stagnant. We're getting better at using what we have and we're getting better at being more efficient. And all of a sudden there's the possibility for a big customer of various industries, not just energy. And so, it's hard to tell if we're in a bubble when there are so many people who stand to benefit from people believing that this is really going to happen.

Lauren Goode: And to that point, when you make this kind of investment in infrastructure, it's a very fixed investment and you're basically doing it under the assumption that the way the compute happens will remain the same for a certain period of time. And actually, what we're seeing is that some of the more computationally-intensive AI models could soon potentially offer diminishing returns compared to smaller models. For example, like a frontier model company like OpenAI, is currently much better, smarter than a smaller model from an academic lab, but that may not always be the case. There's a lot of interesting research going on. There are new alternatives to deep learning, there are novel chip designs, there's new approaches like quantum computing. And I think what we saw with DeepSeek out of China and its remarkably, or reportedly, low-cost model this past January, that's already served as a reality check for the AI industry.

Michael Calore: What do you think is something that we as citizens, as people who have the decision of whether or not to use AI tools, and we have decisions to get involved in whether or not data centers are going to come to our state or come to our county, what can we do?

Molly Taft: I think about this all the time. I'm going to assume, I'm going to go out on a limb that most people listening to this are nerds and enjoy reading and learning, and one thing I... I'm so much fun at parties. One thing I love to tell people at parties is not even get involved, but to learn more about how their local electric utility works. Because if a data center comes to your area and impacts your electric bill, it's because of your utility. And utilities in the US are set up in this really, really strange way, and a lot of them are investor-owned, so still have to make a profit for themselves. But they also control how much money you're seeing on your electric bill every month. And so I think this kind of problem can feel so big and so outside your control, but the more you dig into the wonkier side of things, the more you will find people who are organizing around even just basic asks to utilities to use more renewable energy, to monitor rate hikes. And they will be the ones that will be up on if a data center is coming to town, what it might be doing to your electric bill. So I would encourage people to read more about the fascinating topic of electric utilities in the United States.

Lauren Goode: That's really great.

Molly Taft: Yeah.

Lauren Goode: Molly, you'll be happy to hear that a few weeks ago I was down in Chandler, Arizona for a tour of Intel's new chip fabrication plant. There were a handful of us who were what I would consider maybe mainstream tech journalists there, but then there was one woman there from the paper in Arizona who was paying very close attention to power and utilities and water usage in the area.

Molly Taft: Yeah, she's the real one, honestly. Read her stuff.

Lauren Goode: Yeah. My piece of advice is not related so much to energy usage or your own usage of AI, but I would just say double-down on the humanities. I don't think AI is going away, even if we're in a bubble, even if that bubble bursts. The way that it looks may change in the next few years, but I do not think it's going away. And I think in the future, I want to believe that what will make us stand out is our ability to think and our human relationships, our human capital, if you will, and our ability to appreciate real human-generated art. And so that's what I've been doing. I just spend a lot of time when I'm not on the internet, reading books written by humans and watching films, reconnecting with family and friends. That's my, I don't know, I guess my small act of resistance.

Michael Calore: That's great.

Molly Taft: Same, honestly. Yeah.

Michael Calore: Yeah. And I would say that you do need to understand these technologies in order to have an opinion about them, and in order to understand them, you have to engage with them. So I would encourage you to dabble a little bit, but don't use AI like a monster. Don't say thank you to the machine, because we know that people typing in thank you at the end of a query or after they get an answer, is burning even more resources. So just understand the technology enough so that you understand why it's important to have an opinion about it, and it could help you form your opinion it. And also push back on AI features being crammed into things where they don't need to be. So if you don't see the utility in the AI features on your phone or in your car, figure out how to turn it off, because then it's like turning off the lights when you leave the house. All right, well, let's take another break, and then we'll come back and we'll do our WIRED-Tired, our new little experiment. Welcome back. Lauren and Molly, we are now going to be diving into a new segment that we're calling WIRED-Tired, and there's a slash in between those two words. It's WIRED-Tired. If you're a long time WIRED reader, then you will know that the WIRED-Tired format is a big part of our brand. So whatever is new and cool is WIRED, and whatever passe thing it's replacing is tired. And the WIRED and tired don't have to be related to each other, but it just rhymes better and really rings the bell if they are related. So we're going to try it here on the show and we're going to talk about what is WIRED and tired in our lives. Are you ready?

Molly Taft: Yes.

Lauren Goode: We're all tired.

Molly Taft: I'm exhausted, personally, but thrilled about this.

Michael Calore: Well, let's start with Lauren. Lauren, tell us what is WIRED and tired to you.

Lauren Goode: Okay. Tired to me are extravagant coffee drinks, and WIRED is just go for the simple drip coffee.

Michael Calore: And what do you put in your drip coffee?

Lauren Goode: It's pumpkin spice season, everyone. And I have to say I'm sick of seeing the signs for not only pumpkin spice, but weird twists on it. And now it's like Dubai chocolate pumpkin spice lattes. And where are we going with this?

Michael Calore: No. We're done.

Lauren Goode: There's no end, so just stop it now. Shut it down, and just go for either pour-over or drip, or maybe if you're going to get a little fancy, an Americano. I love a good Americano. I put a little half-and-half in mine and sometimes a sweetener. Whatever. Yeah, that's it.

Michael Calore: So tired, PSL.

Lauren Goode: Yeah.

Michael Calore: WIRED-

Lauren Goode: Drip.

Lauren Goode: Be a drip.

Michael Calore: Be a drip.

Lauren Goode: Yeah, that's it.

Michael Calore: Love it.

Molly Taft: I love that.

Lauren Goode: Thank you.

Michael Calore: Molly, your turn.

Molly Taft: Tired is looking at my phone. I don't want to do it anymore.

Lauren Goode: Yes.

Molly Taft: I don't want to do it anymore, frankly, for anything. I don't care. This is a public apology to all of my friends. I haven't answered texts in months because I don't want to look at my phone. So it's very tired. I'm very tired about it. WIRED, new thing called books. I love to read them. And my recommendation, the book that I read earlier this year and I have not stopped thinking about, is a novel called Sky Daddy by Kate Folk. It is set in the Bay Area, so it ties in, and it's about a woman in love with planes and I'm not spoiling anything. It's a little not safe for work, so don't read it at work, but it's honestly one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time.

Michael Calore: Nice. WIRED, books. Tired, phones. Solid.

Lauren Goode: Great. Mike, what's yours?

Michael Calore: My WIRED is hydration tablets, and my tired is plain old water.

Lauren Goode: Oh, I love how we both went with beverages.

Michael Calore: Yeah. Well, okay, so you should still drink water, and I drink water at meals, but for those times in between meals when I'm doing the thing and hydrating at my desk, I've gotten really into hydration tablets and hydration powders. These are the things that basically turn your bottle of water into a Gatorade. It gives you electrolytes, it gives you some flavor, a little bit of sugar. They have caffeine in them now, which is amazing.

Lauren Goode: Your eyes just lit up.

Michael Calore: Oh, yeah.

Molly Taft: Game changer.

Michael Calore: Totally. You get them at the sporting goods store, you can get them on the internet or whatever. They're sold as sports nutrition. But really they're great because they get me excited about drinking the water that's in front of me. Too many times I'm filling up my water bottle and then just forgetting about it, and then I come back in four days into the office on a Monday and unscrew the cap and it tastes like pennies. Nobody wants that. So put a hydration tablet in your water bottle and suck it down and love it. I like Nuun. Those are good.

Lauren Goode: And they come in handy-

Molly Taft: Those are really good.

Lauren Goode: ... packets for travel too.

Molly Taft: Yeah.

Michael Calore: They do, yeah.

Lauren Goode: Yeah.

Michael Calore: Yeah, lots of single-use plastic. It's awesome. Also-

Molly Taft: WIRED.

Michael Calore: ... Liquid I.V. is good.

Molly Taft: Liquid I.V. has a Firecracker Popsicle flavor. That is my household's favorite.

Michael Calore: We need PSL-flavored electrolytes.

Lauren Goode: Yes.

Molly Taft: No.

For the entirety of the past year, as the teenage roboticists of Team Palestine have been working on their latest project, their homeland has been engulfed in Israel's war with Hamas. Earlier this month, that all changed. With a fragile ceasefire in place, Israeli forces began to pull back from parts of Gaza, and the teens put the final touches on the project they hope will bring them victory: a robot that can maneuver through a series of simulated challenges based on the effects of climate change.

Next week, five of the dozens of students on Team Palestine will travel to Panama City for the ninth annual FIRST Global Challenge, where they will compete alongside students from nearly 200 nations. They'll partner with some, compete against others in a series of matches, and at the end of the three-day event, they hope, walk away with robotics gold. Their aim is not just to succeed at the competition, as they have in several recent years, but also to represent Palestine and increase awareness of‚Äîand access to‚Äîrobotics and other STEM programs for their peers back home. What follows is the story of how they did it.

Khalil DarOmar and Sara Saleh, a husband-and-wife duo from Ramallah in the West Bank, founded the Palestinian FIRST team in 2018. Saleh was working as a sales representative for a logistics and distribution company after recently graduating from Palestine Technical University; DarOmar was a programming freelancer who had studied computer science at Al-Quds University.

Sara Saleh, Team Palestine cofounder: When we founded the team, we had zero experience.

Khalil DarOmar, Team Palestine cofounder: I saw the FIRST Global Challenge, and I said, ‚ÄúWhy are we not in this? We need to be there. We need to represent Palestine in this competition.‚Äù

Saleh: We were so young to start a company or a nonprofit organization. But we had our passion.

Early on, Saleh and DarOmar found their students through local municipalities, relatives, and personal connections. By their second year they had also begun announcing training programs in Ramallah to recruit new team members interested in STEM. They would hold training sessions in their own homes or in local municipality spaces for the first several years.

Things did not go smoothly that first year. Shipment restrictions due to Israeli military control over Palestine prevented Team Palestine from receiving their FIRST Challenge robotics kit in advance for the first several years they participated, forcing them to find workarounds.

For the 2018 competition, Saleh says the FIRST organization connected Team Palestine with Team Canada, and the teams met via video call for months in advance to discuss their robot's design. Canadian students built the robot on Team Palestine's behalf and brought it with them to Mexico for the competition.

DarOmar: The students, it was the first time they were learning about robotics and the FIRST Global Challenge. We needed to make it virtual, and to change it from virtual to a real robot without a kit. A really, really hard start.

Saleh: Khalil only could get to Mexico, because [other students and I] were not able to get our visas due to some complications from the embassy.

DarOmar: But we solved this problem with a creative idea. We took one student from Argentina, from Tunisia, from Egypt, from Jordan. We turned them into a big Team Palestine.

These other countries' students also collaborated remotely with Team Palestine leading up to the competition, finalizing the robot's assembly. In Mexico, wearing Team Palestine shirts, students from those other teams competed with the robot the combined teams had created.

In subsequent years, Team Palestine was able to send a full traveling contingent of five students plus mentors (typically DarOmar and/or Saleh) to the FIRST competition. In 2022, DarOmar and Saleh registered as an independent robotics foundation and established their own office space for meetings and training. But shipping limitations persisted in preventing them from receiving their kit ahead of time, forcing them to use makeshift parts from prior years or work via video call until arriving at the competition.

Fayez Ismail, member of Team Palestine in 2022: Due to the fact that we had older pieces, older motors that weren't as efficient, extrusions ‚Ä¶ It took me three months of full-on engineering [to create the robot design]. Also, the pieces that we needed to use to put the robot together were kind of damaged.

Saleh: It was very challenging. The dimensions of the robot weren't very clear for us. Some parts from the old kits were not usable.

Ismail: We all understood that was the reality. We were not receiving the kit. That's it, you know? We had to focus on what we have, and just work through that. And we did.

Saleh: [Our students] had to do a lot of adjustments on the spot. All the other teams were having fun, exploring new things‚Äîour team was locked in the bedroom, trying to make all the adjustments needed.

Ismail: This is one of the challenges that really stayed with me for a long time. I had a job interview a couple days ago, and they were like, ‚ÄúTell us about a challenge that you faced and how you [overcame] it.‚Äù And every single time I'm in a job interview and get asked this, I don't fail to mention that one example.

Mohammed Shanti, a member of Team Palestine in 2023: I was there in Ramallah for three weeks [prior to the competition], without seeing my family. I just wanted to build the robot. I didn't care about anything else.

Saleh: [The students] would come to the office at 8 am, and they would end at 7 pm. They were like a family. They gather to have pizza and a night over to our house. Those are cherished moments.

The team's excitement quickly gave way to shock in the hours before the opening ceremonies of the FIRST competition in Singapore on October 7, 2023 when they received word of Hamas' attack on Israeli soil.

As team mentors, Saleh and DarOmar requested that Shanti and other students from the 2023 team not speak about the Hamas attack. DarOmar notes that to properly speak about that event, one must also include everything that happened before and after it, including a decades-long Israeli occupation of Palestine, and a two-year bombardment of Gaza since October 7 that several human rights organizations have labeled a genocide, with one organization estimating that child death tolls alone are near 20,000.

Saleh: Me and Khalil [had] our first son‚Äîhe was 5 months old, and he was waiting for us in Palestine. So it was really challenging for us. We had seven students with us. We needed to take them back home, and we had our son there waiting for us as well.

DarOmar: We tried to represent Palestine with a passion and with a hope to live in peace. We tried to show the hope of the kids for the world.

Saleh: All the [other] nations, they were asking if our families were safe and if everything was OK. They tried to cheer us up.

We kept up with all the competition challenges. We won the Helping Hands [award] that year, because we were very motivated. We knew we were there for a reason, and we needed to represent Palestine in the proper way.

The Clara Barton Award for Helping Hands is given to teams who assist other groups in their time of need. In 2023, Team Palestine won for assisting the team from Sudan, which faced difficulties attending that year's event due to conflict that began in their country earlier that year, displacing their entire team and placing their lab under occupied control by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

Saleh: Team Sudan students were unable to arrive until the second day of the competition, and only two out of five students were able to attend. During the first day, our team helped the Sudan mentors complete their robot and represented Team Sudan in the matches. We also carried their flag and represented them during the opening ceremony. Once the Sudanese students arrived, they joined us at the matches.

Shanti: It was a wonderful feeling to see Team Sudan happy and [able to] enjoy the game.

Saleh: The same [thing] that happened to us in Mexico when other countries wore our shirts and participated in our name.

Shanti: When we traveled to Singapore, I made global friends. The competition was in 2023, but we still speak.

Saleh: In 2024, even the Sudan mentors were unable to attend, so only one male and one female student participated. Khalil served as their on-site mentor and main point of contact throughout the competition.

Ahead of the 2024 event, Team Palestine was able to work through shipping restrictions to receive their robotics kit in Palestine ahead of time. But other challenges soon surfaced, including an extensive clearance process at the Jordan-West Bank border.

Saleh: There is a station controlled by the Israeli occupation in the middle of the crossing, where travelers undergo a long and complex inspection process.

That checkpoint is where Khalil had to wait for around seven hours, as security checks and paperwork for technical equipment like robotics parts often take an extremely long time. After finally crossing that point, he then spent about three additional hours on the Jordanian side before being allowed to enter Palestine.

The happiness from the team to finally receive the kits in Palestine and not have to wait until we got to the event‚Äîthat was a really great moment for us.

Receiving the kits in advance clearly benefitted Team Palestine in 2024; after ranking 97th in the competition in 2023 with a score of 46.11, the 2024 team finished 74th with a score of 68.09.

Alumni like Shanti and Ismail often remain involved with a current year's team via Zoom sessions or, where possible, in-person visits. Ismail is also involved in mentoring multiple youth robotics teams in Canada, where he studies at Queen's University and has also volunteered at multiple FIRST competitions since participating as a student.

Both also serve as reminders to current team members of what's possible if they continue pursuing STEM fields. Ismail is in his third year studying computer engineering at Queen's, while Shanti is a freshman studying business intelligence (a combination of business and tech applications) at Al-Najah National University in the West Bank.

Dalia Nasr, 2025 Team Palestine student: The alumni, I can learn from them. There are not a lot of robotics courses in Palestine. It's not really common for us to have these kinds of things. So it's a really, really big opportunity for me.

Ismail: At some point, I was looking to my uppers, people that participated in previous years. The same way I'm inspiring people, other people inspired me.

Saleh: We have no words to express our feelings when the first student graduated from high school, and they started to think, ‚ÄúWe want to be like Khalil and study computer science, or we want to actually study robotics.‚Äù

It was really rewarding to see them turning this passion into a career. The most rewarding thing for us is when they come back in summer vacation, they come to volunteer with our team to share their knowledge.

The 2025 traveling iteration of Team Palestine, five members strong (plus mentors), is just a few days from departing for Panama City. Their robot, which Nasr says is essentially finished, will collect ‚Äúbiodiversity units‚Äù from a tank in the playing field and shoot them into a makeshift ecosystem, simulating real-life attempts at ecological equilibrium, which is this year's theme.

Nasr, 16, will serve as the team's ‚Äúhuman player,‚Äù responsible for aiding the robot in shooting the biodiversity units; she jokes she'll lean on her limited basketball experience for a leg up.

Nasr: Being able to take part in a competition where I can inspire other Palestinian youth or other Palestinian students who are also interested in pursuing careers in STEM, this is something that's genuinely one of the most life-changing experiences in my life. I know that this is a lot of pressure on me as a person, but also it's a really big honor.

I've learned a lot from this experience. This competition specifically, there are a lot of things even outside building the robot. For example, there are social media challenges we take part in. I have had the chance to stand in front of the camera, to speak, and be able to present myself to other countries as well.

We do meetings with different countries before the competition so that we can get to know them, get to know their culture. I was able to present my culture to the countries, and also learn about theirs in return. I think that was also one of the greatest impacts on me.

Saleh and DarOmar's ultimate goal is to create a mobile robotics lab able to travel around Palestine, reaching students who are unable to travel themselves.

DarOmar: Because of the situation in Palestine, it's too hard to move the students between cities. A lot of Palestinian students cannot learn robotics. They want to try robotics, and they want to learn more about robotics. But they don't have the chance, because they cannot come to Ramallah or cannot come to cities.

The students cannot go outside of the village because there are a lot of attacks from settlers. There are a lot of checkpoints between the cities, from the Israeli army.

Saleh: We are working on making a mobile robot van that has all the 3D machines‚ÄîCNC machine, robots, EV3 tools [Lego robotics kits to help students learn programming and design concepts]. So whenever we get the chance to go to Nablus, to Hebron or any other places, we can have all of our materials and tools in one place so we can share it with others easily without any borders or problems.

Shanti: When [Saleh] told me about this thing that they wanted to do, I was very happy. I'm in a different city‚ÄîI told Sara that I'm very ready to help them share robotics there. When I see my story and my growth and development, I really want to share this with different people.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How Prankster Oobah Butler Convinced Venture Capitalists to Give Him Over $1 Million","https://www.wired.com/story/oobah-butler-documentary-interview/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Not long into his new documentary, Oobah Butler tells the cofounder of his newly minted company, Drops, that they should create a piece of luxury luggage that ‚Äúlooks like a bomb‚Äù and will sell for $200,000.

Immediately, I'm thinking his quest to get ¬£1 million in 90 days might have come to an early end.

But I'm wrong.

Butler is a British prankster documentarian who is known for his stunts, like managing to get Amazon to sell its drivers' urine as energy drinks or creating a fake restaurant called the Shed and gaming TripAdvisor to make it the top-rated London restaurant on the platform. His latest documentary, made for the UK's Channel 4, is called How I Made ¬£1 Million in 90 Days. Set in London and New York, it takes on the worlds of startups, venture capital, crypto, and what ultimately comes across as a lot of bullshitting, in the name of striking it rich quick.

Butler opens the film by saying, as someone who didn't grow up with money and isn't particularly motivated by it, he's fascinated by the fact that people ‚Äúidolize‚Äù wealthy entrepreneurs.

‚ÄúIt came from a place of wanting to understand why ... everyone is so obsessed with money in this way,‚Äù he tells WIRED. ‚ÄúAnd I'm not talking about survival. I'm not talking about affording to exist. I'm talking about ... being addicted to the making of money.‚Äù

His only rules for getting ¬£1 million ($1.3 million USD) are that he's not allowed to break the law and whatever costs he incurs trying to make it are his to bear. He employs several strategies to rack up the cash, including simply asking rich people for it (this doesn't go well) and creating hype for crypto company UNFK by doing things like tricking bankers into committing crimes on camera. He also creates Drops, a company that makes news for its controversial stunts and then tries to capitalize on the attention by selling ‚Äúvery overpriced‚Äù items.

Butler seeks the advice of Venmo cofounder Iqram Magdon-Ismail, who quickly declares himself Butler's cofounder on Drops and seems very enthusiastic at first, musing that the company is already ‚Äúworth at least $10 million‚Äù just because the two of them are attached to it, and that they might be able sell out Madison Square Garden in a year's time to tell their story. Their brainstorming session includes schemes for buying the first piece of land on Mars and selling the opportunity to name the ‚Äúfirst branded species.‚Äù But after Butler suggests the bomb-like suitcase and a pair of ‚Äúreal life ad blocking sunglasses‚Äù that remove the wearer's vision entirely, Magdon-Ismail temporarily ghosts him.

Butler then embarks on a memecoin adventure that goes south, before coming back to Drops and launching the ‚Äúfirst legal child sweatshop in Britain in over a century.‚Äù He finds a loophole to avoid paying the child workers, reasoning that because he is filming the kids for the documentary, they are technically performers. His underage staff help him come up with marketing ideas to sell bespoke soccer jerseys featuring a fake religious cigarette brand called Holy Smokes. Though the clothing line gets coverage in GQ, Butler doesn't sell anything close to ¬£1 million worth of jerseys.

There are more ups and downs, culminating in a reunion with Magdon-Ismail as Butler is still short of his goal and running out of time. So Magdon-Ismail introduces Butler to a group of investors where Butler tries to auction off himself‚Äîor more specifically, a 10 percent stake in him for the rest of his life‚Äîfor ¬£1 million. (‚ÄúWhat if he gets hit by a car tomorrow?‚Äù one potential investor asks in earnest.)

While hilarious, the documentary is an eye-opening commentary on the house of cards many modern business ventures seem to be built on. It's also a study of society's obsession with getting rich, which has only blossomed with the rise of influencer and manosphere-led self-help advice.

WIRED asked Butler what he learned from doing business with 1 percenters, if he feels compelled by hustle culture, and how he keeps convincing people to be a party to his ridiculous hijinks.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

WIRED: What moved you to try to get ¬£1 million in 90 days?

Oobah Butler: It was coming as a result of being bombarded with hustle culture. The most influential people online seem to be people who are really dedicated to moneymaking. I understand we're at a point where people are really struggling to find any of the things that provide them with security and an easier life. However, I don't think the numbers of the more entrepreneurial podcasts you listen to correlates directly with your comfort in life and the money you make. It's almost like an addictive mindset that somehow makes you feel like you're actively doing something, but it's not actually effective.

Is there a big difference between the hustle culture in the States, or New York, compared to the UK?

I moved from London to New York during the film. The way that people talk about money here, the way that people pursue money here, it's a lot more open and a lot more, in some ways, grotesque. In the UK, we have old money. Most industries are ruled by people who went to the same schools or are from a certain set of families. Old money here is more fringe. The pursuit of money at all costs, without any sense of morality, it's a really interesting thing, and that's kind of what I tried to ground this film in.

You listened to and read a lot of self-help advice from people like Elon Musk and Jordan Belfort [of The Wolf of Wall Street fame]. Did you find it compelling?

There's something that I learned in a film ... which is this idea of, no matter what experience you go through, and how the reality of it is way more complicated, [still] selling it as this massive win. There's almost a shamelessness and an indefatigable nature of these people. Jordan Belfort went to prison for fraud and fucked a load of people over. There's something very New York about, like, doing white-collar crime and then just rolling back out and just starting again.

With respect to some of these ideas, like the first legal child sweatshop, the suitcase that looks like a bomb. When you were bouncing these ideas around with Iqram, what were you going for? Were you trying to get him to be like ‚Äúno‚Äù?

I was trying. I genuinely was. I'm just not a good business guy. I thought that would be a good idea. And it basically led to him fucking completely ghosting me. Everything he says is, like, let's make a dope-ass Shopify for creators. And you know, he's a proper business guy. He made Venmo. I made a fucking fake shed in a restaurant in London. You just try to lean into what you can do.

Do you find it intimidating to be around super wealthy people?

I grew up in a village where it was a lot of very rich families and stuff. My great grandmother was a servant at the local hall, like the Downton Abbey of where we grew up. I've always been around people who are quite posh and quite rich, even though we grew up working class. I'm the youngest of six. So I quite like cosplaying as a different class. In those rooms around these kinds of people, I almost sort of enjoy it a little bit because I know I shouldn't be there.

In the film you mentioned having a struggle with crypto because it doesn't align with you politically. Can you expand on what you meant?

Being a kid in the '90s and having a mom and dad who were often in a lot of debt and had a lot of issues and always on the edge of fucking losing their house or whatever, seeing them kind of get victimized and fucked over by a pyramid scheme. My dad earnestly had said to me that a lot of the crypto stuff reminds him of the pyramid scheme that they fell victim to, and I suppose that that kind of stuck in my head. The thing that I didn't want to do was make a film about crypto. It just felt too easy. But the film had to be about it because it was about getting rich quick today. And it's like the Wild West. Seems like you can kind of do anything you want in this space without any fear of any consequence.

How comfortable were you selling yourself?

Initially you think, oh OK, so this is a bit odd. But then you think, well, I can have a million tomorrow and I don't immediately have to give anything away. The more I spoke to people about it, the more I felt good about it. Then it becomes a game of, well, I need someone to give me a million at least. But yeah, being on stage and having a room full of private equity people and venture capitalists and stuff discussing the life insurance policy they want to take on you is not the greatest.

After you were done with this, did you feel the urge to keep hustling?

I got addicted to the movement of just shit happening rather than the making of the money. I just think the excitement of being around potentiality is addictive. But to be honest, after this project, I was massively burnt out. The whole thing made me retreat from thinking like that rather than going further down the rabbit hole.

After months of deployments by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the National Guard across American cities, federal agents have been preparing to descend into San Francisco.

Local resistance groups have been coordinating with activists in other cities across the country that have been besieged by federal law enforcement. Thousands of volunteers, coordinating through Signal group chats, Zoom calls, and social media posts, planned protests and spread the word that federal troops are on their way to San Francisco. Even though they aren't‚Äîyet.

On Thursday morning, SF mayor Daniel Lurie posted on Instagram and X to announce that he had spoken with President Donald Trump and convinced him to call off the federal agents that had planned to go to San Francisco this Saturday. Trump confirmed that on Truth Social shortly thereafter, writing, ‚ÄúGreat people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a ‚Äòshot.' Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!‚Äù

Activists and San Francisco residents are not exactly convinced, and so the organizing continues.

Early this week, a contingent of around 100 federal law enforcement agents converged on Coast Guard Island, a small base in Alameda, just across the Bay from San Francisco that federal officials say is being used as a staging area for upcoming immigration raids. Only one road leads to and from the island, and once word spread about the deployment, agents were quickly boxed in. Around 200 protesters showed up Thursday morning to try to disrupt their movements, resulting in clashes.

On Wednesday night, a group called Bay Resistance held an educational webinar that drew a massive turnout; due to the limitations of the group's Zoom subscription, it had to cap the call at 5,000 attendees. Hundreds more viewed a recording afterward.

‚ÄúThe Bay is not going to sit quietly,‚Äù Emily Lee, a Bay Resistance organizer, said on the mobilization call. ‚ÄúWe are definitely going to be standing up together against this administration.‚Äù

Throughout the call, organizers spoke in English with Spanish translations, sharing plans for upcoming actions across the Bay. They talked about lessons learned from their direct communications with organizers in Los Angeles who mobilized against the ICE raids and federal troop deployments there, and the importance of taking the tack of Portland's protesters, who relied on humor and inflatable animals to counter ICE actions and protest Trump's claims of the city being a ‚Äúwar ravaged‚Äù hellhole.

‚ÄúWe're going to prepare ourselves, but we're also going to be joyful,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúSan Francisco, the Bay Area, we know how to have a good party here. And we need to show folks we're not going to stop living our lives.‚Äù

The morning after the Zoom webinar, Trump apparently called off plans to send agents into San Francisco. But a planned resistance rally at city hall went ahead anyway. The rally was arranged by an array of groups including Bay Resistance, local labor unions, and local activist groups. Speakers ranging from cultural leaders to SF district supervisors took the podium to make it very clear that they were not interested in putting a stop to the actions they had planned.

In the crowd of around 150 people, supporters held up signs that read things like ‚ÄúICE Out of CA‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe Hella Love Justice.‚Äù One woman, who said she is a longtime San Francisco resident and former circus performer, twirled around on the sidewalk in a Vladimir Putin mask with a small scowling Trump puppet dangling below her.

The crowd was pumped. ‚ÄúWe have the mechanisms to really get people out in mass numbers,‚Äù says Claire Donovan, Bay Resistance's communications manager. ‚ÄúWe're not scared to use that.‚Äù

Speakers at the rally were quick to challenge Trump's claim earlier this week that he had ‚Äúunquestioned power‚Äù to send troops into San Francisco, claiming that ‚Äúthe difference is I think they want us in San Francisco.‚Äù He seemed to be referencing the recent statements of a couple high-profile billionaires. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had called for the National Guard to be deployed to San Francisco ahead of his company's Dreamforce conference last week, then walked back that statement after a wave of controversy. Former DOGE head Elon Musk also advocated sending in the National Guard.

However the tech leaders feel, San Francisco officials who spoke on the steps of City Hall on Thursday were very clear about denouncing the deployment of federal troops in the city. As SF District 9 supervisor Jackie Fielder put it in her speech, they were all only out there because Marc Benioff, the powerful Trump-aligned billionaire, had said it was time to send in the National Guard. Fielder condemned the billionaires like him who have called for troops to police the city.

San Francisco supervisor Jackie Fielder speaks at the rally.

‚ÄúThis city does not belong to them,‚Äù Fielder said. ‚ÄúIt belongs to us. We are not backing down. We are not flying under anyone's radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you for calling Marc Benioff out on his shit!‚Äù someone else shouted after Fielder spoke.

But even without the ‚Äúsurge,‚Äù people in Big Tech's front yard are still fired up. ‚ÄúUltimately we see it as a win for people power that are organizing help to push them in this,‚Äù Donovan says. ‚ÄúBut it's not over. There's still so much Bay Area, so we want to be ready and stand in solidarity.""

The crowd outside SF City Hall.

The federal presence at Coast Guard Island is still ongoing, and protesters are continuing to stage demonstrations nearby. San Francisco may be out of the crosshairs for now, but Oakland, San Jose, and other Bay Area cities are still on alert. The rallies will continue even if federal troops don't show up in greater numbers.

As Donovan puts it, all these resistance efforts are in service of having a story to tell.

‚ÄúWe need to reframe the story so that it's showing that communities are the ones under attack,‚Äù Donovan says. ‚ÄúIt's not that our cities are riddled with crime.‚Äù

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Weak Data Infrastructure Keeps Most GenAI Projects From Delivering ROI","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/weak-data-infrastructure-keeps-most-genai-projects-from-delivering-roi-179980.html","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 12:01:49 GMT","

Despite billions spent on generative AI, most enterprises still fail to see measurable ROI. A new analysis suggests the problem lies not in algorithms or ambition but in the hidden layer beneath ‚Äî data infrastructure. Experts say storage, scalability, and performance bottlenecks are holding back enterprise AI from moving beyond pilot projects into profit-driving production.

A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study found that despite U.S. companies investing an estimated $30‚Äì40 billion into generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), 95% have seen no measurable return, with only 5% successfully deploying tools at scale. The issue is not infrastructure or talent but the technology itself.

Current AI systems lack memory, adaptability, and the ability to integrate into mission-critical workflows, according to researchers. Numerous outlets reported the MIT study, but it is not available directly from MIT.

A key finding revealed that a vast chasm exists between a small group of companies that extract millions of dollars in value from AI and the vast majority, which have zero measurable impact on their profit and loss statements. Four primary reasons support this claim.

Most GenAI initiatives often fail at the pilot stage. Only 5% of over 300 public implementations successfully scale to production with a measurable impact. Flawed enterprise integration, not the quality of the AI models themselves, results from tools that fail to learn from feedback and are not well-integrated into daily operations.

Another contributing factor to the low ROI results is that employees are using ‚Äúshadow AI economy‚Äù tools, such as ChatGPT, independently. A further reason for failure is mismatched priorities when allocating AI budgets. Sales and marketing receive roughly 50% of the funding, even though back-office automation is more likely to yield significant, measurable returns.

The ROI failure extends across all corporate layers, according to Bj√∂rn Kolbeck, CEO and co-founder of Quobyte. He noted that some come from products forced onto users by CEOs or half-baked ‚ÄúAI features.‚Äù On the technical side, models are often delayed or undertrained due to weak infrastructure, with storage frequently being the primary bottleneck.

‚ÄúAll suffer if you can't feed GPUs at scale ‚Äî [in terms of] memory, adaptability, and integration,‚Äù he told TechNewsWorld.

Kolbeck sees companies investing billions while overlooking adequate storage to support their AI infrastructure as one of the major mistakes corporations make. He said that oversight leads to three key failure factors ‚Äî festering silos, lack of performance, and uptime dilemmas.

The most critical resource for AI is data training. When companies store data across multiple silos, data scientists lack access to essential details.

‚ÄúStorage systems must be able to scale and provide unified access to enable an AI data lake, a centralized and efficient storage for the entire company,‚Äù he observed.

A lack of performance sets in when the storage system cannot keep up with the demands of the GPUs used for training or fine-tuning. This causes expensive resources to sit idle, frustrates data scientists, and delays projects.

‚ÄúSimilarly, when storage solutions aren't built for maximum performance and availability ‚Äì like many HPC storage systems ‚Äì you end up with the same problem: delayed projects,‚Äù he warned.

The MIT report noted that successful AI deployments integrate at scale. That requires fault-tolerant storage.

Traditional storage usually means enterprise storage. While they are reliable, they cannot scale out, Kolbeck cautioned.

‚ÄúEarly AI projects may work well, but as soon as these projects grow in size [as in more GPUs], these arrays tip over, and that's when mission-critical workflows grind to a halt,‚Äù he said.

Kolbeck explained the difference between scale-out architecture versus a scale-up approach as a better option for handling the massive and unpredictable data demands of modern AI and ML. He cited his company's experience in making that transition.

Quobyte provides a parallel file system that turns commodity servers into a high-performance, scalable storage solution. In the past, scale-up solutions have always failed.

So Quobyte ended up with scale-out. He noted that the company saw the strain in HPC, where vector machines gave way to clusters, in computer chips, where modern CPUs are scale-out, and also in the cloud.

The same principle applies to AI training. If you can't scale out, you are limited in how many and how large models you can train or fine-tune.

‚ÄúThe storage needs to keep up with this horizontal scaling. When you add GPUs, your storage needs to be able to scale out in lockstep,‚Äù he said.

AI workflows involve a mix of small and large files. Consider the massive performance requirements that arise when many GPUs access data in parallel, as well as the management of multiple users with varying requirements on the same storage system.

‚ÄúDeveloping and training AI technology is still a very experimental process and requires the infrastructure ‚Äî including storage ‚Äî to adapt quickly when data scientists develop new ideas,‚Äù Kolbeck noted.

Real-time performance analytics are critical. Storage administrators need to be able to precisely identify how applications, such as training or other pipeline phases, impact the storage. Most data scientists lack deep visibility into storage, and storage administrators need this information to make informed decisions about how to modify, optimize, and expand the storage system.

Quobyte's policy-based data management engine rapidly adapts to changing business, user, and workload requirements, providing complete control. Users can change how and where they store files and organize them with a few clicks, he added.

Kolbeck described traditional enterprise storage as built around 30-year-old technology, including the NFS protocol, which Sun Microsystems designed in 1984. This old-school approach cannot keep up with the scale-out requirements of AI.

His favorite examples are Yahoo and Google. Yahoo built its infrastructure on NFS-based enterprise storage appliances. Google, on the other hand, built its entire infrastructure on software storage using distributed systems technology on cheap servers.

‚ÄúThinking that the same recycled storage technology will now enable companies to run successful AI is more like wishful thinking,‚Äù he suggested.

Building the infrastructure for successful AI projects requires thinking like a hyperscaler ‚Äî a philosophy central to Quobyte's approach. The company's software-defined storage system applies distributed systems algorithms to deliver reliable performance on commodity servers, scaling seamlessly from a handful of machines to entire data centers.

Updated at 8:40 p.m. Pacific.

Alaska Airlines said it's recovering from an IT outage and ‚Äúactively restoring operations‚Äù as of 7 p.m. Thursday after grounding flights across the U.S. for about three hours.

In a statement sent to GeekWire, Alaska said the outage began around 3:30 p.m. PT with a failure at the company's primary data center. 

‚ÄúThe IT outage has impacted several of our key systems that enable us to run various operations, necessitating the implementation of the ground stop to keep our aircraft in position,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúThe safety of our flights was never compromised.‚Äù

The outage was not a cybersecurity event or related to other events, according to Alaska. 

Flights are resuming but passengers at some airports are facing long delays as they await inbound planes.

During the outage, passengers on Reddit reported that some planes were sitting on the tarmac or de-boarding. Customers also reported issues with the company's app and website.

It was Alaska's second outage in three months. The Seattle-based airline grounded flights after an outage in July that lasted about three hours.

Alaska Airlines is experiencing an IT outage affecting operations. A temporary ground stop is in place. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you're scheduled to fly tonight, please check your flight status before heading to the airport.

When Tim Chen tried to break into venture capital six years ago, multiple firms in Seattle turned him down. ‚ÄúNobody wanted to hire me,‚Äù he recalled in an interview with GeekWire. ‚ÄúI was too technical, they said. Too nerdy.‚Äù

Chen, a University of Washington graduate and infrastructure engineer who had just sold a startup, decided to launch his own firm. 

Six years later, Chen's investors ‚Äî known as limited partners, or LPs ‚Äî line up to give him money before he even opens a pitch deck.

Chen recently raised $41 million for a fourth fund at Essence VC, his venture firm that backs infrastructure startups. His LPs include institutional investors such as Andreessen Horowitz's Martin Casado and Cendana Capital's Michael Kim.

TechCrunch described Chen as ‚Äúone of the most sought-after solo investors,‚Äù highlighting how investors preempted the latest fund.

‚ÄúI had no deck, no memo ‚Äî I hadn't even started raising,‚Äù Chen told GeekWire. ‚ÄúThe LPs just all came in.‚Äù

Chen used AngelList to raise $1 million for his first fund in 2019, focusing on developer tools and infrastructure ‚Äî categories he knew inside out. The experiment quickly snowballed: he raised $5 million for Fund II and $27 million for Fund III. 

A dozen companies from the Essence portfolio have been acquired, including Tabular, a data management startup that sold to Databricks last year for a reported $2.2 billion.

What started as rejection has become a calling for Chen ‚Äî and an unconventional venture capital success story.

After studying computer science at the UW, Chen worked at Microsoft and VMware, helped launch open-source cloud startup Mesosphere, and later founded Hyperpilot, an ‚ÄúAIOps‚Äù company acquired by Cloudera.

Chen's experience as a software engineer and operator has become his edge in VC ‚Äî especially amid the AI boom. He's able to make faster decisions and gain respect from founders.

‚ÄúTim asked the hardest, most interesting questions about how we were going to build what we said we were going to build,‚Äù said Jordan Tigani, CEO of Seattle startup MotherDuck. ‚ÄúFrom a founder perspective, this let me trust that he actually believed in what we were doing and was coming to his decisions on his own.‚Äù

Seattle entrepreneur Patrick Thompson raised capital from Chen twice ‚Äî with his previous startup Iteratively, which was acquired, and his current company Clarify. ‚ÄúHe's one of the most technically-minded people, but also super humble and easy to work with,‚Äù Thompson said.

The combination of engineering depth and empathy has helped Chen win competitive early-stage deals. He's built a niche around helping technical founders translate research and code into products and go-to-market strategies.

‚ÄúI'm looking for people that have a deep enough background, with high intensity, and huge flexibility on learning,‚Äù he said.

Essence's portfolio spans across the U.S. and beyond. LPs ask Chen why he hasn't moved to the Bay Area yet. 

Chen is staying in Seattle, where he's lived since high school. He believes Seattle's tech scene is under-networked but brimming with talent. 

‚ÄúThere's so much great engineering talent with great iconic companies here,‚Äù he said.

Essence plans to make around 40 investments out of its fourth fund. Seattle is certainly on Chen's radar. 

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI'm meeting people here, like UW PhDs. I like technical people. The nerdier, the geekier, the better.‚Äù

Alaska Airlines is still working to restore operations following a major outage that forced the Seattle-based company to cancel more than 360 flights on Alaska and its subsidiary Horizon Air. 

The outage began Thursday around 3:30 p.m. PT. Alaska grounded planes across the U.S. as it addressed what it described as a ‚Äúsignificant IT outage.‚Äù

In a statement, Alaska said a ‚Äúfailure occurred at our primary data center.‚Äù The outage was not a cybersecurity incident, according to the company.

‚ÄúThe IT outage has impacted several of our key systems that enable us to run various operations, necessitating the implementation of the ground stop to keep our aircraft in position,‚Äù Alaska said. ‚ÄúThe safety of our flights was never compromised.‚Äù

The ground stop was lifted at 11:30 p.m. PT Thursday, but the company is still actively addressing operational impacts that resulted from the disruption.

The company canceled its planned third quarter earnings call on Friday. ‚ÄúWe do not yet have an estimate of the financial impact of the operational disruption on our fourth quarter results,‚Äù Alaska said in a regulatory filing. The company reported revenue of $3.8 billion, up 1.4% year-over-year, while profit dropped 69% to $123 million.

The impact of the outage was evident at Sea-Tac Airport on Thursday evening, where long lines wrapped around the concourse and a maze of suitcases piled up in the baggage claim area. 

The company's Hawaiian Airlines subsidiary was not affected.

Alaska encouraged customers to check their flight status before heading to the airport, and flagged its flexible travel policy.

It's Alaska's second outage in three months. The Seattle-based airline grounded flights after an IT outage in July that lasted about three hours.

While the U.S. government remains in limbo during a shutdown, the White House grounds have been busy this week. Construction workers have begun demolition on the White House's East Wing, which will be replaced by a 90,000-square-foot ballroom that's estimated to hold up to 1,000 guests.

Taxpayers are not funding President Donald Trump's $250 million project. Rather, he is using private donations to construct his lavish addition to the White House.

The White House released a list of the project's funders on Thursday, which include some of the most influential American tech companies, like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as defense companies like Palantir and Lockheed Martin and telecom providers like Comcast and T-Mobile. The crypto industry is also represented among the White House ballroom donors, with money coming from Coinbase, Ripple, Tether America, and the Winklevoss twins.

It is not clear how much each donor has contributed to the project. However, at least $20 million from Google is part of a recent lawsuit settlement over YouTube's suspension of Trump's account after the January 6, 2021, riots. TechCrunch asked Google if the money from the settlement represents the full extent of the company's contributions, but has not yet received an answer.

Silicon Valley's relationship with Trump has changed markedly. While much of the tech industry initially resisted Trump when he became president for the first time in 2016, it has cozied up to Trump during his second term. Meta, for instance, did not donate to Trump's first inauguration fund, but contributed $1 million to the president's second inauguration; Amazon donated $58,000 the first time, but made a heftier $1 million donation this time around.

These donations reflect a greater alignment between Trump and the tech industry.

The industry could be more willing to cooperate with Trump's current administration because many of these major tech companies are facing antitrust litigation. The Trump administration has been much less aggressive in its antitrust enforcement than former President Joe Biden's FTC was under former FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Trump has also taken a more aggressive approach to AI development than his predecessor, which is a financial boon for the companies building out that technology. In his AI action plan, which was unveiled in July, Trump and his administration outlined a goal to cut red tape and use government funds to support the construction of data centers.

Intel's third-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations Thursday, results buoyed by a bump in revenue combined with larger cuts, and multiple, sizable investments over the last two months as CEO Lip-Bu Tan looks to turn around the struggling semiconductor giant.

Intel's revenue results and its $4.1 billion in net income provides a far rosier view than its string of quarterly losses. But the company's recovery story deserves several chapters dedicated to cost cutting via layoffs and other reductions as well as a series of high-profile investments from Softbank, Nvidia, and the U.S. government.

Intel added $20 billion to its balance sheet during the third quarter, the company announced on its third-quarter earnings presentation on Thursday, sending its stock soaring. This growth was largely due to three sizable investments in the company over the last three months.

In August, SoftBank invested $2 billion. A few days later, the U.S. Government took an unprecedented 10% equity stake in Intel. The company has received $5.7 billion of the planned $8.9 billion from the U.S. Government thus far. Nvidia also bought a $5 billion stake in Intel in September as part of a broader deal to develop chips together over time.

‚ÄúThe actions we took to strengthen the balance sheet give us greater operational flexibility and position us well to continue to execute our strategy with confidence,‚Äù Tan said on the company's earnings call. ‚ÄúIn particular, I'm honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and Secretary [Howard] Lutnick have placed in me. Their support highlights Intel's strategic role as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company with leading edge logic, [research and development] and manufacturing.‚Äù

The company also received $5.2 billion from closing the sale of its ownership stake of Altera, a hardware company it had owned since 2015, on September 12. It also sold its stake in Mobileye, an autonomous driving tech company.

Intel grew its quarterly revenue by $800 million in the third quarter to $13.7 billion, compared to $12.9 billion. Intel had net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter, a steep reversal from the $16.6 billion loss it reported in the same year-ago period. 

Despite the strong quarter, there weren't many details on what will happen next with Intel's foundry business, which makes custom chips for customers. The business has floundered from the start and has been a focus of Tan, who initiated significant layoffs in its foundry business this summer.

The business appears to be a priority of the Trump administration; a key condition of the government's investment in Intel includes language that it will penalize Intel if it divested from its foundry business over the next five years.

Wall Street is keeping a close eye on foundry for signs of the company's long-term growth. Intel analysts told TechCrunch in August that the company did not need cash to turn itself around but rather a strategy to get its foundry business on track.

Tan said that Intel thinks its foundry business is ‚Äúuniquely positioned‚Äù to capitalize on the swelling demand for chips but was light on the details ‚Äî beyond saying that the company is actively engaging with potential foundry customers ‚Äî and added that the growth of the foundry business would remain disciplined.

‚ÄúBuilding a world-class foundry is a long-term effort founded on trust,‚Äù Tan said. ‚ÄúAs a foundry, we need to ensure that our process can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with their unique way of building their own products. We must learn to delight our customers as they count on us to build wafers, to meet all their needs for powerful performance, yield, cost, and schedule.‚Äù

Instagram announced on Friday that it will now let you go back and see your previously watched Reels thanks to a new ‚ÄúWatch History‚Äù feature. Rival TikTok has had a Watch History feature for a few years now.

With the new feature, you can go back and find videos you might not have had the chance to save. For example, you could be watching an interesting Reel and then receive a phone call, or accidentally close the app while watching, or get distracted by something else and lose your place in the Reels feed.

‚ÄúHave you ever tried to get back to a reel that you'd seen on Instagram and you just can't find it?,‚Äù Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in an announcement. ‚ÄúWell, there is a new feature that should help. If you go to ‚ÄòProfile' and under ‚ÄòSettings,' under ‚ÄòYour ‚ÄòActivity,' there's Watch History now, so you can see every reel that you've ever watched.‚Äù

Just like on TikTok, you can sort your Watch History by date, the past week or month, or a specific date range. Plus, you can remove Reels from your watch history if you'd like to. 

Instagram's Watch History offers a bit more flexibility when compared to TikTok's, as you can sort videos in chronological or reverse chronological order, or by author. 

Instagram says the feature was highly requested among users. Before this, users had found workarounds to recover lost videos, such as downloading their data from the app and sifting through it to retrieve their watch history. The feature makes the process of finding lost videos a lot simpler and gets rid of the need for these sorts of workarounds. Plus, it brings the Instagram Reels viewing experience on par with TikTok's.

Since its launch as a TikTok clone, Meta has been building out Instagram Reels with features that are already available on the popular short-form app. Most recently, Instagram started allowing creators to connect multiple reels in a series and launched support for Picture-in-Picture viewing, both of which are already available on TikTok.

An investigation by EU regulators has found TikTok and Meta in breach of the Union's rules concerning illegal or harmful online content.

The European Commission (EC) said on Friday that preliminary findings show both companies are not complying with Digital Services Act (DSA) rules that require them to give researchers adequate access to public data.

The Commission called Meta and TikTok's procedures and tools for requesting access to public data ‚Äúburdensome,‚Äù saying that researchers are consequently often left with partial or unreliable data, which affects ‚Äútheir ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.‚Äù

The Commission also said Meta's platforms ‚Äî Instagram and Facebook ‚Äî were both in breach of obligations to provide EU residents with simple ways to report illegal content. The Commission said both platforms impose several unnecessary steps before users can report content, and accused Facebook and Instagram of using so-called ‚Äúdark patterns‚Äù ‚Äî design tricks that manipulate users into taking certain actions.

‚ÄúSuch practices can be confusing and dissuading. Meta's mechanisms to flag and remove illegal content may therefore be ineffective,‚Äù the Commission wrote in a statement.

The EC also said both Meta platforms' moderation appeal mechanisms don't allow EU residents to fully explain or provide evidence to support their appeals. ‚ÄúThis makes it difficult for users in the EU to further explain why they disagree with Meta's content decision, limiting the effectiveness of the appeals mechanism,‚Äù the Commission wrote.

TikTok says it has made ‚Äúsubstantial investments‚Äù in data sharing and has given access to data to nearly 1,000 research teams via its research tools. ‚ÄúWe are reviewing the European Commission's findings, but requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR in direct tension. If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,‚Äù a TikTok spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Meanwhile, Meta claimed it has made changes to its tools and processes to comply with DSA requirements. ‚ÄúWe disagree with any suggestion that we have breached the DSA, and we continue to negotiate with the European Commission on these matters. In the European Union, we have introduced changes to our content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force and are confident that these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU,‚Äù a Meta spokesperson said.

The findings are part of investigations launched into both companies early in 2024. The EC had started looking into TikTok with a focus on advertising transparency, data access for researchers, content moderation, and protection of minors, as well as other concerns. The investigation into Meta was launched after the Commission said it suspected Facebook and Instagram of breaking rules for larger platforms concerning election integrity.

The DSA is the EU's set of rules governing online platforms and content moderation, which broadly addresses concerns over rising risks for consumer welfare in the digital realm. The law imposes a set of extra requirements on big platforms like TikTok and Meta in areas like algorithmic transparency and systemic risk.

Penalties for confirmed breaches of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual revenue.

The EC said Meta and TikTok both will be able to review its investigation documents, challenge the findings and commit to address them.

Also, this is just about preschool. For regular school, I've grown more skeptical, because it didn't work well for either of my kids. They struggled with the independence and planning, and didn't get much done. One switched to special education during primary school and is doing excellent there (but that has much more guidance and costs more, though I wish it was available for everybody), the other switched to a regular school during secondary school after almost failing to pass year after year despite his extraordinary intelligence. He's doing somewhat better now.It's a good option to have, but it's quite likely the advantage is bigger for preschool than school.

I compared Montessori and non Montessori labeled daycares/preschools for my 3 and 4 year olds, and was unable to discern a meaningful difference in the course of the day.Edit:  I ended up going with the daycare that had cameras (so that at least management could audit employees), and a livestream for the parents, which was at a non Montessori daycare.  Staff turnover also seemed lower.  Was more expensive, but have been happy with results.

Once I asked some advocate of the method, what was it exactly; the reply was very good and detailed, but then I pointed out institutes that ‚Äúfollow‚Äù the method, which were nothing as what he described. From that point, it was a mess. ‚ÄúWell, you must not absolutely do it that way‚Äù ‚Äúthere are variations‚Äù etc. I was pretty dissatisfied with the description, and was clear that is not very well defined.

The difference between these two, from my experience, is HUGE. Certified AMI schools, while a little more rigid in terms of teaching fine motor skills, generally have been better at making my kid more independent at doing things he likes to do. AMS schools are kind of wishy washy by comparison, and my kid was bored and under-engaged.

But can technology describe something so personal?

How are you feeling?

I'm genuinely interested in the well-being of all my treasured Checkup readers, of course. But this week I've also been wondering how science and technology can help answer that question‚Äîespecially when it comes to pain. In the latest issue of MIT Technology Review magazine, Deena Mousa describes how an AI-powered smartphone app is being used to assess how much pain a person is in.

The app, and other tools like it, could help doctors and caregivers. They could be especially useful in the care of people who aren't able to tell others how they are feeling.

But they are far from perfect. And they open up all kinds of thorny questions about how we experience, communicate, and even treat pain.

Pain can be notoriously difficult to describe, as almost everyone who has ever been asked to will know. At a recent medical visit, my doctor asked me to rank my pain on a scale from 1 to 10. I found it incredibly difficult to do. A 10, she said, meant ‚Äúthe worst pain imaginable,‚Äù which brought back unpleasant memories of having appendicitis.

A short while before the problem that brought me in, I'd broken my toe in two places, which had hurt like a mother‚Äîbut less than appendicitis. If appendicitis was a 10, breaking a toe was an 8, I figured. If that was the case, maybe my current pain was a 6. As a pain score, it didn't sound as bad as I actually felt. I couldn't help wondering if I might have given a higher score if my appendix were still intact. I wondered, too, how someone else with my medical issue might score their pain.

In truth, we all experience pain in our own unique ways. Pain is subjective, and it is influenced by our past experiences, our moods, and our expectations. The way people describe their pain can vary tremendously, too.

We've known this for ages. In the 1940s, the anesthesiologist Henry Beecher noted that wounded soldiers were much less likely to ask for pain relief than similarly injured people in civilian hospitals. Perhaps they were putting on a brave face, or maybe they just felt lucky to be alive, given their circumstances. We have no way of knowing how much pain they were really feeling.

Given this messy picture, I can see the appeal of a simple test that can score pain and help medical professionals understand how best to treat their patients. That's what is being offered by PainChek, the smartphone app Deena wrote about. The app works by assessing small facial movements, such as lip raises or brow pinches. A user is then required to fill a separate checklist to identify other signs of pain the patient might be displaying. It seems to work well, and it is already being used in hospitals and care settings.

But the app is judged against subjective reports of pain. It might be useful for assessing the pain of people who can't describe it themselves‚Äîperhaps because they have dementia, for example‚Äîbut it won't add much to assessments from people who can already communicate their pain levels.

There are other complications. Say a test could spot that a person was experiencing pain. What can a doctor do with that information? Perhaps prescribe pain relief‚Äîbut most of the pain-relieving drugs we have were designed to treat acute, short-term pain. If a person is grimacing from a chronic pain condition, the treatment options are more limited, says Stuart Derbyshire, a pain neuroscientist at the National University of Singapore.

The last time I spoke to Derbyshire was back in 2010, when I covered work by researchers in London who were using brain scans to measure pain. That was 15 years ago. But pain-measuring brain scanners are yet to become a routine part of clinical care.

That scoring system was also built on subjective pain reports. Those reports are, as Derbyshire puts it, ‚Äúbaked into the system.‚Äù It's not ideal, but when it comes down to it, we must rely on these wobbly, malleable, and sometimes incoherent self-descriptions of pain. It's the best we have.

Derbyshire says he doesn't think we'll ever have a ‚Äúpain-o-meter‚Äù that can tell you what a person is truly experiencing. ‚ÄúSubjective report is the gold standard, and I think it always will be,‚Äù he says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","What's next for carbon removal?","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/24/1126478/whats-next-for-carbon-removal/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Companies have still drawn down only enough CO2 to cancel out a few hours of US emissions. Here's what it will take to really scale up the sector.

MIT Technology Review's What's Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.In the early 2020s, a little-known aquaculture company in Portland, Maine, snagged more than $50 million by pitching a plan to harness nature to fight back against climate change. The company, Running Tide, said it could sink enough kelp to the seafloor to sequester a billion tons of carbon dioxide by this year, according to one of its early customers.

Instead, the business shut down its operations last summer, marking the biggest bust to date in the nascent carbon removal sector.

Its demise was the most obvious sign of growing troubles and dimming expectations for a space that has spawned hundreds of startups over the last few years. A handful of other companies have shuttered, downsized, or pivoted in recent months as well. Venture investments have flagged. And the collective industry hasn't made a whole lot more progress toward that billion-ton benchmark.The hype phase is over and the sector is sliding into the turbulent business trough that follows, warns Robert H√∂glund, cofounder of CDR.fyi, a public-benefit corporation that provides data and analysis on the carbon removal industry.

‚ÄúWe're past the peak of expectations,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd with that, we could see a lot of companies go out of business, which is natural for any industry.‚Äù

The open question is: If the carbon removal sector is heading into a painful if inevitable clearing-out cycle, where will it go from there? 

The odd quirk of carbon removal is that it never made a lot of sense as a business proposition: It's an atmospheric cleanup job, necessary for the collective societal good of curbing climate change. But it doesn't produce a service or product that any individual or organization strictly needs‚Äîor is especially eager to pay for.

To date, a number of businesses have voluntarily agreed to buy tons of carbon dioxide that companies intend to eventually suck out of the air. But whether they're motivated by sincere climate concerns or pressures from investors, employees, or customers, corporate do-goodism will only scale any industry so far. 

Most observers argue that whether carbon removal continues to bobble along or transforms into something big enough to make a dent in climate change will depend largely on whether governments around the world decide to pay for a whole, whole lot of it‚Äîor force polluters to. 

‚ÄúPrivate-sector purchases will never get us there,‚Äù says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. ‚ÄúWe need policy; it has to be policy.‚Äù

The carbon removal sector began to scale up in the early part of this decade, as increasingly grave climate studies revealed the need to dramatically cut emissions and suck down vast amounts of carbon dioxide to keep global warming in check.

Specifically, nations may have to continually remove as much as 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year by around midcentury to have a solid chance of keeping the planet from warming past 2 ¬∞C over preindustrial levels, according to a UN climate panel report in 2022.

A number of startups sprang up to begin developing the technology and building the infrastructure that would be needed, trying out a variety of approaches like sinking seaweed or building carbon-dioxide-sucking factories.

And they soon attracted customers. Companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Microsoft, and others began agreeing to pre-purchase tons of carbon removal, hoping to stand up the nascent industry and help offset their own climate emissions. Venture investments also flooded into the space, peaking in 2023 at nearly $1 billion, according to data provided by PitchBook.

From early on, players in the emerging sector sought to draw a sharp distinction between conventional carbon offset projects, which studies have shown frequently exaggerate climate benefits, and ‚Äúdurable‚Äù carbon removal that could be relied upon to suck down and store away the greenhouse gas for decades to centuries. There's certainly a big difference in the price: While buying carbon offsets through projects that promise to preserve forests or plant trees might cost a few dollars per ton, a ton of carbon removal can run hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the approach. 

That high price, however, brings big challenges. Removing 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year at, say, $300 a ton adds up to a global price tag of $3 trillion‚Äîa year. 

Which brings us back to the fundamental question: Who should or would foot the bill to develop and operate all the factories, pipelines, and wells needed to capture, move, and bury billions upon billions of tons of carbon dioxide?

The market is still growing, as companies voluntarily purchase tons of carbon removal to make strides toward their climate goals. In fact, sales reached an all-time high in the second quarter of this year, mostly thanks to several massive purchases by Microsoft.

But industry sources fear that demand isn't growing fast enough to support a significant share of the startups that have formed or even the projects being built, undermining the momentum required to scale the sector up to the size needed by midcentury.

To date, all those hundreds of companies that have spun up in recent years have disclosed deals to sell some 38 million tons of carbon dioxide pulled from the air, according to CDR.fyi. That's roughly the amount the US pumps out in energy-related emissions every three days. 

And they've only delivered around 940,000 tons of carbon removal. The US emits that much carbon dioxide in less than two hours. (Not every transaction is publicly announced or revealed to CDR.fyi, so the actual figures could run a bit higher.)

Another concern is that the same handful of big players continue to account for the vast majority of the overall purchases, leaving the health and direction of the market dependent on their whims and fortunes. 

Most glaringly, Microsoft has agreed to buy 80% of all the carbon removal purchased to date, according to  CDR.fyi. The second-biggest buyer is Frontier, a coalition of companies that includes Google, Meta, Stripe, and Shopify, which has committed to spend $1 billion.

If you strip out those two buyers, the market shrinks from 16 million tons under contract during the first half of this year to just 1.2 million, according to data provided to MIT Technology Review by CDR.fyi. 

Meanwhile, the investor appetite for carbon removal is cooling. For the 12-month period ending in the second quarter of 2025, venture capital investments in the sector fell more than 13% from the same period last year, according to data provided by PitchBook. That tightening funding will make it harder and harder for companies that aren't bringing in revenue to stay afloat.

Other companies that have already shut down include the carbon removal marketplace Nori, the direct air capture company Noya and Alkali Earth, which was attempting to use industrial by-products to tie up carbon dioxide.

Still other businesses are struggling. Climeworks, one of the first companies to build direct-air-capture (DAC) factories, announced it was laying off 10% of its staff in May, as it grapples with challenges on several fronts.

The company's plans to collaborate on the development of a major facility in the US have been at least delayed as the Trump administration has held back tens of millions of dollars in funding granted in 2023 under the Department of Energy's Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program. It now appears the government could terminate the funding altogether, along with perhaps tens of billions of dollars' worth of additional grants previously awarded for a variety of other US carbon removal and climate tech projects.

‚ÄúMarket rumors have surfaced, and Climeworks is prepared for all scenarios,‚Äù Christoph Gebald, one of the company's co-CEOs, said in a previous statement to MIT Technology Review. ‚ÄúThe need for DAC is growing as the world falls short of its climate goals and we're working to achieve the gigaton capacity that will be needed.‚Äù

But purchases from direct-air-capture projects fell nearly 16% last year and account for just 8% of all carbon removal transactions to date. Buyers are increasingly looking to categories that promise to deliver tons faster and for less money, notably including burying biochar or installing carbon capture equipment on bioenergy plants. (Read more in my recent story on that method of carbon removal, known as BECCS, here.)

CDR.fyi recently described the climate for direct air capture in grim terms: ‚ÄúThe sector has grown rapidly, but the honeymoon is over: Investment and sales are falling, while deployments are delayed across almost every company.‚Äù‚ÄúMost DAC companies,‚Äù the organization added, ‚Äúwill fold or be acquired.‚Äù

In the end, most observers believe carbon removal isn't really going to take off unless governments bring their resources and regulations to bear. That could mean making direct purchases, subsidizing these sectors, or getting polluters to pay the costs to do so‚Äîfor instance, by folding carbon removal into market-based emissions reductions mechanisms like cap-and-trade systems. 

More government support does appear to be on the way. Notably, the European Commission recently proposed allowing ‚Äúdomestic carbon removal‚Äù within its EU Emissions Trading System after 2030, integrating the sector into one of the largest cap-and-trade programs. The system forces power plants and other polluters in member countries to increasingly cut their emissions or pay for them over time, as the cap on pollution tightens and the price on carbon rises. 

That could create incentives for more European companies to pay direct-air-capture or bioenergy facilities to draw down carbon dioxide as a means of helping them meet their climate obligations.

There are also indications that the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN organization that establishes standards for the aviation industry, is considering incorporating carbon removal into its market-based mechanism for reducing the sector's emissions. That might take several forms, including allowing airlines to purchase carbon removal to offset their use of traditional jet fuel or requiring the use of carbon dioxide obtained through direct air capture in some share of sustainable aviation fuels.

Meanwhile, Canada has committed to spend $10 million on carbon removal and is developing a protocol to allow direct air capture in its national offsets program. And Japan will begin accepting several categories of carbon removal in its emissions trading system. 

Despite the Trump administration's efforts to claw back funding for the development of carbon-sucking projects, the US does continue to subsidize storage of carbon dioxide, whether it comes from power plants, ethanol refineries, direct-air-capture plants, or other facilities. The so-called 45Q tax credit, which is worth up to $180 a ton, was among the few forms of government support for climate-tech-related sectors that survived in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill. In fact, the subsidies for putting carbon dioxide to other uses increased.

Even in the current US political climate, Burns is hopeful that local or federal legislators will continue to enact policies that support specific categories of carbon removal in the regions where they make the most sense, because the projects can provide economic growth and jobs as well as climate benefits.

‚ÄúI actually think there are lots of models for what carbon removal policy can look like that aren't just things like tax incentives,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd I think that this particular political moment gives us the opportunity in a unique way to start to look at what those regionally specific and pathway specific policies look like.‚Äù

But even if more nations do provide the money or enact the laws necessary to drive the business of durable carbon renewal forward, there are mounting concerns that a sector conceived as an alternative to dubious offset markets could increasingly come to replicate their problems.

Various incentives are pulling in that direction.

Financial pressures are building on suppliers to deliver tons of carbon removal. Corporate buyers are looking for the fastest and most affordable way of hitting their climate goals. And the organizations that set standards and accredit carbon removal projects often earn more money as the volume of purchases rises, creating clear conflicts of interest.

Some of the same carbon registries that have long signed off on carbon offset projects have begun creating standards or issuing credits for various forms of carbon removal, including Verra and Gold Standard.

‚ÄúReliable assurance that a project's declared ton of carbon savings equates to a real ton of emissions removed, reduced, or avoided is crucial,‚Äù Cynthia Giles, a senior EPA advisor under President Biden, and Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a recent editorial in Science. ‚ÄúYet extensive research from many contexts shows that auditors selected and paid by audited organizations often produce results skewed toward those entities' interests.‚Äù

Noah McQueen, the director of science and innovation at Carbon180, has stressed that the industry must strive to counter the mounting credibility risks, noting in a recent LinkedIn post: ‚ÄúGrowth matters, but growth without integrity isn't growth at all.‚Äù

In an interview, McQueen said that heading off the problem will require developing and enforcing standards to truly ensure that carbon removal projects deliver the climate benefits promised. McQueen added that to gain trust, the industry needs to earn buy-in from the communities in which these projects are built and avoid the environmental and health impacts that power plants and heavy industry have historically inflicted on disadvantaged communities.

Getting it right will require governments to take a larger role in the sector than just subsidizing it, argues David Ho, a professor at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa who focuses  on ocean-based carbon removal.

He says there should be a massive, multinational research drive to determine the most effective ways of mopping up the atmosphere with minimal environmental or social harm, likening it to a Manhattan Project (minus the whole nuclear bomb bit).

‚ÄúIf we're serious about doing this, then let's make it a government effort,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúso that you can try out all the things, determine what works and what doesn't, and you don't have to please your VCs or concentrate on developing [intellectual property] so you can sell yourself to a fossil-fuel company.‚Äù

Ho adds that there's a moral imperative for the world's historically biggest climate polluters to build and pay for the carbon-sucking and storage infrastructure required to draw down billions of tons of greenhouse gas. That's because the world's poorest, hottest nations, which have contributed the least to climate change, will nevertheless face the greatest dangers from intensifying heat waves, droughts, famines, and sea-level rise.

‚ÄúIt should be seen as waste management for the waste we're going to dump on the Global South,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbecause they're the people who will suffer the most from climate change.‚ÄùCorrection (October 24): An earlier version of this article referred to Noya as a carbon removal marketplace. It was a direct air capture company.

These days, the two biggest dates for a movie are the day it comes to theaters and the day it hits your favorite streamer. The Fantastic Four: First Steps was released earlier this summer and now, io9 can exclusively reveal that it's coming to Disney+ on November 5.

That's right, in less than two short weeks, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach will bring their stretching, invisible, burning, and rocky selves to the streamer. The news will be made official later today at an event called SpaceCon in San Antonio, Texas, but we figured we'd give you a little preview. And this preview too.

Fantastic Four will also be ‚Äúthe latest film available in IMAX Enhanced on Disney+, featuring IMAX's exclusive expanded aspect ratio for all Disney+ subscribers, ensuring that the filmmakers' creative intent is fully preserved for a more immersive viewing experience at home. Subscribers with certified TVs and AV receivers can also experience IMAX Enhanced sound powered by DTS:X.‚Äù

In addition to the news, io9 is happy to debut this brand-new featurette with the entire cast, which includes Julia Garner and Ralph Ineson, talking about what makes the perfect Fantastic Four movie night. It's pretty great.

I enjoyed Fantastic Four when it was released but didn't feel the need to run out and buy it immediately when it hit Blu-ray and 4K. Now, though, with it coming to Disney+, it should be fun to watch without the huge expectations the film carried with it. After all, it's the third reboot of the franchise in the last 20 years. One that, even before it was released, was already tying into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to Thunderbolts.

And then, of course, this film also ends with a tease of what Sue and Reed's child could become, especially with a certain Doctor Doom noticing. We'll find out in a little over a year when the whole crew returns in Avengers: Doomsday.

So, again, The Fantastic Four: First Steps is coming to Disney+ on November 5. Will you be watching?

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a bizarre new video to social media platforms on Thursday featuring footage of federal agents arresting protesters in Portland, Oregon. The video uses a song that became very popular among Nazis and white supremacists at the tail end of President Donald Trump's first term, in what appears to be a dog whistle to far-right extremists.

DHS captioned the video, ‚ÄúEnd of the Dark Age, beginning of the Golden Age,‚Äù on sites like X and Instagram, along with a link to the ICE recruitment website. The video was also posted to Bluesky, the social media platform that many federal agencies joined one week ago to troll its more liberal userbase.

The song in the video, MGMT's ‚ÄúLittle Dark Age,‚Äù was released in 2018, though it's been slowed down to an absurd degree. And while nothing in the song suggests sympathy with far-right ideology (quite the opposite, in fact), the song was adopted by far-right content creators in late 2020 to pair with Nazi and white supremacist imagery.

The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a British think tank that tracks global extremism online, published a study in 2021 that noted how popular the song was with Nazis. One example used in the report shows how the song was paired on TikTok with a slideshow of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party, who was killed in 1967.

But the report also explains how popular the song has been to promote esoteric Nazism, featuring memes and fictional characters with far-right symbols like the Sonnenrad or Black Sun. The fact that the song is also slowed down in a very exaggerated manner in the DHS video is another hallmark of the far-right videos that went viral in the early 2020s.

Again, nothing about the song makes sense as a ballad for the far-right, as you can see from some of the lyrics, which seem to be criticizing police violence:

The Guardian described the far-right's affinity for the song in an article from 2024: ‚ÄúCertainly, its adoption doesn't say much for your average neo-Nazi's ability to understand English. Little Dark Age's lyrics are, fairly obviously, an excoriation of Trump-era America and racist police violence.‚Äù

Gizmodo reached out to DHS for comment, and the agency was characteristically indignant about our questions.

‚ÄúJust because you don't like something doesn't make it Nazi propaganda‚Äîthis is bottom barrel ‚Äòjournalism.' MGMT's ‚ÄòLittle Dark Age' is wildly popular on both sides of the political spectrum. Go outside, touch grass, and get a grip,‚Äù read an unsigned email, attributed to a ‚ÄúDHS spokesperson.‚Äù

The agency also sent a link to a 2022 article in Spin about the song and highlighted a quote from MGMT co-founder Ben Goldwasser that reads, ‚ÄúA lot of times, there is no deeper meaning.‚Äù DHS didn't respond to a follow-up question about who may have created the video.

That kind of response from DHS is to be expected, of course. The far-right often operates in a world of plausible deniability. But since President Trump returned to office in January, DHS has posted a lot of fascist content clearly intended to signal to Americans just how extreme the agency has become.

Back in August, Border Patrol, which is part of DHS, posted a video to Instagram and Facebook with the antisemitic lyrics ‚ÄúJew me‚Äù and ‚Äúkike me,‚Äù which only gained widespread attention last week. Border Patrol removed the video and reuploaded it with new music, but never explained why it was posted in the first place. The agency just sent a statement similar to that of a petulant child.

But people on social media know what the song ‚ÄúLittle Dark Age‚Äù can mean. One right-wing political commentator on X even had the idea back in July, writing, ‚ÄúDHS should drop a little dark age edit just to fuck with people.‚Äù And many far-right accounts on X clearly understood the message that was intended by posting a video with that song.

‚ÄúDhs is posting little dark age edits. Crazy timeline on our hands,‚Äù wrote one account that features a profile picture of an anime character wearing a Nazi hat. 

Another extremist account quote-tweeted the DHS video with, ‚ÄúGood job @DHS! You caught up to were we where 4 years ago!‚Äù That account included an upload of another video, which features Adolf Hitler along with the text ‚Äú12 years not a slave,‚Äù and a screenshot from the livestreamed rampage of white supremacist terrorist Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019.

It's not just the song that DHS has chosen that suggests the agency knows what it's doing. The imagery in Homeland Security's ‚ÄúLittle Dark Age‚Äù edit is pretty haunting, utilizing footage from the protests at an ICE facility in Portland and a glitchy aesthetic that's so common among so-called fashwave creators. (Yes, the fash stands for fascist.) The video features an ‚Äúantifa‚Äù logo that's usurped by the DHS logo, as well as clips of agents wearing gas masks while arresting people amid a haze of smoke.

Obviously, when you start talking about obscure corners of the far-right internet while using terms like fashwave it can sound a little silly. These are just internet memes, after all. But there's a visual language that has developed online among the far-right. And while DHS can insist they didn't intend for it to be interpreted as Nazi propaganda, there are plenty of literal Nazis online who believe otherwise.

Further evidence that artificial intelligence is not all that intelligent has been provided by an unfortunate incident in Baltimore, where, thanks to an AI-guided security system, local police nearly arrested a teenager for the crime of‚Ä¶eating Doritos?

According to NBC affiliate WBAL-TV 11, a teenager who entered his high school's campus through an automated security system had a crumpled-up bag of chips in his pocket. The system appears to have flagged the bag as a weapon, the outlet writes. The boy in question, Taki Allen, says that, following his football practice, he was sitting outside the school with a group of his friends when a large band of police officers showed up.

‚ÄúIt was like eight cop cars that came pulling up for us. At first, I didn't know where they were going until they started walking toward me with guns, talking about, ‚ÄòGet on the ground,' and I was like, ‚ÄòWhat?'‚Äù Allen told WBAL-TV 11 News.

‚ÄúThey made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuffed me,‚Äù the teen added. ‚ÄúThen, they searched me, and they figured out I had nothing. Then, they went over to where I was standing and found a bag of chips on the floor.‚Äù

When asked what he was thinking about as the ordeal unfolded, Allen replied: ‚ÄúIt was mainly like, am I gonna die? Are they going to kill me? They showed me the picture, said that looks like a gun, I said, ‚Äòno, it's chips.'‚Äù

A statement provided by the school's principal to the news outlet sheds more light on the incident:

At approximately 7 p.m., school administration received an alert that an individual on school grounds may have been in possession of a weapon. The Department of School Safety and Security quickly reviewed and canceled the initial alert after confirming there was no weapon. I contacted our school resource officer (SRO) and reported the matter to him, and he contacted the local precinct for additional support. Police officers responded to the school, searched the individual and quickly confirmed that they were not in possession of any weapons.

Neither police nor school officials have confirmed the involvement of the Doritos bag, but they haven't denied it either. Gizmodo reached out to Allen's school, Kenwood High School, as well as to Baltimore County police for comment.

WBAL-TV 11 says the company behind the detector, Omnilert (which calls itself a ‚Äúpioneer in AI-powered active shooter prevention technology‚Äù), provides security systems for Baltimore County Public Schools. The outlet says that Allen's school began using the company's software last year to detect potential threats to campus. Omnilert's website states that it sells an AI gun detection solution to schools. Gizmodo reached out to Omnilert for comment.

Lego certainly loves itself a ship‚Äîfrom Pirates of the Caribbean to One Piece (and of course, all those classic Lego Pirate sets of yore), if the brick builder knows one thing, it's how to make an impressive vessel. So perhaps The Goonies is the perfect movie for Lego to set its eyes on for its latest, lavish set.

Today Lego revealed its next release in the fan-design-supported Lego Ideas line will be a huge, 2,912-piece set inspired by the Inferno from the film. One side will faithfully recreate the exterior of the pirate ship commanded by the infamous One-Eyed Willy, while the other will feature vignettes of key scenes from throughout the film. Think the recent Lego Star Wars Death Star, but pirate-ship-shaped and also not $1000 (‚Äújust‚Äù $310!).

The replica of the Inferno houses a recreation of Willy's boulder traps and spike pits, the iconic skeleton organ, and even a nod to the octopus attack scene that was famously cut from the original film. And on top of the set itself, you'll also get 12 minifigures, giving you not just the Goonies themselves‚ÄîBrand, Andy, Data, Mouth, Mikey, Stef, and Chunk (and of course Sloth, too)‚Äîbut also the villainous Fratelli family in the form of Mama Fratelli, Francis, and Jake. To cap it all off, because it would be neither a Lego Goonies set nor a Lego pirate ship set without a skeleton, you also get the remains of One-Eyed Willy too!

The Lego Ideas Goonies set will be available from November 1 through November 3 for members of the Lego Insiders program, before going on general sale November 4, and will retail for $330. You can find more details here.

The benefits of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, aren't just limited to treating obesity. New research shows that semaglutide can protect people's hearts regardless of how many pounds they lose while taking it.

Scientists examined data from a large-scale clinical trial of people with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Compared to people on placebo, they found, those on semaglutide were less likely to develop heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems‚Äîeven when people hadn't lost much weight at all. The results indicate that semaglutide can improve heart health in more than one way, the researchers and outside experts say.

The findings ‚Äúhighlight that the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide may be independent of adiposity and weight loss,‚Äù Laurence Sperling, a preventive cardiologist at Emory University not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.

Semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs have heralded a new era of obesity (and diabetes) treatment. But for a time, it was unclear if these drugs would also improve people's cardiovascular health, and to what extent.

Novo Nordisk (the makers of Ozempic and Wegovy) funded a large, randomized, controlled, and double-blinded study designed to answer that open question‚Äîthe SELECT trial. It involved roughly 17,000 people with obesity and a history of cardiovascular disease, who were followed for up to five years. The primary results from the SELECT trial, published almost two years ago, showed that high-dose semaglutide (the version approved as Wegovy for treating obesity) reduced people's risk of heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events by 20% during the study period. Based on these findings, the Food and Drug Administration expanded its approval of Wegovy to also cover the prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk groups.

Obesity Drug Wegovy Found to Prevent Heart Attacks, Strokes in Major Trial

Since obesity is known to increase the risk of heart disease, it's easy to assume that semaglutide's heart benefits are mostly tied to helping people lose weight. But some evidence has already suggested it's more complicated than that. In this new research, some of the researchers who conducted the SELECT trial took a closer look at their data.

They ultimately found no clear relationship between how much weight someone had lost early into the study (20 weeks in) and their reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The heart-protective benefits of semaglutide were also largely the same across different baseline weight groups. In other words, someone who was overweight (a body mass index between 27 and 30) at the start of the study tended to see a similar reduction in heart disease risk as compared to someone with the highest level of obesity (a BMI over 40).

‚ÄúThis gives us important information that maybe we should be looking at the indication for these drugs beyond just whether your BMI is more than 27,‚Äù Howard Weintraub, preventive cardiologist and clinical director at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, told Gizmodo. Weintraub was one of the lead researchers of the original SELECT trial but wasn't involved in the new research.

The study did see an association between someone's waist circumference throughout the study and heart disease risk. The more a person's waist shrunk, for instance, the greater reduction in risk they had. Waist circumference is another measure of excess body fat. So semaglutide's slimming of body fat does seem to help explain why it prevents heart disease‚Äîbut only partly. The researchers estimated that just a third of semaglutide's effect on lowering cardiovascular disease could be accounted for by a trimming waistline.

The team's findings were published Tuesday in The Lancet.

The authors say these findings could have far-reaching implications for how semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs should be used. If its heart benefits are largely independent of weight loss, then it wouldn't be helpful to limit the prescribing of these drugs based solely on BMI. People taking semaglutide who lose enough weight to no longer qualify as obese might still benefit from continuing the drug for its heart-protective effects‚Äîjust as those who don't lose much weight may, too.

It's even possible that GLP-1 therapy could one day be reframed as a standalone treatment for heart disease, regardless of BMI. Richard Kovacs, the interim chief of cardiovascular medicine at Indiana University's School of Medicine, who is not involved with the study, notes that these findings could shape future guidelines in how doctors manage cardiovascular disease.

‚ÄúThis is a potential guideline changer because of its robust effect here. This is a well-run, large trial that we're all familiar with. It's an important analysis of it,‚Äù Kovacs, who is also the chief medical officer for the American College of Cardiology, told Gizmodo. At the same time, he adds, it would probably still take more data from at least one other large randomized trial for such a change to happen easily.

One important question left to answer is exactly how these drugs can improve our heart health. The researchers argue that some of the drug's protection likely stems from its anti-inflammatory effects, both on excess body fat and elsewhere. But the drug's influence on blood sugar control or our blood vessels could also be playing a part.

Yet another question is whether these heart-bolstering effects can be seen in people who aren't overweight or obese‚Äîsomething that Kovacs suspects will be put to the test soon enough. And it's still important to study whether similar benefits are apparent with other GLP-1 medications, including newer drugs that are combining GLP-1s with other compounds.

Ozempic Might Literally Change How Our Bodies Handle Booze, Study Finds

For now, this research is continuing to demonstrate that there's still so much left to learn about these already game-changing drugs.

‚ÄúI don't think we know everything that the GLP-1 agonists do yet,‚Äù Weintraub said. ‚ÄúSo doctors will need to look at this beyond the prism of a TikTok video, where kids are looking to lose a couple of pounds to look better. That may certainly happen, but I think the cosmetic issues and the role of weight loss are just a small part of it. And as a cardiologist, I'm more motivated by the sort of findings we're seeing here in reducing cardiovascular disease.‚Äù

The Upside Down is getting bigger, or at least it will look bigger than it does at home, as Netflix is reportedly bringing the Stranger Things finale to movie theaters nationwide.

UPDATE 10/23 9.15am ET: Netflix has now officially confirmed that the final episode of Stranger Things will debut in theaters December 31. According to a press release provided by the streamer, screenings will take place in ‚Äúover 350 theaters in the US and Canada‚Äù and will be timed to start at 5pm PT with the episode's release on Netflix, and run through January 1, 2026. Our original story follows.

According to Matthew Belloni at Puck, ‚Äú[The] Stranger Things finale *will* go to theaters: Remember last week when I suggested the recent talks between Netflix and AMC Theatres could lead to more theatrical partnerships beyond KPop Demon Hunters on Halloween? Now I can report that the two-hour Stranger Things series finale will debut in AMC and other theater chains on New Year's Eve, the same day it drops on Netflix.‚Äù

The report also clarified a point made earlier when the possibility was up in the air: ‚ÄúYes, the Duffer brothers were recently quoted in Variety saying they asked for theaters and were ‚Äòshot down' by Netflix's Bela Bajaria. But that interview was done weeks ago, before the theater deals were far enough along, so everyone was playing coy. The deals still aren't signed, I'm told, but it's happening. What's next?‚Äù

Well, what's next, we hope, is a Vecna popcorn bucket or sippy cup where the straws are tentacles.

Bringing the culmination of five seasons to the big screen would be epic. There were some episodes in season four that would have looked so cool on the big screen. With AMC theaters potentially in the mix, the screenings would be even more accessible than the current limited release of Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein. We're thinking that KPop Demon Hunters coming back to theaters for Halloween is a prime testing ground for a more regular Netflix and AMC partnership, to the benefit of audiences as well as streaming projects with cinematic potential.

Will you be watching the Stranger Things finale at home or in theaters, if the latter is an option? Let us know in the comments below!

io9 reached out to Netflix for confirmation of Puck's report and will update if we hear back.

Not enough Intel 7 capacity, as it seems.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Demand for Intel's processors for client and data center applications was on the rise in the third quarter of 2025, but the company could not fully capitalize on it as it faced numerous supply shortages across its business, which included shortages of its own production capacity and an industry-wide shortage of substrates, which will persist into 2026. The company is prioritizing the supply of data center CPUs, but going forward, it also plans to adjust the pricing of its products, which means increased prices of previous-generation client CPUs.

""Capacity constraints, especially on Intel 10 and Intel 7, limited our ability to fully meet demand in Q3 for both data center and client products,"" said David Zinsner, chief financial officer of Intel, during the company's conference call with analysts and investors.

While the Intel 7 (formerly 10nm Enhanced SuperFin) process technology introduced in 2021 ‚Äì 2022 looks ancient, it still packs quite a punch in terms of performance capability and Intel uses it to produce a host of CPUs, including 13th and 14th Generation Core 'Raptor Lake' CPUs as well as I/O die for Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids' CPUs and 5th Generation Xeon Scalable 'Emerald Rapids' processors that are still in demand. Recently, prices of Intel's Raptor Lake processors rose amid supply constraints up as demand for these CPUs is still high three years after the introduction.

As the company has no plans to expand capacities for previous-generation nodes, but foresees demand for Intel 7 and Intel 10-based products to remain strong in the coming quarters, it expects these CPUs to be in short supply well into 2026. Furthermore, to capitalize on it, Intel intends to adjust pricing and produce more high-end SKUs.

""Given the current tight capacity environment, which we expect [to] persist into 2026, we are working closely with customers to maximize our available output, including adjusting pricing and mix,"" said Zinsner.

As for Intel 10 (formerly 10nm SuperFin), it is hard to tell which of Intel's broadly available CPUs use it, but Intel probably ships a boatload of long-life-cycle products made using this technology under long-term supply contracts.

As Intel's Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids' uses an I/O die made on Intel 7 process technology, insufficient capacity hits the company's ability to ship enough expensive data center processors. On the one hand, this might be good news for Intel as demand for its server CPUs is back and it can sell them without a discount or even at a higher price. However, if it does not have enough I/O dies, it cannot ship processors at all. Therefore, it has to divert capacity to data center CPUs, thus cutting the supply of client CPUs, which is one of the reasons why Raptor Lake processors got more expensive recently and will likely gain price in the coming months.

""[In Q4] we expect [client computing group] to be down modestly and [data center and AI group] [to be] up strongly sequentially as we prioritize wafer capacity for server shipments over entry-level client parts,"" said Zinsner.

Intel's decision to sacrifice some lower-end client CPU volume to keep server CPU customers supplied ‚Äî particularly hyperscalers and AI infrastructure buyers ‚Äî has a great rationale as data center CPUs are sold at thousands of dollars a unit, whereas even the highest-end client CPU is hardly sold at $500 - $600. Given the cost of semiconductor fabs and limited production capacity at Intel's 7-capable lines, Intel's management is forced to triage output toward the most profitable products.

In addition to insufficient Intel 7-capable capacity, Intel also blames the shortage of substrates used for CPU packages for the tight supply of its processors, which further complicates the company's supply chain.

""‚ÄäThere is also shortages even beyond our specific challenges on the foundry side,"" said Intel CFO. ""I think there's widely reported substrate shortages, for example. So, I think the demand, you know, there is a lot of caution coming into the year, I think across the board.""

In general, Intel warns that shortages of its processors will persist through 2026. On the client side, this is conditioned by the slow 18A ramp and decent demand for Raptor Lake processors, whereas on the data center side, it will be driven by insufficient Intel 7 capacity amid the continuous ramp of Xeon 6-series products. The shortages are expected to worsen in Q1, but then there may be some relief.

‚Ää""We may actually be at our peak in terms of shortages in the first quarter because we have lived through the Q3 and Q4 with a little bit of inventory to help us and just cranking the output as much as we could with the factory,"" said Zinsner.

It's not going to run out of rare-earth supplies anytime soon.

Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA) chairman and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) senior vice president and co-COO Cliff Hou said during a question-and-answer session that TSMC has enough rare-earth supply from its sources that it is not concerned about the short-term direct impact of any rare-earth export controls from China. Digitimes reports that TSIA has been monitoring the situation and that it does not expect any significant impact within the next couple of years. However, the primary issue lies in the transition to suppliers from Australia and other regions, should China completely stop rare-earth exports, which he says will take time.

Despite the name, rare-earth materials aren't rare at all, at least geologically speaking. However, the limited infrastructure required to extract and refine them is what makes them quite difficult to attain, with China owning over 85% of global processing capacity. The country has used this advantage in global trade negotiations, with Beijing declaring in 2024 that all its rare earth resources are now state-owned. It then banned some rare earth exports in April 2025, when President Donald Trump announced his far-reaching tariffs on all imports into the United States. This export ban was lifted in July in exchange for the White House removing export licenses for EDA software, but was reinstated with far more implications in October.

All this instability had the semiconductor industry reeling, especially as it affects chips that are 14nm and smaller or those that have more than 256 layers. There are other sources of rare-earth minerals, but they lag sorely behind China in output. Australia, one of the second-largest producers of rare-earth raw materials, is looking to capture more of it out of its mining waste. Canada is also making plans to expand its mining industry to include the crucial elements, while the U.S. is considering investing $2 billion to boost the rare-earth supply chain.

As for processing and refining, Malaysia hosts the largest non-Chinese refining facility in the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant, owned by the Australian Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. Incidentally, China has also been in talks with Kuala Lumpur, offering it assistance to develop so that it can tap its own rare earth reserves, which some estimates say are worth approximately $175 billion.

According to Hou, TSMC has one to two years of rare-earth supplies, allowing it to operate even if China turns off the taps. Its main concern at the moment is that it will take time for the company to pivot away from Chinese sources for medium- and long-term, with the shift expected to ‚Äútake time.‚Äù But the bigger question that looms is whether there would be enough supply for the company and the entire industry to pivot to if Beijing decides to cut off the world from its rich rare-earth reserves.

The legendary 1990s home computer is back!

Retro Games Ltd has lifted the curtain on the upcoming A1200 remake, and pre-orders will be open from November 10. Units will be launching from June 2026. We still don't know the price, but we have more details on the hotly anticipated retro computer.

The A1200 is essentially a Linux single-board computer running emulation, possibly one of the UAE (Ultimate Amiga Emulators) that have been around for decades. What makes The A1200 different from just building your own with a Raspberry Pi is that we get a full-sized recreation of the Amiga 1200, and that includes a working keyboard. The side-loading floppy drive isn't present, and I'll kind of miss the rhythmic ""tick, tick, tick"" as the drive sits idle. I'm sure someone will hack that feature in.

Also included are a ""tank"" mouse and a CD32-style game controller. The CD32 is a consolized version of the A1200. There is also a selection of 25 pre-installed games from the Amiga catalog, including greats such as the Turrican trilogy, Beneath a Steel Sky, and the recently ported The Settlers 2, which took 30 years to arrive on the Amiga! If you want to load more games onto your A1200, you can via USB. Games are typically in ADF (Amiga Disk Format) or HDF (Hard Disk Format). I wonder if games could be installed on a virtual hard disk using WHDLoad? If so, then the A1200 could become quite a nostalgia machine.

Each game has four save slots, enabling gamers to pick up and play games that typically did not have a save function (I've still not beaten Treasure Island Dizzy!).

It's not all about games, and the A1200 comes with an integrated Workbench desktop. Workbench was the operating system for the Amiga, and it blew many minds when it was unveiled at CES in 1984. What version of Workbench is included with The A1200 is unknown. To be period accurate, it would be Workbench 3.0 or 3.1.

The original Commodore Amiga 1200 was introduced in 1992, and it extended the form factor of the previous Amiga 600 into a sleeker case than the original Amiga 500. Under the hood, the Amiga 1200 ran a Motorola 68EC020 at 14 MHz, double the speed of the older Amigas. It had 2MB of Chip RAM, a side-loading floppy drive, and space for an internal IDE hard drive (an expensive addition in 1992). Graphics capabilities were much improved over previous generations. The AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture) provided more colors on screen. Older Amigas could render up to 4,096 colors on screen using HAM (Hold and Modify), but this was typically for static images. If you wanted better Amiga graphics on a budget, you paid for the A1200.

Retro Games Ltd has a history of creating slices of our childhood nostalgia. The original product from Retro Games Ltd was a mini version of the seminal Commodore 64. Since then, we have seen full-size versions of the Commodore 64, VIC 20, and ZX Spectrum. Other mini home computers are the C64 Mini Black Edition, an Atari 400, and an Amiga 500, which could be the same Linux SBC as used in The A1200. But that is mere speculation for now.

But the M5 fails to offer competitive performance in multi-threaded CPU-Z test.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Apple's processors are notorious for their high performance when running in their native environments: macOS and iOS. However, an experiment conducted by NPacific, a Chinese enthusiast (via HXL), shows that Apple's latest M5 processor can destroy high-end CPUs from AMD and Intel while running Windows 11 in virtualization mode. There is a catch, though: So far, the enthusiast has only benchmarked the M5 processor in CPU-Z, a synthetic benchmark.

Staying true to Apple's goal of developing processors with the maximum possible single-thread performance, the M5 system-on-a-chip (SoC) scores 1600.2 points in single-thread CPU-Z version 1.04.arm64 benchmark, assuming the results from an unknown enthusiast are to be believed. This is the highest single-thread score ever registered on a non-overclocked CPU in the CPU-Z database. To put it into context, Intel's Core i9-14900KS scores 952 points in this benchmark, whereas AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D achieves 867 points.

As it turns out, a custom Armv9 core from Apple running at up to 4.60 GHz can outstrip a Raptor Cove core by a whopping 68% and a Zen 5 core by astounding 84.5%, at least in this one benchmark. We do not know if Intel's and AMD's cores can actually achieve their 6.20 GHz and 5.70 GHz maximum boost clocks in CPU-Z, but the current result is fantastic for Apple.

When it comes to multi-thread performance in CPU-Z, the results are more of a mixed bag for Apple's M5. The CPU has 10 cores without simultaneous multi-threading, so the benchmark runs 10 threads on the processor, which scores 5976.2 points. Since AMD and Intel do not have high-performance client CPUs with 10 cores, it makes sense to compare Apple's M5 to CPUs running 8, 12, 16, or 20 threads.

Apple's M5 outperforms all CPUs running 8 threads, and its closest rival ‚Äî Intel's Core i7-12700K ‚Äî scored 5533 points. However, with its 12 threads, the CPU finds itself near AMD's eight-core Ryzen 9-7900X (5935 points) and well behind current-generation Ryzen 9900X or previous-generation Core i7-12700K (7550 points). With 16 threads, Apple's M5 result looks rather pale, on the level of Intel's Core i5-13450HX (5978 points), andwell behind AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D.

Since there is no CPU-Z compatible with macOS or iOS, we can only wonder whether the rather weak result of Apple's M5 is conditioned by its limited core count, lack of simultaneous multi-threading, or Windows 11's scheduler that does not know how to properly work with Apple Silicon CPUs in multi-threaded environments.

Keeping in mind that we are dealing with a synthetic benchmark run in virtualization mode, we can't really draw any solid conclusions from these results, except to note that Apple optimizes its SoCs to demonstrate maximum single-thread performance for higher power efficiency. That's not exactly anything new, but these results pique our interest, and we'd love to see the M5 tested in other benchmarks in Windows.

Donavyn Coffey

 October 24, 2025  

In late August, the federal government approved the investment structure of a medical device company called Requestor ‚Äî a decision that may reassure physician investors looking to invest in their area of expertise.

The company, which manufactures devices used for stroke treatment, was created by a physician and is partially owned by physicians, all of whom could influence referrals.

However, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Office of the Inspector General concluded the company's structure did not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute because the physicians owned only 35% ‚Äî well below the 40% threshold defined in the safe harbor regulations.

While the federal approval applies only to Requestor, it offers guidance for physicians interested in investing in other ventures. Caution is still warranted: Even with the best intentions, financial incentives can cloud clinical judgment and damage professional reputation.

More than ever, the scrutiny and consequences for physician investors loom large. ‚ÄúIt's always been a point of concern for any administration, but recently, we've seen more action with the Department of Justice prosecuting and HHS investigating this type of fraud,‚Äù said Nicolette Taber, associate attorney at Dickinson Wright in Chicago who specializes in healthcare law.

So where is the legal and ethical line? Medscape Medical News spoke with physicians, entrepreneurs, and financial experts to explore how doctors can grow their wealth without putting their patients or their credibility at risk.

The good news is that physicians have plenty of healthcare investment options that minimize conflicts of interest. When it comes to diversified exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, ‚Äúphysicians aren't treated any different than anyone else,‚Äù said Jackie Griggs, lead financial planner for Wrenne Financial, a wealth management firm for healthcare professionals. 

Funds like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, she noted, are roughly 9% healthcare related. But the stake a physician owns in any single company ‚Äúis so miniscule that there's no way they could benefit from some kind of prescribing.‚Äù

In Illinois, where Taber practices, med spas have become another safe and lucrative option, particularly for physicians willing to take an active role rather than serve as silent investors. 

Issues surface when physicians own larger shares of a business and stand to profit from referral or prescribing patterns. These financial ties, even when unintentional, can bias clinical judgment and lead to inappropriate care.

‚ÄúThe AMA [American Medical Association] maintains that physicians hold a fiduciary duty to their patients. They have to operate in patients' best interest, even if it comes at a financial disadvantage,‚Äù Griggs said.

Although 2025 has seen a surge in federal investigations, including more than 300 cases of alleged healthcare fraud levied over the summer, few laws directly regulate physician investing or conflicts of interest.

Federal regulations prevent physicians from using their clinical and research insight for insider trading. Stark Laws and Anti-Kickback Statute prohibit self-referrals ‚Äî cases in which physicians send patients for services that financially benefit them or their family members. Beyond these laws and acts of outright fraud, however, oversight is ‚Äúpatchy,‚Äù noted John Shufelt, MD, physician entrepreneur and founder of a physician-only venture capital firm.

The AMA Code of Ethics helps fill in some of the gaps. According to an AMA spokesperson, any investment in health-related businesses that could potentially place financial gain over patient welfare is concerning, including:

‚ÄúEven if you don't consciously bias your decisions, the appearance of impropriety can be just as damaging,‚Äù Shufeldt said. ‚ÄúPatients, colleagues, and regulators are quick to sense when medicine stops being purely about care.‚Äù

At best, such entanglements can cost a physician the trust of patients and colleagues. At worst, they can lead to malpractice lawsuits, compliance investigations, or even board sanctions. 

Just because an investment introduces some conflict of interest doesn't mean that it's entirely off the table, Taber said. The of Requestor decision clearly leaves room for physicians to balance patient care with financial investments. ‚ÄúIt's always important to cover your tracks,‚Äù she noted. ‚ÄúGet input from a healthcare attorney or financial expert and make sure you're complying with all the necessary federal regulations, safe harbor regulations, professional ethics, and employer policies.‚Äù

‚ÄúPhysicians are very smart and savvy, Taber added. ‚ÄúBut sometimes they ignore the requirements in place. The federal government put these in place for a reason: it's always with patient safety in mind.‚Äù

Like Taber, the AMA doesn't oppose every potential conflict, but it calls for transparency. The AMA Code of Ethics recommends that all financial interests be disclosed to patients. ‚ÄúWhether on consent forms that patients sign or website bios, patients should be clear on the financial interests of their provider,‚Äù Taber advised.

When weighing the ethics of a potential investment, Shufeldt said physicians can always come back to the mission. ‚ÄúIf your investments align with the same core mission that drives your medical practice ‚Äî improving care, reducing costs, expanding access ‚Äî you're more likely to stay on the right ethical side of the line.‚Äù

Ultimately, physicians' most valuable investment remains the one they make in their patients' trust.

QUEBEC CITY ‚Äî Among adult patients with congenital heart disease, type 2 diabetes can strike early and significantly affect mortality, according to a population-based cohort study presented at the 2025 Canadian Cardiovascular Congress. Unexpectedly, the risk was higher among women, even though patients with gestational diabetes were excluded from the analysis. The findings suggest a need to screen for diabetes earlier in patients with congenital heart disease.

‚ÄúWe know diabetes is a growing epidemic,‚Äù said Sabrina Maya D'Angelo, MD, second-year internal medicine resident at McGill University in Montreal, during her presentation of the data. ‚ÄúIn 2011, [Jonathan Afilalo, MD, MSc, and colleagues] showed the comorbidities that affect mortality in the aging congenital heart disease population. Diabetes was one of these comorbidities, but this work was done in patients over 65 years of age‚Ä¶. We wanted to focus on the younger patients.‚Äù

D'Angelo and her colleagues had three objectives. ‚ÄúFirst, we wanted to calculate the incidence rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the congenital heart disease population and compare it to that of the general population,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe also wanted to compare the incidence rate of severe lesions to that of nonsevere lesions. Second, we wanted to identify the predictors of early-onset diabetes in adult congenital heart disease patients and then to assess the association between early-onset diabetes and all-cause mortality.‚Äù

The researchers conducted a population-based cohort study using the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. They examined data from 1983 to 2017, which included socioeconomic status, hospitalizations, use of outpatient services, and vital status. Among a sample of 137,656 patients, 84,253 met the inclusion criterion of being aged 18 years or older and developing type 2 diabetes.

The investigators excluded patients with gestational diabetes and defined early-onset type 2 diabetes as disease occurring by age 40 or earlier. Incidence rates of type 2 diabetes were adjusted for competing risk for death, and propensity score matching was used to control for potential confounding variables when calculating survival following the development of type 2 diabetes.

Among the 84,235 patients who developed type 2 diabetes, 30,196 did so by age 40 years. The propensity-score matched analysis comprised 8825 pairs of patients: 2802 who developed diabetes by age 40 and 14,848 who developed it later in life.

The incidence of type 2 diabetes was higher in the congenital heart disease group vs the general Canadian population, patients aged 20-34 years (1.88 vs 1.40 per 1000 person-years, P < .001), patients aged 50-64 years (13.84 vs 11.08, P < .001), and patients aged 65-79 years (23.37 vs 15.14, P < .001) but not in patients aged 35-49 years (5.08 vs 5.40, P = .004). The incidence of diabetes in patients aged 20-34 years was higher among those with more severe congenital heart disease vs those with milder disease (2.47 vs 1.80 per 1000 person-years, P < .001).

Survival among individuals who developed type 2 diabetes by age 40 was lower than that among individuals who did not develop diabetes and those who developed diabetes later in life. Notably, the mortality hazard ratio (HR) was 2.5 times higher in patients with early-onset diabetes (HR, 4.19) than in those with those with late-onset disease (HR, 1.65).

Not surprisingly, predictors of developing early-onset type 2 diabetes included chronic liver and kidney disease, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. What was unexpected was that male sex was highly protective (HR, 0.69).

‚ÄúWhat's new and very interesting about the work that D'Angelo presented about diabetes is how big of an impact [it has] in‚Ä¶reproductive-age female patients with moderate-to-severe congenital heart disease,‚Äù Lily Lin, MD, pediatric cardiologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, told Medscape Medical News. Lin was not involved in the study but chaired the session in which it was presented.

‚ÄúIt was surprising because we always thought that being female protects against certain cardiovascular risks‚Ä¶. I really look forward to the next steps as she looks through a little bit more to see the granularities of the data, whether that can give us more clues. Or maybe we need to study it prospectively [to determine if we need to] be screening for diabetes earlier and [figure out] how we should better provide care, to minimize these additional risks for our patients.‚Äù

The study was funded by a Canadian Institute of Health Research Foundation grant. D'Angelo and Lin reported having no relevant financial relationships.

 October 24, 2025  

A pair of studies presented at Infectious Disease Week (IDWeek) 2025 Annual Meeting in Atlanta described the biggest risk factors for colonized patients progressing to infection in a single health system as well as the demographics of those who died from Clostridioides difficile infections in the US over the past quarter of a century.

Sustained exposure to high-risk antibiotics strongly predicted the likelihood that patients with C difficile colonization will progress to an infection. Following infection, White patients were at a greater risk for death from C difficile infections than Black or Hispanic patients.

The research presented overall ‚Äúre-emphasized the fragility and lack of resiliency of microbiome integrity in patients known to be colonized with C difficile who are subjected to another health stress, especially systemic antibiotic use,‚Äù said Sean M. Anderson, MD, clinical fellow in infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine, Baltimore, who was not involved in either study but attended the session where they were presented.

‚ÄúLeveraging knowledge of C difficile colonization status into clinical decision-making is a significant gray area in practice currently, even for experts in the field, given the lack of reproducible studies investigating regimens and outcomes of C difficile prophylaxis,‚Äù Anderson told Medscape Medical News. ‚ÄúThe accumulation of scientific evidence such as presented here is critical for developing guidelines to improve patient care in this highly common, highly morbid infection.‚Äù

C difficile ‚Äúremains a significant public health concern in the United States‚Äù that contributes to a ‚Äúsignificant amount of mortality and morbidity, especially among the hospitalized patients and the elderly age groups,‚Äù Sohaib Asghar, MBBS, lead author of the CDC WONDER study and an internal medicine resident at AdventHealth Internal Medicine in Sebring, Florida, said in a press briefing ahead of the meeting.

‚ÄúThe findings of this study underscore the importance of sustained preventive strategies to further reduce the burden of this infection,‚Äù Asghar said. ‚ÄúWhat he found most striking from the findings was that those with the most access to healthcare were most prone to the disease.‚Äù

His analysis of 25 years of data from the CDC found that White patients made up 83.9% of deaths related to C difficile compared with 8.1% Black patients, 5.5% Hispanic patients, and 2.2% others. Other risk factors included being women, being hospitalized, and living in the US South.

‚ÄúTraditionally we think that infections, especially healthcare-associated infections or wild infections like HIV and hepatitis, have social determinants, so we expect people who are getting infected or dying from these infections are usually from low socioeconomics or those people who have lesser access to healthcare utilization,‚Äù Asghar said during the briefing.

‚ÄúHowever, in C diff, it's actually the opposite,‚Äù Asghar said. ‚ÄúIt's the White population. They have more resources, they have more access to healthcare utilization, and they are more prone to being exposed to antibiotics or other risk factors‚Äù such as being in a nursing home.

Asghar and his colleagues used data from the CDC's WONDER database to analyze all 216,311 deaths of people in the US of any age who had C difficile colitis as a primary diagnosis between 1999 and 2023. They found that more women (58.2%) than men (41.9%) died from C difficile, with deaths in metropolitan areas accounting for 83.8%, while 16.2% occurred in nonmetro areas.

The geographic region at the highest risk for death was the South, which bore 33.1% of deaths compared with 22.2% in the Northeast, 24.4% in the Midwest, and 20.3% in the West. However, after adjustment for age, mortality trends were highest in the Northeast region. States with the highest crude mortality rates, ranging, respectively, from 4.1 to 6.6 per 100,000 people, included Missouri, West Virginia, Vermont, Ohio, Maine, and Rhode Island, while states with the lowest mortality rates, ranging, respectively, from 0.77 to 1.6 per 100,000 people, were Hawaii, Alaska, Utah, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia.

People in healthcare settings were most susceptible to C difficile deaths. The majority of deaths (71.2%) occurred in inpatients. Another 1.65% occurred in other medical facilities, while 15% occurred in nursing homes or long-term care, and 4.6% occurred in hospice facilities. Only 5.5% of deaths occurred in the patient's home.

Mortality trends remained stable over time in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, but they increased for inpatients. Emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens likely drove the upsurge in C difficile deaths seen between 2006 and 2015, Asghar said. Starting with a mortality rate of 0.5 per 100,000 people in 1999, it rose to 3.6 per 100,000 people in 2006 and remained there until 2016, when it began declining.

Among the factors that have helped contribute to that decline are the use of fidaxomicin and more effort spent on preventing recurrences by starting patients on stool microbiota transplants after their first recurrence, Asghar said.

‚ÄúIt's very effective. It's reducing their readmissions, it's reducing the overall healthcare burden, and it's also reducing the mortality, especially in the elderly group and especially those who are prone to develop fulminant C diff infection,‚Äù he said.

But he pointed to another major reason for the overall decrease in deaths.

‚ÄúThe gradual decline in the mortality rate is mostly attributed to improved infection and control practices and antimicrobial stewardship programs,‚Äù Asghar said. ‚ÄúThe irrational use of antibiotics has been one of the most associated risk factors associated with C diff infection.‚Äù

The other study presented at the meeting underscored the continuing role of antibiotics in the progression of C difficile colonization to infection. Patients with C difficile colonization had nearly triple the odds of progressing to an infection if they were exposed for an extended period to high-risk antibiotics that include clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, Sophia Chang, fourth-year medical student at Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, told attendees.

Chang and her colleagues conducted a retrospective case-control study of 2212 adults with C difficile colonization who underwent at least two two-step stool tests in the Duke University Health System between March 2020 and December 2023.

The researchers identified 71 cases of patients who progressed to infection ‚Äî a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and a positive result for the toxin enzyme immunoassay ‚Äî and matched them to 133 controls who were NAAT+ and toxin-negative.

The patients were matched on the basis of date of index testing within a year, and the researchers compared patients' demographic and clinical characteristics during the 90 days before index testing and a period of no more than 90 days between their index and repeat tests, considered the exposure period. The median exposure period was 28 days.

For both the preexposure and exposure periods, the researchers identified patients' receipt of antibiotics as high risk (clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins), low risk (all other antibiotic classes), or none. Then they stratified the patients into patterns of cumulative antibiotic exposure (none-none, none-low, low-high, etc.).

One of the strongest predictors of progression to infection was receiving high-risk antibiotics in both the preexposure and exposure periods. Patients with this antibiotic exposure pattern had 2.7 greater odds of infection after adjusting for other characteristics (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.7; P = .03).

‚ÄúIt was quite striking to note that over 80% of the case group who developed EIA+ [enzyme immunoassay] C diff infection received systemic antimicrobials during the study window, including over 60% who received a ‚Äòhigh-risk' antibiotic despite prior detection of C diff colonization,‚Äù Anderson said about the findings. ‚ÄúOftentimes, the use of these agents is unavoidable and minimally substitutable in many contexts, but it emphasizes the importance of taking into account knowledge of prior C diff colonization into clinical decision-making.‚Äù

Other major risk factors included admission for a cardiovascular diagnosis during the exposure period (aOR, 6.5; P = .003), peptic ulcer disease (aOR, 5; P = .02), and a Charlson Comorbidity Index score ‚â• 10 (aOR, 6.1; P = .01) compared with those with a CCI score of 0-2. The finding about peptic ulcer disease as a risk factor was new, Anderson told Medscape Medical News.

The study was limited by its small sample size, retrospective single-center design, and lack of data on illness severity or C difficile culture.

Nevertheless, the findings ‚Äúreinforce the need for vigilant antimicrobial stewardship across the continuum of care, especially in high-risk populations,‚Äù Chang said. ‚ÄúThe period following colonization represents a particularly critical window during which avoiding high-risk antibiotics may offer the greatest opportunity for targeted stewardship interventions.‚Äù

Anderson noted another limitation of the study that ‚Äúa blanket classification of ‚ÄòNAAT+/EIA-' patients as ‚Äòcolonized' rather than active disease is difficult to justify given that the EIA test has been shown to only be approximately 60%-70% sensitive for detecting active C diff disease.‚Äù He acknowledged, however, that ‚Äúthis testing pattern is the best and most reproducible proxy we have for comparing presumed colonized patients with presumed active infection patients, especially for retrospective, her [electronic health record]-based studies.‚Äù

Asghar reported receiving support from the HIV Medicine Association and reported having no industry disclosures. Chang reported having no disclosures, and her research was funded by the Duke University School of Medicine Eugene A. Stead Student Research Scholarship. Anderson reported being a sub-investigator in Vedanta's phase 3 clinical trial for VE303, a novel microbiome replacement therapy for recurrent C difficile infection, but for no financial compensation.

A faster, oral alternative to docetaxel is set to reach NHS clinics after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended darolutamide (Nubeqa, Bayer) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who are unable to receive or tolerate chemotherapy.

Detailed in NICE's final draft guidance, the decision will make darolutamide available through the NHS in England and Wales to approximately 6000 patients, offering a new oral therapy for those who with limited alternatives to docetaxel or other androgen-receptor inhibitors.

Darolutamide functions by blocking hormones that fuel cancer growth, specifically depriving prostate cancer cells of testosterone required for multiplication and spread. Patients take two tablets twice daily alongside standard ADT. 

Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, welcomed the decision and expects this approval to give clinicians and their patients ‚Äúmore flexibility to choose the approach best suited to individual circumstances and clinical needs.‚Äù

The guidance was finalised 5 weeks ahead of the standard review timeline, underscoring NICE's commitment to accelerating access to effective prostate cancer treatments.

The NICE's decision was supported by evidence from the phase 3 ARASENS trial (N = 1306). 

The results showed that adding darolutamide to ADT and docetaxel significantly improved overall survival in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, reducing the risk for death by 32% compared with ADT and docetaxel alone. Progression-free outcomes, measured by time to castration-resistant disease or death, also favoured darolutamide. 

A NICE network meta-analysis of the TITAN, ARCHES, LATITUDE, and STAMPEDE trials suggested that combining ADT with androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors such as apalutamide, enzalutamide, and abiraterone provides comparable survival benefits in this disease setting. 

NICE determined that darolutamide plus ADT delivers similar or lower overall costs to the NHS compared with apalutamide plus ADT. The list price is ¬£4040.00 for a 28-day supply (112 √ó 300-mg tablets), though Bayer has agreed to a confidential commercial discount.

The guidance requires healthcare providers to use the least expensive suitable treatment option, considering administration costs, dosages, price per dose, and commercial arrangements when choosing between darolutamide plus ADT and apalutamide plus ADT. 

NHS England and integrated care boards must provide funding within 30 days of final publication, with routine commissioning beginning after this interim period.

Physician certification systems are misaligned with modern medical practice, contends Harlan M. Krumholz, MD, in Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The certification process requires doctors to memorize obscure facts but does not test skills like shared decision-making that define expert practice, the journal's editor-in-chief writes.

‚ÄúThe focus should be on learning reinforcement, not punitive testing. Think Duolingo for core cardiology knowledge: convenient, engaging, and designed to build confidence rather than create anxiety.‚Äù

Australian researchers have identified two nervous system components that drive tumor growth in gastrointestinal cancers, creating promising new avenues for treatment with existing approved therapies.

Our gut contains its very own nervous system and is commonly regarded as the second brain. Key players of this system are neuropeptides, the signaling factors that are produced and released by nerves. These factors relay messages throughout our nervous system by connecting to receptors on the outside of cells, influencing a variety of processes.

The team at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute (ONJCRI) and La Trobe School of Cancer Medicine discovered that CGRP, a common neuropeptide, and its receptor RAMP1 influence tumor growth in colorectal and stomach cancers.

This is a significant breakthrough because drugs targeting CGRP and RAMP1 are already available to treat migraine. These therapies could potentially be repurposed to treat cancer, fast-tracking the path for clinical use.

Lead author of the paper published in BMJ Oncology today, Dr Pavitha Parathan, says: 

""We were surprised to see not only nerve fibers containing CGRP inside the tumors and potently promoting their growth, but also the tumor cells themselves producing CGRP. 

""This is very impactful because we have identified a new way that tumors can manipulate their environment to sustain their growth. The good news is that there may already be drugs available to block this and halt tumor growth.

""This is a druggable nerve‚Äìtumour pathway with existing therapies that are already well tolerated in other diseases, supporting ONJCRI's goal of making cancer treatments not just effective, but kinder and easier on the patient.""

The researchers used advanced genetic engineering techniques to delete the RAMP1 receptor in tumour cells, which significantly reduced their growth.

Dr Lisa Mielke, paper senior author and Laboratory Head at ONJCRI (the La Trobe School of Cancer Medicine), says: ""The role of the nervous system in cancer is an exciting new area of research, with high potential for novel treatment approaches.""

The next phase of our research will involve testing existing migraine therapies that inhibit CGRP to repurpose these drugs as cancer treatments.""

Dr. Lisa Mielke, Laboratory Head, School of Cancer Medicine, La Trobe University

""In the future, we hope to incorporate the existing CGRP inhibitors in clinical trials alongside conventional colorectal cancer therapies.""

Globally, gastrointestinal cancers are responsible for 1 in 4 cancer cases (4.8 million) and 1 in 3 cancer deaths (3.4 million).

T cells play central roles in the adaptive immune response against cancer. Their functional inactivation is a primary driver of tumor progression, making the reactivation of T cell function a main goal in immunotherapy. The review details how T cells specifically recognize and eliminate malignant cells by engaging tumor antigen peptides presented by MHC molecules.

""T cells can specifically recognize tumor antigen epitopes presented by MHC molecules to clear malignant tumor cells. The targets that can be recognized by T cells in tumors mainly include two types"", the authors point out. Highly immunogenic, tumor-specific ""neoantigens"" derived from somatic mutations, and more widely shared ""tumor-associated antigens"" that are overexpressed in cancers.

The review also illustrates how tumors evade this immune surveillance through multiple mechanisms, including suppressing T cell activation, inducing T cell exhaustion within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, undergoing immunoediting to lose target antigens, and creating physical barriers to T cell infiltration.

The team further provides a detailed discussion on the three major strategies of T cell-mediated immunotherapy:

""No single immunotherapy modality is sufficient to address the complex challenges of tumor heterogeneity, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and on-target/off-tumor toxicities,"" explains Professor Dong. ""The future lies in rationally designed combination therapies that integrate these approaches.""

The review identifies two critical frontiers for current research on immunotherapy: first, the discovery of more precise tumor antigens and the establishment of corresponding T cell receptor libraries to develop broader, more specific therapies; second, a deeper mechanistic understanding of T cell biology to identify key functional subsets and biomarkers for improved patient stratification, and ultimately improving the response rate of tumor immunotherapy.

This work provides a robust framework of T cell-mediated immunity and immunotherapy for researchers and clinicians, outlining a clear path toward more effective and durable immunotherapies for cancer patients.

The idea that Affordable Care Act marketplaces are riddled with fraud has become a major talking point among Republicans, as lawmakers in Congress argue about whether to extend the enhanced tax credits that are helping offset the cost of health care marketplace coverage for low- and middle-income people. Those ACA subsidies expire at the end of the year and have become a flash point in the government funding showdown.

""The tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry,"" said Vice President JD Vance during a recent interview on CBS News. ""We want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.""

Key to the Republican argument of widespread fraud is a report published in August by the Paragon Health Institute, a Republican-aligned think tank. The report focuses on ""phantom enrollees"" in the ACA marketplaces.

Paragon president Brian Blase said these ""phantom enrollees,"" who don't use any medical care in a year, exceed the percentages of ""what you would expect in a normal, functioning health insurance market.""

Blase and his team say they have quantified the percentage of zero-claim enrollees in the ACA marketplace by analyzing Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data released in August.

This highlights one of the central issues with the CMS data: It tracks the number of plan enrollments rather than individual enrollees.

The federal data that Paragon analyzed could count enrollees twice if they've switched plans during the year, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Per that data, in 2021, the percentage of enrollments without any medical claims was 19%. That percentage jumped to 35% in 2024.

To Blase and Paragon, this increase in zero-claim enrollments is evidence of fraud. It indicates, they say, that rogue insurance brokers are signing up people who don't exist, don't qualify, or have other insurance and don't need ACA coverage.

""Basically, what happened is you had insurers benefit, brokers benefit financially, and just massive numbers of people got put on the program,"" Blase said. That's where these phantoms come in. ""They have no idea that they're enrolled, and, as such, they use no medical care.""

In 2021, former President Joe Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, which included enhanced ACA subsidies that made plans available at low or no cost to certain low-income individuals and expanded eligibility for subsidies to some middle-income people. Those credits were extended through 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed in 2022.

News stories show how simple it could be for insurance brokers in certain states to sign people up for zero-cost ACA insurance plans, unbeknownst to the consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services has tried to crack down on those fraudulent practices.

But health policy experts and analysts have cautioned against reading too deeply into the numbers of zero-claim enrollees.

""It's not that he's wrong, but I think he's overinterpreting,"" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, of Blase's analysis.

Cox said there's evidence that plan-switching has increased, due in part to extended open enrollment periods. Increased plan-switching could make the number of people being double-counted higher in the federal data and increase the percentage of zero-claim enrollees over the years. Some enrollees also may have been on an ACA plan for only part of the year, which would make them less likely to make a claim.

""We're not trying to argue there is no fraud. It's a real thing. But the question is, how big of a scale is this problem?"" Cox said. ""Just suggesting that anyone who's not using health care is a fraudulent enrollee ‚Äî that's not true. Plenty of people don't use health care.""

It's not uncommon for healthy people in an insurance marketplace not to use their insurance in a given year, according to health policy experts. And with the enhanced ACA subsidies, more people signed up for marketplace coverage. Enrollment data shows that it made the marketplace population younger, and younger enrollees may be less likely to use their insurance. A recent report found that each year from 2018 to 2022, an average of 23% of enrollees in employer-sponsored plans didn't use their health insurance.

""Somehow the idea that people not using health insurance is some sort of a problem ‚Äî it might be. But in principle it isn't,"" said Joseph Antos, a health policy expert and senior fellow emeritus at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""The point is that for insurance to work, you need some people who are not making claims on the insurance.""

The main trade associations for insurers and hospitals, AHIP and the American Hospital Association, have also disputed Paragon's characterization of the federal data and even published blog posts breaking down their arguments. AHIP pushed back on the idea that the insurance industry is profiting from the enhanced subsidies by stating that existing law caps health plan profits.

Paragon was started by Blase in 2021 and has become widely influential in Republican health policy circles. Alumni of the organization are staffers in the Trump administration and in House Speaker Mike Johnson's office, so it follows that the group's takeaways would become Republican talking points.

It's also not new for the GOP to say that government programs are full of fraud. During the negotiations over the One Big Beautiful Bill, Republican lawmakers insisted Medicaid wouldn't be cut to pay for the tax cuts, but that ""waste, fraud, and abuse"" in the health program would be eliminated.

Now, the ACA is center stage in the ongoing federal government shutdown, with Democrats pushing for Congress to extend the current ACA subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. And fraud, again, is a centerpiece of the argument for Republicans. Democrats take a different view on the amount of fraud in the program, instead emphasizing how the subsidies' expiration will increase insurance premiums.

""It's become a boondoggle. It's a subsidy for insurance companies,"" Speaker Johnson said of the ACA subsidies at a shutdown press conference last week. ""When you subsidize the health care system, and you pay insurance companies more, the prices increase. That's been the problem.""

A study by University of California, Riverside, scientists has found that two toxic chemicals can form when the main ingredient in most e-cigarette fluids is heated, and that these compounds can harm human lung cells.

The researchers characterized the toxicity of methylglyoxal and acetaldehyde, both known toxins that can be generated during the heating of vaping liquids containing propylene glycol. While these chemicals are already recognized as harmful in other settings, their impact during vaping has not been well understood until now.

Using lab-grown human airway tissue, the team exposed cells to realistic levels of each compound and monitored how the cells responded. Both chemicals disrupted essential cell functions, but methylglyoxal caused greater damage at much lower concentrations. It interfered with mitochondria, the structures that generate energy for cells, and weakened the actin cytoskeleton, which helps cells maintain their shape and strength.

""These changes are signs of stress and injury that could contribute to long-term health problems if repeated during vaping,"" said Prue Talbot, a professor of the graduate division and lead author of the study published in Frontiers in Toxicology.

Talbot noted that acetaldehyde has received more attention in the past because it appears in higher amounts in e-cigarette vapor and is a known component of cigarette smoke linked to lung disease.

""However, our results suggest that methylglyoxal may be even more toxic to airway cells, despite appearing in smaller quantities,"" she said.

Man Wong, a graduate student and first author of the paper, said one particularly concerning finding is that lower-powered e-cigarette devices, often assumed to be safer, might produce higher levels of methylglyoxal.

""Because nearly all e-cigarettes use propylene glycol, understanding how these byproducts form and how they affect cells is critical to evaluating the long-term health risks of vaping,"" Wong said.

The study also showed that even short-term exposure to these chemicals can alter cellular pathways linked to energy production, DNA repair, and structural integrity.

Our work helps explain how vaping-related chemicals may contribute to lung injury. We hope it guides future studies and safety evaluations of e-cigarette products.""

Man Wong, First Author

Talbot and Wong conducted the research with Teresa Martinez and Nathan Hendricks. 

The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products, and the UCR Academic Senate.

Frontline healthcare workers struggling with depression after the COVID-19 pandemic experienced significant relief from a treatment combining psilocybin group therapy with mindfulness training, according to a new study from Huntsman Mental Health Institute at University of Utah Health. Doctors and nurses who received this controlled, group psilocybin therapy along with an eight-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program saw far greater improvements than those who only learned mindfulness techniques.

Benjamin Lewis, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at University of Utah 

The study, which originally appeared in PLOS Medicine, included 25 healthcare workers who worked directly with COVID patients and were battling both depression and burnout. A select group of healthcare workers were administered a single dose of psilocybin in a controlled clinical setting along with 8 weeks of mindfulness training while the other half completed the mindfulness training alone.

For those that were treated with the combination therapy, the group's depression scores dropped by more than twice as much as the meditation-only group in addition to feeling less emotionally exhausted and more connected to themselves and others.

Nearly half (46%) of healthcare workers who received psilocybin alongside mindfulness techniques were free of depression at two weeks, compared to just 8% who only learned mindfulness practices.

Most psilocybin studies are expensive and hard to scale up as they use two therapists per patient with individual sessions. This study delivered treatment in groups instead, creating an easier path towards scaling and a more accessible option for healthcare workers looking for relief.

A new study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines can amplify immune checkpoint therapy in lung and skin cancers by unleashing a potent interferon-driven immune surge that transforms resistant tumors into immunotherapy-ready targets.



Study: SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines sensitize tumours to immune checkpoint blockade. Image Credit: KwangSoo Kim / Shutterstock

In a recent study in the journal Nature, researchers investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines could sensitize cancerous tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study leveraged several extensive human datasets and found that COVID-19 vaccination within 100 days of starting ICI treatment was associated with improved survival in retrospective single-institution cohorts of melanoma and NSCLC patients.

Notably, preclinical models revealed that the vaccine triggers a massive type-I interferon surge, with anti-tumor effects dependent on signaling through the type-I interferon receptor (IFNAR1), a mechanism known to prime the body's T-cells to attack cancerous tumors. This interferon-driven response also promoted epitope spreading, in which activated T cells recognize multiple tumor antigens, and led tumors to upregulate PD-L1 as a counterdefense, rendering them newly susceptible to ICI therapy. These findings suggest that widely available, ‚Äúoff-the-shelf‚Äù mRNA vaccines could offer a practical, hypothesis-generating strategy to enhance ICI responses, pending further clinical validation.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are revolutionary anti-cancer interventions that harness the body's immune system to fight tumors. These elements block checkpoint proteins, off switches that prevent the immune system from attacking healthy cells. By blocking these checkpoints, ICIs enable immune cells (e.g., T cells) to recognize and eliminate cancer cells more effectively. Unfortunately, while ICIs are highly effective in improving cancer outcomes and survival rates, this only works for a fraction of patients.

For most others, research suggests that the immune system fails to recognize the tumor as a threat, a mechanism termed ‚Äúimmunologically cold‚Äù tumors. These tumors lack the pre-existing T-cells that ICIs need to activate, rendering the therapy ineffective.

To address these cold tumors, researchers have been developing and pilot-testing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines to heat them up by teaching T cells to find them. While these approaches show promise, their manufacturing processes are complex, expensive, and time-intensive, necessitating more readily accessible, cost-effective ‚Äúoff-the-shelf‚Äù alternatives.

The present study addresses this pressing need and supports future cancer therapy by leveraging a multi-pronged approach that combines human patient data, preclinical animal models, and a study in healthy volunteers to investigate whether COVID-19 vaccines could replicate personalized mRNA cancer vaccines by heating cold tumors.

The study first analyzed patient records from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, identifying patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic melanoma who were treated with ICIs. ICI-treated patient outcomes were evaluated to elucidate whether the outcomes of those who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine within 100 days of starting their ICI treatment (n = 180 NSCLC patients and 43 melanoma patients) were different from those who did not (n = 704 NSCLC patients and 167 melanoma patients) to evaluate the difference in overall survival (OS) across both treatments.

The study then used preclinical murine models of known ‚Äúcold‚Äù tumors (melanomas and lung cancers) to elucidate the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 vaccines' ability to heat cold tumors. Specifically, mice were treated with a lab-made version of the Pfizer vaccine (Spike RNA-LNPs), an ICI (anti-PD-1), or a combination of both. Blocking antibodies targeting IFNAR1 (the type I interferon receptor), but not IL-1R, were used to pinpoint the immune pathway responsible for the synergistic response.

Finally, the study conducted a human mechanistic study in which blood collected from healthy volunteers (5 receiving Moderna, 11 receiving Pfizer) at multiple time points before and after vaccination was analysed using high-sensitivity assays to measure changes in over 250 immune-related cytokines. Although exploratory due to small cohort size, the analysis revealed a dose-dependent interferon response, with Moderna's higher mRNA dose producing a somewhat stronger IFN-Œ± signal.

The study found that COVID-19 vaccination substantially improved patient outcomes. In the NSCLC cohort, patients who received a vaccine within 100 days of ICI treatment had a 3-year overall survival rate of 55.7%, compared with 30.8% in the unvaccinated group. Notably, this translates to a 49% reduction in cancer-associated mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, p < 0.0001).

Encouragingly, COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a greater benefit in metastatic melanoma patients, with the vaccinated group demonstrating a three-year overall survival of 67.6% versus 44.1% in the unvaccinated group (HR = 0.37, p = 0.0048). This group also saw a significant improvement in progression-free survival (HR = 0.63, p = 0.0383).

Importantly, no comparable survival benefit was observed with influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, and the association persisted after correction for immortal-time bias and propensity score matching. Notably, the benefit was extended to PD-L1-low or ‚Äúcold‚Äù NSCLC tumors, which typically respond poorly to ICI therapy, suggesting that the vaccine may help overcome innate resistance.

Results from the mechanism studies revealed that COVID-19 vaccines trigger a massive, viraemia-like surge of type-I interferons. Analyses of immune-related cytokines revealed that IFN-Œ± was the most upregulated cytokine, demonstrating a 280-fold increase in only 24 hours following vaccination. This IFN surge activates the body's innate immune system, priming T-cells to recognize and attack tumor-associated antigens (not viruses). The resulting T-cell infiltration prompts tumors to increase PD-L1 expression, a defensive adaptation that is subsequently neutralized by ICI blockade, thereby sustaining anti-tumor immunity. Blocking the type-I interferon receptor (IFNAR1) abolished the observed anti-tumor synergy in mice, confirming the pathway's causal role.

The present study demonstrated that clinically available mRNA vaccines, even those targeting non-tumor antigens (like COVID-19), are potent immune modulators that may sensitize tumors to ICIs through type-I IFN-driven innate activation and epitope spreading. These findings suggest that ‚Äúoff-the-shelf‚Äù vaccines could represent a practical, potentially scalable approach to turning cold tumors hot, overcoming a significant barrier to effective cancer treatment. However, the authors emphasize that these findings are observational and hypothesis-generating, requiring prospective clinical validation before therapeutic adoption.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health care, including cancer screening and diagnosis, especially for medically underserved populations, leading to substantial underdiagnosis of early-stage cancers in 2020. In a new study led by the American Cancer Society (ACS), scientists found that Medicaid expansion was associated with smaller declines in early-stage cancer detection among adults during the pandemic. The study is to be published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI).

Many people experienced job disruptions and financial instability during the pandemic, which led to cost barriers to timely care. This data suggests a protective effect of Medicaid expansion on cancer early diagnosis during the public health emergency.""

Dr. Xuesong Han, scientific director, health services research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study

For the study, researchers compared changes in proportions of early-stage (stage I/II) cancer diagnosis in Medicaid expansion states versus non-expansion states. Scientists analyzed data among 1,844,515 individuals aged 18-64 years newly diagnosed with cancer in 2018-2022 from the National Cancer Database using a difference-in-differences (DD) approach. Adjusted DD estimates were calculated and stratified by key sociodemographic factors and cancer type.

The results showed that the uninsured percentage among patients aged 18-64 years newly diagnosed with cancer remained stable at around 2% in Medicaid expansion states and an estimated 8% in non-expansion states. The proportion of early-stage diagnoses declined following the COVID-19 pandemic, but the decline was considerably smaller in Medicaid expansion states than in non-expansion states, particularly pronounced among patients aged 18-44 years, patients who are male with high comorbidity burden, and treated in academic facilities; the populations who were most likely to obtain insurance coverage through Medicaid expansion.

""Our findings can inform policymakers and the public in the 10 states that have yet to expand Medicaid eligibility,"" Han added. ""The findings also provide critical information for policymakers and the public in all states about the public health implications of upcoming large federal cuts to Medicaid programs and expected loss of insurance coverage for more than 10 million adults.""

""This research adds to the mountain of existing proof that Medicaid expansion saves lives from cancer by reducing the number of people who are uninsured,"" said Lisa A. Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), the advocacy affiliate of ACS. ""ACS CAN has long advocated for Medicaid expansion, and our work continues as states begin to contemplate how to implement the drastic changes from this summer's budget reconciliation law. These recent changes made by Congress to cut Medicaid will undo decades of progress in the fight against cancer. Increasing and protecting existing access to this critical program must be a priority nationwide if we are to end cancer as we know it, for everyone."" Other ACS researchers contributing to the study include Nova Yang, MSPH, Dr. Qinjin Fan, Dr. Leticia Nogueira, Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, and senior author Dr. Robin Yabroff.

Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., a global leader in life science research and clinical diagnostics products, today announced that MicroVal, the international certification organization for the validation and approval of alternative methods for the microbiological analysis of food and beverages, has approved iQ-Check‚Ñ¢ Enterobacteriaceae Kit for the real-time PCR detection of Enterobacteriaceae (EB) in infant formula, infant cereal with and without probiotics, and related ingredients.

Enterobacteriaceae, often used as indicators for hygiene process criteria, is a large family of gram-negative bacteria that encompasses well-known food pathogens including Salmonella Cronobacter, or pathogenic E. coli. Presence of the pathogens provides an indicator of process effectiveness to eliminate or neutralize biological contaminants and supports prevention of recontamination. The iQ-Check Enterobacteriaceae Kit is a complete, flexible, and open solution for EB detection, enabling industrial microbiology laboratories to control and effectively adjust quality assurance procedures.

MicroVal is an independent international certification organization that provides a standardized method validation system for the microbiological analysis of food and beverages. By certifying that proprietary testing methods perform as well as internationally recognized reference methods, MicroVal certification ensures acceptance of new testing methods by regulatory and governing bodies in the food trade. Validation of the iQ-Check Enterobacteriaceae method was carried out according to the ISO-16140-2:2016 and MicroVal technical guidance, confirming its capabilities to accurately detect common pathogens in infant formula and cereals.

The latest study for the iQ-Check Enterobacteriaceae method demonstrated excellent concordance to the reference method, ISO 21528-1, validating the kits for use in infant formula and cereal testing up to 375 g. The kit was evaluated on parameters including sensitivity, relative level of detection, inclusivity and exclusivity. In addition, Bio-Rad's iQ-Check Free DNA Removal Solution was validated as part of the workflow to remove free/dead cell DNA from the samples before PCR testing.

‚ÄúInfant formula and their related ingredients must be very carefully managed, requiring strict testing and analyses prior to commercial launch, with a strong focus on Enterobacteriaceae,‚Äù said Franck Edouard, Senior Marketing Director, Food Science Division, Bio-Rad Laboratories. 

Receiving MicroVal validation for our iQ-Check Enterobacteriaceae Kit for infant formula and cereal demonstrates the wide applicability of our iQ-Check kits, further cementing our position as leaders in food science.""

Franck Edouard, Senior Marketing Director, Food Science Division, Bio-Rad Laboratories

The method is complementary to Bio-Rad's iQ-Check Salmonella spp. and iQ-Check Cronobacter Solution. The certificate (2018LR80) is available on the MicroVal website. The iQ-Check Enterobacteriaceae Kit is also AOAC PTM validated for powdered infant formula and environmental samples (certificate 082003).

More expensive steak, cheaper tomatoes, but the same total cost for the average basket of groceries at the supermarket. A comprehensive study, led by researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden has analyzed the potential effects of a food tax shift ‚Äì where VAT is removed from healthy foods and levies are introduced on foods that have a negative impact on the climate. The study shows that a shift in taxes could have both environmental and human health benefits, and means that 700 fewer people in Sweden would die prematurely each year.

Today, diet in many high-income countries is a leading risk factor for certain diseases and premature death. In Western Europe, unhealthy diets cause many times more deaths annually than high levels of alcohol consumption, and about as many deaths as smoking. Furthermore, what we eat also has a very negative impacts on the climate. In Sweden, the negative impact on the climate from food consumption is roughly twice that of the direct emissions from all Swedish passenger car traffic.

Current policy initiatives mainly rely on providing dietary guidelines. The European Commission's own advisory body ""Science Advice for Policy by European Academies"" (SAPEA) has recommended the use of economic incentives to encourage healthier diets. This new study analyzed how such incentives could be implemented in practice using a food tax shift, and what effects a reform of this kind might have. The case examined was Sweden, but, according to the researchers, the results are relevant for most high-income countries. The study was carried out by researchers from Chalmers University of Technology, Karolinska Institutet, and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

""Today's diets are making us sick and negatively impacting the climate. If we want to do something about this collectively, taxes and subsidies are a good way forward. Our research also shows that this can be done without the average trip to the supermarket for groceries becoming more expensive when selective taxes on certain food groups are compensated by removing VAT on other food groups,"" says J√∂rgen Larsson, researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, who led the recently published study.

With a food tax shift, VAT would be removed from some foods that we should eat more of according to e.g. the recently released EAT Lancet report. The effects of imposing levies on certain foods that have a big impact on the climate were also calculated.

The study shows that the changes in diet that a food tax shift is anticipated to lead to can prevent about 700 deaths annually among people under 70 in Sweden. This can be compared with the figure of around 200 road traffic deaths in Sweden annually.

This high figure surprised us, and yet it is a conservative estimate. There is also a lot of suffering associated with unhealthy diets that is not apparent in this figure, such as living with obesity or type 2 diabetes.""  

J√∂rgen Larsson, researcher at Chalmers University of Technology

The food tax shift would also reduce the climate footprint of Swedes' food consumption by about 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. This is equivalent to an 8 per cent reduction in emissions from all passenger cars ‚Äì or nearly one in ten cars disappearing from Sweden's roads.

The study focused on four food groups:

The researchers focused on foods with robust scientific evidence for their effects on health or the climate, where reduced consumption of beef and lamb would benefit the climate, while other measures would mainly have health-promoting effects. VAT would therefore be removed for fruit, vegetables, legumes and whole grain products, and levies introduced on sugar-sweetened beverages, beef, lamb, pork and processed meat.

""That the price of food affects the level of consumption is well known. A historical example is beef consumption, which increased by 50 per cent in Sweden during the 1990s, largely attributable to the price of beef almost halving after Sweden's entry into the EU,"" he says.

The study's calculations were based on current VAT levels in Sweden, and confirm that price changes have a big impact on what consumers put in their shopping trolleys. The removal of VAT would reduce the price level of these products by almost 11 per cent, leading to an increase in consumption of, for example, 10 per cent for whole grain bread and 4 per cent for fruit and vegetables. The levy on sugar-sweetened beverages would increase the price by around 17 per cent, which the researchers estimated would reduce consumption by about a quarter. 

The biggest difference for Swedish consumers would be in the prices of beef and lamb, where the tax shift would mean a price increase of around 25 per cent, or almost 3 euros per kilo. This is estimated to reduce meat consumption by 19 per cent.

""While it might seem to be a big price increase, it would also lead to a decrease in meat consumption in Sweden by one-fifth ‚Äì thus returning meat consumption to the same level as in the 1990s. Not everyone needs to become vegetarian for the sake of the climate, but with more moderate consumption, a lot stands to be gained,"" he says.

Increases in the price of food usually hit low-income earners harder because this group spends a larger proportion of their income on food. But with the proposed tax shift, some foods would be more expensive and others cheaper, something the researchers see as an advantage for gaining public acceptance for the change.

""That the reform is also cost-neutral for central government also improves the chances of its implementation. In the long term, a food tax shift would benefit central government economically through better public health, reduced sick leave, and lower costs for health care,"" he says.

Researchers discovered that a single serving of dark chocolate milk improved sprint times and power output in young adults, suggesting its potential as a natural ergogenic aid, though benefits remain modest and context-dependent.



Study: Effects of Dark Chocolate on Physiological and Anaerobic Performance Among Healthy Female and Male Adults. Image Credit: xpixel / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers examined the effects of dark chocolate milk (DC milk) consumption on anaerobic sprint performance in healthy adults. DC milk contains biologically active compounds, such as catechins, epicatechin, theobromine, and procyanidins, that may support cardiovascular health.

Studies have reported that consuming dark chocolate products with high cocoa content may improve performance in endurance sports. Moreover, reduced mental and physical fatigue has been observed in dark chocolate consumers, leading to higher executive function. However, no study has examined the impact of dark chocolate milk on anaerobic performance.

In the present study, researchers assessed whether DC milk influences metabolic processes and increases performance during an anaerobic sprint test. They recruited individuals aged 21‚Äì35 years, with no medication use, no musculoskeletal injuries within the last six months, who exercised thrice per week, performing ‚â•75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity or ‚â•150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.

Participants were randomized to receive DC milk or iso-caloric white chocolate (WC) milk as a flavonoid-free control. They completed two trial sessions (WC and DC) with a 7-day washout period between them. Participants were asked to maintain their usual diet and physical activity throughout the study to reflect real-world conditions. Females completed the first trial during their follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Participants completed a physical activity readiness questionnaire before the test.

In addition, participants' body composition, height, weight, and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Subsequently, the DC group consumed 300 mL of DC milk, while the WC group consumed 300 mL of milk mixed with WC flavor. Participants rested for 1.5 hours after drinking their assigned beverage to allow for digestion. They completed a set of warmups 10 minutes before starting two sets of the running-based anaerobic sprint test (RAST).

RAST involved six 35-meter sprints with 10 seconds of passive recovery between sprints. Timing gates were used to measure the time to complete each sprint. The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and HR were recorded before the test and after the second, fourth, and sixth sprints. A four-minute rest was allowed after the first set of RAST before continuing to the second set.

Fatigue index (FI) and power output were calculated. A t-test was performed to compare performance and physiological data between RAST sets. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to estimate the average power output, average sprint time, HR, and RPE for each set and trial and between genders.

The study recruited 20 adults, with an average age of 25.07 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 22.85 kg/m¬≤. Significant differences were observed in FI during the first RAST and total effort time, average sprint time, mean power, and relative mean power during the second RAST between DC and WC trials. Specifically, mean power (p = 0.009) and relative mean power (p = 0.007) were significantly higher for DC milk compared with WC during the second RAST, as shown in paired t-test results. In addition, males and females showed significant trial differences in FI and resting HR, respectively, during the first RAST.

Further, males demonstrated greater improvements in mean power and relative mean power during the second RAST compared with females, highlighting a possible gender-specific response. A significant difference was observed in average sprint times across sprint sets and trials. There was an important difference in average sprint times between females during the first RAST in DC and WC trials, but not during the second RAST in WC and DC trials.

In contrast, no significant differences were observed between average sprint times for males in the first and second RASTs in DC and WC trials. Further, there were no significant between-trial differences in average power output per individual sprint set, even though the overall second RAST mean power improved for DC milk. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in average HRs or RPEs between the first and second RASTs in WC and DC trials.

The study findings showed that dark chocolate milk intake significantly improved total effort time and average sprint time in the second RAST. It also increased the mean and relative mean power output during the second RAST, particularly among male participants. There were no significant differences in average HR or RPE across sprint sets or trials. As such, the beverages' ability to further improve performance was likely negligible. Notably, FI was significantly different between trials in the first RAST, and resting HR was lower in females after DC milk intake, suggesting possible modulation of autonomic recovery.

Overall, the findings suggest that dark chocolate milk may modestly enhance anaerobic sprint performance, likely due to the combined effects of flavonoids and sucrose on blood flow and glycolytic energy supply. However, the authors noted that no physiological biomarkers such as nitric oxide (NO) were directly measured, so mechanistic explanations remain hypothetical.

Importantly, the authors cautioned that the improvements observed were statistically minor (around 0.5‚Äì1.5%) and may have limited practical significance for general exercisers, though such margins could be meaningful for competitive athletes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Updated guidelines published for pediatric CPR and emergency cardiovascular care","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251024/Updated-guidelines-published-for-pediatric-CPR-and-emergency-cardiovascular-care.aspx","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 14:24:00 GMT","

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association (the Association), a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, have published updated guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care for newborn and pediatric populations.

The ""2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care"" mark a comprehensive update to the guidelines for pediatric basic and advanced life support and neonatal resuscitation since 2020. Experts from each organization co-led the three chapters - Pediatric Advanced Life Support, Pediatric Basic Life Support and Neonatal Resuscitation, with writing groups evenly balanced between members of the American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics. The guidelines were jointly published online Oct. 22 in Circulation and Pediatrics as part of a comprehensive update of CPR and ECC recommendations for lifesaving resuscitation.

Every year, more than 7,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and approximately 20,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in infants and children in the United States.

Children are not little adults, and these guidelines offer specific recommendations that reflect the unique needs of children.""

Javier Lasa, M.D., FAHA, FAAP, associate professor in critical care and cardiology at Children's Health in Dallas and volunteer co-chair of the 2025 Pediatric Advanced Life Support Writing Group

The Pediatric Basic and Advanced Life Support guidelines are intended to be a resource for lay responders and health care professionals who provide care for infants and children in multiple settings: the community, prehospital and facility-based environment. Highlights from the new pediatric guidelines include:

Henry Lee, M.D., FAAP, professor of pediatrics and neonatologist from the University of California San Diego and American Heart Association volunteer co-chair of the 2025 Neonatal Writing Group stressed the need for properly trained neonatal clinical care: ""The guidelines also observe that one out of every 10-20 newborns each year needs help transitioning from the fluid-filled environment of the womb to the air-filled room. It is essential that every newborn infant has a health care professional dedicated to facilitating that transition who is trained and equipped for the role using these recommendations.""

While an updated unified chain of survival has been developed for adults and children, a separate new newborn chain of care was created that provides a framework for considering essential elements of the health care system relating to neonatal health.

Highlights from the neonatal guidelines include:

Volunteer writing group chairs representing both organizations participated in global launch events taking place simultaneously in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, the site of the 2025 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation meeting. The updated guidelines and CPR training materials are available in U.S. and international English-with many additional translated languages planned -so first responders, clinicians and other learners can begin using the most current, science-backed resources immediately. These educational materials can be accessed at the following links: Pediatric Advanced Life Support (https://cpr.heart.org/pals) and the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, 9th Edition (https://aap.org/nrp).

Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China. (1:15)

CHESTER, Pa. -- Everywhere fans turned on Thursday at Subaru Park, there were reminders of Alex Morgan's illustrious United States national team career, from the eponymous pink pre-wrap headband station outside the gates to a Morgan bobblehead handed out to the first couple thousand fans through the gate.

U.S. Soccer honored the career of Morgan on Thursday as the USWNT faced Portugal at the same stadium where Morgan scored the first of her 123 international goals, which ranks fifth in program history. She scored her first goal in the same stadium in 2010.

Morgan retired last year as a two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist.

""You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan, and I think the sport should show a lot of gratitude to that, because it's important for our players to be recognizable,"" USWNT head coach Emma Hayes said the day before the match. ""She is, without question, in recent times, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport.""

Former teammates Abby Wambach, Megan Rapinoe, Ali Krieger and Kelley O'Hara were among those in attendance for Morgan's ceremony before the match. Forward Trinity Rodman, who missed this training camp due to a sprained MCL, was also in attendance on the sideline before the match to support Morgan.

U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone and federation CEO JT Batson presented Morgan, flanked by her family, with flowers and a framed jersey with the No. 224, representing her number of appearances for the team.

""There was nothing she didn't achieve,"" Hayes said. ""She was a player that epitomized everything that this program is about. She's an unbelievable credit to her family, because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none.""

Prior to the match, the videoboard in the stadium ran a recording of current, younger USWNT players answering trivia about Morgan's career before sharing what the former forward meant to them and the team.

""She has meant so much to me and the game,"" USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson said Wednesday before practice at Subaru Park. ""She's made the game better. I feel like I wouldn't be in the position I'm in right now if it weren't for the players that came before me -- especially Alex -- and them fighting for equality and equal pay.

""I just want to continue her legacy, but thinking about what she did on the field is something that can't be replicated, which is really cool.""

Last month, the San Diego Wave retired Morgan's No. 13 jersey. Morgan ended her club career there and made San Diego a home for her family. She became a minority investor in the Wave earlier this year.

A second video tribute to Morgan at halftime Thursday ended with her daughter, Charlie, saying, ""Good night, we out.""

Despite the celebrations in honor of Morgan, Portugal pulled off a surprise win over the U.S., coming back from a goal down to win 2-1.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

SAL√â, Morocco (Oct. 24, 2025) -- The U.S Under-17 Women's National Team defeated Norway 5-0 to win Group C at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. It was the second time the USA has won its group at this tournament (with 2022 in India being the other) but the first time the U.S. U-17s have won all three group games. 

Three National Women's Soccer League players scored goals as forwards KK Ream (Utah Royals), Ellie Kocher and Micayla Johnson (Chicago Stars) and midfielder Mak Whitham (Gotham FC) each tallied their first goals of the tournament while Nyanya Touray came off the bench to score her fourth.

The USA will now face the third-place team from Group A, B or F on Tuesday, Oct. 28 at 11:30 a.m. ET on FS2.

The USA has scored 13 goals in group play in this tournament, matching its record for most goals during the group stage at the FIFA U-17 WWC, which was set in India in 2022, but that group stage included an 8-0 win over India.

U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer made six changes to the starting XI from the second group match, a 5-2 win over China PR that clinched a berth in the Round of 16 with one match -- this one against Norway -- remaining. Schoepfer kept the same back line and changed five of the six midfielders/forwards, and the USA scored five goals in a game for the second time in the tournament.

Goalkeeper Peyton Trayer got the nod in the nets for the USA after Evan O'Steen had started the first two matches. Trayer earned her first World Cup shutout. 

Norway, needing a win to have any chance of advancing in a tournament that sends four third-place teams to the knockout round, fell far short. It took the USA just under six minutes to score as Ream dribbled into the left side of the penalty area, made a bit of space for herself to shoot and smacked her left-footed shot off the right post and in from 16 yards out. For Ream, the youngest goal scorer in NWSL history when she tallied on Aug. 29 for the Utah Royals at 16 years and 52 days old, it was her first goal of this tournament. It was also the USA's fastest goal yet of the tournament.

The USA doubled its lead in the 49th minute and effectively put the game away as the young Americans were even more dominant in the second half. Midfielder Scottie Antonucci played a ball to Kocher just above the penalty box on the right. Kocher beat Norway defender Lea Ellingsen with a quick cut to her right as she dribbled into the penalty area and then struck her shot on the ground inside the left post from just above the corner of the six-yard box. It was Kocher's first goal of the tournament as well.

Midfielder Nyanya Touray entered the match in the 61st minute and made an immediate impact, scoring in the 63rd. The goal came as Ream got around the defense into the left side of the penalty area and cut a pass back to Touray, who perfectly timed her run and finished with the inside of her right foot from 10 yards out. The goal momentarily tied Touray for the lead in the Golden Boot race with four goals so far in the tournament, and she of course leads the USA in scoring.

The USA made it two goals in a two-minute span when a nice attack down the right side saw Johnson, who came on in the 62nd minute, cross from the right side to Ream, who sent a header on goal. Norway goalkeeper Sara Holte, who came on at halftime, saved the shot but spilled the ball right at the feet of Whitham, who smashed the rebound into the net from close range to make it 4-0 in the 64th.

The USA finished the scoring in the 80th minute and this time it was Johnson. She played a give-and-go with substitute Lauren Malsom in the right side of the penalty box and then rolled her shot off the left post and in from about 16 yards out.

Trayer was called into action in the 30th minute as Norway forward Christina Herseth got behind the U.S. defense into the left side of the penalty area drove a high shot at goal. Trayer pushed the ball away, but the rebound fell to another Norway attacker and Trayer had to save that shot with a dive to her left.

The USA utilized the Video Support System in the 38th minute, asking for a penalty kick review as Celia Halvorsen bundled into outside back Sydney Schmidt in the right side of the penalty area as both battled for a cross. After video review, the referee denied the request.

Whitham had two good chances to score inside the final five minutes of the first half. In the 42nd minute she intercepted a back pass deep inside the penalty box, but she was in close quarters with the Norway goalkeeper Maria Kroken, who stole the ball off her feet. In the 45th minute, Schmidt made a great dribbling run, advanced the ball 40 yards down the left side and played Ream on the wing. Ream crossed to Whitham inside the six-yard box, but the USA's youngest player at 15 years of age put her close range shot over the bar. Whitham would get her goal later in the game.

Norway exited its first FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup without scoring a goal.

USA ‚Äì KK Ream, 6th minute: The USA benefited from a Norway turnover in the back as Ream dribbled in the left channel and struck a left-footed shot from just inside the penalty area off the right post and in past the diving Norway goalkeeper. USA 1, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Ellie Kocher (Scottie Antonucci), 49th minute: Antonucci played a short pass to Kocher just above the penalty box on the right. She took on her defender one-on-one, scorched her to the outside, and then drove her shot on the ground inside the left post from just above the corner of the six-yard box. USA 2, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Nyanya Touray (KK Ream), 63rd minute: Touray immediately sparked the USA after coming off the bench, scoring seconds after subbing on. Touray ran onto a perfect cut back pass into the seam from Ream and finished with the inside of her right foot from 10 yards. USA 3, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Mak Whitham, 64th minute: Whitham capitalized on a mistake from the Norway goalkeeper who dropped KK Ream's header just in front of the goal and the 15-year-old made her pay, blasting the ball into the net from close range. USA 4, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Micayla Johnson, 80th minute: Johnson and fellow sub Lauren Malsom played a give-and-go in the right side of the box which set up Johnson to roll her shot off the left post and in from about 16 yards out and become the first American player to score in two FIFA U-17 Women's World Cups.

CHESTER, Pa. ‚Äî The U.S. women's soccer team stumbled Thursday in its first game since July, allowing a goal in each half that sent Portugal to its first win against the Americans, 2-1, on the same night two-time Women's World Cup winner Alex Morgan was feted with a star-studded farewell.

Portugal not only beat the Americans for the first time in 12 matches, it scored its first goals against them in international play.

U.S. coach Emma Hayes said she could tell at practice ahead of the match the nearly four-month layoff could affect her team.

""It felt to me like we just hadn't played together for a long time,"" Hayes said. ""I just didn't recognize us.""

Rose Lavelle scored only 33 seconds into the exhibition match for the hosts, only for Portugal goalkeeper Ines Pereira to shut the Americans down the rest of the game.

Lavelle electrified the crowd at Subaru Park, the home field for Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union, when she scored before many of the more than 17,000 fans had even settled into their seats after a pregame ceremony for Morgan.

""Sometimes you can start the game like that and you think to yourself, 'I hope we don't sit back and be passive,'"" Hayes said. ""That's what we did.""

Portugal's Diana Gomes scored her eighth international goal when she got a header past Phallon Tullis-Joyce that tied the game in the first half. Portugal had been outscored 40-0 by the United States in the previous 11 matches between the teams, plus Lavelle's goal.

Fatima Pinto scored her fifth international goal from atop the box through traffic late in the second half for the winner that gave Portugal its landmark victory.

""There is a standard of winning, and it kind of exceeds all those things, whether it's the time apart or the age of the team or experience. We have a choice now of how we respond,"" U.S. midfielder Sam Coffey said.

The U.S. team returned after a 113-day layoff for the start of a true ramp-up toward Women's World Cup qualifications. There's another match scheduled against Portugal and one against New Zealand to close out the three-match window at the end of the month.

The team needs the work before the results truly matter.

""We didn't look like the team that we've been working on, but that's what happens when you've got 113 days apart,"" Hayes said.

With the 36-year-old Morgan in the house, the stadium underwent a makeover in honor of her big night.

Her greatest moments (such as her four-goal game for the U20 women's World Cup team) were recognized in stand-up cutouts that lined the outside of the stadium. Girls lined up at the pre-wrap station to get their hair game-day ready, and T-shirts and banners with Morgan's name on them were the hot items for sale. Fans everywhere raised signs showing the former striker love in her national team send-off.

Even national team members who couldn't take the field wouldn't miss the big night for Morgan, who retired from soccer last year when she became pregnant with her second child.

American forward Trinity Rodman was on hand for Morgan's celebration but did not play as she recovers from a knee injury. Rodman has played for the Americans just once since they won a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Retired U.S. players Kelley O'Hara, Megan Rapinoe and Abby Wambach also attended the game.

Besides being part of Women's World Cup championship teams in 2015 and 2019, Morgan also won an Olympic gold medal in 2012. She played in 224 matches for the U.S. ‚Äî and was honored with a framed jersey with that total as the number ‚Äî with 123 goals and 53 assists. She was chosen the U.S. women's soccer player of the year in 2012 and 2018.

Morgan also played in 150 National Women's Soccer League matches during her professional career, spending time with the Portland Thorns, Orlando Pride and San Diego Wave. She rejoined the San Diego Wave in May as a minority stakeholder.

Hayes only had Morgan for one game during her tenure, but the former Chelsea coach has been around the sport long enough to appreciate the American great's impact on the game ‚Äî and for her to be feted at the same stadium where she scored her first national team goal in 2010.

""There was nothing she didn't achieve,"" Hayes said a day earlier. ""She was a player that epitomized everything this program is about. She's an unbelievable credit to her family because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none.

""You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan, and I think the sport should show a lot of gratitude to that, because it's important for our players to be recognizable. And she is, without question, in recent times, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport.""

The US Women's National Soccer Team played a friendly match against Portugal at Subaru Park in Chester and fans were thrilled to see their soccer heroes, including Alex Morgan.

CHESTER, Pa. - Soccer fans had a night to remember as the US Women's National Team faced off against Portugal at Subaru Park. 

The event was a celebration of women's soccer, drawing in families and young fans eager to see their idols in action. 

The atmosphere was electric, with many young girls excited to see their heroes up close. 

""Look around there are so many young girls here right now who are so excited to go in and see their heroes,"" said a spectator.

 Becky Pierce, who traveled from Bloomsburg, Pa., with her family, shared, ""We got Harper involved in soccer at a really young age and she loves it. 

This is her first US Women's soccer game and I hope she continues to love the sport as much as I did growing up."" 

The match featured a special ceremony honoring Alex Morgan, a two-time World Cup winner and recent retiree. 

Her influence on the sport was evident, with many fans naming her as their favorite player. 

Jason Rose from Mt. Laurel, N.J., expressed his excitement, saying, ""Super cool. I have 2 daughters so having the ability to show them women's soccer here in Philly is really cool."" 

There is growing momentum for Philadelphia to secure a National Women's Soccer League expansion team. 

Jen Leary from Watch Party PHL hosted a pre-game tailgate and emphasized the importance of support, saying, ""Especially with FIFA coming I think now is the time to really show there is support for a team here and there is excitement."" 

Families like the Fillipelli's found the experience inspiring. 

Lucy Fillipelli, a young soccer player, said, ""It's fun and inspirational because I have been watching these people play for a while and it's kind of unrealistic to actually see them in person."" 

Her mother, Dawn Fillipelli, added, ""This is our time Philly is a great place to see soccer. We have all these stadiums and just a great experience to be able to see US Women's soccer here tonight."" 

Portugal won the match 2-1.  

It was Portugal's first every victory against the USWNT.

What's next:

The US Men's National Team is also scheduled to play a friendly match against Paraguay at Subaru Park on November 15th.

Women's Soccer

USWNT honored Alex Morgan's career at the stadium where she scored her first goal. Brad Smith/ISI Photos/USSF

Alex Morgan stood on the pitch inside Subaru Park in Chester, Pa., one last time Thursday.

Even though she retired last year, this moment ‚Äî standing before the U.S. women's national team as it celebrated her iconic legacy ‚Äî was long overdue.

The stadium roared as the announcer rattled off the 36-year-old's many accomplishments over her 15-year career. Before the current U.S. squad took on Portugal in the first of two friendlies this international window, the younger generation of players watching as they warmed up, thousands of fans began chanting her name.

But no list could measure what Morgan meant to women's soccer.

It was only fitting that a career like Morgan's came full circle in this way, on the field where she scored her first goal for the U.S. 15 years ago.

While still a senior at the University of California, a 21-year-old Morgan entered the pitch for the USWNT as a second-half sub Oct. 6, 2010. The U.S. trailed China, with an at-home unbeaten streak on the line, inside what was then PPL Park in Chester.

Just shy of 13 minutes on the pitch, Morgan overlapped with teammate Abby Wambach, who flicked a header to the young striker. Morgan calmly waited for the right moment, watching the ball closely as it bounced once before her. She then struck it into the back of China's net, recording her goal of 123 goals scored for the United States over a legendary 15-year career.



There are few players as iconic as Alex Morgan. The two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist is one of the most prolific goal scorers in U.S. women's soccer history, and one of the most recognizable faces in the women's game. Beyond the pitch, she was a staunch advocate for gender equity and equality, having lent her voice for the betterment of the game throughout her career.

Her accolades are plenty: 224 caps for the U.S., a treble winner with Lyon in France and more than a decade in the National Women's Soccer League. Morgan was also instrumental in the fight for equal pay, better working conditions and player protections across country and club, including advocating for players during NWSL's systemic abuse scandal.

As U.S. women's coach Emma Hayes told reporters this week, Morgan ‚Äútranscended' women's football.

‚ÄúThere was nothing she didn't achieve,‚Äù Hayes said. ‚ÄúShe was a player that epitomized everything this program is about. She's an unbelievable credit to her family, because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none. You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan.‚Äù

Morgan's is among a string of recent retirements from the U.S. women's national team, including those by Ali Krieger, Megan Rapinoe, Becky Sauerbrunn and Alyssa Naeher, who will be honored in her home state of Connecticut on Sunday. As many from her generation, though, Morgan has not strayed far from the game.

She has evolved into a strategic businesswoman, with a slew of ventures started in recent years. In 2021, she co-founded Togethxr, a women's sports media company. The brand rose to fame with its ‚ÄúEveryone Watches Women's Sports‚Äù tagline, seen on shirts around the globe and the front of London City Lionesses jerseys in the Women's Super League.

Earlier this year, Morgan became a minority investor in the San Diego Wave, the last club she played for.

Morgan retired over a year ago on Sept. 5, 2024, after announcing she and her husband, Servando Carrasco, were expecting their second child, Enzo. Three days after her announcement, she ended her career with a symbolic 13 minutes for the San Diego Wave, the same number as her iconic jersey.

‚ÄúI left everything on the field. I did everything I ever wanted to do and more,‚Äù Morgan said after that game. ‚ÄúI feel so at peace because I am ready to start a family. I'm ready to hang up the boots and allow the next generation to flourish and just relish in the spotlight. I'm just ready.‚Äù

This week, Morgan finally received the standing ovation for the legacy she leaves behind with the U.S. On the eve of her celebration, current U.S. players reflected on her impact.

For Arsenal defender Emily Fox, three words come to mind: ‚ÄúConsistent‚Äù and ‚Äúon top.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like the entirety of her career, she's always been improving, always wanted to get better. Both on and off the field, she embraces that,‚Äù Fox said. ‚ÄúJust with what she and the team have done for equal pay, also her foundation that she started, joining the San Diego Wave franchise and bringing that to life. With Alex, she's very 360 in the sense that she is on the field and off the field in what she does.‚Äù

Chelsea winger Alyssa Thompson, one of the rising stars in this new U.S. generation, has looked up to Morgan since she started playing soccer. The two were teammates at the 2023 Women's World Cup, when 18-year-old Thompson was the youngest player on that summer's U.S. roster. That's something Morgan could relate to, as the youngest player called up for the U.S. at the 2011 World Cup.

‚ÄúShe has meant so much to me and the game,‚Äù Thompson said. ‚ÄúShe's changed the game for the better. I wouldn't be in the position I am right now if it weren't for the players that came before me, especially Alex, fighting for equality and equal pay.‚Äù

Though the U.S. suffered an early exit from that tournament, Morgan's leadership stayed with her.

‚ÄúWhen we weren't doing as well as we wanted to, and she gave our team a speech, I feel like it really empowered me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt inspired me to stay together as a team and believe in our team.‚Äù

For midfielder Rose Lavelle, Morgan's goal in the 2019 World Cup semifinal match against England stands out. Lavelle was the first player to hug Morgan after her viral tea celebration, which graced the world's front pages the next day. The goal happened on Morgan's 30th birthday, and the U.S. went on to win their second consecutive World Cup title, with a game-winning goal from Lavelle.

‚ÄúIt's always such a great opportunity to be able to honor and celebrate players like that,‚Äù Lavelle said. ‚ÄúThey are the reason that we are the team we are. They taught us how to be excellent.‚Äù

But it's not just the players who got to play with Morgan who feel her impact on the national team's program. Twenty-one-year-old Ally Sentnor received her first cap with the national team in November, six months after Morgan played her last U.S. game.

‚ÄúLegend, goal scorer, icon are a few words to describe her,‚Äù Sentnor said. ‚ÄúShe was this amazing, heroic, untouchable player that we watched growing up. She was one of my favorite players growing up. I had her jersey, iconic pink prewrap, we all wore it when we were younger, trying to be her.

‚ÄúJust to be on the team now, to be able to honor her, is such a full circle, incredible moment. I can't wait to give her a huge round of applause. She's just done so much for this sport, never mind this team. We owe a lot to her.‚Äù

There were 13 years, 4 months and 17 days between Morgan's first U.S. goal and her last. Her final goal was during the Concacaf W Gold Cup, when she scored against Argentina on Feb. 23, 2024. This fittingly took place in Carson, Calif., about 40 miles from her hometown of Diamond Bar.

But when Morgan reflects on that first goal, she makes a point to give flowers to another player.

‚ÄúIt was an important goal,‚Äù Morgan recently told ESPN. ‚ÄòWith an assist from my hero and idol, Abby (Wambach).‚Äù

In that moment, Wambach set Morgan up for greatness, a ceremonious passing of the torch from one generation to the next.  In many ways, Morgan's entire career was spent preparing to pass that torch for future generations, too.

Get unrivaled matchday access

ATLANTA (Oct. 24, 2025) ‚Äì Defender Eva Gaetino, who was participating in U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp this week outside of Philadelphia, has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team roster and will join the U.S. camp ahead of the final two matches of the FIFA window.

The USA will face Portugal on Sunday, Oct. 26 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. (4 p.m. ET on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports) and then will take on New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo., on Wednesday, Oct. 29, in the team's first-ever match at CPKC Stadium (8 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. CT, on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English on Universo and Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports and FDP Spanish radio). The match in Connecticut will be presented by Volkswagen. 

U.S. head coach Emma Hayes had originally named 26 players for this camp, but with forward Trinity Rodman having to withdraw due to injury, a roster spot opened up and it has now been filled by Gaetino. The 22-year-old Michigan native was with the USA for the 2024 SheBelieves Cup, but did not see action, and then earned her first and thus far only cap in a 90-minute performance against Argentina on Oct. 30, 2024.

‚ÄúThis is the epitome of the value of the U-23 program,‚Äù said USWNT head coach Emma Hayes. ‚ÄúWe have the U-23s training at the same site as the National Team, so we are easily able to call a player up and it's important for the U-23s to know how much we value them. Eva is a player who has been in with the full team and in with the U-23s, but also out of both teams. No players' journey is the same and certainly no one's career takes a linear path. We gave Eva some pointed feedback over the past year, and she went back to her club, worked every day to get another chance at a call-up, and put into action things we wanted to see in her. She's the most WNT-ready player in this U-23 camp so she'll be a good addition to our training camp roster for the last week.‚Äù

The 5-foot-11 central defender out of Michigan is in her third season, but second full season, with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Premi√®re Ligue after a banner college career at Notre Dame.

Catarina Macario of the United States splits defenders during the first half of an international friendly at Subaru Park. Mitchell Leff / USSF via Getty Images

The U.S. women's national team lost 2-1 to Portugal at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa., on Thursday, opening the October international window with a flat performance as they begin preparations for the 2027 World Cup in Brazil.

Midfielder Rose Lavelle put the U.S. ahead just 33 seconds into the game, an electric start that quickly fizzled. What followed was a disjointed showing, a stark difference from the attacking display that fueled a 3‚Äì0 win over Canada at the Allstate Continental Cl√°sico in August.

Portugal capitalized on a defensive lapse in the 41st minute, with Diana Gomez scoring an equalizer off a corner, punishing the U.S. backline. Portugal's second goal came in the 73rd minute from Fatima Pinto on a similar set piece.

It was the first meeting between the two sides since their goalless group-stage encounter at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup in Auckland, New Zealand. Thursday night's performance served as a reminder that, for all the talk of progress, head coach Emma Hayes still has plenty of work to do to build her roster for next year's World Cup qualifiers.

‚ÄúWe scored a goal and we stopped playing,‚Äù Hayes told the TNT broadcast after the match. ‚ÄúWe didn't look like a team the whole evening both sides of the ball.‚Äù

For the first time in as long as anybody on-site could remember, the USWNT conceded not once but twice from corner kicks.

The first was a product of poor marking. Midfielder Sam Coffey let Portugal's Diana Gomes drift away from her. Forward Catarina Macario seemed to misjudge the flight of the ball. Defender Avery Patterson was backing away from it, leaving Gomes free to head home an equalizer in the 41st minute.

‚Äî B/R Football (@brfootball) October 23, 2025



The second Portugal score seemed to be more unfortunate than lackluster. Lavelle challenged F√°tima Pinto for the initial ball. A couple of U.S. defenders were then slow to the second ball, allowing Pinto to beat goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce with a clean shot from the penalty spot.

After the match, Lavelle took responsibility for the goal.

‚ÄúI have to put my hand up on the second one,‚Äù Lavelle said. ‚ÄúThat was my mark, so I have to be better and just like boot it out and get a better clearance.‚Äù

‚Äî B/R Football (@brfootball) October 24, 2025



Perhaps the Americans missed their defensive mainstay, Naomi Girma. But Emily Sonnett, Tara McKeown and others have defended hundreds, if not thousands, of corners in their national team and NWSL careers. They, and Hayes, will be disappointed with how they defended set pieces tonight.

Despite the defeat, the night opened with U.S. midfielder Lavelle scoring 33 seconds into the match. She settled the ball and, with a quick turn, shot it through two defenders. The tally stood despite Lavelle appearing to play from an offside position. The friendly did not have VAR.

‚Äî U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) October 23, 2025



Lavelle has been in top form with Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) in recent weeks. The midfielder has scored four goals and recorded one assist over the club's last seven games. Four days ago, we saw some ‚ÄúRose Lavelle magic‚Äù when the 30-year-old scored off a free kick, helping Gotham clinch their place in the upcoming NWSL playoffs.

Lavelle is one of the remaining veterans who played against Portugal in the ill-fated 2023 World Cup group stage, helping guide the U.S. through this ongoing season of change, especially as the team works towards World Cup qualifying and head coach Hayes narrows her roster for 2027. Lavelle has the second-most caps on this roster, second only to captain Lindsey Heaps and with only three more caps than defender Sonnett.

It is fitting that Lavelle scored one of the fastest goals in U.S. women's soccer history on the same night as U.S. Soccer honored Alex Morgan. She is, after all, believed to hold the record for fastest goal ever scored, with her 12-second goal against Costa Rica in 2016.

Before Thursday, the USWNT had not conceded a goal since April 8. Even without several stars, including the most recent scratch of Trinity Rodman, it rolled through friendlies against China, Jamaica, Ireland and Canada ‚Äî four very respectable opponents. The team looked both solid and dynamic.

Thursday was a very different story. After Lavelle's goal, Portugal controlled much of the first half, with more shots and 59 percent possession through 45 minutes. Hayes, standing at the edge of her coach's box on the sideline, repeatedly shouted ‚Äúrhythm!‚Äù ‚Äî presumably because the U.S. had very little of it.

‚ÄúI think we gotta find a way to get control of the ball,‚Äù an apparently frustrated Lavelle told the TNT broadcast at halftime.

U.S. defenders also looked shaky. Portugal's Catarina Amado snuck behind fullback Avery Patterson on the first set piece. Center back McKeown whiffed on a clearance in the box, and goalkeeper Tullis-Joyce had to bail her out with an impressive save. On the ensuing corner, though, Portugal scored ‚Äî the first goal conceded by the USWNT in 491 minutes of soccer.

The USWNT's October roster is full of youth. But at her pre-match news conference Wednesday, Hayes spoke glowingly about her three most experienced players, Lavelle, Heaps and Sonnett.

‚ÄúIt makes me smile thinking about them,‚Äù Hayes said. And then she made a serious point: ‚ÄúYou can't compete to win without experience.‚Äù

Accordingly, she kicked off this three-match international window with about as much experience as possible in the lineup. Lavelle, Heaps and Sonnett all started, along with Olympic gold medalists Emily Fox and Sam Coffey. Several exciting youngsters, such as Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton and Ally Sentnor, had to settle for places on the bench.

In the very first minute, Lavelle validated that choice with her goal (albeit as offside as it looked), and Sonnett made a few key interventions. But Sonnett also got outjumped on the first Portuguese goal. Throughout the first half, the U.S. looked stale. Portugal was able to break 3-v-3 on multiple occasions, through or around the U.S. midfield. Heaps seemed to struggle defensively.

Midway through the second half, Hayes turned to Yohannes, Hutton and forwards Emma Sears and Yazmeen Ryan (in place of Heaps, Coffey, Macario and Michelle Cooper). But not much about the flow of the game changed.

Some of those subs, and others, should get a chance to start against Portugal on Sunday or against New Zealand next week.

Kasey Keller is a true U.S. Men's National Team legend. A four-time World Cup veteran, he was the starting goalkeeper in two of the four tournaments he played ‚Äî in 1998 and 2006 ‚Äî and delivered countless memorable performances across his 102 appearances for the United States.

Among his international highlights are four Concacaf Gold Cup titles and a semi-final run at the 1995 Copa Am√©rica in Uruguay, where the USMNT famously upset Argentina 3‚Äì0. Keller, who shared goalkeeping duties with Brad Friedel during that era, later delivered one of the greatest individual performances in U.S. Soccer history at the 1998 Gold Cup ‚Äî a 1‚Äì0 win over Brazil, the only such victory in the program's history. He made ten saves that day, prompting Brazilian striker Rom√°rio to call it ‚Äúthe greatest goalkeeping performance‚Äù he had ever seen.

Keller ranks second all-time among USMNT goalkeepers with 53 wins and recorded 47 clean sheets. His club career was equally distinguished, featuring successful spells in England, Germany, and Spain before finishing his playing days in MLS with the Seattle Sounders. Today, Keller serves as an ESPN pundit, appearing on ESPN FC and F√∫tbol Am√©ricas on ESPN+.

In a sit-down interview with RG, Keller reflects on his transition from player to pundit and tackles some of the tougher questions surrounding U.S. Soccer ‚Äî from the challenges faced by the so-called ‚ÄúGolden Generation,‚Äù to defining what success should look like at the 2026 World Cup, to why former stars of his caliber remain largely absent from the national team's leadership structure.

‚Äì You've successfully transitioned from playing to punditry and even become a part-owner of a USL team. How important was it for you to find something meaningful to do after retiring, and how did that path into media and ownership come about ‚Äî was it something that happened naturally, or did it take some time to figure out?

‚Äì You know, it's tricky. A lot of players today earn great salaries, and those numbers keep growing generation after generation. But the reality is most players retire in their mid-30s. I was lucky ‚Äî I almost played until my 42nd birthday, just a few weeks shy ‚Äî but most are done much earlier. And when you think about it, how much money would you have to make in a short career to maintain the same lifestyle for the rest of your life if you retire at 34 or 35? So even from a financial standpoint, most players realize they'll need to do something after they retire.

But it's not just about money ‚Äî it's also about self-worth. When you've spent your entire life waking up with a purpose ‚Äî training, preparing for a match, studying opponents ‚Äî suddenly having nothing to prepare for can leave a big void. People say, ‚ÄúOh, it must be great to retire and do whatever you want,‚Äù but after a while, that lack of focus can be tough.

I was fortunate that I got to retire on my own terms. I could've played another year, but I chose to stop when I did. Most players don't get that choice ‚Äî either the offers stop coming, or the body gives out. When I stepped away, I thought about what came next. If you want to stay in the game, there are really three main paths: coaching, front office, or media.

For me, media made the most sense because of my family. When we moved back to the U.S., my kids started sixth grade ‚Äî their fifth school in their fourth country. I didn't want to uproot them again. Working in broadcasting allowed me to stay put, keep them in school, and still stay involved in the game.

I started with the Seattle Sounders' local broadcasts, which also included an ambassador role with the club. Then I signed a full-time contract with ESPN. What I loved about broadcasting after 20 years as a player was having some control over my schedule. Of course, if there was a match on the weekend, I couldn't just skip it, but during the week, I had flexibility ‚Äî something I never had as a player.

I remember when the Sounders' broadcasts were run by the Seahawks' media team. One Friday before a home game, I was invited to play in a charity golf event. Normally, Fridays were packed ‚Äî we'd watch training, meet with players and coaches, and have a production meeting. I called my producer, Brian, and asked if I could miss the meeting. In my entire career, I'd only missed training for things like my kids' births or a medical emergency. And his response was, ‚ÄúYeah, of course, just call me later and we'll go over what was said.‚Äù I was shocked ‚Äî that kind of flexibility doesn't exist when you're playing.

‚Äì Looking at U.S. Soccer now from a bit of distance, how do you see the program's overall progress since your playing days? Would you say it has continued to move forward, or has it stagnated ‚Äî maybe even taken a step back in some areas?

‚Äì I think it's a bit of both. There have been periods, especially after the U.S. qualified for the 1990 World Cup, where we probably overachieved in some of our results. And I think that early success created a false sense of expectation ‚Äî that our progress would be steady and linear. People started thinking, ‚ÄúOkay, we've made it this far, so the next step must be the semifinals or the finals.‚Äù But that's not how international football works. There's a reason only a handful of countries ‚Äî France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina ‚Äî consistently win World Cups. It's not random.

Some of that overachievement made people believe we'd reached that same level, when in reality, we were still developing the structure and depth needed to sustain it. I remember being part of a panel at the MIT Sloan Analytics Conference, and one of the questions was, ‚ÄúWhy hasn't the U.S., with 350 million people, produced a Messi or a Ronaldo?‚Äù

It reminded me of a story. Not long before that, my wife and I were on vacation in Costa Rica. As soon as we landed, people recognized me ‚Äî staff at the airport, workers at the hotel ‚Äî everyone wanted to talk about soccer: the U.S. team, Costa Rica, the World Cup. The sport is a national obsession there. But during that same trip, not a single American tourist stopped me to talk about football.

And that, to me, sums it up. In most countries, football is the dream ‚Äî every kid grows up wanting to play for their national team. In the U.S., there are a hundred different dreams. You can grow up wanting to be a football player, or a baseball player, or a snowboarder, or even a skateboarder like Tony Hawk. There's nothing wrong with that diversity, but it means our focus as a sporting culture is spread across so many directions. In places like Argentina or Brazil, it's simple ‚Äî if you're not going to be a footballer, then you figure out what else to do. Here, it's the opposite.

‚Äì When Mauricio Pochettino came in, he talked a lot about building a new culture within the national team. But it raises the question ‚Äî what culture are we talking about changing? Because your generation had already built something strong. You guys competed well in Copa Am√©ricas, won Gold Cups, and were consistently successful. So do you think this idea of ‚Äúchanging the culture‚Äù overlooks some of what was already working before, or is it based on what he saw with this current squad?

‚Äì Yeah, I mean, we got out of World Cup group stages, we competed well. I remember when I was at Leicester, one of my assistant coaches ‚Äî a former Scottish international ‚Äî used to give me a hard time whenever I missed a few club games for World Cup qualifiers. He'd say, ‚ÄúWhy are you worried about that? You'll beat those teams easily.‚Äù And I told him, ‚ÄúReally? How many World Cup group stages has Scotland ever made it out of?‚Äù

That was my point ‚Äî what the U.S. achieved during that era wasn't automatic. We often overachieved compared to where we were as a footballing nation.

That's part of managing ‚Äî creating an environment where that hunger and competitiveness stay alive. What I really liked in these last few matches was that we finally started talking about football again ‚Äî tactics, movement, missed chances ‚Äî instead of questioning effort and mentality. That's real progress.

I actually talked about this once with Thierry Henry. He told me, ‚ÄúWhen you played against Americans ‚Äî club or country ‚Äî you knew you had to match their effort. Maybe they weren't the best team technically, but if you didn't bring the same fight, you'd be embarrassed.‚Äù And he said recently he's noticed a bit of that slipping away.

And he's right ‚Äî we're not at a stage yet where pure talent alone can win games against top teams. Back when I was playing for Leicester against Manchester United or Arsenal, we couldn't just go out and play our football and hope for the best. We had to find ways to disrupt them, to fight, to get a result against superior sides. And that's what the U.S. always had ‚Äî that determination to compete, to grind, and to find a way.

‚Äì We're now seeing more U.S. players competing at top clubs and doing well, which is great. But when we talk about culture, I sometimes wonder about the difference between American players and, say, Uruguayans. In Uruguay, each new generation grows up trying to meet the standard set by those before them ‚Äî like God√≠n following players such as Paolo Montero. There's a lineage to live up to. In the U.S., though, many of these players are the standard; they're the first to reach that level. Do you think that lack of an established tradition or benchmark could be part of the challenge when it comes to building a lasting football culture?

‚Äì That's an interesting point, because while some of our players are now at big clubs, those clubs aren't what they used to be. The level of competition and expectations have dropped, and that changes the context.

To be fair, many of these players have had very good individual seasons. But I've been there ‚Äî I've had strong personal performances on teams that still finished mid-table. That's what's happening now: talented players doing well individually, but not necessarily leading top teams to success.

And that's part of the issue. They've reached those big stages, but not necessarily during the club's strongest period, so they aren't yet establishing themselves as true stars competing for major titles.

In earlier years, American players often didn't even get the chance to join top teams, simply because they were American. Now that they do, it's progress ‚Äî but we're still waiting for someone to take that next step and really become a defining figure at the highest level.

What's interesting is that while people call this a ‚Äúgolden generation,‚Äù there are also areas where we've gone backwards. There was a time when several American goalkeepers were starting regularly in the Premier League at the same time. That's not the case anymore. And yet, we keep hearing that we're producing more great players ‚Äî but the results don't quite show that in some positions. 

And finally, just because a player performs well abroad doesn't automatically mean it translates to the national team. I always say, if someone has multiple nationalities, the key question isn't about talent ‚Äî it's about identity. What are you? What do you feel you are? Because when it's 90 degrees, in tough conditions, playing in a difficult away qualifier, I need players who are 100% committed. If you're only choosing the U.S. because it's your best chance to play in a World Cup, that's not enough.

‚Äì What is the real expectation of this USMNT team based on the body of work over the last six years? Two knockout round games at the World Cup?

‚Äì I always look at the World Cup draw and ask myself: should the U.S. get out of that group? Sometimes, yes ‚Äî sometimes, no.

Take Qatar, for example. England were favorites to win the group, and when you look at the rest ‚Äî Iran and Wales ‚Äî you'd say the U.S. should finish second. That's a fair expectation.

Now go back to Brazil. That group had Germany, Portugal, and Ghana ‚Äî all very strong teams. In that case, it's hard to argue the U.S. should have advanced. They could, sure, but not that they should.

That's where expectations get tricky. When people say it's a failure if the U.S. doesn't reach the quarterfinals, I ask: is the U.S. really one of the eight best teams in the world? No, not yet. To get that far, they'd have to beat teams that are better than them. It can happen ‚Äî but it shouldn't be expected. Realistically, the U.S. is still somewhere between 20th and 30th in the world.

‚Äì Then, given how the federation has danced around and many pundits have said that it's only about what happens at the World Cup, maybe doing well at the World Cup would only validate the immediate result and may make winning Gold Cups, Nations Leagues, or Copa Americas even less of a priority? 

‚Äì Yeah, I think it's about perspective. Three years out from a big tournament, no one really cares about every single player ‚Äî like a sprinter or a swimmer ‚Äî until they have a real chance to achieve something big, like winning a gold medal. Then people pay attention. The same goes for soccer. Missing one World Cup or qualifying campaign isn't the end of the world. Even historically strong countries face struggles, and it's about understanding the bigger picture.

At the same time, the small wins matter. Winning Gold Cups, for example, is important because it builds a winning culture. The only way to create a culture of winning is by actually winning. And I've seen that firsthand ‚Äî we've won with our best team and with mixed squads, and in both cases, players stepped up and grew from the experience.

I also believe in putting a team on the field that can win every game. You can't rotate players just for the sake of giving everyone a chance in friendlies ‚Äî those matches often don't reflect the true strength of the team. World Cup qualifying is different because it forces you to play the players who matter.

The challenge in recent years has been too many meaningless matches, constant rotation, and coaching changes. Every time a new coach comes in, they expand the net to see everyone, which makes the process feel disjointed and false. It's hard to build momentum or culture in that environment.

‚Äì Why haven't players like you or an Eddie Pope or other past USMNT stars transferred into coaching youth national teams, like say former players do with Argentina or Uruguay? Why has US Soccer closed the door on players who once defended the crest of the US? 

‚Äì I'll tell you a good story. J√ºrgen Klinsmann wanted to bring in some new talent and called me to ask if I could step in as the goalkeeping coach for a Gold Cup. At the time, I was broadcasting, and my contract had a clause that if I missed matches, my pay could be affected.

I told him, ‚ÄúJ√ºrgen, I can't commit without checking with the club.‚Äù The Sounders and Seahawks thought it was a great idea ‚Äî having their local broadcast analyst on the national team was excellent exposure. So I called J√ºrgen back and said, ‚ÄúThe club's fine with it, but here's what I'll be giving up to make it work. I'm not looking to make more money ‚Äî I've been on four World Cup teams ‚Äî but I shouldn't lose money to coach in the Gold Cup.‚Äù

J√ºrgen said, ‚ÄúThat's a fair point. I'll bring it up with U.S. Soccer.‚Äù A short time later, he came back and said, ‚ÄúU.S. Soccer won't cover it.‚Äù I told him, ‚ÄúI'm sorry, but I'm sticking to this. I'm not going to lose money to work for U.S. Soccer.‚Äù

I called him and told him, ‚ÄúI will never do that again.‚Äù If U.S. Soccer doesn't value me enough to make up the difference after what I've given to the program, people hesitate to get involved.

Former USMNT goalkeeper Kasey Keller sat down with RG and spoke about his memorable experience playing for Milwall, one of the most passionate clubs around. 

RG spoke to Jerome Opoku about recovering from an ACL injury, playing in the S√ºper Lig, and helping Ghana qualify for the World Cup.

RG spoke to Renato Paiva about engineering Benfica's academy, being sacked by Botafogo after beating PSG, and plenty more in an exclusive interview.

From coaching U.S. Soccer's youth teams to helping Nashville SC lift their first-ever trophy, Michael Nsien is making his mark on the technical side of the game.

FARMINGTON ‚Äî The practice is lively, fast-paced. The two dozen players are moving in concert, non-stop, as soccer players do.

It is, however, quiet. No whistles, no shouting. In a sport where communication it critical, the U.S. men's deaf soccer team finds its own ways to stay connected.

‚ÄúIt's a mixture of eye contact, recognition of the game, IQ and ASL, sign language,‚Äù says forward Michael Schmidt, 36, one of the oldest and most accomplished players on the U.S. team. ‚ÄúIn a way, deaf players are smarter, because we have to use our eyes more. Coaches are telling us to use your eyes all time, and this is the perfect way; you can't use your voice, you have to use your eyes more. That's how we build that connection, and that's one of the things I was attracted to about this team.‚Äù

U.S. women's soccer team will have star Trinity Rodman back for its match at Rentschler Field



The U.S. team has been in Connecticut all week, training for its match against Germany at Rentschler Field on Sunday at 1 p.m., to be shown on truTV, with streaming available on HBO Max, before the U.S. women's team takes on Portugal at 4 p.m. It's part of preparation for the next big tournament, the Deaflympics in Tokyo in November. The U.S. team won bronze at the Pan American Games last year in Brazil, clinching with a 4-0 win over Mexico to qualify. Schmidt scored twice in that game.

‚ÄúIt's very different from what I expected,‚Äù says Tate Lancaster, who has been with the team since 2020. ‚ÄúI grew up with only one other classmate in school who had hearing aids as well, but we didn't really converse well with each other. But coming onto this team, I really learned how to communicate with sign language, and get back into this whole other community that I didn't really know much about.‚Äù

The 23 players come from all over the country, the age range from 18 to 37. Many have played high school or college soccer despite their hearing impairment, but there they were allowed to wear their hearing aids. In international competitions, players are told to ‚Äútake your ears out‚Äù before the games begin. To be eligible, players have hearing loss of at least 55 decibels, the borderline between moderate and moderately severe, in their better ear. Some players have no hearing and some are completely nonverbal.

‚ÄúYou can't communicate quickly enough by signing while passing the ball,‚Äù Schmidt says, ‚Äúso it's visual, you have to be prepared, two or three plays ahead. Deaf players, we are a little more aware of our surroundings, our emotions, how we communicate with our body language. Every camp, we make sure we have about 20 important signals, get in line, come closer, check two, turn, common language that soccer players know, but it's visual.‚Äù

Interpreters use sign language, or tablets with written instructions to convey the messaging of coaches and trainers as players huddle up.

‚ÄúThe vibe is great energy and a community feel,‚Äù coach Everett Palache says. ‚ÄúThey love each other. That was the biggest thing I stepped into, like ‚Äòholy crap, these guys really like hanging out with each other.' They're like brothers. I try not to mess that up.‚Äù

The U.S. program dates back to 1965, playing in the Deaflympics in Washington, D.C. that year, finishing as high as fourth (in 2008) at the World Deaf Football Championships, taking first at the 2019 Deaf Pan Am games. Since 2022, the program has been a fully-funded part of the U.S. Soccer Federation, along with other extended teams including the women's deaf team, Cerebral Palsy (CP) team, power team, which uses wheelchairs, beach soccer and futsol, or five-on-five soccer. There are specially-designed spaces for the extended teams at U.S. Soccer's Atlanta headquarters. Volkswagen is the deaf team's presenting sponsor.

The chance to travel around the country allows the teams to attract and recruit players. As the U.S. men's deaf team trained at the Farmington Sports Arena, youth teams and coaches, working on adjacent fields, stopped to watch the late afternoon practice ‚Äî its second of the day ‚Äî on Wednesday. The team visited students at the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford on Thursday morning.

‚ÄúSoccer is the universal language,‚Äù Schmidt says. ‚Äú‚Ä¶To play in a professional stadium with fans, on TV, it's going to be a huge honor for us. It's a significant moment to reach out to all players out there and say ‚Äòhey, you can achieve your dreams.' Everybody faces a different kind of adversity, but you can overcome it, you can get to this level, and know that there are resources out there for you. Just because there's a disability doesn't mean you can't play soccer.‚Äù

Dom Amore: Dan Hurley, Rick Pitino bring old-school fire to a new era of the Big East



Originally from Cleveland, Schmidt joined the team in 2014 after a local college coach forwarded him an e-mail about tryouts. He drove to Pittsburgh to check it out, ‚Äúand the rest has been history,‚Äù he says.

In 2016, he played at the World Cup in Italy. In a fifth-place game against England, Schmidt scored the winning goal as the fourth kicker in an OT shootout.

‚ÄúI just remember doing the celebration my family and friends told me to do,‚Äù Schmidt says. ‚ÄúYou get to experience a moment not many people get to experience.‚Äù

Lancaster, from Overland Park, Kansas, graduated from Baker University, but found himself idle and bored during the pandemic when he saw a notice for a tryout in Louisville on social media. He traveled on his own expense, made the team and is now back into soccer, coaching at the youth level back home in Kansas City, as well as playing.

‚ÄúThe biggest challenge I have playing with my teammates here is communicating with them,‚Äù Lancaster says. ‚ÄúEspecially if I'm on the back line, I have to figure out a way to talk to them when they're facing the other way and understand how to react to what their movement is. We come up with key words, condense a lot of our phrases, quick signs, we kind of come up with our own language within the team. Basic sign language, but they have more meaning in the situation we're in. Once we cross the white line, we're all playing the same sport.‚Äù

The chance to play on television Sunday will give two young players he has been coaching in Kansas City the chance to watch Lancaster on a big stage.

‚ÄúI hope kids see that they can do the same thing,‚Äù Lancaster says. ‚ÄúA couple of kids back home, they're hard of hearing and kind of going through a hard time, playing with other kids who are hearing and they're struggling to fit in. This game gives them that outlet, so I hope when they see us on TV, see me playing back home, they have the realization that I can do whatever I set their mind to.‚Äù

Dom Amore: Azzi Fudd ‚Äòowning her space' to begin her last dance with UConn women



Playing for the U.S. team has changed his life in multiple ways. Lancaster, 31, was on the team when it became part of the U.S. soccer community. He met his fianc√©, Gracie Fitzgerald, who plays on the U.S women's deaf team. ‚ÄúI have this team to thank for it,‚Äù he says.

The team prides itself on its speed and quickness. ‚ÄúWe play with pride, play with passion,‚Äù Schmidt says, ‚Äúthe game of soccer is supposed to be fun. Make them remember you on the field. This is why we're here.‚Äù

Palache, who was brought 20 years of coaching experience to the job in 2024, realized during a trip to Washington and a game against Alexandria (Va.) Soccer Association that he was in the right place.

‚ÄúThat really showed us our grit and our desire and I knew that they had another level to them,‚Äù Palache says. ‚ÄúI had wondered how far we could push them, and that  game itself pushed them. I'm ultra-competitive, and that's when I knew they were equally competitive and I was in the right spot. The profile that we're looking for is resiliency, athleticism, adaptability. We've actually come up with an acronym off of ‚ÄòDEAF,' they've got to have drive, got to give effort, got to be adaptable, got to have faith in the process. ‚Ä¶ We do something called a legacy letter, get them to think about what is their purpose, and everyone said they want to leave a legacy they can live up to, and inspire the next generation that it's possible.‚Äù

Kasey Keller is a true U.S. Men's National Team legend. A four-time World Cup veteran, he was the starting goalkeeper in two of the four tournaments he played ‚Äî in 1998 and 2006 ‚Äî and delivered countless memorable performances across his 102 appearances for the United States.

Among his international highlights are four Concacaf Gold Cup titles and a semi-final run at the 1995 Copa Am√©rica in Uruguay, where the USMNT famously upset Argentina 3‚Äì0.

Keller ranks second all-time among USMNT goalkeepers with 53 wins and recorded 47 clean sheets. His club career was equally distinguished, featuring successful spells in England, Germany, and Spain before finishing his playing days in MLS with the Seattle Sounders. Today, Keller serves as an ESPN pundit, appearing on ESPN FC and F√∫tbol Am√©ricas on ESPN+.

In a sit-down interview with RG, Keller reflects on his transition from player to pundit and tackles some of the tougher questions surrounding U.S. Soccer ‚Äî from the challenges faced by the so-called ‚ÄúGolden Generation,‚Äù to defining what success should look like at the 2026 World Cup, to why former stars of his caliber remain largely absent from the national team's leadership structure.

‚Äì You know, it's tricky. A lot of players today earn great salaries, and those numbers keep growing generation after generation. But the reality is most players retire in their mid-30s. I was lucky ‚Äî I almost played until my 42nd birthday, just a few weeks shy ‚Äî but most are done much earlier. And when you think about it, how much money would you have to make in a short career to maintain the same lifestyle for the rest of your life if you retire at 34 or 35? So even from a financial standpoint, most players realize they'll need to do something after they retire.

But it's not just about money ‚Äî it's also about self-worth. When you've spent your entire life waking up with a purpose ‚Äî training, preparing for a match, studying opponents ‚Äî suddenly having nothing to prepare for can leave a big void. People say, ‚ÄúOh, it must be great to retire and do whatever you want,‚Äù but after a while, that lack of focus can be tough.

I was fortunate that I got to retire on my own terms. I could've played another year, but I chose to stop when I did. Most players don't get that choice ‚Äî either the offers stop coming, or the body gives out. When I stepped away, I thought about what came next. If you want to stay in the game, there are really three main paths: coaching, front office, or media.

For me, media made the most sense because of my family. When we moved back to the U.S., my kids started sixth grade ‚Äî their fifth school in their fourth country. I didn't want to uproot them again. Working in broadcasting allowed me to stay put, keep them in school, and still stay involved in the game.

I started with the Seattle Sounders' local broadcasts, which also included an ambassador role with the club. Then I signed a full-time contract with ESPN. What I loved about broadcasting after 20 years as a player was having some control over my schedule. Of course, if there was a match on the weekend, I couldn't just skip it, but during the week, I had flexibility ‚Äî something I never had as a player.

I remember when the Sounders' broadcasts were run by the Seahawks' media team. One Friday before a home game, I was invited to play in a charity golf event. Normally, Fridays were packed ‚Äî we'd watch training, meet with players and coaches, and have a production meeting. I called my producer, Brian, and asked if I could miss the meeting. In my entire career, I'd only missed training for things like my kids' births or a medical emergency. And his response was, ‚ÄúYeah, of course, just call me later and we'll go over what was said.‚Äù I was shocked ‚Äî that kind of flexibility doesn't exist when you're playing.

‚Äì Looking at U.S. Soccer now from a bit of distance, how do you see the program's overall progress since your playing days? Would you say it has continued to move forward, or has it stagnated ‚Äî maybe even taken a step back in some areas?

‚Äì I think it's a bit of both. There have been periods, especially after the U.S. qualified for the 1990 World Cup, where we probably overachieved in some of our results. And I think that early success created a false sense of expectation ‚Äî that our progress would be steady and linear. People started thinking, ‚ÄúOkay, we've made it this far, so the next step must be the semifinals or the finals.‚Äù But that's not how international football works. There's a reason only a handful of countries ‚Äî France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina ‚Äî consistently win World Cups. It's not random.

Some of that overachievement made people believe we'd reached that same level, when in reality, we were still developing the structure and depth needed to sustain it. I remember being part of a panel at the MIT Sloan Analytics Conference, and one of the questions was, ‚ÄúWhy hasn't the U.S., with 350 million people, produced a Messi or a Ronaldo?‚Äù

It reminded me of a story. Not long before that, my wife and I were on vacation in Costa Rica. As soon as we landed, people recognized me ‚Äî staff at the airport, workers at the hotel ‚Äî everyone wanted to talk about soccer: the U.S. team, Costa Rica, the World Cup. The sport is a national obsession there. But during that same trip, not a single American tourist stopped me to talk about football.

And that, to me, sums it up. In most countries, football is the dream ‚Äî every kid grows up wanting to play for their national team. In the U.S., there are a hundred different dreams. You can grow up wanting to be a football player, or a baseball player, or a snowboarder, or even a skateboarder like Tony Hawk. There's nothing wrong with that diversity, but it means our focus as a sporting culture is spread across so many directions. In places like Argentina or Brazil, it's simple ‚Äî if you're not going to be a footballer, then you figure out what else to do. Here, it's the opposite.

‚Äì When Mauricio Pochettino came in, he talked a lot about building a new culture within the national team. But it raises the question ‚Äî what culture are we talking about changing? Because your generation had already built something strong. You guys competed well in Copa Am√©ricas, won Gold Cups, and were consistently successful. So do you think this idea of ‚Äúchanging the culture‚Äù overlooks some of what was already working before, or is it based on what he saw with this current squad?

‚Äì Yeah, I mean, we got out of World Cup group stages, we competed well. I remember when I was at Leicester, one of my assistant coaches ‚Äî a former Scottish international ‚Äî used to give me a hard time whenever I missed a few club games for World Cup qualifiers. He'd say, ‚ÄúWhy are you worried about that? You'll beat those teams easily.‚Äù And I told him, ‚ÄúReally? How many World Cup group stages has Scotland ever made it out of?‚Äù

That was my point ‚Äî what the U.S. achieved during that era wasn't automatic. We often overachieved compared to where we were as a footballing nation.

That's part of managing ‚Äî creating an environment where that hunger and competitiveness stay alive. What I really liked in these last few matches was that we finally started talking about football again ‚Äî tactics, movement, missed chances ‚Äî instead of questioning effort and mentality. That's real progress.

I actually talked about this once with Thierry Henry. He told me, ‚ÄúWhen you played against Americans ‚Äî club or country ‚Äî you knew you had to match their effort. Maybe they weren't the best team technically, but if you didn't bring the same fight, you'd be embarrassed.‚Äù And he said recently he's noticed a bit of that slipping away.

And he's right ‚Äî we're not at a stage yet where pure talent alone can win games against top teams. Back when I was playing for Leicester against Manchester United or Arsenal, we couldn't just go out and play our football and hope for the best. We had to find ways to disrupt them, to fight, to get a result against superior sides. And that's what the U.S. always had ‚Äî that determination to compete, to grind, and to find a way.

‚Äì We're now seeing more U.S. players competing at top clubs and doing well, which is great. But when we talk about culture, I sometimes wonder about the difference between American players and, say, Uruguayans. In Uruguay, each new generation grows up trying to meet the standard set by those before them ‚Äî like God√≠n following players such as Paolo Montero. There's a lineage to live up to. In the U.S., though, many of these players are the standard; they're the first to reach that level. Do you think that lack of an established tradition or benchmark could be part of the challenge when it comes to building a lasting football culture?

‚Äì That's an interesting point, because while some of our players are now at big clubs, those clubs aren't what they used to be. The level of competition and expectations have dropped, and that changes the context.

To be fair, many of these players have had very good individual seasons. But I've been there ‚Äî I've had strong personal performances on teams that still finished mid-table. That's what's happening now: talented players doing well individually, but not necessarily leading top teams to success.

And that's part of the issue. They've reached those big stages, but not necessarily during the club's strongest period, so they aren't yet establishing themselves as true stars competing for major titles.

In earlier years, American players often didn't even get the chance to join top teams, simply because they were American. Now that they do, it's progress ‚Äî but we're still waiting for someone to take that next step and really become a defining figure at the highest level.

What's interesting is that while people call this a ‚Äúgolden generation,‚Äù there are also areas where we've gone backwards. There was a time when several American goalkeepers were starting regularly in the Premier League at the same time. That's not the case anymore. And yet, we keep hearing that we're producing more great players ‚Äî but the results don't quite show that in some positions. 

And finally, just because a player performs well abroad doesn't automatically mean it translates to the national team. I always say, if someone has multiple nationalities, the key question isn't about talent ‚Äî it's about identity. What are you? What do you feel you are? Because when it's 90 degrees, in tough conditions, playing in a difficult away qualifier, I need players who are 100% committed. If you're only choosing the U.S. because it's your best chance to play in a World Cup, that's not enough.

‚Äì What is the real expectation of this USMNT team based on the body of work over the last six years? Two knockout round games at the World Cup?

‚Äì I always look at the World Cup draw and ask myself: should the U.S. get out of that group? Sometimes, yes ‚Äî sometimes, no.

Take Qatar, for example. England were favorites to win the group, and when you look at the rest ‚Äî Iran and Wales ‚Äî you'd say the U.S. should finish second. That's a fair expectation.

Now go back to Brazil. That group had Germany, Portugal, and Ghana ‚Äî all very strong teams. In that case, it's hard to argue the U.S. should have advanced. They could, sure, but not that they should.

That's where expectations get tricky. When people say it's a failure if the U.S. doesn't reach the quarterfinals, I ask: is the U.S. really one of the eight best teams in the world? No, not yet. To get that far, they'd have to beat teams that are better than them. It can happen ‚Äî but it shouldn't be expected. Realistically, the U.S. is still somewhere between 20th and 30th in the world.

‚Äì Then, given how the federation has danced around and many pundits have said that it's only about what happens at the World Cup, maybe doing well at the World Cup would only validate the immediate result and may make winning Gold Cups, Nations Leagues, or Copa Americas even less of a priority? 

‚Äì Yeah, I think it's about perspective. Three years out from a big tournament, no one really cares about every single player ‚Äî like a sprinter or a swimmer ‚Äî until they have a real chance to achieve something big, like winning a gold medal. Then people pay attention. The same goes for soccer. Missing one World Cup or qualifying campaign isn't the end of the world. Even historically strong countries face struggles, and it's about understanding the bigger picture.

At the same time, the small wins matter. Winning Gold Cups, for example, is important because it builds a winning culture. The only way to create a culture of winning is by actually winning. And I've seen that firsthand ‚Äî we've won with our best team and with mixed squads, and in both cases, players stepped up and grew from the experience.

I also believe in putting a team on the field that can win every game. You can't rotate players just for the sake of giving everyone a chance in friendlies ‚Äî those matches often don't reflect the true strength of the team. World Cup qualifying is different because it forces you to play the players who matter.

The challenge in recent years has been too many meaningless matches, constant rotation, and coaching changes. Every time a new coach comes in, they expand the net to see everyone, which makes the process feel disjointed and false. It's hard to build momentum or culture in that environment.

‚Äì Why haven't players like you or an Eddie Pope or other past USMNT stars transferred into coaching youth national teams, like say former players do with Argentina or Uruguay? Why has US Soccer closed the door on players who once defended the crest of the US? 

‚Äì I'll tell you a good story. J√ºrgen Klinsmann wanted to bring in some new talent and called me to ask if I could step in as the goalkeeping coach for a Gold Cup. At the time, I was broadcasting, and my contract had a clause that if I missed matches, my pay could be affected.

I told him, ‚ÄúJ√ºrgen, I can't commit without checking with the club.‚Äù The Sounders and Seahawks thought it was a great idea ‚Äî having their local broadcast analyst on the national team was excellent exposure. So I called J√ºrgen back and said, ‚ÄúThe club's fine with it, but here's what I'll be giving up to make it work. I'm not looking to make more money ‚Äî I've been on four World Cup teams ‚Äî but I shouldn't lose money to coach in the Gold Cup.‚Äù

J√ºrgen said, ‚ÄúThat's a fair point. I'll bring it up with U.S. Soccer.‚Äù A short time later, he came back and said, ‚ÄúU.S. Soccer won't cover it.‚Äù I told him, ‚ÄúI'm sorry, but I'm sticking to this. I'm not going to lose money to work for U.S. Soccer.‚Äù

I called him and told him, ‚ÄúI will never do that again.‚Äù If U.S. Soccer doesn't value me enough to make up the difference after what I've given to the program, people hesitate to get involved.

Premiership Women's Rugby has one overriding target for the new season ‚Äì more eyeballs than ever.

Be it on television, via social media, or of course, in the stadium, the world's top women's club competition is eager to attract new supporters.

Off the back of a record-breaking Rugby World Cup, won by the Red Roses in front of a sold-out crowd at Allianz Stadium, women's rugby is surfing a wave of momentum, and PWR executive chair Genevieve Shore knows it is crucial to capitalise on that success as the league prepares to get back underway this weekend.

Harlequins, who count England superstar Ellie Kildunne among their number, will get the ball rolling at home to Loughborough Lightning on Friday night, while the opening weekend will draw to a close with a repeat of last year's final as champions Gloucester Hartpury host Saracens.

That makes Shore, a World Cup winner in her own right back in 1994, a very busy woman this week - but she would not have it any other way.

She said: ‚ÄúWe've got all those corporate targets and numbers and scorecards but for me, it's just more people seeing us and wanting to be part of the journey. We want more people watching us on television, more people watching on social, and more people watching in the ground.

‚ÄúThere is the bigger picture of why you get out of the bed in the morning, it's for our athletes and for our fans. If the feedback we are getting from them is good, then I'll be happy.

‚ÄúIt's exciting, we're in year three, so growth, growth, growth is all I care about at this point. Everything else will solve itself.‚Äù

Just a month on from that final success at Twickenham, PWR is hoping to maintain the interest that was evident over the course of a tournament which set attendance records from start to finish.

As well as the Red Roses, who all played their club rugby in PWR, there was a huge contingent from the league featured in other countries, including finalists Canada.

That multicultural aspect to the league is a strength in the eyes of Shore, who explained: ‚ÄúWe had one in four players at the World Cup, the Black Ferns are here, the Canadians are here, the US are here, the Welsh, the Scottish. We want to tell all of those stories.

‚ÄúI don't like to compare us to men's sport too much, but I have started saying that we are the Premier League. If you want to see the world's best players, this is the place to do it.

‚Äú65% of our players are England qualified and can play for the Red Roses. That is a lot of players and at any one time, there are only 23 people who can play for the Red Roses, they have plenty to choose from.

‚ÄúWe want to make sure those Red Roses are playing competitive rugby every single week. It's important to make sure the international competitions keep growing. So it's a 360 view of everybody has to win for women's rugby to win, that is where I come from.‚Äù

Shore and PWR have some examples to follow close to home, with the Lionesses having enjoyed European Championship success in 2022 and again this summer.

The way they have converted that into bigger attendances in the Women's Super League is one of the achievements that PWR have been trying to imitate, acknowledging that the audience for the World Cup and the Red Roses is not your typical rugby crowd.

Shore said: ‚ÄúWe've had a good period of time to think it through. We have had the case studies with the Lionesses, not just in 2022 but also this time as well.

‚ÄúWe've really carefully looked at what works well for them and what works for other major sporting tournaments across Europe and in this country.

‚ÄúWe are really doubling down on the message that PWR is the home of heroes, we're trying to make sure that people make that connection.

‚ÄúWe've done a lot of work trying to make sure people know who the clubs are, you can't make the assumption that everyone knows who Harlequins are, who are Tigers, who are Sale? 50% of our audience are brand new to rugby so we have to make sure we are making those connections.‚Äù

As well as the hope for increased attendances, there are also plans in place to increase female representation on coaching staffs, after a summer that saw the league's only two female head coaches move on from their positions.

In conjunction with the RFU, PWR have commissioned a research project to look at some of the obstacles currently faced by female coaches and what can be done to remove them, with the results due to be published in February.

Likewise, current referee Holly Wood has been empowered to work on a fast-track project for female match officials.

Add in an athletes' forum allowing the league's main actors to influence how it develops, and the hope is that this is just the beginning.

It all kicks off this week and Shore's message is simple: ‚ÄúYou watched the World Cup, you enjoyed it, you loved it. Now come and see those same brilliant women play in the PWR.‚Äù

No-one quite knew what workout Jude Bellingham was doing. He was sort of maybe jumping. There was a kettlebell in his hands. But he was also wearing football boots, and had resistance bands worked into the mix. It looked like three drills at once, a strange combination of activities. Still, whatever it was, it's working.

Bellingham has been in a tricky spot of late. There is growing noise in England that Morgan Rogers - not him - should be Thomas Tuchel's go-to attacking midfielder going forward. Madrid also didn't seem to particularly miss him as he recovered from shoulder surgery. Xabi Alonso, for the most part, has Los Blancos humming early on. 

But this is Jude Bellingham, a truly excellent footballer who can, quite clearly, be a difference-maker for any side at any level. It has been an odd few months for him. His form dropped drastically at the end of the 2024-25 campaign, and Madrid went trophyless. A much-delayed shoulder surgery stopped any sort of early season revival before it could even start. And now, he finds himself in between. 

There have been some promising signs. He scored in his first Champions League start of the season, and has found a rhythm in Alonso's midfield. But El Clasico, on Sunday, seems to be something of an inflection point; is this the game where we will see the Bellingham of old? Or is this where worries begin to mount as the season wears on?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Brighton forward is playing the best football of his career at 34 and Thomas Tuchel could have a vacancy next summer

Age appears no barrier for Thomas Tuchel's England. An 18-month contract as a one-shot deal ‚Äì North America or bust ‚Äì little need to plan for the future. Any legacy is bound up in the success or failure of Mission 2026, hence the expected presence of ‚Äúgood tourist‚Äù Jordan Henderson, 36 less than a week after the World Cup kicks off.

Though Harry Kane is immovable, undroppable, there may yet be a vacancy for an athletic, intelligent, hard-working forward, capable of linking play and leading the press, should Ollie Watkins or Dominic Solanke falter. Anyone meeting the demands of modern forward play: apply within.

The top-scoring Englishmen in this season's Premier League on four each are Burnley's uncapped Jaidon Anthony, also eligible for Jamaica, and Danny Welbeck, whose last game for his country was at the 2018 World Cup. If Henderson was a Gareth Southgate mainstay, then Welbeck was a favourite of Roy Hodgson, his 16 goals in 42 appearances a decent scoring rate.

This season, Welbeck has been as good as any English striker. His finishing, as shown by predatory strikes for Brighton against Newcastle, gets better with age. The first, a falling-leaf dink, was followed by stroking home after a Dan Burn tackle set the ball loose. Calmness in the midst of a pell-mell match secured three points.

‚ÄúI have the passion and love for football,‚Äù Welbeck said after the game. ‚ÄúIt's what I want to do. I feel good. I feel strong and fit so I won't be stopping soon.‚Äù

He is 35 next month, and at Brighton, the club he joined as a free agent in 2020, after a season at Watford, is playing the best football of his career, his goal average per game ‚Äì 0.36 ‚Äì higher than in his 20s or as a teenage forward for Manchester United. He returns to Old Trafford on Saturday.

In the corridors of the Amex Stadium, at the foot of a staircase, is a photograph from September 2023 of Welbeck celebrating his goal at Old Trafford in a 3-1 win. No non-celebration celebration to follow scoring against his former club; the smile is broad. It is 11 years since Welbeck left United, recent arrival Louis van Gaal finding no place for him in a forward line that had Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney. That summer of 2014, United imported Radamel Falcao and √Ångel Di Mar√≠a, where Welbeck had been the fruit of the club's admired, cherished youth system.

Some on the coaching staff were aghast at the sale to Arsenal of a young man they had seen come all the way. Brian McClair, the former striker in charge of the academy, recalled ‚ÄúDanny running into the gym as a six- or seven-year-old at the Cliff [United's then training ground] ‚Ä¶ he was a happy lad, he was enthusiastic, and he was quick‚Äù.

Welbeck was early collateral for attempts to modernise after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure, a process still far from completion. He began ‚Äì and continues ‚Äì the trend of former United players flourishing away from Old Trafford's sapping turf. From the same Fletcher Moss nursery club that provided United with Wes Brown and Marcus Rashford, Welbeck was one of Ferguson's final fledglings.

Taken to Moscow as part of the 2008 Champions League final travelling party, on the eve of the match he scored a hat-trick in training. Though left out of the matchday squad, he overslept so heavily after the post-match celebrations that Ferguson left him to make his own way to the airport.

In Ferguson's final Champions League match, a last-16 encounter in March 2013, he started Welbeck instead of Rooney, Welbeck's energy causing huge problems for Real Madrid, only for a scoring touch to desert him. Cristiano Ronaldo's did not, United exited.

At Arsenal, an inability to finish chances his movement had created was labelled a weakness. Still, Ars√®ne Wenger, having snatched him from Tottenham's grasp in 2014, remained a confirmed admirer. ‚ÄúHe can play wide, on the right, and central, he can play with anybody,‚Äù he said in 2018.

Welbeck had the faith of two managerial greats but also experienced sore luck with injuries, missing Euro 2016 with a knee injury. He signed for Watford after a broken ankle had concluded his Arsenal career.

At Brighton, Welbeck has made use of hi-tech facilities and the staff's expertise in recovery to enjoy an Indian summer, an experienced hand in one of world football's prime talent factories, his dependability an asset as potential ‚Äì and coaching regimes ‚Äì comes in and out.

Brought in when Graham Potter was manager, before enjoying a close working relationship with Roberto De Zerbi, he has partnered a number of forwards, of varying skill sets, from Glenn Murray and Neal Maupay to Evan Ferguson and Jo√£o Pedro. Georginio Rutter, who supplied the first against Newcastle, is his latest regular accomplice. Often on the flanks at United and Arsenal, he has played centrally almost exclusively.

After the Newcastle win, Brighton's head coach, Fabian H√ºrzeler, close to three years younger than Welbeck, set aside the goals, instead hailing the overall package: ‚ÄúWhen we look at his performance, how many times did he help us defend the goal, how many recovery runs? ‚Ä¶ It's about how he is as a leader.‚Äù

H√ºrzeler has full membership of a distinguished list of managers within Welbeck's fanclub. Would Tuchel consider joining them?","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

You have come to the ESPN Africa edition, for other ESPN editions, click above.

Inter Miami co-owners David Beckham and Jorge Mas share their delight at Lionel Messi extending his contract with the club. (1:29)

Africa's World Cup qualifying campaign has seen nine teams secure their places at next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico. However, for four CAF teams there's still a glimmer of hope.

The expanded World Cup format has opened the door for one of the quartet of best-placed African group runners-up to squeeze into the expanded 48-team competition... if they can run the playoff gauntlet successfully.

Read on for everything you need to know about the World Cup qualifiers playoffs, including dates, format, and our (probably completely useless) predictions.

The expanded World Cup finally answered calls for more berths to be given to African teams, with the 54-member confederation (CAF) only previously getting five qualifiers.

As well as that number being increased to nine automatic qualifiers, Africa also have the opportunity to compete with four other confederations -- AFC, CONMEBOL, CONCACAF and OFC -- to decide the final two participants.

After the CAF playoffs in November have determined which side from the continent will go forth to compete in the inter-confederation FIFA Play-Off Tournament, Africa will have to wait until March to see whether they have a 10th World Cup representative.

CAF's First Round produced nine qualifiers directly, with each of the group winners progressing to the World Cup.

There will be a strong North African contingent, with Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria all present, while South Africa will return for the first time since they hosted in 2010.

From West Africa, Senegal, Ghana and reigning African champions Ivory Coast will all be in attendance, as will first-time qualifiers Cape Verde, who are set to become the second smallest nation ever -- and the smallest from Africa -- to feature at the World Cup.

When the qualifying group stage concluded in mid-October, the four best-placed of the nine group runners-up secured their places in the African playoff.

CAF announced before the last round of fixtures that, in order to normalise the group standings, given that Group E had one fewer team competing following the withdrawal of Eritrea, they would not be taking into account results against each group's bottom-placed team in order to rank the runners-up.

Gabon finished atop the ranking of runners-up, with 19 points from their eight 'eligible' fixtures. The Panthers, the only potential first-time qualifiers in the playoffs, were outstanding during the group stage, losing just one match, and finishing one point behind Cote d'Ivoire.

The Democratic Republic of Congo have also made the cut and, like Gabon, were only one result away from topping their group and returning to the World Cup for the first time since 1974.

A 3-2 defeat by Senegal in Kinshasa on September 9 ultimately saw the Leopards cede the initiative in the group to the Teranga Lions, but they have the opportunity to make amends during the playoffs.

While Gabon and the DRC will be delighted to still be 'alive' in the race for the World Cup, Cameroon and Nigeria -- the other two 'lucky losers' -- would surely have expected to have been home and dry by this point.

Instead, Cameroon's four drawn matches, as well as their defeat by Cape Verde in Praia, left them four points behind the islanders, condemning the most successful African side in World Cup qualification to the playoffs.

The chaos going on behind the scenes in the country's football community -- notably the animosity between FA president Samuel Eto'o and head coach Marc Brys -- doesn't augur well, but the Indomitable Lions have proved their capacity in the past to triumph over adversity.

For the Super Eagles, a playoff berth, having missed out on top spot to South Africa, is both an ignominious outcome and a major relief, with their campaign lurching from one crisis to another as they won just four of their 10 group fixtures.

Nonetheless, a Victor Osimhen-inspired 4-0 demolition of World Cup hopefuls Benin in their final qualifier was testament to their quality and could prove the launchpad for the most unlikeliest of qualifications.

The group runners-up who failed to advance are Burkina Faso, Niger, Madagascar, Uganda and Namibia.

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens breakdown the success of Morroco's new generation following their U20 final victory.

Gabon, who finished top of the runners-up rankings will take on fourth-placed Nigeria in one semi, while Cameroon and the DRC meet in a Central African derby in the second semi. The brackets were decided based on the October 2025 FIFA world rankings.

Both semifinals will take place on Thursday November 13, with the two victors advancing to the final on Sunday November 16.

All three matches will be held in Morocco, although the exact venue for the semis and the final, as well as specific kickoff times, have yet to be confirmed by FIFA, and it remains to be seen whether both fixtures on Nov 13 will take place in the same stadium or even city.

The matches are expected to be broadcast on FIFA+. International broadcasters have yet to be announced.

The unpredictable and unprecedented nature of the format -- not to mention the participation of four flawed teams -- largely prevent confident predictions as four teams will become one to represent the continent in the FIFA Play-Off Tournament.

With both semis being one-off clashes in a neutral venue, not to mention the mere two-day rest before the final, the prospects of a shock outcome appear high... although what would a 'shock outcome' be given the four disparate teams set to compete?

Gabon and Congo will fancy their chances, coming off the back of impressive group stage campaigns in which they pushed the fancied Ivorians and Senegalese close. The Panthers, in particular, were outstanding going forward, with the mesmerising Denis Bouanga and veteran Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring 15 goals between them.

They comfortably outscored the other three teams in the semis, and dropped just five points during the entirety of the qualifying campaign -- fewer than the likes of automatic qualifiers Cape Verde, South Africa and Senegal.

So often in chaos in recent years, their decision to keep faith in local coach Thierry Mouyouma after a series of fairly forgettable foreign managers has finally given the Panthers a sense of identity and rare belief.

The same can't be said of Cameroon. The five-time African champions have utterly lost their aura, dropping points against Eswatini was a lowlight of the qualifying campaign, while the defeat in Praia as well as draws with Angola (twice) and Libya have made for a miserable few months.

Things came to a head during the final qualifier against Angola, where Eto'o was filmed engaging in a heated discussion with a supporter about the team's failings.

The likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Carlos Baleba and Frank Anguissa still represent genuine quality, while veterans such as Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting could help the Lions salvage something from a testing year.

Nigeria have endured similar hardships, notably going through four different head coaches during the course of the qualifying campaign. Momentum is certainly on Nigeria's side though, with current coach Eric Chelle going six games unbeaten in the qualifiers after taking the helm.

The Super Eagles conclude on a high note, with that 4-0 pasting of Benin, with South Africa's points deduction for fielding illegible player Teboho Mokoena against Lesotho in March ultimately not influencing the group standings.

Nigeria can also call upon the majority of the players who reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations last year, with the experience of navigating high-profile matches this collective gained along the way.

If Osimhen can recapture the form he brought as Benin were put to the sword, Nigeria are the outstanding contenders to progress.

Like Gabon, DR Congo could take advantage of their 'outsiders' tag to play without the weight of expectation that Cameroon will surely carry on their shoulders when the pair meet in a Central African derby in their semi.

They're well ahead of the progress that was anticipated under Sebastien Desabre when he took the helm after failure to reach the 2022 tournament, and the Frenchman has also made the Leopards tough to beat.

The 3-2 defeat by Senegal in Kinshasa was an outlier, and beyond that fixture, the two-time African champions kept six clean sheets during the group stage. Attackers such as C√©dric Bakambu, Th√©o Bongonda and Yoane Wissa ensure they have many ways to hurt opponents.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

SAL√â, Morocco (Oct. 24, 2025) -- The U.S Under-17 Women's National Team defeated Norway 5-0 to win Group C at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. It was the second time the USA has won its group at this tournament (with 2022 in India being the other) but the first time the U.S. U-17s have won all three group games. 

Three National Women's Soccer League players scored goals as forwards KK Ream (Utah Royals), Ellie Kocher and Micayla Johnson (Chicago Stars) and midfielder Mak Whitham (Gotham FC) each tallied their first goals of the tournament while Nyanya Touray came off the bench to score her fourth.

The USA will now face the third-place team from Group A, B or F on Tuesday, Oct. 28 at 11:30 a.m. ET on FS2.

The USA has scored 13 goals in group play in this tournament, matching its record for most goals during the group stage at the FIFA U-17 WWC, which was set in India in 2022, but that group stage included an 8-0 win over India.

U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer made six changes to the starting XI from the second group match, a 5-2 win over China PR that clinched a berth in the Round of 16 with one match -- this one against Norway -- remaining. Schoepfer kept the same back line and changed five of the six midfielders/forwards, and the USA scored five goals in a game for the second time in the tournament.

Goalkeeper Peyton Trayer got the nod in the nets for the USA after Evan O'Steen had started the first two matches. Trayer earned her first World Cup shutout. 

Norway, needing a win to have any chance of advancing in a tournament that sends four third-place teams to the knockout round, fell far short. It took the USA just under six minutes to score as Ream dribbled into the left side of the penalty area, made a bit of space for herself to shoot and smacked her left-footed shot off the right post and in from 16 yards out. For Ream, the youngest goal scorer in NWSL history when she tallied on Aug. 29 for the Utah Royals at 16 years and 52 days old, it was her first goal of this tournament. It was also the USA's fastest goal yet of the tournament.

The USA doubled its lead in the 49th minute and effectively put the game away as the young Americans were even more dominant in the second half. Midfielder Scottie Antonucci played a ball to Kocher just above the penalty box on the right. Kocher beat Norway defender Lea Ellingsen with a quick cut to her right as she dribbled into the penalty area and then struck her shot on the ground inside the left post from just above the corner of the six-yard box. It was Kocher's first goal of the tournament as well.

Midfielder Nyanya Touray entered the match in the 61st minute and made an immediate impact, scoring in the 63rd. The goal came as Ream got around the defense into the left side of the penalty area and cut a pass back to Touray, who perfectly timed her run and finished with the inside of her right foot from 10 yards out. The goal momentarily tied Touray for the lead in the Golden Boot race with four goals so far in the tournament, and she of course leads the USA in scoring.

The USA made it two goals in a two-minute span when a nice attack down the right side saw Johnson, who came on in the 62nd minute, cross from the right side to Ream, who sent a header on goal. Norway goalkeeper Sara Holte, who came on at halftime, saved the shot but spilled the ball right at the feet of Whitham, who smashed the rebound into the net from close range to make it 4-0 in the 64th.

The USA finished the scoring in the 80th minute and this time it was Johnson. She played a give-and-go with substitute Lauren Malsom in the right side of the penalty box and then rolled her shot off the left post and in from about 16 yards out.

Trayer was called into action in the 30th minute as Norway forward Christina Herseth got behind the U.S. defense into the left side of the penalty area drove a high shot at goal. Trayer pushed the ball away, but the rebound fell to another Norway attacker and Trayer had to save that shot with a dive to her left.

The USA utilized the Video Support System in the 38th minute, asking for a penalty kick review as Celia Halvorsen bundled into outside back Sydney Schmidt in the right side of the penalty area as both battled for a cross. After video review, the referee denied the request.

Whitham had two good chances to score inside the final five minutes of the first half. In the 42nd minute she intercepted a back pass deep inside the penalty box, but she was in close quarters with the Norway goalkeeper Maria Kroken, who stole the ball off her feet. In the 45th minute, Schmidt made a great dribbling run, advanced the ball 40 yards down the left side and played Ream on the wing. Ream crossed to Whitham inside the six-yard box, but the USA's youngest player at 15 years of age put her close range shot over the bar. Whitham would get her goal later in the game.

Norway exited its first FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup without scoring a goal.

USA ‚Äì KK Ream, 6th minute: The USA benefited from a Norway turnover in the back as Ream dribbled in the left channel and struck a left-footed shot from just inside the penalty area off the right post and in past the diving Norway goalkeeper. USA 1, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Ellie Kocher (Scottie Antonucci), 49th minute: Antonucci played a short pass to Kocher just above the penalty box on the right. She took on her defender one-on-one, scorched her to the outside, and then drove her shot on the ground inside the left post from just above the corner of the six-yard box. USA 2, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Nyanya Touray (KK Ream), 63rd minute: Touray immediately sparked the USA after coming off the bench, scoring seconds after subbing on. Touray ran onto a perfect cut back pass into the seam from Ream and finished with the inside of her right foot from 10 yards. USA 3, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Mak Whitham, 64th minute: Whitham capitalized on a mistake from the Norway goalkeeper who dropped KK Ream's header just in front of the goal and the 15-year-old made her pay, blasting the ball into the net from close range. USA 4, NOR 0

USA ‚Äì Micayla Johnson, 80th minute: Johnson and fellow sub Lauren Malsom played a give-and-go in the right side of the box which set up Johnson to roll her shot off the left post and in from about 16 yards out and become the first American player to score in two FIFA U-17 Women's World Cups.

With the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo duopoly now disappearing into the rearview mirror, the battle for the Ballon d'Or hasn't felt so open for the best part of 20 years, with countless players beginning the campaign believing they have a chance of claiming the most prestigious individual prize football has to offer. Ousmane Dembele emerged from a career plagued with inconsistencies to win the Golden Ball in 2025, and he is among a crowded field of contenders as the 2026 race gets going.

Dembele largely secured the award off the back of his performances in helping Paris Saint-Germain win their first European Cup, and the Champions League is yet again likely to have a big say on the Ballon d'Or battle this time around. However, it's also a World Cup year, so there is a chance that the eventual winner doesn't emerge until the summer in North America.

Don't forget, too, that there is the Africa Cup of Nations running from late December and into January, meaning there could be some players who don't only shine for their clubs but also impress at two major tournaments over the course of the campaign.

The Ballon d'Or race is a marathon not a sprint, and it's worth bearing in mind that Dembele didn't emerge as a potential contender until midway through the 2024-25 campaign. However, with the European season now properly up and running, so too are GOAL's Power Rankings as we track the likeliest winners of the Golden Ball over the coming weeks and months:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The U.S. opened a three-match international break with a frustrating defeat with few positives after the game's first 33 seconds

If the first 33 seconds were anything to go by, the U.S. women's national team were set to cruise. They'd gotten on the board in the blink of an eye, with Rose Lavelle seemingly setting a tone with a first-minute goal. Surely that would be a sign of things to come. Surely, like Spain and England earlier this year, the USWNT would use that goal to kickstart a rout of Portugal.

Not quite. In fact, not even close. Instead, it was the USWNT who found themselves on the end of a stunning 2-1 defeat at Subaru Park, one that served as a harsh reminder that, despite recent successes, this team still has a lot of work to do.

Not only had the USWNT never lost to Portugal - they had won 10 of 11 all-time meetings, with the two teams playing to a scoreless draw in the group stage of the 2023 World Cup - they had never even conceded a goal. After Lavelle's goal, the US held a 40-0 goalscoring advantage over Portugal all-time.

But that changed quickly. After Lavelle quick opening goal, the USWNT were outmuscled and, in truth, outplayed by Portugal. The two goals came off set pieces, one in the first half from Diana Gomes and a deflected effort from Fatima Pinto in the 72nd minute to seal it.

Boiling it down to just that would be unfair to Portugal, though. The visitors played toe-to-toe with the USWNT, having their share of the ball and fighting like hell to get it back every time they lost it. Portugal's performance was scrappy, yes, but it was also somewhat complete, unlike the one put forward by the USWNT, who generated little of note outside of the goal and a few near-misses.

With the 2-1 loss, the USWNT has now dropped three matches in a calendar year for the first time since 2022 - and this was much different than previous 2-1 setbacks against Japan and Brazil, as Portugal entered the match ranked 23rd in FIFA's world rankings. The USWNT is ranked No. 2.

Fortunately for the USWNT, they'll get their chance to respond in just a few days as these two teams face off in East Hartford, Connecticut on Sunday. This was the first game for Emma Hayes' side in 113 days, having last played in a 3-0 win over Canada on July 2. The rust was obvious, but Sam Coffey gave that justification no legitimacy, calling it a ""cop out."" She noted that Hayes called out the lack of team cohesiveness. 

""Disappointment is the word,"" Coffey told TNT after the match. ""Conceding on two set pieces? We pride ourselves on defensive set pieces and we did not live up to that standard tonight. Her biggest message was that we were just too individual. We didn't play as the incredible team that we are tonight. We tried to do it as individuals, and that's not who we are. The strength of the team is its numbers, the group itself. We did not show that tonight. That's a huge learning for us.""

Hayes was equally frustrated, saying of the 113-day layoff, ""I aged 113 years on the touchline. Like, it was frustrating, of course. Listen, our team have been wonderful since I've been here. This, for me, is a moment for us to really lean in and say, ‚ÄòLook, there's a reason we set you up a certain way. And, you know, sometimes it doesn't happen.' And I'm frustrated because I know everybody wants to do well and we're disappointed... We scored a goal and we stopped playing.""

If the U.S. wants to change the result, and the narrative, they'll need much better on Sunday.

Two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion Alexander Zverev on Friday became the fourth singles player to qualify for the season finale when he advanced to the Vienna semi-finals with Tallon Griekspoor's withdrawal.

Zverev, who has now qualified for the year-end championships eight times, joined Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic in the field at Inalpi Arena. The Nitto ATP Finals will take place from 9-16 November.

Zverev put himself in good position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin early in the year by making the Australian Open final, his third championship match at a Grand Slam tournament. 

The Hamburg native triumphed on home soil in Munich for the 24th ATP Tour title of his career, and he has now claimed at least one tour-level trophy in nine of the past 10 seasons. Zverev also made the final in Stuttgart and advanced to ATP Masters 1000 semi-finals in Toronto and Cincinnati.

The German first qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals in 2017 and has earned his place at the prestigious event in eight of the past nine seasons. He earned the crown in 2018 and 2021, and also made the semi-finals in 2019 and 2024.

According to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Zverev owns a 17-10 record at the year-end championships. He is 9-3 since the event relocated to Turin in 2021 and two of those defeats have come in final-set tie-breaks.

When Zverev claimed glory at the Nitto ATP Finals for the second time, in 2021, he became one of just two active singles players who has won the Nitto ATP Finals more than once, joining Djokovic. 

Four singles places remain at the Nitto ATP Finals, with fifth-placed Fritz currently next in line to qualify.

A new chapter of the Rolex Paris Masters has begun in its striking new home, and with it comes the arrival of the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Carlos Alcaraz touched down at La D√©fense Arena on Friday morning, gearing up for his first tour-level appearance since triumphing in Tokyo last month. Beanie on, buzz cut hidden from the brisk Paris air, the 22-year-old Spaniard surveyed the vast new venue before taking to the practice court alongside 2018 champion Karen Khachanov.

First practice in the new venue for Carlos Alcaraz and 2018 champion Karen Khachanov ü¶æ#RolexParisMasters pic.twitter.com/tXSGE0soMb

During his Tokyo title run, Alcaraz sustained a left-ankle injury and subsequently missed the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai. Earlier this week, he was back in his home town of El Palmar, Spain, training with his team in preparation for a return to Tour. Now, with a 5-4 record in Paris, including his best showing in 2022 when he reached the quarter-finals, the World No. 1 arrives with unfinished business.

Could the move to Europe's largest indoor sports venue ignite his first French crown? The centre court at La D√©fense Arena can accommodate 17,500 spectators, which makes it the second-biggest tennis court for year-round events, behind only Arthur Ashe Stadium at the US Open.

The Rolex Paris Masters remains just one of three ATP Masters 1000 titles missing from Alcaraz's glittering resume. Over the coming week, he will look to cross it off and tighten his grip on a potential second ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF finish.

Already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, Alcaraz holds a lead of more than 2,000 points over rival Jannik Sinner atop the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Sinner is competing this week in Vienna, where he is into Friday's quarter-finals.

Alcaraz boasts a Tour-leading 67 wins and eight titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. In Paris, he is returning to indoor action for the first time since February, when he won his first trophy in these conditions at the ATP 500 in Rotterdam.

Former World No. 2 Petra Kvitova announced she is expecting her second child with husband Jiri Vanek. After a 17-month maternity leave, she returned to tennis earlier this year but decided to retire after the US Open.

Weeks after she closed the book on her Hologic WTA Tour career at the US Open, former World No. 2 Petra Kvitova is beginning a next chapter. She'll soon be a mother of two.

The 35-year-old announced Thursday that she and husband Jiri Vanek are expanding their family. 

The couple, who married in 2023, already share son Petr, born last July -- and the toddler played a role in Kvitova's second pregnancy announcement. She posted a photo of the family of three wrote in the caption in Czech and English: ""Our little boy will soon become a big brother.""

A post shared by Petra Kvitova (@petra.kvitova)

Kvitova returned to tennis earlier this year after a 17-month maternity leave, fittingly welcoming her son during the 2024 fortnight of the grass-court Grand Slam she won twice.

The love of the game, rather than returning to her previous glory, brought the left-hander back to the tour in February at the ATX Open -- but she decided by the summer that she was ready to hang up her racquets for good. She won just one of the nine matches she played after coming back, and announced in June that the US Open would be her final event. 

""Mentally, I think I can't do it any more, as well as emotionally and physically. ... You still remember how you played before, how everything was smooth and I was hitting winners and suddenly it's not there,"" she said in New York.

‚ÄúI'm totally ready. I'm not regretting anything. I still love tennis but everything else, waiting for the practices, waiting for the car, waiting for a match, it's just tiring. And having a son, it's a totally different life. I just want to spend more time with him as well.""

Kvitova's career ended with a first-round loss to Diane Parry in New York.

Popular in the locker room, Kvitova was an eight-time Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award winner as voted by her peers -- and received a flood of congratulatory messages including from players like Belinda Bencic, Sorana Cirstea, Carla Su√°rez Navarro and Elena Vesnina.

Elena Rybakina qualifies for WTA Finals Riyadh after a quarterfinal win in Tokyo over Victoria Mboko. Mirra Andreeva and Ekaterina Alexandrova will serve as first and second alternates, respectively.

ST. PETERSBURG, FLA, USA -- The WTA announced Thursday night that Elena Rybakina has qualified for the WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF setting the world-class singles field for the prestigious end-of-season showpiece.

Rybakina, from Kazakhstan, joins PIF WTA World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka along with Iga Swiatek, defending champion Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys and Jasmine Paolini in the draw in Riyadh to compete for the WTA Finals Billie Jean King Trophy.

The 26-year-old secured her qualification in dramatic fashion at this year's last possible tournament, having needed to reach at least the semifinals this week at the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo which she duly did earlier today, defeating Victoria Mboko in her quarterfinal match. Mirra Andreeva and Ekaterina Alexandrova will serve as the first and second alternates, respectively.

""The world-class singles field for the WTA Finals is now set, and I can't wait to welcome this inspiring group of athletes to Riyadh,"" said WTA Finals Tournament Director Garbi√±e Muguruza. ""This season we have seen eight different champions across WTA 1000 tournaments and the Grand Slams showing the incredible depth and drama of the WTA Tour, with the perfect curtain-call now ready to take place at the WTA Finals.""

Rybkakina will be appearing at the WTA Finals for the third year in a row. She made history in 2023 as Kazakhstan's first singles qualifier.

She won her career ninth and 10th WTA titles this season to earn her place in Riyadh, triumphing at two WTA 500 events at the AUX ¬∑ Ningbo Open and Internationaux de Strasbourg.

The former Grand Slam champion also reached a string of semifinals in addition to Tokyo, including three at WTA 1000 level at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, Cincinnati Open and National Bank Open presented by Rogers (Montreal).

The 2025 WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF takes place from November 1-8, 2025 and features the top 8 singles players and doubles teams on the PIF Race to the WTA Finals Leaderboard (with the 8th spot going to the singles player and doubles team that have won a Grand Slam if ranked No.8 to No.20). Players and teams compete in a round-robin format with the singles champion lifting the WTA Finals Billie Jean King Trophy and the doubles champions earning the WTA Finals Martina Navratilova Trophy.

Who is the favorite in Riyadh? Who better to ask than an eight-time WTA Finals champion Martina Navratilova, who knows exactly what it takes to win this event.

The field for the WTA Finals in Riyadh is set. It took nearly 10 months and the last week in Tokyo to sort out the final qualifying spot, but the lineup is now official: Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Jessica Pegula, Elena Rybakina, Madison Keys and Jasmine Paolini. 

This order reflects the Race standings that will be finalized and published on Monday.

It's a mix of heavy hitters and fresh storylines -- major winners, first-timers and players who arrived here on very different paths. Some powered through all year, some surged late, and some had to solve real problems along the way just to make it back to this stage.

To break down the field, we turned to someone who knows this tournament better than anyone: Martina Navratilova.

She won the WTA Finals eight times -- nearly twice as many as any other player -- and understands what separates qualifying from actually winning the title. Here's her read on the eight players heading to Riyadh:

‚ÄúIncredibly consistent and excellent. One major win, two finals and a semifinal. She was only three or four matches from winning the Grand Slam. Her consistency is not to be underestimated. There are so many players you can lose to these days, you have to be on your game at all times, and she was.

‚ÄúShe peaked well for all the majors. She's still rueing the French Open more than anything. She could have won that match against Coco Gauff. But she bounced back and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon, where she was beaten by Amanda Anisimova rather than beating herself. Then she won the US Open pretty decisively.

‚ÄúShe's the heavy favorite on any surface, but particularly on a medium-pace hard court where you get a solid bounce and good footing. Her shots pay off on any surface and she has enough time to get into position. It's fast enough for her to do damage and slow enough for her to prepare for her shots. She's deadly on this stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like she's a bit of an enigma this year based on the standards she set in recent seasons. She didn't win the one everyone thought she would at Roland Garros, then she turned around and won the one no one expected her to win. Maybe the pressure was off and she said, ‚ÄòI'm just going to go for it.'

‚ÄúShe's been a bit up and down, but she won Wimbledon in an amazing way. She flattened out her shots and didn't worry about missing here and there. That's the kind of aggressive approach she needs to bring to Riyadh. That should give her some confidence.

‚ÄúShe's played nine hard-court finals and won them all. That's crazy. One of those was last year in Riyadh, so look out if she gets rolling again. Her backhand is like Djokovic's -- maybe with even more power. It's money.

‚ÄúWhen the serve is happening, it's a real weapon, and I'm glad she's figuring that out. Her movement is better than anybody else. She can always depend on that. It's the one thing fully under her control. She knows she can run and defend no matter what. Then she manages the rest. When she comes forward, she has a very good volley and it's hard to get the ball past her. She just won in Wuhan, so she should be confident.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my goodness. She has been through so much -- losing her father and dealing with everything else that came with that. The expectations were big, almost on par with Mirra Andreeva and Coco Gauff now. Big things were expected of her and she tried to grow into that. Sometimes the pressure is too much if the results don't come on the timeline people expect. It gets tricky. There were injuries, too.

‚ÄúNow everything just came together for her this year and it's great to see because she's such a nice person. She hits a heavy ball. She reminds me of Lindsay Davenport. That Wimbledon loss had to be sitting in the back of her mind, but she beat Iga in the US Open semifinal and played well in the final. That's a hard one to bounce back from, but she did it.

‚ÄúShe hits such a clean ball. It's a pleasure to watch from a purist's point of view. She's accurate on both sides and takes time away. If I were serving to her, I'd just go body, body, body, because you don't want to give her a free swing.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's been picking it up. She's adapted her game to be more aggressive, going for her shots, coming forward more, using the drop shot. She hits a nice ball, not too much topspin or slice when she's in rhythm. Now she's mixing it up much better -- the drop shot, coming in, the low-bouncing slice.

‚ÄúShe's a relatively late bloomer, but she changed her game and it's paid off. She wants the ball coming onto her racquet so she can redirect, kind of like Radwanska. In slow conditions, she has to create her own pace, and in China she was swinging harder at everything -- her serve, her groundstrokes. When the court is slow, she can really whale away.‚Äù





 Jimmie48/WTA
                        

‚ÄúWhen she won Wimbledon in 2022, the future looked bright. Her game is beautiful. She has such easy power and she moves well. The serve is a killer. She has all the shots and she's proven she can win on any surface.

‚ÄúIf I were her, I'd work on the slice more, just to change things up. Mix in more drop shots off both wings so she can knife the ball and keep opponents guessing. It's hard to tell sometimes what she's thinking on court -- she has a serious game face -- but with the way she's been playing in Asia, you can't count her out. She's playing as well as she has all season.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were all pulling for her. I cried when she won the Australian Open. I was so happy for her. I thought she'd be a massive force after that because so much of her challenge was emotional. The game has always been there.

‚ÄúShe changed her racquet and strings, but she also changed her attitude, and that was the biggest shift. She was much more consistent in Australia. It's been two months since she's played a match and there's nothing wrong with that. She decided it was a good time to take a break, train for this tournament and be physically ready for Australia. That's smart short-term and long-term thinking.

‚ÄúShe gave herself permission not to play. I wish I had done that. She should be fresh and sharp. She'll like this surface. It suits her.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe has a really fun game to watch. She's a torpedo out there, and she defends well, attacks well, and she understands spins, positioning and angles. She's like a mini Ashleigh Barty with a smaller serve.

‚ÄúShe qualified in both singles and doubles, and that can be rough with round-robin play. You're playing a match every day, and it's killer if you make both semifinals. That could be 10 matches in eight days if you go all the way. That's a big ask. But she's build for this.‚Äù

Published Oct 24, 2025

For 20 years, we had stasis at the top of men's tennis. Since late 2022, it feels as if we've been moving in permanent fast forward.The shift began that September. Early in the month, Carlos Alcaraz, then 19, won his first major title at the US Open. Later the same month, Roger Federer, then 41, bid a tearful good-bye to tennis at Laver Cup in London.The other shoe‚Äîin the form of Jannik Sinner‚Äîdropped 12 months after that. First, the 22-year-old Italian beat 36-year-old Novak Djokovic in a series of important matches to close out 2023. Then he ended his long run of dominance at the Australian Open to start 2024.We had been waiting for a changing of the ATP guard for so long, some of us wondered if it would ever happen. Who could follow the Big 3's 66-Slam act? By the end of 2024, in stunningly swift fashion, we had our answer. That year, Alcaraz and Sinner split the four majors, and they did the same in 2025. At Roland Garros this spring, they gave us a classic final worthy of the very best of the Big 3's.

After Federer, Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal raised the bar inhumanly high for so long, I expected we would see the return of the human‚Äîi.e., occasionally imperfect‚Äîchampion to tennis. Instead, with their ever-faster pace of play and ever-cleaner ball-striking, Alcaraz and Sinner look poised to raise the bar higher. Jim Courier christened them the ‚ÄúNew 2,‚Äù but that phrase has quickly reached its expiration date. Neither of them is 25, but at this point there's nothing novel about their rivalry.So maybe it makes sense that Sinner and Alcaraz‚Äîbefore marriage, before kids, before steady girlfriends, maybe even before their brains are fully formed‚Äîhave already been given the book treatment. This summer saw the release of Being Carlos Alcaraz, by British tennis writer Mark Hodgkinson, and *Changeover*,\ by Giri Nathan of the sports site Defector. Anyone who has written a sports-related book will be jealous of their timing. There was no guarantee when they started writing that, at the moment their volumes arrived, Sinner and Alcaraz wouldn't be injured or slumping or just mediocre. Instead, to the delight of their publishers, the two were about to play their third straight Slam final at the Open.The measure of a good sports biography in my case is whether it (a) makes me want to watch its subject more, and (b) helps me see them with new and possibly more sympathetic eyes. Both of these books succeed in doing that, and in setting the narrative table for the sport's next rivalry.

A post shared by Mark Hodgkinson (@hodgkinsonmark2000)

Hodgkinson's Alcaraz bio is the more nuts-and-bolts of the two. If you want to fill in any gaps in your knowledge of early Carlitos, the book has you covered.But nuts-and-bolts doesn't mean dry. Hodgkinson is good at evoking Alcaraz's hometown of El Palmar in southeast Spain, a laid-back village of 20,000 with year-round sun that's referred to as ‚ÄúEurope's orchard,‚Äù and where a giant mural of an 11-year-old Alcaraz is now plastered across a wall at his old elementary school.For me, the early Alcaraz‚Äîwho was nicknamed Tarzan by a coach‚Äîcan be summed up in one image from this book. As a 5-year-old, he loved to bash the ball against the backboard at his local club over and over and over, ideally without end. Alcaraz's father, a teaching pro at the same club, said his son resembled a mini ground-stroke machine when he went up against the wall‚Äîone who hid his dad's keys so he wouldn't have to leave, and cried when he finally did. Tennis was life for Alcaraz's father, Carlos, Sr., and it would be for Carlos, Jr., as well.From there, Hodgkinson takes us to the next stop on Alcaraz's turbo-journey to the top: Juan Carlos Ferrero's academy in nearby Alicante. That the former No. 1 would set up shop within driving distance of the Alcaraz family's tiny hometown feels providential. The academy, located in the mountains far from any nightlife, turned out to be a suitably hardcore and ascetic introduction to big-time tennis for the fun-loving but not rebellious teenager. Even Covid was a blessing in disguise: Alcaraz spent six weeks locked down at Ferrero's academy, and emerged a much-improved 17-year-old.

Even Covid was a blessing in disguise: Alcaraz spent six weeks locked down at Ferrero's academy, and emerged a much-improved 17-year-old.

For me, the early Alcaraz‚Äîwho was nicknamed Tarzan by a coach‚Äîcan be summed up in one image from this book. As a 5-year-old, he loved to bash the ball against the backboard at his local club over and over and over, ideally without end. Alcaraz's father, a teaching pro at the same club, said his son resembled a mini ground-stroke machine when he went up against the wall‚Äîone who hid his dad's keys so he wouldn't have to leave, and cried when he finally did. Tennis was life for Alcaraz's father, Carlos, Sr., and it would be for Carlos, Jr., as well.From there, Hodgkinson takes us to the next stop on Alcaraz's turbo-journey to the top: Juan Carlos Ferrero's academy in nearby Alicante.

There's not much dirt or gossip to report on Alcaraz yet. The worst thing he seems to have done so far is sing ‚ÄúWe Are the Champions‚Äù off-key at a karaoke bar with friends in Ibiza after winning Roland Garros. Ferrero had warned him against the party trip. It's good to know Alcaraz ignored him, and then won Wimbledon a few weeks later anyway.Maybe most revealing to me is the fact that Alcaraz has seen two different psychologists, starting when he was eight. The first, Josefina Cutillas, may be as responsible as anyone for the fun-first, process-over-results attitude that has worked so well for him.‚ÄúWhen they spoke on Mondays, Alcaraz wasn't allowed to tell Cutillas whether he had won or lost his latest match, only how he thought he had played,‚Äù Hodgkinson writes. ‚ÄúGiving attention to the result would have reduced Alcaraz's tennis to winning or losing, to being a success or a failure, and Cutillas didn't want that for him.‚Äù‚ÄúCutillas was hoping that as a boy, and maybe deeper into his tennis life, he would be less interested in his results than in whether he was improving and meeting the standards he was setting for himself.‚Äù

By all accounts, Cutillas's wishes have come true. Even today, Alcaraz says he plays his best when he enjoying himself, expressing himself in his shots and movement, and finding satisfaction in his own performance, rather than worrying about winning and losing. It's an attitude that millions of tennis players over the decades have tried to maintain as they compete; Alcaraz may go down as the first ever to make it work.Where Hodgkinson gets us up to speed on Alcaraz's formation, Nathan, in *Changeover*, takes the reins and tells the story of the most recent development in his career, his rivalry and relationship with Sinner.The book is an extended celebration of tennis genius, 2020s-style, and a more writerly affair than Hodgkinson's.

A post shared by Jannik Sinner (@janniksin)

Like Alcaraz, and Nadal before them, Sinner was raised in a remote area: the village of Sexten, on the border between Italy and Austria in the Dolomites. While tennis was the be-all and end-all for Alcaraz and his father, it was ‚Äújust another game‚Äù for Sinner and his family. Skiing was the default sport in their mountains. Sinner says it's ‚Äúvery, very strange‚Äù to imagine a tennis player coming from there. He was an excellent skier, too, but his skinny frame was better suited to tennis, which he took up at the advanced age of 13.Hodgkinson and Nathan both say that Alcaraz ‚Äúplays how he feels‚Äù on any given day. Sinner, by contrast, is always planning his next move. Nathan quotes an early coach of Sinner's praising his ‚Äúcapacity for work, and for simplifying it.‚Äù From a young age, he was thinking ahead to a pro career, and had little interest in juniors. He studied the pros for hours on video at night‚Äîbut only the ones who had orderly playing styles that made ‚Äúsense.‚Äù When he practiced with touring pros, he took a lot from the experience; unlike other kids, his coach said, he wasn't just interested in the Instagram shot at the end.If there's an anecdote in Changeover that helps explain Sinner to me, it comes when he tells his coach at the time, Ricardo Piatti, ‚Äúto stay f-ing calmer‚Äù on court, and then fires him soon after. Calmness, thoughtfulness, cool calculation: They mean a lot to Sinner. Precision is his calling card, and you need a cool head and a steady hand to time the ball the way he does, as consistently as he does.

Alcaraz and Sinner have both shown a desire to keep improving. Each has recently upgraded his serve, and each grabbed the No. 1 ranking because of it. Each of them has also shown an ability to live with and enjoy success. Nathan notes that Sinner began to show a looser side to his personality when he rose to No. 1 in 2024, and Alcaraz has been smilier than ever during his successful 2025.This week in Paris, provided both of their bodies remain willing, they'll play in the same event for the first time since the US Open. Right now, as we start to think about 2026, it seems like we've passed an early peak in the Sincaraz era. They gave us an epic Slam final in Paris, and two decent but fairly one-sided follow-ups at Wimbledon and in New York. It won't be easy for them to keep manufacturing classics. Even Federer and Nadal never topped their five-setters at Wimbledon in 2008 and the Australian Open in 2009. Over the following eight years, they would only meet in one major final.What might be next for Sinner and Alcaraz, and what might put an extra edge into their rivalry in 2026? One thing that has surprised me so far is that they have yet to create feuding fan bases‚Äîor, if they have, I haven't found them. That was a major element of every Big 3 match: You knew, whenever they met, that it was life or death for millions of fans who loved their guy, and detested the guy across the net.

With Federer versus Nadal, and then with both of them versus Djokovic, there was always a king vs. usurper dynamic. Federer gracefully dominated for two years, before his polar opposite, the teenaged, muscle-bound Nadal, dared to challenge him. Then, just as they had won over the world with their tear-filled epics, along came Djokovic to crash the party. The fan resentment never abated.Alcaraz and Sinner, who emerged at roughly the same time, lack that dynamic; neither is a rightful king or a usurper. Can these two nice and generally humble guys inspire the kind of loyalty, and the kind of hatred, that the Big 3 did?If not, we may miss it, or we may not. For now, as these two books ably relate, we're lucky to have two worthy heirs to the throne. Hopefully, we'll never get bored of their brilliance.

The Austrian is set to crack the Top 90 after winning a maiden main-draw match at his home ATP 500 event.ByFlorian HeerPublished Oct 24, 2025 copy_link

Filip Misolic experienced a week of highs and lows at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna.The 24-year-old Austrian celebrated his first-ever main-draw victory at his home ATP 500 tournament, defeating Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli, 7‚Äì5, 7‚Äì6 (6), in a hard-fought opening match. But his run ended in the second round against Australia's Alex de Minaur, the world No. 7, leaving Misolic with mixed emotions‚Äîproud of his progress, but aware of how small the margins are at the top of the game.

Against Carabelli, Misolic made a dream start, racing to a 4‚Äì0 lead with two early breaks before the Argentine battled back to level the score. The Austrian held firm under pressure, saving break points at 4‚Äì4 and 5‚Äì5, and clinched the first set with his first opportunity at 6‚Äì5. The second set remained on serve throughout, leading to a dramatic tie-break filled with spectacular rallies. After two hours and 16 minutes of play, Misolic converted his second match point to seal a milestone victory‚Äîhis first-ever appearance in the round of 16 at the Erste Bank Open.‚ÄúThis win means a lot to me,‚Äù Misolic said afterwards. ‚ÄúIt's a beautiful feeling to experience this at home. I was really nervous at the beginning‚Äîwhen I led 4‚Äì0, I thought, this can't be so easy. Then it got more complicated, but with the energy from the crowd, I managed to push through. I felt like I could play ten more sets. Overall, it was a solid performance.‚Äù

His second-round opponent, however, proved to be a much tougher challenge. Against de Minaur, early breaks in both sets set the tone for the match. The Australian broke Misolic's serve in the very first game‚Äîa grueling ten-minute battle‚Äîand repeated the feat early in the second set to take full control. Misolic had three break points at 2‚Äì3 but was unable to convert, and de Minaur closed out the match efficiently.‚ÄúEven though I lost, there are many positive moments I'll take from this match,‚Äù Misolic reflected. ‚ÄúPlaying against a Top 10 player in front of the Vienna crowd is an honor. It's tough when you get broken right away, it changes the rhythm. I had three break chances in one game, but at this level, it's the small details that make the difference.‚ÄùDespite the defeat, Misolic's performance in Vienna marked another important career step. The 50 ATP ranking points he earned will move him into the Top 90 for the first time‚Äîa significant milestone that could secure him a spot in the main draw of the 2026 Australian Open.

2025 Mexico City Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Norris regrets paucity of 'perfect weekends' but feels he's 'where I need to be'

Max Verstappen has rapidly closed in on Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in the title fight ‚Äì but what does the data say about the Red Bull driver's championship prospects?

With five rounds remaining in the 2025 season, the battle for the Drivers' Championship has been rapidly heating up.

Much focus has surrounded the increased threat posed by Max Verstappen, with the Dutchman's recent strong run of form seeing him close the gap to leader Oscar Piastri down to just 40 points, while Piastri's McLaren team mate Lando Norris is only 14 points adrift in second.

Four-time World Champion Verstappen admitted after his latest win in Austin that ‚Äúthe chance is there‚Äù for him to claim a fifth consecutive title, adding: ‚ÄúWe just need to try to deliver these weekends to the end of the year, so yeah, we'll at least try whatever we can.‚Äù

But would another streak of similar results for Verstappen until the end of the season ‚Äì as well as a repeat in recent form for Piastri and Norris ‚Äì be enough to secure him the title? And what does Piastri need to do to defend his lead and seal a maiden championship?

Well, we've been delving into the data to find out‚Ä¶

Verstappen has triumphed in three of the last four Grands Prix, a pattern that he will be hoping to extend into the final five rounds of the campaign. Looking at his chances based on past success, the Dutchman has form at each of the upcoming tracks, having scored five wins in Mexico City, three in Sao Paulo, one in Las Vegas, two in Qatar and four in Abu Dhabi.

That makes for a total of 15 victories across these tracks. Throw in a win at the 2023 Sao Paulo Sprint and the statistics make for even more impressive reading ‚Äì and perhaps ominous for his rivals.

Let's say that Verstappen takes to the top step at every remaining race ‚Äì along with the two remaining Sprints ‚Äì but that championship leader Piastri finishes each event in second, with Norris in third. In this scenario, Piastri would clinch the title on a total of 450 points ‚Äì by a margin of just three points from Verstappen, while Norris would have a deficit of 31 points.

In terms of his own record at the next five circuits, Piastri's only two Sprint victories were achieved in Qatar, while his best finish in Mexico has been a P8.

As for Norris, the Briton took victory in last year's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, plus the Sao Paulo Sprint in 2024. His own best result at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez was a second place, also achieved last season.

Given that the championship fight arguably took its greatest turn after F1 returned from its summer break in August ‚Äì with the five rounds since seeing Verstappen embark on his promising run ‚Äì we also looked at the data based on each of the title protagonists' average scores across these races.

Across these five weekends in Zandvoort, Monza, Baku, Singapore and Austin, Piastri took victory in the Dutch Grand Prix before claiming P2 at the Italian race one week later. He has since finished off the podium at each of the three events since, giving him an average score of 12.4 since the summer break.

Norris' average result from these five rounds, meanwhile, comes in at 11.4, while Verstappen's ranks at 23.8. As such, the data shows that if each driver continued to score that figure (rounded to the nearest whole number) at each of the upcoming weekends, Verstappen would have 426 points by the end of the campaign, meaning that he would be crowned World Champion by 20 points from Piastri, with Norris 39 points adrift of the top spot in third.

From the last five rounds on the calendar, Verstappen's average finish is 3.3, while Norris' is 5.9 and Piastri's stands at 7.6.

Needless to say, the McLaren duo will be keen to turn this around as soon as possible ‚Äì and it will be fascinating to see how the results really play out‚Ä¶

2025 Mexico City Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Norris regrets paucity of 'perfect weekends' but feels he's 'where I need to be'

Formula 1 is racing at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez for the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend.

Formula 1 has headed straight to Mexico City from Austin as the 2025 season continues to move towards its conclusion, and our F1 TV team are here to preview all the action from the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriquez.

First up is the title fight, with Max Verstappen very firmly in the mix following his stunning win in Austin last time out. He is now just 40 points behind Oscar Piastri in the Championship, and the Aussie has it all to do to find some form.

But while Piastri searches for answers, Lando Norris searches for points - he is now just 14 points behind his team mate, in what is looking like a three-way fight all the way to Abu Dhabi this year.

Elsewhere, Charles Leclerc is looking to back up his podium from Texas, while Lewis Hamilton also believes he can continue his momentum from Austin with a strong showing here.

Hit go on the video player above to join Laura Winter, James Hinchcliffe, Chris Medland and Ruth Buscombe as they run through these talking points and plenty more ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix.

2025 Mexico City Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Norris regrets paucity of 'perfect weekends' but feels he's 'where I need to be'

Max Verstappen's victory in Austin has closed the points gap behind championship leader Oscar Piastri to just 40 points, and a three-way battle for the title is well and truly on...

When Max Verstappen stood on the Zandvoort podium in second, fresh from the summer break and in front of his home fans, the Dutchman felt like the result was a ""really good achievement"" for his Red Bull team.

It was the first time he had been on a Grand Prix podium since Canada back in June ‚Äì and while he had a Sprint win to his name in Belgium during that period ‚Äì as he left the Netherlands 104 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri, there was an increasing feeling that a fifth title in a row would be a step too far, even for a driver of his immense talent.

But since that day in Zandvoort, Verstappen has won three of the last four Grands Prix ‚Äì and finished second in the other. As he ticked each of those achievements off, he wasn't keen to entertain any chat about his title chances.

2025 Mexico City Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Norris regrets paucity of 'perfect weekends' but feels he's 'where I need to be'

Ferrari stopped development earlier than its rivals, but has managed to keep pace and return to the podium through Charles Leclerc last time out in Austin. While limiting expectations for the remaining races, Lewis Hamilton believes the team is on the 'right path' to achieve strong results in the future.

Charles Leclerc took his first podium since Belgium at last week's United States Grand Prix, but has moved to limit expectations of further successes this season.

Leclerc's top-three finish in Austin was his and Ferrari's sixth of the season, with five of this number coming for third-place finishes, and the other for a second place in Monaco.

‚ÄúI am not surprised by the fact we are missing a bit more performance going throughout the end of the year, especially considering that probably Mercedes and Red Bull are two of the teams that pushed their development a bit later than other teams,‚Äù said Leclerc.

‚ÄúIf we look at the gap compared to the McLaren, it remained kind of the same. For us, we are more focused about next year, which I hope will help us.

‚ÄúBut it was a very positive weekend. Whether from now on we can consistently fight for a podium, I think it is a long shot, but I will try to make this happen again this weekend.‚Äù

Having stopped development at an early stage, Ferrari have sought to make gains through improved procedures and set-up, with Leclerc adding of the Austin podium: ‚ÄúIt has been a long time, and it's good for everybody in the team to finally see a little bit of improvement.‚Äù

Although still searching for his first podium in Ferrari colours, Lewis Hamilton equalled his best result for the season with a fourth-place finish at the Circuit of The Americas, a result he had last achieved at Silverstone.

Following the race, Hamilton said, ‚ÄúI'm finally feeling like I'm on top of the car,‚Äù with plenty of positives taken from the weekend.

Arriving in Mexico, the seven-time World Champion was still riding high, saying: ‚ÄúComing from a positive weekend... I'm confident that this weekend, we can try to do the same again. I think we're on the right path.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI feel like we're going in the right direction, and I think ‚Äì Rome wasn't built in a day, so it takes time to build. For me, coming into the team, I've wanted to be respectful of the way that they've done things in the past, and just to really observe and see where our strengths and where our weaknesses are, and to highlight where our weaknesses are and areas to work on.

‚ÄúBut I do feel that they have been responding. I think you're starting to see some of the impact of the work that we're doing in the background.‚Äù

2025 Mexico City Grand Prix: Weekend Warm-Up

Norris regrets paucity of 'perfect weekends' but feels he's 'where I need to be'

Marking 10 years since its return, the Mexico City Grand Prix has evolved into one of Formula 1's most playful weekends. Blending sport, culture and celebration, it's a race where local pride and global spectacle collide ‚Äì and one of the only races where the energy and noise of the crowd can overpower the roar of the engines.

Ten years after its triumphant return to the Formula 1 calendar, the Mexico City Grand Prix has become the sport's ultimate fiesta ‚Äì a celebration of speed, culture and national pride.

When F1 returned to the Autodromo Hermanos Rodr√≠guez in 2015, it reignited a love affair between Mexico and motorsport that had been waiting a generation to burst back into life. What began as a revival quickly grew into one of the most anticipated events on the schedule for both drivers and fans.

The event has taken on a character all its own. From the roar inside the Foro Sol stadium to the streets alive with music, colour and marigolds, the Mexico City Grand Prix has evolved into more than a race weekend. It has become a festival that has captured the heart of the entire nation and, a decade on, the fiesta shows no signs of slowing down.

Once the home of baseball and still host to blockbuster concerts, Foro Sol now bears witness to some of the most climactic moments in F1, turning the stadium into something entirely its own.

Built in the early 1990s to host the Diablos Rojos del Mexico baseball team, Foro Sol quickly became part of the city's identity. Madonna, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones ‚Äì many of the world's biggest names have rocked its stage. Peace and quiet have never really been in Foro Sol's nature!

It was entirely fitting then, when F1 returned in 2015 after more than two decades away, that organisers and circuit designers recognised the potential of the stadium. By routing the track through the old baseball diamond, they created an arena where the sport could meet the fans up close.

Now the Foro Sol grandstands hold thousands of spectators each race weekend. It was never built for F1 racing, yet it feels as though it always belonged to it. The roar, the colour, the emotion ‚Äì Foro Sol lifts the Grand Prix to another level, and it's now impossible to imagine the race without it.

When F1 arrives in Mexico City, the entire capital shifts gears. Streets that are usually thick with weekday traffic start to buzz with colour and music. Around the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, the energy is constant. Fans in team shirts spill out of metro stations, singing, waving flags, buying tacos from street vendors who have doubled their grills for the weekend.

But the celebration does not stop at the circuit gates; it flows into every corner of the capital. In the city centre, rooftop bars host lively watch parties, murals are refreshed with racing themes, and markets glow with marigold garlands in the lead-up to the Day of the Dead celebrations.

Locals and visitors drift between art, music and mezcal, sharing the same electric rhythm that defines race week. The city feels alive in every sense, and everyone wants to be part of it.

F1 has long been a source of pride in Mexico, a country whose passion for speed and spirit helped shape the sport's early story. The then-named Mexican Grand Prix debuted in 1963 at the Magdalena Mixhuca Circuit, before the venue was later renamed Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in honour of local motorsport heroes Ricardo and Pedro Rodriguez.

Their fearless talent and success on the world stage quickly morphed the Rodriguez brothers into national heroes. In 1961, at just 19 years old, Ricardo stunned the motorsport world when he became the youngest driver to race for Ferrari. His record stood for more than six decades before it was broken by Ollie Bearman, who stepped in as a replacement driver for Ferrari last year when Carlos Sainz suffered with appendicitis.

Ricardo passed away in a fatal crash a year later on home soil, and the torch was passed to his brother, Pedro. The older brother went on to claim Mexico's first F1 Grand Prix win at the 1967 South African Grand Prix. In a cruel twist of fate, Pedro also died in an accident in 1971 during a race in West Germany.

Together they redefined what levels of success were possible for home-grown Mexican drivers, inspiring generations who still feel their influence today. The circuit that bears their name remains a living tribute to their lasting legacy.

For today's fans, that same pride lives on through Sergio 'Checo' Perez. The Guadalajara-born driver has become a national icon, carrying the hopes of a country every time he races at home. From karting in Jalisco to six Grand Prix victories and 39 podiums in F1, his success is a story of perseverance and talent.

Next year, his return to Mexico City with the new Cadillac F1 Team will mark the beginning of a new chapter ‚Äì one that promises to etch his name even deeper into F1 history.

In Mexico, the fans are a key part of the spectacle, and few destinations do it as thoroughly as they do here. Street vendors outside the circuit sell marigold garlands, masks and handmade accessories that soon fill the stands, creating a vibrant patchwork of colour.

Every year, supporters weave their culture into the weekend ‚Äì from sombreros and embroidered shirts to flag capes and painted faces inspired by D√≠a de los Muertos. They wear their identity like a badge of honour, their passion and pride shining through as the grandstands erupt in colour, culture and unmistakable Mexican spirit.

As usual, the paddock leans into the moment, with drivers and teams adding touches of local flair. Charles Leclerc drew headlines last year when he arrived dressed in a traditional mariachi-style outfit, while Daniel Ricciardo has often joined the festivities sporting a sombrero and Day of the Dead-inspired face paint.

Sergio Perez also pays tribute to his roots through custom helmet designs, traditional embroidery and, more recently, a Mexican wrestling mask on race day ‚Äì we can't wait to see what he will bring in 2026.

Few circuits test both man and machine quite like Mexico City. Sitting more than 2km above sea level, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez is the highest track on the calendar. The thin air strains engines, alters aerodynamics and challenges drivers' endurance, so every lap demands precision, rhythm and nerve.

Yet it is the atmosphere that really takes the drivers' breath away. From the moment they arrive, they are surrounded by the roar and excitement of the fans. That sentiment is shared across the grid. During his stint with Sauber Zhou Guanyu summed it up, saying: ‚ÄúThe fans at the track make Mexico so special. You really feel the atmosphere ‚Äì they are very passionate about racing.‚Äù

No one understands that connection more deeply than Perez. ‚ÄúBeing on the podium in your home Grand Prix is something very, very special,‚Äù he said after finishing P3 at the 2021 edition. ‚ÄúI gave my full heart for these people. I could actually hear them when I was going through here,‚Äù he said of the moment he entered the Foro Sol, surrounded by tens of thousands of adoring fans.

Jon Heder, Megan Suri and Natasha Leggero also star in director Todd Berger's movie that hails from Live Nation Studios and features a soundtrack of 1990s tunes.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	A new horror-comedy feature is ready to take a stab at skewering Generation X culture. 


	Director Todd Berger is helming the satirical slasher movie The Big Kill for Live Nation Studios, with production having recently commenced, The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively reveal. The film pays tribute to Gen X and is set to popular 1990s songs. 




	Leading the ensemble cast are such genre favorites as Skeet Ulrich (Five Nights at Freddy's 2), Alicia Witt (Longlegs), Jolene (Star Trek: Enterprise) and Megan Suri (Companion). The cast also includes comedy stars Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite), Pete Holmes (Woman of the Hour), Natasha Leggero (The Do-Over), Morgan Jay (St. Denis Medical), Trevor Wallace (Drugstore June) and Steph Tolev (Tires).

The Big Kill centers on a group of longtime friends and their families as they share a remote cabin following a funeral. When a killer starts hunting the group, the friends are forced to confront the darkest elements of their past.


	Berger (It's a Disaster) helms the film from a script by Emmy-winning Daily Show writer Daniel Radosh. Producers include Live Nation Studios and Mason Novick for MXN Entertainment. Ryan Kroft executive produces for Live Nation Studios.


	‚ÄúHorror plus comedy set to '90s music equals a resounding yes for Live Nation Studios,‚Äù Live Nation Studios head of film and television Kroft says. ‚ÄúWith this fan-favorite cast and phenomenal producing team, The Big Kill is destined to be a horror hit.‚Äù 

	











	Adds Berger, ‚ÄúWhen I saw Scream in the theater as a teenager, it blew me away because it was a slasher movie filled with people my own age, talking the way we actually talked. But then, over the years, I noticed something about the protagonists of slashers ‚Äî they weren't aging like the rest of us. So now, to get to make a horror comedy about fellow Gen Xers with kids and mortgages and ruminations on existential dread, and to do it with an incredibly witty script and amazing cast, is a dream come true.‚Äù 


	Novick says in his own statement, ‚ÄúHorror comedies are one of the toughest genres to land. It's so important to deliver on both the laughs and scares. We're so fortunate to have a cast that is both legacy horror actors and a bunch of really funny comedians, this way we have both great jokes and great kills.‚Äù

The 13-member boy group returned to the L.A. venue less than a year after their last two sold-out shows at the stadium in November 2024. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


Seventeen made a grand return to Los Angeles, performing two nights at L.A.'s BMO Stadium. 


	The 13-member K-pop group ‚Äî consisting of members S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, The 8, Mingyu, DK, Seungkwan, Vernon and Dino ‚Äî is currently performing with nine members. Four members, Jeonghan, Wonwoo, Hoshi and Woozi, are currently carrying out their mandatory military enlistment in South Korea.




	Seventeen, fresh off their 10th anniversary and latest album, Happy Burstday, returned to the U.S. for the New_ Tour, stopping in L.A. on Oct. 16 and 17. The two-night engagement was one of five stops in America; the group began their tour in Korea before heading to Hong Kong. They'll continue on to Japan after they wrap the U.S. leg.

	It was an energetic and non-stop affair, a delight for longtime fans and newcomers alike.  Seventeen, known for their close relationship with their fans, seemed equally delighted to see the screaming crowd. The K-pop group kicked off their show with a display fitting for a runway with different members popping up in pairs to strut around the stage to recent B-side ‚ÄúBad Influence.‚Äù 


	The intro was fitting for many reasons. Several members of Seventeen have made their way into fashion over the last few years ‚Äî Mingyu, for example, is an ambassador for Dior and frequents Calvin Klein campaigns. But ‚ÄúBad Influence‚Äù itself started on the runway. The song, produced by Pharrell Williams, debuted at the Louis Vuitton Men's Fall Winter 2025 runway show; Williams serves as the men's creative director for the luxury fashion house.

	











	The new tour allowed the group to bring recent single, ‚ÄúThunder,‚Äù a highlight of their latest album, along with all of Burstday's B-sides in the form of solo stages. The group spoke with The Hollywood Reporter earlier this year in a digital cover story about the move to include more individual opportunities as this stage of their career.


	‚ÄúWe are standing at a new starting line, preparing for a new path ahead and ready to blaze a new trail,‚Äù the group's overall leader, S.Coups, told THR during that interview.  Added Hoshi, ‚ÄúWe would like to show more of our individualities, each of the members' personalities and capabilities, so that when the time comes and we get back together again as a group, we‚Äòll be able to showcase ourselves as a better Seventeen.‚Äù 


	In addition to the solo songs, Seventeen sprinkled in some of their singles from the last few years, ‚ÄúHot,‚Äù ‚ÄúRock With You,‚Äù ‚ÄúLove, Money, Fame,‚Äù ‚ÄúDar+ling‚Äù and ‚ÄúF*ck My Life,‚Äù along with some unexpected surprises ‚Äî ‚ÄúA-Teen,‚Äù ‚Äú9Teen‚Äù and ‚Äú20.‚Äù But, of course, no Seventeen show is complete without the Seventeen track ‚Äì ‚ÄúVery Nice.‚Äù


	The song, off the group's first full-length album, was released in 2016 and continues to be a staple for the group. Veteran Carats, the official name for the boy group's fans, know to expect not one, two or even three encores of the song, but typically at least a handful of times. The group also gets fans involved, going down to the barricade to let fans sing a portion of the song. During the Friday night show, the group performed the song a handful of times, along with a repeat of the 2024 track, ‚ÄúEyes on You.‚Äù

	











	Throughout the night, Seventeen noted that they were unsure when they'd be back as a big group; much of the group will join their already enlisted members to complete their mandatory military service in the coming years. The sentiment made the night even more special for the fans in the audience, seeming to cherish the time with the group. 


	Seventeen has made it clear that fans have nothing to worry about in terms of the group's future, however. ‚ÄúWe understand that the fans are very sad that some of us are going to be away, but among ourselves, [we] don't consider this to be a really huge deal because we know that we are going to stay together,‚Äù Woozi previously told THR.  ‚ÄúWe should consider this as quite a long preparation phase for the next album that's going to be even better and greater.‚Äù


	Seventeen's New_ World Tour will continue its U.S. leg with dates in Sunrise, Florida and Washington, D.C. next week.

They've helped fetch Oscars, boosted box office and upstaged their A-list co-stars ‚Äî but these days, Hollywood's animals can't seem to book a gig.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	Rocco may not have booked a film or TV gig in a few years, but he keeps busy. He still picks up the occasional commercial, keeps fit, stays social and spends his days in a bucolic valley about an hour north of Los Angeles. On this unusually breezy afternoon in July, he's messing around with his longtime companion Porter when a new arrival disrupts the calm and things quickly devolve into a chaotic round of chasing and tug-of-war.


	Which is what happens when you introduce a green plush alligator toy to an energetic Saint Bernard-boxer mix.

	Rocco, whose credits include Veronica Mars, Jane the Virgin and The Morning Show, is one of many four-legged actors in the L.A. area who aren't landing Hollywood gigs like they used to. As AI continues to advance, more productions are opting to create animal performances in post rather than film with the real thing ‚Äî a trend that's left trainers, wranglers and animal coordinators increasingly anxious about the future of their profession.


	‚ÄúIt has certainly impacted the studio animal trainers and the studio animal business already quite a lot,‚Äù says Karin McElhatton, owner of Studio Animal Services, which houses Rocco and scores of other critters, from dozens of cats to a ‚Äúretired squirrel‚Äù to a duck named Bob, supplying animal talent for productions like Ghostbusters, L.A. Confidential and CSI: Miami. AI isn't the only challenge: The fallout from COVID, the 2023 strikes and the overall contraction of the entertainment business also have hit hard. But some in the field fear virtual animals could be the final blow.

	A few dozen miles south, Benay Karp is also seeing a downturn. The owner of Benay's Bird & Animal Rentals, she estimates the number of jobs her animals are getting is down to just 40 percent of what it was pre-pandemic. Karp specializes in small wildlife and birds, though most of her work comes from dogs and cats. Her feathered performers have appeared in Mirror Mirror and she supplied all the animals for years on Grace and Frankie. ‚ÄúI don't think I've had a call for a woodpecker in probably three or four years, maybe five years. I have a flock of seagulls. I think I've only gotten one job for them in the last year, where they used to work all the time.‚Äù


	Wild animals ‚Äî lions, bears, wolves ‚Äî have long worked less frequently than their domesticated peers. Scripts don't incorporate these animals as frequently as others, safety risks are top of mind and they increasingly have been phased out thanks to pressure from animal welfare groups. But even the industry's most bankable species ‚Äî dogs and cats ‚Äî aren't getting the work they once did. Gone are the days of Lassie, Rin Tin Tin or Chris, the Saint Bernard mix who starred in Beethoven. In 2020's Call of the Wild, Harrison Ford's co-star, Buck, was a computer-generated dog based on a real canine. And in this year's Superman, the sidekick pup Krypto was a digital version of director James Gunn's own dog, Ozu, scanned for the role.

	











	Even horses could be under threat. While some filmmakers still insist on the real thing ‚Äî especially in Westerns and period pieces ‚Äî trainers say even equine work could eventually be outsourced to visual effects. ‚ÄúIn Secretariat, we had five [horses] that made up the same horse, and I would literally hand-paint them to match [one another],‚Äù says wrangler and animal trainer Lisa Brown. ‚ÄúNow, I don't know why in the future they just couldn't digitally do it more cost-effectively.‚Äù


	Not everyone is mourning the shift. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has long pushed to eliminate real animals from film and television sets, arguing that making them work for human entertainment is cruel and exploitative.


	Lauren Thomasson, director of the organization's film and TV division, points to tech-heavy projects like Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and Mufasa as models of progress. ‚ÄúWe know that AI can be used like all technologies for good or for harm,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIn this case, this is one way AI can be used for a really good thing, which is ending the suffering of animals in the entertainment industry.‚Äù


	But animal experts in the business argue that something is lost when performances are fabricated rather than filmed. Real animals, they say, bring a kind of visceral, emotional truth that can't be faked ‚Äî no matter how advanced the tech.

	











	Bonnie Judd, an animal coordinator based in British Columbia, says she hasn't experienced the same drop-off in demand as some of her U.S.-based peers, and she's not as worried for the future, believing authenticity still matters. Judd recalls a pivotal death scene in 2019's A Dog's Journey with her canine star Belle: ‚ÄúI tell the dog to close her eyes as the camera dollies in on her face, and the whole studio is bawling their eyes out,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou don't get that emotion with AI.‚Äù


	Back at Studio Animal Services, Rocco and Porter, a handsome golden retriever, are eventually coaxed away from their favorite toys. A cluster of trainers wave treats, drawing the pair toward a particularly photogenic spot between a pair of large succulents. Right on cue, they pose for the camera, tongues wagging, eyes locked on the reward.


	Still working. Just not quite like they used to.

The international partnership deal follows an earlier TV licensing and distribution pact between the Canadian media player and Fox Entertainment Global.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Tubi, Fox Corp.'s ad-supported streamer, is spreading its wings in Canada by striking a content distribution and ad sales pact with Bell Media.


	The strategic partnership includes plans to co-develop original content for distribution on Tubi globally, across Bell Media platforms in Canada, and through Sphere Abacus, Bell Media's international content distribution arm. Bell Media will also serve as the exclusive Canadian ad sales partner for Tubi, while its own ad-supported FAST channels will launch on the Fox streaming platform in Canada.

	‚ÄúBringing Bell Media and Tubi together is a powerful growth partnership that furthers many of Bell Media's key areas of focus: increasing opportunities for advertisers to reach Canadian consumers alongside premium digital video, expanding digital distribution for our content, and collaborating with strategic partners on globally resonant storytelling,‚Äù Bell Media president Sean Cohan said in a statement.


	The Tubi deal in a turbulent Canadian TV market where viewers continue to shift to streaming platforms builds on an earlier licensing and distribution pact between Bell Media and Fox Entertainment Global, the international distribution arm of the U.S. network, and Neshama Entertainment. The first series to emerge from that pact is the drama Prejudice, from creator and showrunner Celeste Parr and with Emily VanCamp attached to star.


	That development deal sees the Canadian company and Fox partner on local originals for Bell Media's CTV network and Crave streaming platform that in turn land on the Fox network in the U.S. market. Fox Entertainment handles global distribution of the Canadian originals.

	











	The expanded content distribution pacts allow Fox, Tubi and Bell Media to share the costs and risks on TV series to be shot in Canada and that tap local tax credits and currency savings. The series will then land on linear TV and streaming platforms on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border.


	Tubi as an ad-backed streamer is a growing player in an increasingly crowded Canadian streaming TV space where Bell Media and other local media players face increasing competition from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other U.S. digital services.


	For its part, Bell Media has a minority stake in Montreal-based indie producer Sphere Media and has content development pacts with Elliot Page's Pageboy Productions, Seth Rogen's Point Grey Pictures, Lionsgate and others.

‚ÄúI'm just too excited for y'all to see the new episodes,‚Äù the actor and racing driver wrote in a post on X.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Frankie Muniz is celebrating his TV family's reunion in the upcoming Malcolm in the Middle reboot.


	The actor and racing driver shared a behind-the-scenes photo from the set of the revival, alongside his onscreen brothers Justin Berfield and Christopher Masterson (aka Malcolm's older brothers, Reese and Francis).




	‚ÄúI was told not to post this yet, but then I remembered the theme song,‚Äù Muniz wrote. ‚ÄúI'm just too excited for y'all to see the new episodes and I miss my brothers.‚Äù

I was told not to post this yet, but then I remembered the theme song. I'm just too excited for y'all to see the new episodes and I miss my brothers. pic.twitter.com/LT2aXgsAOK


	The caption served as a slight reference to the original Malcolm in the Middle theme song, entitled ‚ÄúBoss Of Me‚Äù from They Might Be Giants, which includes the recurring lyric, ‚ÄúYou're not the boss of me now!‚Äù 

	











	When news of the reboot, titled Malcolm in the Middle: Life's Still Unfair, was announced last December, it was further revealed that  Bryan Cranston and Jane Kaczmarek, who portrayed Muniz's parents in the series, were returning to reprise their roles. Berfield and Masteron later signed on to take part in the four-episode Disney+ series, while Kiana Madeira joins to portray Malcolm's (Muniz) girlfriend. 


	Vaughan Murrae, Keeley Karsten and Caleb Ellsworth-Clark are also featured in the cast, with the latter actor notably taking over the role of younger brother Dewey, whom Erik Per Sullivan originated. 

	











	Cranston recently explained why Sullivan wasn't included in the revival cast list. ‚ÄùI talked to Erik and I said, ‚ÄòHey, we got the show! It's gonna come back.' He goes, ‚ÄòOh, that's fantastic!' And I go, ‚ÄòYeah, so we're looking forward to having you back.' He goes, ‚ÄòOh, no, no, I don't want to do it. But it's fantastic that you are,'‚Äù Cranston said during a June appearance on the Fly on the Wall podcast.


	‚ÄúHe's actually going to Harvard,‚Äù he added of Sullivan. ‚ÄúHe's really, really smart, and I think he's getting his master's at Harvard right now. He said, ‚ÄòOh God, no, I haven't acted since I was nine or something. So I'm not into it.'‚Äù


Malcolm in the Middle ran from 2000-2006, and picked up a total of seven Emmys. While reflecting on what filming the revival meant to him, the show's star Muniz said he ‚Äúloved‚Äù the experience. 


	‚ÄúI'm not exaggerating when I say filming this reboot, like I loved it so much, way more than I ever thought I could have,‚Äù he said during a September podcast appearance. ‚ÄúI think people will be surprised, in a sense, where everybody is and the story. But it's only four episodes‚Ä¶ It's hard to fit in 20 years of stuff into four 30-minute episodes, right? But I think people are going to be very happy with what they came up with.‚Äù


	Linwood Boomer, the creator of Malcolm in the Middle, is also returning as writer and executive producer. Cranston will also serve as an EP alongside Tracy Katsky of KatCo, Gail Berman, director Ken Kwapis and New Regency's Arnon Milchan, Yariv Milchan and Natalie Lehmann. Jimmy Simons and Laura Delahaye are co-executive producing.

The Puerto Rican superstar and Hollywood legend even danced briefly to ""Baile Inolvidable.""

Bad Bunny was recognized Thursday (Oct. 23) as the Top Latin Artist of the 21st Century at the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Awards, in one of the ceremony's most emotional moments.

Rita Moreno, the nonagenarian Puerto Rican Hollywood legend, surprised Bad Bunny on stage by presenting him with the trophy. ‚ÄúToday I see an artist who brings to the entire world that same strength, that same passion that helped me never give up,‚Äù Moreno remarked, as Bad Bunny looked on from the audience. ‚ÄúIt moves me from the bottom of my heart, Benito, to present you with the Billboard Latin Artist of the 21st Century Award, Bad Bunny!‚ÄùThe prestigious honor is based on his unparalleled achievements on Billboard's Top Latin Albums and Hot Latin Songs charts throughout the first 25 years of the century. As he went up to accept his award, the two danced briefly together to the rhythm of ‚ÄúBaile Inolvidable,‚Äù creating a magical moment.

	‚ÄúI respect you a lot, I admire you a lot, wow,‚Äù Bad Bunny told Moreno. ‚ÄúFollowing your words, every time I hear other artists express themselves that way about me, it gives me the confidence that being myself and doing the things I do from the heart will always be a great decision, because that's what I've done since day one, discovering who I am and what I represent.‚Äù


	‚ÄúI accept this award with pride because I know how hard I've worked, not only myself, but everyone on my team,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI'm aware that this award could have been for any of the artists here tonight who have also contributed to Latin music, who have inspired me, who are why I'm here, and those who are dreaming of being here. I will always identify with those artists because I consider myself a young man who continues to dream, with many goals and things to do.‚Äù

	











	He added: ‚ÄúWhat I'm saying now, I'm saying from the heart. I didn't have any practiced words. I still don't understand, among so many artists, why me? But I'm grateful. This is yours because you have me here. I don't know, God wanted me to receive it because it doesn't feed my ego. I receive it without arrogance, very humbly, and I will remain the same.‚Äù


	The excitement had begun moments earlier, when, after the presentation video was shown, Los Pleneros de la Cresta appeared singing their hit collaboration ‚ÄúCaf√© con Ron‚Äù in the halls of the James L. Knight Center in Miami ‚Äî from where the show was airing live via Telemundo. 


	With historic consistency, the multi-platinum Puerto Rican superstar has shattered records in Latin music on the Billboard charts and beyond. His last four albums ‚Äî Deb√≠ Tirar M√°s Fotos (2025), Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma√±ana (2023), Un Verano Sin Ti (2022), and El √öltimo Tour del Mundo (2020) ‚Äî have all earned unprecedented No. 1s on the all-genre Billboard 200. Beyond the charts, Bad Bunny's recent concert series at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico marked a milestone by breaking records for its magnitude and economic impact.


	He has become a cultural icon, breaking barriers in fashion, film, and music ‚Äî from co-chairing the Met Gala to collaborating with soccer megastar Lionel Messi on a groundbreaking Adidas partnership ‚Äî as well as starring in film projects alongside acclaimed directors and actors.


	Bad Bunny graces the cover of Billboard‚Äòs October Issue 14. He will also be the first Latin-American male solo artist to headline the Super Bowl Halftime Show in February 2026.

	At the stroke of midnight, Bruce Springsteen shared Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition (via Sony Music), a treasure chest stuffed with previously unseen and unheard cuts. It's the stuff of fans' dreams.

	Released both digitally and as a five-disc box set, Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition gathers solo outtakes from back in the day, and the fabled ‚ÄúElectric Nebraska‚Äù sessions; a newly-shot performance film of Nebraska in its entirety; a recently-released version of ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù, recorded back in April 1982 with Springsteen backed by Max Weinberg and Garry Tallent; plus a 2025 remaster of the original album.

	











	‚ÄúWe threw out the keyboards and played basically as a three-piece,‚Äù Springsteen reflects of the unearthed ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù cut, a song penned during the Nebraska era. ‚ÄúIt was kinda like punk rockabilly. We were trying to bring ‚ÄòNebraska' into the electric world.‚Äù




	In a separate promo video accompanying the release, Springsteen admits he's often asked about ‚ÄúElectric Nebraska,‚Äù which features Tallent, Weinberg, Danny Federici, Roy Bittan and Stevie Van Zandt. ‚ÄúThere is no ‚ÄòElectric Nebraska'. It doesn't exist,‚Äù he says, thinking out loud. 


	Wrong. 


	He checked, revisited the vault. ‚ÄúThere it was,‚Äù he remarks. ‚ÄúAnd radically different than anything I'd remembered.‚Äù


	The album was pushed back a week to coincide with the cinematic rollout of Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere. Directed by Scott Cooper and released through 20th Century Studios, the biopic chronicles the making of Springsteen's Nebraska, and served as the opening film at AFI Fest in Hollywood on Wednesday.


	Springsteen was on hand for a brief performance inside the TCL Chinese Theater after the screening, according to The Hollywood Reporter, where he thanked guests for ‚Äúsupporting our movie‚Äù and quipped ‚Äúthis is my last night in the movie business, I'm sticking to music.‚Äù


	The Rock And Roll Hall of Fame-inducted artist used the opportunity speak out once more against Donald Trump, offering up a ‚Äúprayer‚Äù for ‚Äúno kings‚Äù in his speech. ‚ÄúI've spent 50 years traveling as kind of a musical ambassador for America and I've seen firsthand all the love and admiration that folks around the world have had for the America of our highest ideals. Despite how terribly damaging America has been recently, that country and those ideals remain worth fighting for. I want to send this out as a prayer for America, for our unity. No kings,‚Äù he remarked, before hitting a rendition of ‚ÄúLand of Hope and Dreams.‚Äù

Tame Impala's 'Deadbeat' is the highest charting new release on the ARIA Albums Chart.


													By
												

	Lars Brandle



	Australia's latest chart week was pitched as a fight of two heavyweights. In one corner, Taylor Swift's incumbent, The Life Of A Showgirl (via Republic/Universal). And in the other, Tame Impala's long-awaited Deadbeat (Columbia/Sony).

	When the results were called, Swift's Showgirl had packed enough glitter to retain the crown, and nab another chart double.

The Life Of A Showgirl retains top spot on the ARIA Albums Chart for a third successive week. According to ARIA, nine of her 14 leaders have logged at least three cycles at the summit, including Red (three weeks), 1989 (nine weeks), Lover (three weeks), Folklore (four weeks), Evermore (four weeks), Midnights (16 weeks), 1989 (Taylor's Version) (14 weeks) and The Tortured Poets Department (eight weeks).


Kevin Parker slides in at No. 2 on the national chart with Deadbeat, the first new album release in five years from his psychedelic pop project, Tame Impala.


	All five of Tame Impala's studio albums have cracked the top 5 in Australia starting with Innerspeaker (from 2010) and Lonerism (2012), both of which peaked at No. 4. Tame Impala's last two albums, Currents (2015) and The Slow Rush (2020), went all the way to No. 1.


Deadbeat is the best-selling title this week on vinyl.


Tame Impala has won 13 ARIA Awards, one BRIT Award, a Grammy, and belatedly cracked the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time earlier this month with Deadbeat single ‚ÄúDracula.‚Äù On the current ARIA Singles Chart, ‚ÄúDracula‚Äù sinks its teeth in for a No. 40 start. Only one Tame Impala song has charted higher in Australia, ‚ÄúThe Less I Know The Better,‚Äù which reached No. 17 in 2015. ‚ÄúDracula‚Äù is the only new release, and only homegrown title, in the top 50. 

	











	Staying with the national albums survey, published Friday, Oct. 24, Aussie heartthrob Ruel debuts at No. 6 with Kicking My Feet (Virgin Music Group/Universal), his third appearance in the top 10; and London indie band The Last Dinner Party enters the top tier for the first time with From The Pyre (Island/Universal), new at No. 7.


	Western Australia's The Southern River Band open their account at No. 16 with Easier Said Than Done (Orchard), for their appearance on the chart. The rockers are added to the lineup of the support acts for AC/DC's stadium concerts this December in Perth, produced by TEG Van Egmond.


	Several other local artists make a splash on the ARIA top 40, including Melbourne rock band Camp Cope (Live At Sydney Opera House at No. 20 via PCR), singer-songwriter Wilsn (Bloom at No. 31 via Mushroom), and country singer Andrew Swift (Lucky Stars at No. 33 via ABC/Orchard), while internationals Sabaton (Legends at No. 14 via BNM/MGM) and Ashnikko (Smoochies at No. 15 via WUK/Warner) make their mark.


	It's all about Taylor Swift on the ARIA Singles Chart, too, as ‚ÄúThe Fate Of Ophelia‚Äù holds at No. 1 for a third week. It's one of four Showgirl songs in the top 10, though ‚ÄúOpalite‚Äù (down 2-4), ‚ÄúElizabeth Taylor‚Äù (down 5-7) and ‚ÄúFather Figure‚Äù (down 6-8) are losing their grip.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


The Victorious spinoff Hollywood Arts starring Daniella Monet, reprising her role as Trina Vega, is moving forward ‚Äî and moving to a new home. The multi-camera sitcom, which was developed at Nickelodeon, where it was put on fast track in early 2025, has been licensed to Netflix, which has ordered 26 episodes.


Hollywood Arts will premiere on the global streamer in 2026 before a second-window release on Nickelodeon and sibling Paramount+ (likely day and date). 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The sale to Netflix is believed to be a recent development after the August completion of the Skydance-Paramount merger, which resulted in the departure of longtime Nickelodeon chief Brian Robbins among other top executive exits.

	As Deadline reported in February, Victorious creator Dan Schneider, who parted ways with Nickelodeon in 2018, has no involvement in Hollywood Arts. The followup to the popular 2010 sitcom, which ran on Nickelodeon for four seasons, comes from writers/showrunners Jake Farrow ‚Äî who was a writer-producer on both Victorious and offshoot Sam & Cat and also voiced Robbie's puppet Rex Powers on Victorious ‚Äî and Samantha Martin (Nick's Henry Danger and The Fairly OddParents: Fairly Odder).


	By February, casting on Hollywood Arts had already started, and Nickelodeon assembled the cast before the series was taken to Netflix, I hear. In addition to Monet, who also executive produces, it includes Alyssa Miles (Hanging out with Alyssa and Xavier), Emmy Liu-Wang (Raven's Home), Peyton Jackson (Young Dylan), Erika Swayze (School Spirits), and Martin Kamm (Unsung Hero). Yvette Nicole Brown (Community) is set to guest star.

	











	It is unclear yet whether other original cast members, notably lead Victoria Justice and Wicked star Ariana Grande, would appear on Hollywood Arts. It would make sense for Justice to reprise her role as Tori Vega, Trina's younger sister.


	In the new series, struggling actress Trina Vega (Daniella Monet) returns to her former high school, Hollywood Arts, as an unqualified substitute teacher, quickly finding herself both clashing with and unexpectedly inspiring a new generation of ambitious and talented students as they learn to find their true path at Hollywood's most elite performing arts school. 


Hollywood Arts held its first table read Oct. 14 with production underway in Vancouver, Canada. You can see photos from the table read above.


	Originally developed and produced by Nickelodeon, Hollywood Arts will now be produced by Paramount Television Studios. The newly revived post-merger TV studio encompasses the slates of Skydance Television and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios as well as Awesomeness series and Nickelodeon's live-action shows.


	Taking in Hollywood Arts makes sense for Netflix. The platform currently carries Seasons 1-3 of Victorious, which Netflix says has amassed over 45M views on the streamer since the beginning of 2024.


	Launching a successful original teen sitcom has been a challenge for Netflix amid an overall struggle for original multi-camera comedies on streaming. Netflix got some traction with Alexa & Katie while other efforts, such as No Good Nick and Team Kaylie, faced quick cancellation. The streamer does have hits in the tween and teen space, including movie juggernaut KPop Demon Hunters and ongoing series XO, Kitty, produced by Paramount TV Studios, Geek Girl, My Life With the Walter Boys and A Good Girl's Guide to Murder. 


	Netflix has had a string of collaborations with Nickelodeon over the past decade through different regimes on both sides, including a major 2019 output deal for original films and TV series based on Nickelodeon IP. The streamer has Avatar: The Last Airbender, a live-action show based on the beloved Nick animated series.


	And, as part of Paramount's windowing strategy, Nick sitcoms That Girl Lay Lay and Erin & Aaron got a second run on Netflix in the U.S., with the streamer debuting the shows internationally.


	A revival of another Dan Schneider sitcom for Nickelodeon, iCarly, recently ran on Paramount+ for three seasons. New Paramount leadership's motives to license Hollywood Arts to Netflix instead of keeping it in-house on Nickelodeon and Paramount+ ‚Äî or taking the first run and offering Netflix second window ‚Äî are not entirely clear but the strategy shift will bring in sizable revenue. Additionally, comedy is not a priority as Paramount+'s original slate is being rebuilt under the new leadership.


Hollywood Arts is executive produced by Monet, Farrow, Martin and director Jonathan Judge (The Really Loud House, My Weird School). The first episode is written by Farrow and Martin and will be directed by Judge. Production of the series is overseen by Nickelodeon's Shauna Phelan, EVP, Live Action Series, and Brian Banks, Executive in Charge of Production.‚ÄúComing back as Trina alongside such a dynamic, powerful cast of newcomers is something I feel very lucky and grateful to do,‚Äù Monet said. ‚ÄúVictorious was in a lot of ways life changing for all of us, our cast is forever bonded by that experience, and to think that I have an opportunity to steward anything close to that is a feeling I can't begin to describe. As an actress, producer, and mom, I am so eager to create something we can all be proud to share with the world.‚Äù


Victorious follows teenager Tori Vega (Justice), as she navigates her way through the prestigious performing arts high school Hollywood Arts, alongside her older sister Trina (Monet) and other talented students, Andre Harris (Leon Thomas III), Robbie Shapiro (Matt Bennett), Jade West (Elizabeth Gillies), Cat Valentine (Grande) and Beck Oliver (Avan Jogia). The comedy scored solid ratings and earned two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Children's Program.

	











	This is the second Victorious spinoff series following the Victorious/iCarly mashup Sam & Cat, which starred Victorious' Grande as Cat and iCarly‚Äòs Jennette McCurdy as Sam.

	After Deadline broke the news that Michael B. Jordan was in line for the Ricardo Tubbs role in Universal‚Äòs Miami Vice movie being directed by Joseph Kosinksi, the studio now looks to have zeroed in on his partner. Deadline is hearing Austin Butler is in early talks to star as iconic TV detective James ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù Crockett, the character made famous by Don Johnson in Michael Mann's 1980s TV series.


	Sources say it is still early days and no deals are done, but after scheduling was worked out for the  film to shoot later in 2026, Butler is engaging and interested. As for Jordan, his deal to play Tubbs is also early days.

	











	Eric Warren Singer and Dan Gilroy are penning the script. Dylan Clark and Kosinski are producing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Universal had no comment.


	The film is dated for August 6, 2027, and this incarnation will explore the glamour and corruption of mid-1980s Miami, inspired by the pilot episode and first season of the NBC series that would influence the pop culture from fashion to filmmaking.


Miami Vice is based on characters created by Anthony Yerkovich from the series executive produced by Yerkovich and Mann. Singer was the first scribe that originally developed the adaptation with Kosinski. The show rocketed Johnson to pin-up-star status in the role of white-suit-wearing Sonny Crockett, while Philip Michael Thomas played his partner Tubbs.


	If a deal is able to close, add the part to another high-profile role for Butler following his Oscar-nominated work in Elvis, followed by films like Dune: Part Two and most recently Caught Stealing. 












	We will let you know more as this unfolds.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


UPDATED with cause of death: Filipino social media star Emmanuelle ‚ÄòEmman' Atienza, who courted controversy with her lifestyle videos in her native Philippines, has died at her home in L.A. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner confirmed her cause of death as suicide by ligature hanging. She was 19.


	Her death has sparked a raft of condolence messages from fans alongside Filipino celebrities and influencers, such as Bea Borres, Gretchen Fullido and Heart Evangelista, as well as debate over whether she had been a victim of cyberbullying and what role this had played in her death. 

	











	Atienza, who was the daughter of the Filipino TV personality Kim Atienza and Felicia Atienza, a celebrity entrepreneur and fitness guru, had moved to L.A. over the summer.


	Her parents confirmed the news of their daughter's death in a post on Instagram. She is reported to have died on October 22. 


	‚ÄúIt's with deep sadness that we share the unexpected passing of our daughter and sister, Emman,‚Äù read the post. ‚ÄúShe brought so much joy, laughter, and love into our lives and into the lives of everyone who knew her. Emman had a way of making people feel seen and heard, and she wasn't afraid to share her own journey with mental health. Her authenticity helped so many feel less alone.‚Äù


	‚ÄúTo honor Emman's memory, we hope you carry forward the qualities she lived by: compassion, courage, and a little extra kindness in your everyday life.‚ÄùThe post, which was also signed by Atienza's siblings Jose and Eliana, did not reveal the cause of her death.


DEADLINE RELATED VIDEOS:


	Atienza, who had 875,000 follows on TikTok and another 225,000 on Instagram, had a built a profile around her posts vaunting her wealthy lifestyle but also for tackling mental health issues and pushing back against conservative values in the Philippines.


	She found herself in the middle of a media storm in November 2024, after she posted a video of dinner with friends, including Filipino singer Rhaila Tomakin and Miss World Philippines Krishnah Gravidez, in a high-end Japanese restaurant in Manila as they played ‚Äúguess the bill.‚Äù


	The TikTok trend involves friends guessing the bill when they eat out at a restaurant, with the person whose estimate is the closest settling the account.  

	











	The bill at the Japanese restaurant was eventually revealed to be 133,000 Philippine Peso ($2,268). The post sparked a backlash in the Philippines, where the average monthly wage is less than a fifth of that sum. 


	Atienza took the post down and withdrew from social media for a time but hit back in subsequent posts at suggestions that her family's wealth derived from its political connections on her father's side.


	Her recent posts from L.A. had mainly consisted of videos showing her settling into life in the city as well as performing acrobatic feats at outdoor gym spaces and climbing wall centers.

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Detectives Danny Reagan and Lena Silver will be playing the blues around the world after a raft of international buyers bought Boston Blue. The show has its world premiere in Cannes at the MIPCOM market last week. Following the international launch it has sold into over 100 markets, Deadline can reveal.


Donnie Wahlberg reprises his role as Reagan in the Blue Bloods offshoot. His character relocates from NYC to Boston in the series, and Sonequa Martin-Green is his new partner, Lena Silver. The show launched on CBS in the U.S. on October 17 and episodes stream on Paramount+ the day after playing on linear.

	











	The roster of international buyers snapping up the show includes AXN Asia and Coupang Play in Korea. M-Net has acquired it for Africa and Sky for New Zealand. In Europe, Boston Blue has landed at pay-TV giant Sky in German-speaking territories. It is also headed to Play Media in Belgium, Cosmote TV in Greece, S√≠minn in Iceland and beIN in Cyprus and Turkey. Elsewhere, it will be on CTV and in Australia on Paramount+.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Internationally, the procedural format has enduring appeal so hopes were high for Boston Blue, especially as its forebear, Blue Bloods, had established a strong fanbase globally. Quickly getting to 100 territories, however, is at the top end of expectations. The show is sold by Paramount Global Content Distribution, which cut the international deals.


	Wahlberg is an exec producer on the series. In Cannes he talked up the possibility of a Blue Bloods‚ÄìBoston Blue franchise. CBS certainly has form here, with NCIS and other procedurals spawning numerous spinoffs. International sales are key to getting these shows funded and making them profitable and that responsibility falls to Lisa Kramer's PGCD division.


	As well as Wahlberg and Martin-Green, the Boston Blue cast includes Maggie Lawson, Marcus Scribner, Mika Amons, Gloria Reuben and Ernie Hudson. The series is produced by CBS Studios in association with Jerry Bruckheimer Television. Brandon Sonnier and Brandon Margolis are showrunners and exec producers. Bruckheimer, KristieAnne Reed and Wahlberg are also EPs.

	











	Meanwhile, we hear more international deals are in the works for Boston Blue.

The first episode showed a lot of promise. Donnie Wahlberg and Sonequa Martin-Green had good chemistry, and I think I'll enjoy watching them as partners.

The show was
 Good Danny was excellent, but they're making it out like blue blood The family dinner, and I do not like when they replace Sean. They should have had Danny's old partner with him. Bring Back some of the old characters from blue blood. Sure make the show lot better.

Well I guess it will last.  Tried watching and couldn't make it half way.  Too boring  and rehashing of tired concepts.   Plus writing was atrocious.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Claudia Winkleman is poised to land her own BBC chat show ‚Äî and Deadline can reveal it will be made by the company behind The Graham Norton Show.


The Daily Mail first reported on the talk show plans on Friday, but Deadline can now confirm that the series is set to be produced by So Television. 


	A deal for the chat show has not yet been finalized, though talks are said to be at an advanced stage. The news comes hours after Winkleman and Tess Daly dropped a glitterball bombshell about their plans to quit Strictly Come Dancing this year.

	Sources told Deadline that Winkleman and Daly's social media announcement about their Strictly exit ‚Äúblindsided‚Äù the BBC, which did not release a statement on the matter until two hours later. One person said it spoke to the ‚Äúpresenter power‚Äù the duo wield. 

	











	Winkleman, who also hosts The Traitors, earned her chat show stripes by stepping in for Norton earlier this year when the Irish presenter was on a break from his BBC duties. ‚ÄúTo be honest, nobody is more livid than me,‚Äù Winkleman joked when opening the show.  


	The idea is that Winkleman's series will broadcast when The Graham Norton Show is off-air, meaning there will be no clashes between the shows and they will not be competing for guests. The BBC recently renewed The Graham Norton Show for another three years, while its recent run of episodes has boasted eye-catching bookings, including Taylor Swift. 


	So Television was founded by Norton and business partner Graham Stuart. The company, which also made Netflix comedy special Hannah Gadsby's Gender Agenda, is owned by ITV Studios.


	The BBC declined to comment.

It's only gotten weirder, over the last few years, that Jon M. Chu has never been able to get any traction on a sequel to his 2018 blockbuster hit Crazy Rich Asians. After all, Chu's no longer just ‚ÄúCrazy Rich Asians director Jon M. Chu‚Äù: He's become something of a full-blown cottage industry, propelled most of all by the success of last year's Wicked, and the expected performance of its sequel next month. This guy is the stud from which Warner Bros. is hanging pretty much all of its holiday hopes, which only makes the multiple fizzled attempts to build on his first big hit feel all the more incongruous.

But, no more: Chu swears that the previously announced Crazy Rich Asians sequel show is the real deal, with scripts written, and production ready to go‚Äîjust as soon as he gets a green light. (God only knows when that'll be, since he's also still on the hook to do a lot of other stuff, including directing a Hot Wheels move for J.J. Abrams for some unfathomable reason.) Chu was making these promises during a recent conversation with Esquire, where he swears up and down that there will actually be more Crazy Rich Asians at some point. ‚ÄúIt's a real thing. We have scripts, and we're waiting to be officially ready to go. Our cast will be there.‚Äù (Chu does not then specify ‚Äúour cast,‚Äù which feels like it could be a major sticking point for translating the film's universe into TV.)

Meanwhile, Chu also talked a bit about the difficulties in adapting Kevin Kwan's follow-up novel to Crazy Rich Asians, China Rich Girlfriend, for the screen: ‚ÄúIt's hard to do the continuation of the books,‚Äù he told Esquire. ‚ÄúBecause our characters changed so much in the first movie. It's so different [from] the books, actually, even though it feels like it's the same. So you couldn't go one-to-one. But we can use a lot of inspiration from the book to dig out more story from it.‚Äù

News of the TV continuation began circulating back in February, i.e., right after Chu handed Warner Bros. his latest fresh basket of money.

Jennifer Check goes both ways, but right now, she's going forward into a sequel. Original writer Diablo Cody is ‚Äúworking on it right now,‚Äù director Karyn Kusama said in a recent interview with Deadline. ‚ÄúI'm very excited to hear what comes of it,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI know some of the bones of it, so I'm not going to give anything away, but it sounds fun and crazy like the first film. And I have no doubt that Diablo will do something absolutely incredible with it.‚Äù

Jennifer's Body, which bowed in 2009, was a victim of its sex-heavy mis-marketing and a lot of misogynistic backlash against both Diablo Cody and its star Megan Fox, but it's become a veritable cult classic in the years since. ‚ÄúI'm just so grateful that the film managed to find its audience, perhaps on a different timeline than any of us might have expected or hoped for, but I'm just so thankful that the work continues to speak to people,‚Äù Kusama said. ‚ÄúI'm just so satisfied by that.‚Äù It's continued to speak to both Fox and co-star Amanda Seyfried as well, as both have mentioned their interest in a sequel in various interviews throughout the years. ‚ÄúI think we're making another one,‚Äù Seyfried said this past March. ‚ÄúI didn't confirm it! I said, ‚ÄòI think.' We're working on it.‚Äù Despite her clear desire not to pull a Tom Holland, the use of ‚Äúwe‚Äù is notable. In 2021, Fox also expressed interest in resurrecting Jennifer. ‚ÄúI don't think it's a hard movie to make a sequel to,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI mean, they should make it into a TV series. That would be cool.‚Äù

Cody herself was ‚Äúnervous to get back into that,‚Äù as she previously told Deadline of her feelings regarding the film she admitted was a ‚Äúcommercial and critical disaster‚Äù at the time. Like Kusama, however, the film's new cult status healed some of that hurt. ‚ÄúAnd then this magical thing happened the last few years where that movie found an audience and people began to really appreciate it,‚Äù Cody continued. ‚ÄúAnd it gave me the confidence to say, ‚ÄòYou know what? I never lost my passion for that world and I want to do another one.' So, I'm here.‚Äù

Silencing the Malcolm In The Middle revival skeptics, who refuse to believe that a reunion season of the offbeat turn-of-the-century sitcom is on the way, star Frankie Muniz shared a photo of himself with his television brothers, Justin Berfield and Christopher Kennedy Masterson, from the set of the new limited series. Earlier today, Muniz posted the picture on X, the everything website, where you can take a break from incessant Nazi memes to ask Muniz, ‚ÄúWhere's Dewey?‚Äù In his caption, he revealed that he was told to refrain from sharing photos, but he remained steadfast in his assertion that no one's the boss of him (now). ‚ÄúI was told not to post this yet, but then I listened to this song,‚Äù Muniz wrote. ‚ÄúI'm just too excited for y'all to see the new episodes and I miss my brothers.‚Äù

To answer the question on everyone's mind, Erik Per Sullivan, who played Dewey on the show, is too busy getting his master's degree from Harvard to appear on the reunion. He also retired from acting in 2010, when he last appeared on screen in the Joel Schumacher drama Twelve. On the upcoming series, entitled Malcolm In The Middle: Life's Still Unfair, newcomer Caleb Ellsworth-Clark will play Dewey. Berfield, who returns to play Malcolm's brother Reese, had also retired from acting and hadn't worked since he produced and starred on one episode of 2010's Sons Of Tucson.

Malcolm In The Middle: Life's Still Unfair is set for a four-episode revival on Disney+ in 2026.

Adam Driver kicked up a bit of a shitstorm in the Star Wars universe this week, revealing that‚Äîin the midst of an extremely fallow period for the franchise in movie theaters‚Äîhe and Steven Soderbergh had taken the time to cook up, for their own pleasure, a cool-sounding movie centered on Driver's old pal Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. Said film apparently excited everybody who heard about it, right up until it was run straight into the thresher known as ‚ÄúDisney CEO Bob Iger.‚Äù Iger apparently shot the idea down purely on its premise‚Äîi.e., that Solo might still be alive after Rise Of Skywalker‚Äîand ‚Äúthat was that.‚Äù

But there's nothing quite like a Star Wars fanbase scorned, and so now fans who've just learned about this project have already started making big, flashy gestures in defense of it. Specifically, Collider reports that somebody apparently rented a plane to fly over Disney headquarters with a banner trailing behind it, calling on the studio to ‚ÄúSave #TheHuntForBenSolo.‚Äù The banner was apparently organized by fan Lianna Al Allaf, who wanted Iger and his fellow executives to know ‚Äúhow much the character of Ben Solo means to so many of us, and that the fans really do want this movie.‚Äù

It feels like Driver must have known what he was doing when he aimed the fandom's ire straight at Iger: In the interview, he makes it clear that pretty much everybody at Lucasfilm was onboard for the project, and that Iger (and fellow executive Alan Bergman) were the specific stumbling points. (They apparently hadn't heard that you can bring characters back in this universe by just having Oscar Isaac mumble ‚ÄúSomehow, so-and-so returned.‚Äù) It's very hard to imagine Iger about-facing on something like this‚Äîhe's made it clear that new Star Wars movies are going to be pretty much the safest bets possible, even as the series' TV side has made ambitious swings like Andor‚Äîbut, hey, we'll take Star Wars fans being mad about a cool-sounding movie getting killed over Star Wars being mad that, like, women exist any day of the week.

Something windy this way comes. Dark Winds is blowing back into town for season four. AMC announced earlier today that the fourth season of Dark Winds will hit AMC and AMC+ on February 14. The new season will pull Lt. Leaphorn (Zahn McClarnon), Chee (Kiowa Gordon), and Manuelito (Jessica Matten) away from the comfort of the Navajo Nation and into the seedy underbelly of 1970s Los Angeles in search of a missing Navajo girl. Season four is also welcoming new cast members into the investigation, including Franka Potente, Isabel DeRoy-Olson, Chaske Spencer, Luke Barnett, and, Bosch himself, Titus Welliver.

Along with the announcement, AMC released a short first look at season four, which should prepare viewers for the ominous milieu of LA noir. As always, though, the show is all about character, with Leaphorn narrating the clip, pining for the days when murders weren't so frequent.



We've long been fans of Dark Winds, which has brought originality and nuance to a tired genre. ‚ÄúEnter AMC's Dark Winds,‚Äù A.V. Club‚Äòs TV writer Saloni Gajjar wrote in her season three premiere recap. ‚ÄúThe neo-Western thriller is pointedly set in the '70s but also feels contemporary in its tackling of themes like bigotry, classism, and violence against Indigenous people. The show distinguishes itself with a propulsive suspense, grounded protagonists, immersive cinematography, and, crucially, a rare spotlight on Native American voices both on- and off-screen.‚Äù

Dark Winds is based on Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn & Chee novels. Hillerman published his final installment of the series in 2006, before his 2008 death. Afterward, his daughter, Anne Hillerman, took up the series and published Spider Woman's Daughter in 2013. Her most recent entry, Lost Birds, came out in 2024.

Dark Winds returns on February 15 at 9 P.M. EST on AMC and AMC+.

Lauren Silverman sparks marriage rumors after changing her Instagram name to Lauren Cowell ahead of Simon Cowell's upcoming Netflix documentary, ‚ÄúSimon Cowell: The Next Act.‚Äù Silverman has surprised fans by changing her social media name to Lauren Cowell. 

The 48-year-old mother of two, who has been engaged to beloved ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù judge Simon Cowell since 2021, deleted her old Instagram account, @LaurenMichelle1974, and launched a new one under @LaurenMichelleCowell.

While the reason behind the sudden change remains unclear, HELLO! reported that the mystery will likely be addressed in Simon Cowell's upcoming Netflix documentary, ‚ÄúSimon Cowell: The Next Act.‚Äù EntertainmentNow could not independently verify the wedding reports.

The new Netflix docuseries ‚ÄúSimon Cowell: The Next Act‚Äù is set to premiere in December 2025 and will follow the entertainment mogul as he assembles a brand-new boy band. The project promises an inside look at Cowell's next chapter, both professionally and personally.

Lauren and Simon, who met in 2004 while vacationing in Barbados, got engaged on Christmas Eve 2021 after nearly two decades together. The couple shares one son, Eric, 11, while Lauren also has a son, Adam, 19, from her previous marriage to real estate entrepreneur Andrew Silverman.

Lauren and Simon's romance began years after their initial meeting. At the time, Lauren was married to Andrew Silverman, who was also a friend of Simon's. Their relationship eventually turned romantic, and in 2013, the pair publicly confirmed they were expecting their first child together.

A post shared by Simon Cowell (@simoncowell)

For Cowell, fatherhood was a turning point. Speaking to Kelly Clarkson, he recalled, ‚ÄúFrom that moment I saw the scan, I was like, ‚ÄòThat is it, I'm besotted.' Now I just cannot imagine my life without him. He's the most amazing thing that ever happened to me.‚Äù

A post shared by HELLO! Magazine (@hellomag)

The couple's engagement took place in Barbados, where they first met. Lauren's engagement ring reportedly features a 20-carat oval diamond, estimated to be worth a small fortune, given Cowell's net worth of $600 million.

As for their upcoming wedding, Cowell teased during ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù Season 18 that the big day will be an intimate affair. ‚ÄúI am planning it all, otherwise I know what will happen ‚Äì there will be 600 people and it'll get out of control, like my 50th birthday party,‚Äù he joked. ‚ÄúNo one knows when it's going to be ‚Äì that'll be a surprise, even for Lauren.‚Äù

In an earlier interview with People in 2023, Cowell described wedding planning as ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù explaining that after years together, they want to keep things simple and meaningful.

EntertainmentNow has reached out to Simon Cowell's representative for comment and is awaiting a response.

Emma Stone is a famous name nowadays; however, that wasn't always a moniker that was used by the star. Indeed, that's not even her real name. She was born Emily Stone, but also used another name at one point.

‚ÄúI actually adopted a stage name for six months,‚Äù Emma revealed during a Wednesday, October 22 appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. ‚ÄúBecause the Screen Actors Guild, it's like a business bureau, you can only have one person with that name. I was 16, and I decided I wanted to be ‚ÄòRiley,' so I was ‚ÄòRiley Stone.'‚Äù

Although she thought the name was ‚Äúbeautiful,‚Äù it didn't quite work out.

‚ÄúI had a guest part on Malcolm in the Middle,‚Äù she told the host. ‚ÄúAnd they kept going, ‚ÄòRiley,' ‚ÄòRiley,' and I had no idea who they were talking to. Truly. So I was like, ‚ÄòI cannot be Riley.' It came out of nowhere. I was just like, ‚ÄòCool name. I'll just be Riley.'‚Äù

However, when it failed to stick, ‚ÄúI then changed it to ‚ÄòEmma,' because it's close enough to ‚ÄòEmily.'‚Äù

In April 2024, Emma was asked by The Hollywood Reporter, ‚ÄúDoes anyone in the industry call you Emily?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I get to know them, people that I work with do,‚Äù the star answered. ‚ÄúIt's just because my name was taken [by another actress in SAG]. Then I freaked out a couple of years ago. For some reason, I was like, ‚ÄòI can't do it anymore. Just call me Emily.'‚Äù

THR then asked, ‚ÄúIf some fan came up to you and said, ‚ÄòCan I take a selfie, Emily?' would you be like, ‚ÄòIt's Emma.'‚Äù

Emma admitted, ‚ÄúNo. That would be so nice. I would like to be Emily.‚Äù

Emma is far from the only star to use a stage name. In fact, plenty of famous figures use snappy pseudonyms. You might be asking who ‚Äî well, check out the names (real and faux) below.

Gigi Hadid was born Jelena Noura Hadid, according to Harper's Bazaar.

Lady Gaga is really Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta.

Rihanna is Robyn Rihanna Fenty.

Joaquin Phoenix was known as Joaqu√≠n Rafael Bottom.

Natalie Portman was Neta-Lee Hershlag.

Miley Cyrus was given the name Destiny Hope Cyrus when she came into the world.

Derek Hough shared a beautiful moment with a young fan in the ‚ÄúDancing with the Stars‚Äù ballroom, and fans have praised him for his kindness. 

A post shared by Derek Hough (@derekhough)

The young fan's name is Cesily Collette Young. In her Instagram bio, she states: ‚ÄúPlay expert, Artist, chef, and a wheely fun girl. Account managed by parents.‚Äù She is also a talented actress who held the role of Young Nessarose in the film ‚ÄúWicked.‚Äù 

Young had a fantastic night interacting with the professional dancers and their celebrity dance partners on Wicked Night in Week 6. Her Instagram account is filled with happy photos from Show Day on Tuesday, October 21. However, the last post on Instagram from the night is a video of her dancing on the ballroom floor with DWTS Season 34 host and professional dancer Derek Hough. It is a moving moment.

Hough captioned his video with a simple message, writing, ‚ÄúMay I have this dance @cesilycollette @dancingwiththestars @wickedmovie.‚Äù Fans reacted to the post, flooding it with comments about how beautiful this interaction was and how lovely Hough and, of course, Young are! 

‚ÄúSo lovely, and of course Derek would be out there dancing with her. He is an exceptionally kind and thoughtful man,‚Äù a fan wrote. 

‚ÄúOh my heart Derek you are going to be the best daddy!‚Äù another comment reads. Many fans shared the same sentiment with another commenter stating, ‚ÄúBless his heart. He seems like a wonderful man. I can already see that he is going to be a great dad.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCrying good tears,‚Äù a fan shared. ‚ÄúI use a wheelchair and use to do musical theatre but i got sick and now for over 15 years i have been unable to perform. This is beautiful.‚Äù

A post shared by Cesily Collette (@cesilycollette)

Earlier in the night, Young had shared a photo on Instagram of herself and Hough. She looked lovely in her black dress while Hough had on a dashing green suit. The pair smiles into the camera. 

The caption reads, ‚ÄúIt's a 10 to be at @dancingwiththestars.‚Äù 

Fans reacted to the post with praise for Young. ‚ÄúSo happy to see you there Cesily you look adorable!‚Äù a comment reads. ‚ÄúSaw you on my screen and immediately went ‚ÄòYESSSS THATS MY GIRL CC!!!!!'‚Äù another shared. 

A third comment reads, ‚ÄúI just saw you in the crowd. You look beautiful tonight, as usual.‚Äù

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Third-Place Contestant Debbie Siebers Predicts Mel Owens' Likely Winner on 'The Golden Bachelor'","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-bachelor/debbie-siebers-winner-season-2-golden-bachelor-mel-owens/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 01:30:42 GMT","

‚ÄúThe Golden Bachelor‚Äù season 2, starring Mel Owens, is quickly coming to an end as the former NFL star has narrowed the contestants down to his final two women. After visiting hometowns on the Oct. 22 episode, Owens chose to move forward with Cindy Cullers, 60, and Peg Munson, 62, and had to say a heartfelt goodbye to Debbie Siebers, 65.

With Cindy and Peg being total opposites, Siebers shared her take on who she truly believes will win over Owens' heart in the very end.

Unfortunately, Debbie Siebers was not given a rose by Mel Owens after hometowns' week. Still, in a recent interview with Parade, she shared the woman she strongly believes will capture his heart at the finale.

‚ÄúThey're so different,‚Äù Siebers said of Cindy Cullers and Peg Munson. When describing Munson, Siebers shared that the burst of energy viewers saw on their screens of the former firefighter was the real deal. ‚ÄúShe'd be the first to bolt out of bed [in the Bachelor house] at 5 a.m., and she's already in the jacuzzi and working out, and she's very fun,‚Äù she said.

As for Cullers, she is a lot more reserved, with Siebers stating that she ‚Äúis just so calming to be around. She's got this demeanor. Even when she was cooking in the kitchen, she's just got this calmness and ease about her.‚Äù

A post shared by The Golden Bachelor (@goldenbachabc)

But who does Siebers really think will ultimately get a proposal out of Owens? ‚ÄúPeg really brings the fun out of him and I think because of all the mantras and the toasts that he always did was to love happiness and fun. And I think he's looking for that lightheartedness and fun, nothing too heavy but just somebody who's going to make him come out of himself a little bit more. So I think it might be Peg.‚Äù

Munson quickly became a fan-favorite on ‚ÄúThe Golden Bachelor‚Äù thanks to her full-of-life personality and spontaneity. She left a lasting impression on Owens right from the very start after stepping out of the limo in a bombsuit. Munson used to work as a firefighter and bomb technician in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Munson earned her first one-on-one date with Owens in episode 4, and the two went to the Orange County Fair, where Owens shared that he admired Munson's ‚Äúhigh level of energy.‚Äù It was clear that Munson had a way of getting the playful side out of Owens and made him feel young again. Who doesn't want that?

During hometowns week, Owens got the chance to meet Munson's only daughter, Dakota, from her first and only marriage. Although she hit him with a few tough questions, he admired Dakota's strong bond with her mother and wanted to protect her heart. 

With Munson and Culler being polar opposites, it's hard to predict who Owens will ultimately choose on ‚ÄúThe Golden Bachelor.‚Äù

‚ÄúDancing With the Stars‚Äù judge Derek Hough and his wife, Hayley Erbert, shared details of their heartbreaking family loss recently. The couple's emotional 2024 dance on ‚ÄúDWTS‚Äù had a hidden meaning that's now very clear.

In October 2024, Hough and Erbert performed a dance to Benson Boone's ‚ÄúBeautiful Things.‚Äù The couple recently shared the heartbreaking story of their miscarriage, and now it's clear that there was a hidden meaning in that special performance.

Erbert suffered a miscarriage last year, which the couple revealed in a video posted on their Instagram accounts on October 15.

‚ÄúThere are some things in life that change you forever. For us, this is one of those things,‚Äù Erbert wrote in the caption. ‚ÄúA chapter of love, loss, heartbreak, and everything in between.‚Äù

She continued, ‚ÄúAs we are now in October, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, we share this part of our story to honor our baby that never made it earthside. One in four pregnancies end in miscarriage, a silent heartbreak so many families know, and one we unfortunately had to experience.‚Äù

Erbert added, ‚ÄúAs we share this, know that there's a rainbow not far behind. ‚ô•Ô∏èüåà‚Äù

The video shows the excitement surrounding the pregnancy and ends with the heartbreak of suffering a miscarriage.

On October 20, Hough shared a photo from the performance, noting, ‚ÄúNow that you know our story, this moment holds a much deeper meaning. Beautiful Thing(s) ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù

A post shared by Derek Hough (@derekhough)

Hough and Erbert's fans flooded the comments section with emotional messages.

‚ÄúWow! I felt the emotion then, and feeling it all over again with a new perspective!‚Äù one fan shared.

Another fan wrote, ‚ÄúThis is even more heartbreaking now üò≠, you went through so much and you're still such bright lights, I wish you nothing but happiness forever üíñ.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour marriage has endured so much in such a short time ‚Ä¶ your family will thank you some day for the strength you have brought to your relationship and a bond that others will not understand,‚Äù one of their fans noted.

Another person wrote, ‚ÄúJust wow. So much to go through. And now, when I watch this performance, I will cry even more for your heartache. I truly admire the strength you both have and your openness to share. I am so excited for your rainbow baby to come! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù

It's interesting to hear ‚ÄúSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere‚Äù director Scott Cooper say he's realizing that this may not be the movie people were expecting about Bruce Springsteen. The interesting part: ‚Äúrealizing‚Äù is in the present tense.

Warren Zane's book of the same name (sans the ‚ÄúSpringsteen‚Äù part of the film's title) is about a famous musical artist basically retreating from the world to write and perform what many think is still his greatest album, ‚ÄúNebraska.‚Äù Oh, and Springsteen recorded ‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù on a wonky piece of equipment and, trying to transfer this particular piece of music over to vinyl, so it could be mass produced for sale, turned out to be quite the challenge ‚Äî and a large part of the book focuses on this particular technical task.

 








Related Stories ‚ÄòBugonia' Review: Jesse Plemons Tries to Save the World from Emma Stone in Yorgos Lanthimos' Blunt Big-Pharma Hostage Thriller ‚ÄòSir√¢t' Wins Top Prize at the 2025 Chicago International Film Festival: Full Winners List 

So, on the surface, not really a book that screams ‚Äúthis should be a movie‚Äù! But the fact it's not, and that this story isn't what people are going to be expecting out of a movie about Bruce Springsteen (played by Jeremy Allen White), is what makes it interesting in the first place. This isn't a film about Springsteen performing stadium anthems to masses of fans (though, we do get one scene like that), it's about Springsteen deconstructing his own identity, which led to an album title track about a mass murderer performed by Springsteen in the first person.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






It's a big week for ‚ÄúNebraska.‚Äù As the film chronicles, Springsteen refused to do any press for the album, which led to record store patrons just, one day, stumbling upon a brand new Bruce Springsteen album that sounded like nothing he had done before. In contrast, Bruce Springsteen has been everywhere the last few weeks promoting not just this film, but the release of a new ‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù box set that includes the Holy Grail for Springsteen fans, ‚ÄúElectric Nebraska.‚Äù 

Again, as we see in the film, Springsteen did attempt to record the ‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù songs with the E Street Band, but something about the moody, echo-y tone of the original recordings was being lost in the studio. So, he and his manager, Jon Landau (played by Jeremy Strong, in what has to be one of his most earnest and sweetest roles to date) set out to convince the record company that what started as a demo tape should be released as the album, with the promise that something much bigger was just over the horizon. (Which would wind up being ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù)

Ahead, Cooper takes us through his journey with this film. (And, yes, his own realizations about what an audience might expect from a Springsteen film as opposed to what an audience might like.) A journey he tried to make in the same spirit Springsteen made ‚ÄúNebraska.‚Äù Though, obviously, he didn't get the studio to agree to the whole ‚Äúno press‚Äù part of that spirit. And he makes it pretty clear, he'd have loved to skip this part.

 










The following interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.

IndieWire: In a week that the ‚ÄúElectric Nebraska‚Äù outtakes are finally being released, in the spirit of that, what outtakes can we expect from ‚ÄúDeliver Me from Nowhere‚Äù?

Scott Cooper: Well, I generally never put anything from an outtake that wasn't included in the film. Because I feel if it should ever be seen, it should be in the movie.

Bruce does not agree with this philosophy. 

Bruce does not agree with that. But it did take him 43 years for ‚ÄúElectric Nebraska.‚Äù But what you do hear in the film is the E Street Band performing ‚ÄúElectric Nebraska,‚Äù with Jeremy singing the vocals, which is really nice. It's interesting both are coming out on the same day‚Ä¶

What a coincidence. 

But there are quite a few scenes that are quite wonderful of Jeremy singing that I just wanted to capture. One incredible performance from him and the E Street Band [not in the film] is ‚ÄúDancing in the Dark.‚Äù It's really quite lovely, but it feels like maybe for a different film. We are obviously more focused on ‚ÄúNebraska.‚Äù But if one were to have a coda where we are looking forward to what we might expect, that would be it. 

 










Right, Jon Landau famously told Bruce that the ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù album needed one more hit and ‚ÄúDancing in the Dark‚Äù was the last thing written at the last minute and becomes his biggest hit. There's your post-credits scene.

And Bruce told Landau, ‚ÄúIf you want that song, you effin' write it.‚Äù So Bruce stormed off and wrote that song in a day.

Speaking of, this movie isn't a tidy story‚Ä¶

Oh, no, not at all.

Even the making of ‚ÄúNebraska.‚Äù It's not just, ye goes to this house in New Jersey and records ‚ÄúNebraska,‚Äù then after that releases ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù The two albums are so intertwined and, to someone who doesn't know the story, it might be confusing, but you lean into that. It's remarkable how much you stick to the book.

The biggest challenge with the drama of ‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù is internal. There's really no band. There's no evil producer we see in films. There's no real tension apart from Al Teller, the head of Columbia Records, telling Jon Landau they can't play this. It's one man alone with his thoughts and a four-track recorder and I think it's one of the most emotionally charged creative acts in modern music. But the big question for me is, how do you make solitude cinematic? You're not shooting a film filled with concerts or crowds. You're shooting stillness in a man wrestling with how honest he can be in his work. My guiding principal was to make the film like how Bruce made ‚ÄúNebraska.‚Äù 

 










How so?

Minimalist. Dark. 

‚ÄúNo press tour.‚Äù

No press tour! It's interesting, Bruce says, ‚ÄúI don't even know how to explain this album.‚Äù I don't even know how to explain the film apart from to say it's about a neglected soul repairing himself through music. 

You should have tried to pull off no press. ‚ÄúJust like the album, we are not going to promote this movie.‚Äù

If I didn't have to do press, Mike, I wouldn't. No one would know anything about me or my process, if I'm being frank.

That's fair.

Alas, here I am.

Was there any moment in his life you wanted to include but couldn't? Maybe even just because it didn't match up with this particular timeline.

So many people have preconceived notions about a music film about Bruce Springsteen. Or a film that they want to see like the ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù or ‚ÄúBorn to Run‚Äù story. People have ownership over Bruce Springsteen because I know people who have seen him 140 times. So, this is probably the most unexpected story that folks will get about a music icon. Or a man, in my estimation, who is the soul of American music. I'm realizing this film is not what people expected. Now whether it's what they wanted is another thing.

What do you mean by ‚Äúrealizing‚Äù?
 










Well, I played the film in Telluride, New York, Madrid, Rome, Berlin, Le√≥n, and people didn't expect this story about Bruce Springsteen to be told. And for many people didn't know this was a chapter in Bruce's life that was so painful and so personal, for an album that became so enduring for him. I think people think of Bruce Springsteen, the casual fan, as the ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù tour, or maybe the ‚ÄúBorn to Run‚Äù tour. If you look at his autobiography, ‚ÄúBorn to Run,‚Äù most every chapter is very lengthy. The chapter on the making of ‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù is maybe one or one and a half pages. And Bruce said it was too painful to relive that. So, now we are reliving it. 

Speaking of his book, this film is so much about his relationship with his father. There's that part in his book when he talks about winning his Oscar for ‚ÄúStreets of Philadelphia,‚Äù setting it on his parents' kitchen table and his dad says, ‚ÄúOK, you win.‚Äù

You know, Bruce and I have discussed other chapters in his life. I suppose it will remain to be seen if folks want to see those films from Scott Cooper and Bruce Springsteen. But there are plenty of chapters left, I think, to tell. But it's hard to get folks off the sofa to see movies these days that don't rain glass and concrete or men in leotards. 

 










Speaking of other chapters, you actually do get into another interesting chapter of his life not many people know about post-‚ÄúNebraska.‚Äù Earlier this year, Bruce released ‚ÄúTracks II,‚Äù which includes the 1983 Los Angeles Garage Sessions. Your movie actually gets into that era, too, and Bruce is not in a good place when he's living in LA.

Oh, incredibly so. It's so interesting we are debuting the film in Los Angeles within a mile of where he wrote ‚ÄúCounty Fair.‚Äù And there was a time I considered ending the film in Los Angeles. But it seemed fitting, at least, for this chapter, for him to go home. Because Bruce is New Jersey's favorite son. But the film ends with a man walking away from the camera, looking forward. The song that closes the film was recorded by Bruce in 2000 at Madison Square Garden, the live version with the E Street Band of ‚ÄúAtlantic City.‚Äù In a moment of great despair Bruce Springsteen says to Jon Landeau, ‚ÄúWhat we're doing with these songs, it's making me nauseous. Listen to what we're doing to ‚ÄòAtlantic City.'‚Äù What I wanted to show was, the film ends in 1982, but ‚ÄúAtlantic City‚Äù will be in the rotation in a very heavy was later on in Bruce's life. Because they did get it right, the E Street Band.

Yeah, all the ‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù songs now, they sound great with the band.
 










‚ÄúOpen All Night.‚Äù 

Didn't he open with that in LA last year?

Well, for good reason, I was at that show. Bruce said, ‚ÄúI've got something for ya.‚Äù 

Oh, he did that for you?

That was for me.

I want to ask about Paul Walter Houser as Mike Batlan. In the film, Mike is portrayed as a confidant as Bruce records the album. But in reality they, at least later, have some strife. How did you approach that? Did Bruce interject at all how he was portrayed?

Yeah, that was the only relationship in the film that I changed the tenor of. I don't know if you've seen any of my other films‚Ä¶

I have.

They are devoid of humor. And I thought it would be nice that Mike Batlan would serve as, not any kind of comic foil, but someone who is very different to Bruce and his life. Someone who is deeply humane and kind and wants the best for Bruce, because it's a different color. That is not the relationship he had with Mike Batlan. And I didn't think it was important to discuss that unless I'm telling a much larger story about Bruce Springsteen. And Bruce loved the portrayal of Mike Batlan by Paul Walter Hauser. The movie aligns very close to fact. The things I have altered a bit was Mike Batlan and Faye, who was a amalgam of a few women Bruce was seeing. 

 










There's a small moment when Jeremy Strong as Jon Landau is on the phone. He says goodbye, then there's a pause and before he hangs up he does a ‚Äúha ha ha‚Äù laugh before he hangs up. The crowd loved that. 

You know, Jeremy Strong is well known for playing cold, calculating characters. Kendall Roy. Roy Cohn. I've known Jeremy a long time. He was cut out of my film ‚ÄúBlack Mass.‚Äù But I wanted to see tender, warm, passionate, and a man who laughed easily because that's who Jon Landau is. And for people who know Jon Landau well, they think Jeremy has captured him perfectly. That's a testament to Jeremy's devotion to getting it right, because he did a great deal of research on a man who is behind the man. And was out of the frame, by design. And people who have known Bruce and Jon's relationship and have spent time with them, far more than I ever have, think Jeremy White and Jeremy Strong have so beautifully captured their relationship. 

You told a story at New York Film Festival about losing your house in the fires and Bruce invited your family to stay at his house.

I did?

Yes.

Well, that did happen. We lived in Bruce's place. And when my daughter's guitar burned, Bruce replaced that. So often you are told not to meet your heroes for fear they will disappoint. And Bruce Springsteen far exceeded my expectations in every regard.

Animated TV shows have a way of sticking around when they get big. Most famously, there's ‚ÄúThe Simpsons,‚Äù which has been airing on Fox for 35 years with few signs of stopping. But other popular shows ‚Äî ranging from kids' fare like ‚ÄúSpongebob Squarepants‚Äù to edgier adult programs like ‚ÄúFamily Guy‚Äù and ‚ÄúSouth Park‚Äù ‚Äî have 10 or even 20+ years and counting of new seasons under their belt. 

Adult Swim‚Äòs ‚ÄúSmiling Friends,‚Äù an absurdist and experimental series that has become an online cult favorite, has over the course of its short run increasingly grown in popularity. The series, which follows the unhinged misadventures of charity workers dedicated to making people happy, is currently airing its third season, and in a sign of confidence from its network, was already renewed for two additional seasons in 2024. Is there a world where ‚ÄúSmiling Friends‚Äù runs for 20 years like ‚ÄúSouth Park?‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck no,‚Äù ‚ÄúSmiling Friends‚Äù co-creator Michael Cusack says bluntly in an interview with IndieWire, along with his creative partner Zach Hadel. ‚ÄúIt's renewed for four and five now and we'll see how we feel at the end of that. It could be a natural wrap-up then. Zach and I change our minds every day on this. We don't want it to be a show that outstays its welcome and goes on forever. But we're also very lucky to get this show up, so there's a nice little middle ground. Zach and I have made a promise to each other where we'll always be honest and say, ‚ÄòLook, do we want to keep going with this, or do we want to wrap it up on a high note?' So we'll do Seasons 4 and 5, and see how we feel.‚Äù

 










Until then, Cusack and Hadel have their hands full working on the show; the pair write and direct every 11-minute episode, and voice almost the entire main cast along with numerous supporting or recurring characters. It's a lot of work, although Hadel describes their creative process as ‚Äúvibes-based.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt starts with Michael and I hanging out, most of the time in an online call. It used to be Skype, you know, whatever the app is, rest in piece Skype, but we used to just go with that and just shoot the shit. And a lot of the time it's us looking at what we find funny, what we find interesting, what engages us?‚Äù Hadel says. ‚ÄúWe kind of test each other and build up and build out the best version of whatever idea we're on is, and it's like Dan Aykroyd's Crystal Skull vodka. It refines through the stones, over and over until it's purified.‚Äù

Once they have their script, Cusack estimates it takes about a year for an episode to get fully produced. Over its first two seasons, ‚ÄúSmiling Friends‚Äù became known for its experimental animation, frequently mixing in different techniques like 3D animation, claymation, and puppetry into its 2D world for surreal effect. 

‚ÄúIt's a hard show to make, it's a show that probably actually needs double the crew to make,‚Äù Cusack said. ‚ÄúBut, you know, after all the chaos and the hardships going through it, I always look back and I I think, like, no, actually, it's probably good, that it's hard, because then it creates something special.‚Äù

 










‚ÄúIf we didn't have a team around us there'd be like half an episode of the show out by now,‚Äù Hadel says.

Season 3 of ‚ÄúSmiling Friends‚Äù has begun with several memorable episodes, including a premiere that introduces a pitiable CGI character named ‚ÄúSilly Samuel‚Äù voiced by Connor O'Malley, or the third episode, which parodies obsessive fan culture with a mole man obsessed with main characters Pim and Charlie. The most memorable episode so far, though, is the second, which departs from the typical formula of the series to focus on supporting character Mr. Frog (voiced by Cusack), a wealthy mega-celebrity humanoid frog who has been the focus of an episode every season. 

Cusack and Hadel say the character was an immediate favorite upon first working on the show in 2018 and, while they usually want to leave other characters introduced as clients for the Smiling Friends charity as one-offs, they came up with the idea to do a ‚ÄúMr. Frog episode‚Äù every season. This one, ‚ÄúLe Voyage Incroyable de Monsieur Grenouille,‚Äù sees Mr. Frog (having become president in a Season 2 episode) go through a spiritual crisis that ends with him finding inner piece and turning into a photorealistic frog. Originally, the episode focused on him going from president to dictator of the world, but Hadel says the idea fell through because it wasn't original enough, so they pivoted into a weirder, more serious direction.

 










‚ÄúIt also is a thing where the fact that it's serious is the joke,‚Äù Cusack says. ‚ÄúThe joke is that it's Mr. Frog, it's so stupid, unbelievably stupid that he's going through this. We never want to be sending serious messages with this show.‚Äù

The episode arguably hits peak absurdity when Mr. Frog's father appears in a live-action sequence to dress down his son, played in a cameo by a green paint-covered Creed Bratton, best known for his work in ‚ÄúThe Office.‚Äù As Hadel tells it, neither he nor Cusack had ever seen ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù or knew much about Bratton before he was cast. However, while looking for someone to play the character, they had trouble casting for the profile of an intimidating man in his 60s. A member of the production staff, however, was friends with Bratton, and convinced Hadel and Cusack to watch an audition tape he sent over for the small role.

‚ÄúThat is my favorite kind of cameo, where we didn't get him for any of the cool reasons. It was just like, ‚ÄòOh, he did the part well,'‚Äù Hadel says. ‚ÄúI think he nailed it, and that's why he got it was because he did a good job.‚Äù

While Cusack and Hadel don't know exactly how long it'll be before they end ‚ÄúSmiling Friends,‚Äù they do know how they want to end it. The two tell IndieWire that a movie spinoff wrapping up the adventures of Pim and Charlie is the perfect way they want the series to conclude.

 










‚ÄúWe'd love to end it with that, whenever we feel like the show has ended, I'd feel like that be a good way,‚Äù Hadel says. ‚ÄúAnd I don't think we would do it in the middle of the show, like other shows have done it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like the idea of a movie wrapping up, because we've got an 11-minute show, right?‚Äù Cusack adds. ‚ÄúIt's hard to do a finale in that format. Doing a movie would be the perfect way to wrap-up the whole series. We've thought about that since the beginning, doing a movie like that, and it'd be great.‚Äù 

New episodes of ‚ÄúSmiling Friends‚Äù Season 3 air Sunday nights on Adult Swim.

Bruce Springsteen was right. At the risk of oversimplifying the merits of this handsome box set, spoiling the plot of his dramatic new biopic, and squashing 40-plus years of fervent mythmaking, the truth is as Springsteen always insisted. Even when testing out the material with his most intuitive collaborators, working with some of the best songs he'd ever written, the definitive version of Nebraska remains the one he captured on tape in his Colts Neck home in January 1982: just a depressive guy in his early 30s with an acoustic guitar, a TASCAM PortaStudio, and an Echoplex, tracking solo demos for his next full-band record. Everything he tried in the following months, as it turns out, was an experiment.

But, lord, what an experiment. For the uninitiated, I'll go through it quickly. After the success of his poppy 1980 single ‚ÄúHungry Heart‚Äù and building off the momentum of several years of nonstop touring and critically acclaimed albums, Springsteen entered the most creatively restless period of his career. First, he wrote the murder ballads and haunted lullabies of Nebraska, which he tried to re-capture with the E Street Band, and in solo renditions in the studio, before deciding to release the home-recorded demos. There was no press and no tour, so he just kept writing, which led to 1984's commercial breakthrough Born in the U.S.A. Along the way, he discarded several records' worth of outtakes that have since been released on compilations like Tracks and Tracks II: The Lost Albums. (He also managed to co-write and co-produce two comeback records for the early rock'n'roll icon Gary U.S. Bonds; contribute a Grammy-winning song to Donna Summer; and put on several pounds of muscle mass.)

It sounds like a golden era, but to Bruce, it felt like a rut‚Äîthe kind of tortured, lonesome period that gets a ceaselessly brooding Jeremy Allen White cast to play you in the film. The irony is that the most important pieces of the puzzle‚Äîfrom the original Nebraska to the lightning-in-a-bottle album version of ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.‚Äù‚Äîall happened quickly, intuitively, before anyone had a chance to overcomplicate things. Like little else in his official catalog, the release of Nebraska 82: Expanded Edition helps contextualize this moment. In a concise package, you get a fuller portrait of one of Springsteen's greatest and most mysterious albums‚Äîand to this day, the one he's proudest of‚Äîas well as candid insight into his creative process.

The box contains a new remaster of the album proper; a disc of solo acoustic outtakes that embody the same wounded spirit; the fabled Electric Nebraska sessions; and a live album and film of Springsteen playing the record in its entirety to an empty theater in New Jersey earlier this year. The live stuff is welcome and fittingly reverential, especially with tasteful accompaniment from former Bob Dylan sideman Larry Campbell. The remaster is solid: a reminder that, despite this album's reputation for helping pioneer the lo-fi genre, the sound is actually more artful and dynamic than much of his work that followed. Next time you listen to ‚ÄúAtlantic City‚Äù on headphones, pay attention to the last 30 seconds, how the layers of acoustic guitar, mandolin, and background vocals slowly dissipate, one at a time, and consider the care that goes into adding such depth to such a stark landscape.

Unlike Springsteen's previous box sets for Darkness on the Edge of Town and The River, the idea isn't to explore how many different directions he could have gone. This time it's a steady process of refinement. Where Nebraska is renowned for a borderline oppressive consistency in tone, Electric Nebraska is all about the whiplash, shifting between heartland ballads and screaming rock songs across the duration of its eight-song tracklist. Presented more like guide tracks than finished takes‚Äîmostly just Springsteen on electric guitar and vocals; Max Weinberg on drums; and Garry Tallant on bass‚Äîthese are the ones that feel like demos, even if they hint at an album that could have been slightly more conventional and commercially viable in 1982. (Although this version of ‚ÄúDownbound Train,‚Äù with its clanging rhythm and disorienting bridge, might go down as the most deranged recording in his catalog.)

It's not hard to see why Springsteen saw these sessions as a failure. There is something slightly generic about the renditions of ‚ÄúOpen All Night‚Äù and ‚ÄúJohnny 99,‚Äù songs I've always associated with desperate, sleep-deprived adrenaline. Here they sound like the kind of things a band could count off and launch into unrehearsed with playful bar-band chords and rockabilly rhythms. On one hand, it shows you just how much Springsteen's writing‚Äîso open to interpretation, so archetypal in its structure‚Äîgains from his delivery. (For another example, compare this bleak, early acoustic take on ‚ÄúThunder Road‚Äù to the triumphant album version.) On the other hand, this type of costuming was crucial to his songwriting during this period: a fascination that could turn a romp like ‚ÄúPink Cadillac‚Äù into something pained and moaning, like the narrator has returned to earth, zombified and broken, with only one thing on his mind.

For hardcore fans, transformations like these will be the draw of the collection: hearing the journey of tracks like Born in the U.S.A.'s ‚ÄúWorking on a Highway‚Äù from a genuinely creepy ballad called ‚ÄúChild Bride‚Äù into a ditty so raucous that Springsteen himself can't get through the demo without laughing. Some outtakes, like ‚ÄúLosin' Kind,‚Äù a country ballad that's all the more powerful for its lack of resolution, have circulated unofficially for years, but two compositions are entirely new to this box set: ‚ÄúOn the Prowl‚Äù and ‚ÄúGun in Every Home.‚Äù In the former, he closes with a disorienting repetition of the word ‚Äúsearching,‚Äù slathered in Sun Studios slapback delay to conjure the clatter of a live band behind him. In the latter, he offers a nightmarish portrait of suburban life and closes with a dejected confession: ‚ÄúI don't know what to do.‚Äù

In any given song, Springsteen may be adopting the perspective of a serial killer in the shadows or a fugitive on the lam; he may be speeding away from the scene or wondering, upon getting caught, whether he is actually lucky to be alive. The whole point of enduring a dark night of the soul is that you can't see your way out. But sometimes, he caught glimpses of where it would lead. Along with the original demo tape, Springsteen wrote an accompanying letter to his manager, Jon Landau. Here, he goes song by song, elaborating on the bleak subject matter, suggesting ways to spice up the arrangements, and, once in a while, acknowledging his cautious optimism.

He leaves a particularly prescient note beside the scrawled title of ‚ÄúBorn in the U.S.A.,‚Äù a song that appears here in two nascent forms: a menacing acoustic blues about Vietnam and a full-band rocker that, without its chiming synth part, leaves little doubt how the narrator feels about his birthright. ‚ÄúMight have potential,‚Äù he writes in the margins, an instinct that sustained him through the sessions. He knew it would take work to deliver songs like these, and it would take time to understand them. But he kept his faith that at the end of every hard-earned day, there's magic in the night.

October 24, 2025

Anyone stumbling across the utopian cerulean vistas of Cahl Sel's Blue EP earlier this year could have been forgiven for wondering if the record was a forgotten gem from three decades past, rather than a brand-new production from a young upstart.

For one thing, the label that put it out, Reflective, is itself a vestige of leftfield electronic music's golden age, having lain largely dormant since 1997. Reflective was resurrected in 2022 to release Cahl Sel's debut EP, Every Moment; in its prime, the imprint had been responsible for a wealth of mid-'90s classics‚Äîrecords from bright-eyed mischief-makers like label founder Spacetime Continuum and IDM pioneer ¬µ-Ziq, recording as Kid Spatula, who lured curious ravers in stranger, squirrelier directions. The sound of both Cahl Sel EPs, particularly Blue, invoked that era in their clean-lined drum programming and bucolic washes of synthesizer, and with good reason: The San Francisco musician, aka Jasper Sharp, makes and performs his music on a hardware setup that harkens back to a halcyon, pre-laptop era.

Cahl Sel's debut album, Traces, sounds even more like a lost ambient-techno classic. The drums move like precision-engineered machinery: sturdy yet understated kick drums, die-cutting snares, diamantine hi-hats spinning in tricky clockwork patterns. Arpeggios twirl in elegant arcs against airy pads that glow like a tropical sunrise. Tracing the path of Cahl Sel's serpentine synthesizer melodies, it's easy to imagine hothouse flowers filmed in stop motion: green shoots whipping upward, uncurling in midair, and slowly exploding into star-shaped blossoms tinged with cadmium and azure.

Traces carves a sidewinding path between sleek, propulsive cuts and more atmospheric passages. The jittery techno of opener ‚ÄúBlink‚Äù slows to a languid electro crawl in ‚ÄúCall to Mind‚Äù before the drums disappear completely in ‚ÄúLivin,‚Äù an otherworldly sketch that runs new-age tones through the mazelike circuitry of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. But, as with the best ambient techno of the '90s, the division between ‚Äúdance music‚Äù and ‚Äúlistening music‚Äù is purely notional: It's a full-body sound that rewards both energetic movement and horizontal repose.

Some of the most energetic tracks are notable largely for what they don't do. ‚ÄúBlink‚Äù begins with spring-loaded claps and hi-hats, but the pads drip down like sun-drenched honey, as if to say, not so fast, tiger; not only that, but there's no bassline, an absence that leaves you hanging in a tantalizing state of perpetual anticipation. Given the speedy tempo and energetic rhythms, you might expect it to evolve into a more forceful club track, yet it never does. Instead, it simply floats in a delirious, delicious interzone.

It's not hard to guess at some of Sharp's influences. Aphex Twin's early work looms large; the mournful ‚ÄúAncient and Distant,‚Äù with its eerie, undulating melody, could easily pass as an outtake from Autechre's Amber. The cozy drone underpinning ‚ÄúLeft Eye‚Äù pulls from the same well from which Boards of Canada drew their fuzzy VHS fantasias. Traces of Burger/Ink's great Las Vegas linger in the intricate counterpoints and dubby undercurrents. And the knife-edged electro patterns look back fondly at Gescom, Bola, and other zero-gravity B-boys affiliated with the Skam label.

But most influential of all might be Spacetime Continuum himself, which probably isn't coincidental: The Reflective chief, aka Jonah Sharp, just happens to be Jasper's father. It's striking how thoroughly Jasper absorbed his dad's vision of electronic music, and it's fun to imagine him as a boy, soaking up his parents' record collection as if by osmosis‚Äîspooning Cheerios while the idyllic sounds of tracks like ‚ÄúPressure‚Äù and ‚ÄúFluresence‚Äù poured from the kitchen speakers. But Cahl Sel's talents are so clearly his own‚Äîjust listen to how masterfully he fans out the stacked harmonies of ‚ÄúClear,‚Äù one of the album's emotional highlights‚Äîthat his parentage should be considered little more than a footnote.

For a similar reason, I hesitate to call his music retro, however much it may resemble its influences. It's certainly no more narrowly retro in its intent than any number of other contemporary electronic projects: From trance to jungle to minimal to dubstep, dance music is awash in throwback energy, and has been for years now. And this kind of wistful ambient techno makes for a special case. The prime years of this sound were awfully short, lasting from the early-mid-'90s until the turn of the millennium. And the canon was so paltry‚Äîonce you've tallied the classics, the dropoff in quality is swift and steep‚Äîthat records like Cahl Sel's read as a kind of wish fulfillment: a belief that there remains more to be done in the genre, and a desire to make good on its untapped potential. Yes, Traces bears ample traces of those who came before him, but Cahl Sel is looking forward, not back.

A new album of Malawian roots music is the inaugural release of a new record label from the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (Mass MoCA). A collaboration with California label Hen House Studios, Mass MoCA Records released the Kasambwe Brothers' self-titled album today, and you can hear it below.

The Kasambwe Brothers are a band of four decades, based in the Ndirande township near Malawian capital Blantyre. They found their way to a Mass MoCA residency with help from Hen House and Luc Deschamps, the director of the Jacaranda Foundation and France's honorary consul to Malawi. Watch a documentary on the making of the album, which involves collaborators from the Massachusetts music scene, below. Clement Kammwamba is the artist behind the cover painting.

Mass MoCA Records will operate in tandem with the museum's curatorial ethos, a press release notes, and is running as a three-year pilot. Museum director Kristy Edmunds said, ‚ÄúBy joining forces with Hen House Studios and being able to tap into the remarkable number of music studios and intimate venues in the local area‚Äîthe ingredients for a hand-made record label were all around us. I see this label as an extension of how we innovate to support the mobility of artists' ideas and connect audiences the world over.‚Äù

Harlan Steinberger, the producer and engineer behind Hen House, added, ‚ÄúThough technology today can work wonders, the digital world has de-humanized us. I believe in an older-world method that emphasizes the magic of a band making music together in one room, playing off the creativity of the moment. The humanistic approach creates a deeper emotional listener experience that can not only be heard, but also felt.‚Äù

An album from Compton jazz artists Black Nile will follow in 2026, the press release notes.

	Speaking with Sirius XM's Trunk Nation, the guitarist was asked about GNR playing the Sphere. ‚ÄúI haven't been [to the Sphere] yet, but just everything that I've seen, or most everything that I've seen of it, looks amazing,‚Äù Slash said (via Blabbermouth). 


	However, ‚ÄúI'm real trepidatious about playing there, because‚Ä¶ It's a great visual show. I think that in almost every case for a band, it becomes a visual show as opposed to seeing a rock n' roll show. So there's that.‚Äù


	Slash added that he talked to Joe Walsh, whose band the Eagles currently resides in the Sphere, about playing the venue, and that the guitarist told him ‚Äúit's not really sort of rock ‚Äòn' roll friendly, the way that it's set up. So it's just one of those things where it seems like a really cool thing, and conceptually there's probably a lot of cool things that you could do, but I don't think it would be the right environment for a proper rock n' roll show.‚Äù

	Earlier this year, Metallica talked openly about potentially performing at the Sphere. ‚ÄúI'd be interested to see that too,‚Äù Slash said. ‚ÄúI could see them doing it‚Ä¶ You have to prepare your mind to put on not just a band performance, but 50 percent of what you're doing is going to be the projection, or whatever you call that ‚Äî the outer wall, what you're putting on as content.‚Äù

	Despite his trepidation, Slash didn't completely rule out Guns N' Roses occupying the Sphere at some point. ‚Äú[The visuals] is something that's gonna be the main focus of your show and the main focus of what everybody's gonna be looking at,‚Äù Slash told Trunk Nation. ‚ÄúAnd so you have to sort of getting to that mindset, and I think that's hard for us to go that far into it. But we'll see. Maybe down the road.‚Äù


	Earlier this month, the Sphere announced that the reunited No Doubt will be the next act to spend their weekends at the Las Vegas venue, with the band booked for 12 gigs in May 2026.

Julian Lennon knows how some people may view him, even more than 40 years after his life as a pop star began with his first and biggest album, Valotte. But speaking from his home in Monaco, he's trying to find the right word. ‚ÄúSome have said that, with nepotism today, I was a pioneer of‚Ä¶‚Äù


	Does he mean ‚Äú‚Ä¶.nepo baby‚Äù?


	‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Lennon says, his tone more bemused than bitter. ‚ÄúThere weren't many around, really. I was certainly one of the first in that field to deal with what I had to deal with. But I'm here. I've survived, and I'm okay. I'm alive and kicking. I'm pretty happy with my life and my work, and I just get up every day and think the best and hope for the best and pray for the best during these very, very difficult times.‚Äù


	Lennon may still be known to the majority of the public as John's son (from his first marriage, to Cynthia Lennon) and as the mullet-sporting newbie who had two massive radio and MTV hits in the Eighties, ‚ÄúValotte‚Äù and ‚ÄúToo Late for Goodbyes.‚Äù As he'll be the first to admit, his experiences in the music business since then have been a mixed bag. But in recent years, he's ventured into alternative careers as a photographer, a children's-book author, and documentary producer. In the latter case, he's not simply working on rock docs: He's executive producer of Ai Weiwei's Turandot, a just-released film about the Chinese artist and his debut as a director at the Rome Opera House.

	











	‚ÄúPeople only knew me as John's son, so not only for my own benefit, but for others, I wanted to prove to myself that I could do what I set out to do,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI wanted to build a foundation for myself that was undeniable, regardless of what anybody said.‚Äù

	











	And now, after a few years away from it, Lennon, who turned 62 this spring, has returned to music with a four-song EP titled because ‚Ä¶,  and a new video for ‚ÄúI Won't Give Up,‚Äù the ballad that concludes it and could be seen almost as a statement of purpose. ‚ÄúIt can mean whatever you want it to be, and that's the beauty of it, is it not?‚Äù he says of the title. ‚ÄúThat's the beauty of the lyrics we write, the songs we perform, is that you make it what you will.‚Äù He talks with Rolling Stone about that new music as well as director Sam Mendes' in-the-works Beatles biopics and Lennon's own plans for an as-yet-untitled autobiography.

After your last album Jude was released in 2022, you spoke publicly about your disappointment with its reception. What made you want to make another record, and an EP at that?Time and time again, I've certainly felt I've been let down by the labels. I put so much heart and soul into this stuff, especially in the later albums, and when you see a piece of work being, in my opinion, shelved, that's hard to deal with. That's why I went indie for a long time, and then I got reeled back in to do Jude and was promised the world with that yet again, and I didn't feel I got any support from the label on that.  


	But my intention for quite a long time now has been to just do singles and EPs. You're still doing music, but there isn't so much pressure. And it's not necessarily the label that caused that pressure. It's more about how I feel about the work and how it should be presented. So the idea of doing an EP was really pleasing to me. I've got so much other stuff I do these days, from the White Feather Foundation [the organization he founded to help ‚Äúenvironmental and humanitarian issues‚Äù] to documentaries to the children's book and photography, I just felt I could relax. I can still do music, but in a much more civil way in my head. I don't have to take a year out, because I can just pick a few songs and work on those, which allows me to breathe a bit more and feel a bit freer about the whole thing. I can put a single out, and if it catches, it catches, but at least I'm just letting the creativity flow and putting it out there.

How did these four songs come together?Around the time of Jude, Justin Clayton, who I've known since I was 11, and I literally found boxes of demo tapes and cassettes in the basement of my ex-business manager's office. I had no idea they were there. I thought I'd lost them in moving or something like that. But I got these boxes and opened them up, and I'm going, ‚ÄúOh my God, this is all the stuff I've written, good or bad, whatever, over the years.‚Äù About a year ago, Justin, who has a home studio, said, ‚ÄúDo you want to go through any of these old [music] folders and files?‚Äù I said, sure. I'd been meaning to get around to taking a look at them, because there was a lot of stuff there that just didn't suit being on any particular album throughout the years.

	











How far back do these songs and recordings date?The first three tracks are from the late Eighties and early Nineties. They were actually labeled as such on old reel-to-reels. When I heard them, I thought, ‚ÄúThese tracks are kind of fun,‚Äù which is what I wanted to get from this experience: remembering what it used to be like to have a bit of fun with music. The vocals are the originals, and so are the guitar and bass, but Justin suggested we get a real drummer and it would change the whole vibe. We did and it feels like the songs have become whole, so to speak, with real drums on them. But very simple tracks. What I love  about them was that they were not overly produced by any means.  


	The songs were probably written anywhere between my 20s and 30s, when all boys want to do is run after girls ‚Äî or boys ‚Äî so it was just coming-of-age songs and loss, and where did it all go wrong? And so nothing new there really, just written in a much more simplified and direct way than maybe I'd write these days. So, the ambition is probably every quarter to throw out an EP with a couple of singles and four or five songs.


	The fourth single, ‚ÄúI Won't Give Up,‚Äù is the last track. I was in Los Angeles 10 years ago and met Andrew Watt, who was just coming into the fray with music. He was working at a tiny little studio and said, ‚ÄúJules, have you got anything you want to work on?‚Äù I had the lyrics and verses of that song, from 20 or 30 years ago, and Andrew said, ‚ÄúWhy not try switching that and doing that?‚Äù Justin eventually came up with a bridge and a solo, which finished the song. It sounds like the last song on an EP to me: the ‚Äúbig arena ballad‚Äù kind of thing at the end.


What memories did hearing older songs trigger of your first album and the start of your career shortly before that?To be honest with you, the first two albums feel like another lifetime, a time and a place and an age and experience. There was a lot of naivete with the first album. I didn't know the downfalls and the negativity that could come from certain things not being accepted. As a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed kid going, ‚ÄúHi, I'm Julian!‚Äù I didn't really understand what I was in for. Had no frigging clue.


	I'm also in the very, very beginning of putting together my memoir, which I don't want to do in the usual manner. I don't want to do, ‚ÄúI was born here. These are my parents. This is what happened. Blah, blah, blah.‚Äù I came up with another approach to doing it, which I can't tell you about, unfortunately, otherwise it would give the game away. But that's a project I need to spend time on. I've had an assistant who has been interviewing old friends of mine for recollections, times and places, how we met.  

	











Will there be a section on the mullet years?The mullet years? [Dismayed expression] Well, listen, the mullet is back, isn't it, in force? Yeah, that's very scary. Well, the mullet years ‚Ä¶ I don't know about that. No doubt there'll be a few pictures about that.  


Have you interviewed Sean and Yoko for the book?I've talked to Sean. Yoko, no, because I haven't seen her for a long, long time. Last time was actually at George Martin's memorial, which was quite a while ago [2016]. But I can only wish her well. Sean tells me what he can, when he can, what he feels like telling me. I don't push anything. I love him, and just want to a have a happy, brotherly, supportive relationship with him.  


Even though you're still in the midst of the memoir, what would you want people to take out of it about your life?There are still people who are very confused about how I lived, when dad actually left, how mother, Mum, was treated, and how we looked after ourselves for many years. And how, as much as I love Sean and I'm fine with Yoko, I've been so distanced from my own family and my own father's life and work. I'm on the outside of things. I always have been, since the age of five. Mom and I made our own way most of my life. Dad did help with food and clothing and school. But many people misunderstand that and believe that I'm still and always have been in the mix and that I've been swimming in mountains of money. That's never been the case for me. So, there are a few things here and there I feel need to be corrected. But mostly, it's the fact that I've had some extremely weird life experiences, more often than not, likely due to being John's son.


What comes to mind as weird?I was a pretty shy kid and had to go to a new school in the north [of England], where my mother partially lived, when I was 12 or 13. I recall going to the morning assembly, where you'd sing a couple of hymns and teachers would say a couple of things. It was the first day of school and I'm crapping myself anyway because I was very uncomfortable being in a position of not knowing anybody. And the headmaster gets up at the end of the session and says, ‚ÄúWe'd like to introduce some of the new staff members. And we also have Julian Lennon, the son of John Lennon from the Beatles.‚Äù And I'm going, ‚ÄúYou motherfucker.‚Äù Sorry for my French, but really, you just did that to me in a brand-new school, and now I'm going to have to deal with that shit? Fortunately, most kids of that age, it went over their heads.  

	











Maybe he said that to make the school seem prestigious?Well, I don't know. The last school I was in, I went back years ago and they have a yearbook, as with most schools. And apart from a photograph, I wasn't mentioned anywhere, so it didn't make any bloody difference, let me tell you! I'm not sure they were proud at all. It was probably the opposite. I was the first guy that started a band in the school ever, and they weren't too keen on that.  


Speaking of your childhood, we've all heard about the four separate Beatles biopics in the works. What do you know about the one on your father?Normally I'm kept out of all the Apple and Beatles stuff. Sean and I have a great relationship, but he can't even talk to me about that stuff legally, which is a little uncomfortable, because he wants to tell me stuff, but he can't. But Sean got in touch and said, ‚ÄúListen, Sam Mendes wants to get in touch.‚Äù I went, ‚ÄúReally? Why?‚Äù I hadn't even heard of the four new Beatles films. And initially, I just thought to myself, ‚ÄúYou've got to be kidding me. Another freaking Beatles film? Haven't we had enough?‚Äù [Laughs]


What happened next?Sam and I met earlier this year and had lunch. He was an absolute gentleman. He said, ‚ÄúListen, I wondered if you had any quirky or kooky stories or memories you might have had.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúThere are things I remember, but there's no real clarity on that stuff.‚Äù I was three or four years old. Then he said, ‚ÄúThe most important thing for me, Jules, is that I want to make sure that your story and your mother's story are told with absolute clarity and truth, whatever that means.‚Äù And I just said, ‚ÄúI truly appreciate that.‚Äù I thought the idea of this was bonkers from the get-go, but then I fell in love with it, and now I'm more intrigued than anything else to see how he's going to deliver on this. It inspires me to believe that Mum, more than anybody, will be seen in a good light. She has always been seen as very gracious and very honorable, so I just hope that comes across.


And someone will be playing you?Apparently so! So, that'll be interesting too. In fact, I just left London after a charity thing I did for AmfAR [the nonprofit organization devoted to AIDS research] and Sean was just flying in and said, ‚ÄúJules, do you want to go meet up and go down to the set to see how things are going?‚Äù I would have loved to, but I was flying back [to the States], so maybe later in the year or however things turn out. Sean does include me in as much as he can, and I'm thankful for that.  

	











Will you get a chance to read the script?I know that Apple and the Beatles have a say in that. And Sean has asked me to read the script with him as well to see if anything rubs us not the wrong way, because, again, from Sam's perspective, he wants this to be the truth as best it can be told. I'll be certainly intrigued to have that chance to read it when I get the opportunity. I just hope it shines a light on everything and everyone. It would be nice if it's a good thing. 


The fascination with the Beatles continues, doesn't it?Forever and forevermore. A friend asked me, ‚ÄúDo you think this is going to go on?‚Äù I said, well, the movies and everything still keep coming out. There's always something going on. Whether that resonates with the younger generations, who knows? But I think these films will certainly draw in some serious intrigue from all age groups.  


As hard to believe as it is, this December will be 45 years since we lost your father.It's very weird because it was such a long time ago. When I was just in London, I went back to my hotel room, and there were limited TV channels, and there were a couple of back-to-back documentaries about Dad, which I watched. But even though that was a tough relationship, the distance and everything, I forget how much he achieved, and the originality and authenticity of him and his being. And so the older I grow, the more I'm inspired by him.


	Which is a good thing but also a sad thing, because right towards the end was when we started speaking again. The idea of seeing each other a lot more was the plan. So sadly, that's not the case. But I speak to him every once in a while, as I do my mother. I go and hug a tree and I wish all my family and friends that have passed love, as we all do under those circumstances.


I live close to the Dakota and tourists still stop in front of the entrance every day and take photos.That whole thing is very, very weird. I'm kind of thankful I don't live in New York.

As far as your new EP, what are your expectations at this point?I don't have any. I think it's best not to have any. I think, ‚ÄúDo the work.‚Äù I'm a big fan of Rick Rubin, who often says, ‚ÄúJust do the work. Put it out there after you've done it. That's nothing to do with you anymore. It's for the rest of the world to take on what that means to them.‚Äù And I believe there's nothing I can do to make anything better or worse in that light.

Elon Musk is a fan of movies, or pretends to be. He claims that we're living in a simulation like the one depicted in The Matrix, and that he is one of the chosen few who perceives its structure. He says that Tesla‚Äòs Cybertruck is ‚Äúwhat Bladerunner would have driven,‚Äù evidently unaware that the protagonist of Blade Runner has an actual name (Rick Deckard) and pilots a flying car. Most recently, Tesla has rolled out a ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù mode for its so-called Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system, named after a series of films in which characters race turbocharged vehicles through post-apocalyptic wastelands, killing one another in spectacular fashion. (The average American commute, in other words.)


	FSD automates a number of driving tasks, including navigation, steering, acceleration, lane changes, and responses to traffic signals ‚Äî but it still requires an attentive human driver at the wheel to take over in a split second in the event of error. ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù mode was originally a setting for Tesla Autopilot, a less advanced system for steering and cruise control, and has never previously been available for the more comprehensive FSD controls.         

	











	If FSD's Mad Max mode doesn't equip your Model Y with the kinds of explosives or grappling hooks you'd see in the Mad Max franchise, it does deliver in one respect, according to Tesla enthusiasts who have tried it out after upgrading to FSD v14.1.2 in the past week: It puts the pedal to the metal. ‚ÄúMad Max mode is INSANE,‚Äù wrote one fan last week in a post on X, sharing a video that showed his car reaching a speed of 85 miles per hour on a freeway. ‚ÄúIt drives your car like a sports car. If you are running late, this is the mode for you.‚Äù

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The problem, at least from the pesky standpoint of automotive safety, is that a self-driving Tesla on the Mad Max setting will apparently reach those speeds regardless of local limits. Another Tesla influencer on X posted a video in which it piloted his car at 85 mph on a highway where the legal maximum speed ‚Äî by his own admission ‚Äî is 65. Across many states, speeding 20 mph over the limit is punishable by a fine of several hundred dollars and points on your driver's license. ‚ÄúIf you like to drive fast, you're going to love this new mode,‚Äù this driver wrote. ‚ÄúMad Max mode makes the car zoom around town like it's on a mission lol.‚Äù

	Tesla's FSD update described Mad Max as offering ‚Äúhigher speeds and more frequent lane changes‚Äù than ‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù which was previously the most aggressive profile, followed by the more relaxed settings ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù and ‚ÄúChill.‚Äù (With v14.1.2, Tesla has also added ‚ÄúSloth,‚Äù which is even more conservative than ‚ÄúChill.‚Äù) The release also noted: ‚ÄúDriver profile now has a stronger impact on behavior. The more assertive the profile, the higher the max speed.‚Äù Presumably, then, a Tesla owner who often drives well over the limit will find that Mad Max mode seeks to match this habit.


	Software entrepreneur Dan O'Dowd, founder of the tech safety group the Dawn Project and a longtime critic of Tesla FSD, believes the added setting poses a danger to all motorists. ‚ÄúRather than improving road safety, Tesla's latest software update is putting more people at risk,‚Äù he tells Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúDriving in Mad Max mode doesn't just put Tesla owners at risk but also other road users, who did not sign up to be Elon Musk's crash test dummies.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúI have never seen another Fortune 500 CEO show such callous disregard for public safety or the law.‚Äù


	Musk has bet big on fully autonomous driving technology, saying that Tesla will prove essentially worthless without it, though so far it has failed to realize that dream. On Wednesday, he told investors that its robotaxi pilot program would expand beyond Austin and San Francisco to as many as 10 more U.S. cities by the end of the year. As Musk continues to repeat his prediction that a Tesla FSD system with no need for human oversight is right around the corner, the company faces multiple lawsuits over deaths from road accidents involving a Tesla vehicle that had assistance features activated. In August, the company was found partially liable for a fatal 2019 crash in Florida and was ordered to pay a total of about $240 million in compensatory costs and punitive damages.

	Tesla is also under investigation by the Department of Justice over whether it misled customers regarding the self-driving capabilities of their vehicles (despite the name ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving,‚Äù this remains a Level 2 autonomous system, a far cry from the all-encompassing Level 5 automation Musk has promised) and has been the subject of multiple probes by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Just this month, the regulator opened a new inquiry into dozens of reports that Teslas with FSD engaged had violated traffic laws, with some of these incidents leading to collisions and injuries. In most of these cases, a self-driven Tesla allegedly ran a red light or drove on the wrong side of the road.   


	Reached for comment on the apparent traffic violations committed by Teslas in Mad Max mode, NHTSA said in a statement to Rolling Stone that it is ‚Äúin contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,‚Äù noting that the company's FSD system still requires ‚Äúa fully attentive driver who is engaged in the driving task at all times.‚Äù 


	‚ÄúThe human behind the wheel is fully responsible for driving the vehicle and complying with all traffic safety laws,‚Äù the agency said. 


	O'Dowd insists that government intervention is needed. ‚ÄúNHTSA must act now to ban Tesla Full Self-Driving in the interests of public safety,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTesla has wasted critical engineering time developing this juvenile and reckless software mode instead of using that time to fix the litany of critical safety defects that remain present in its defective Full Self-Driving software.‚Äù

	Absent regulatory action, it seems Tesla drivers using the Mad Max setting on FSD will continue to travel at dangerous speeds. In an X Spaces event this week, a user narrated his experience with the new mode as he tried it out for the first time. ‚ÄúIt's going 65 in a 35 right now,‚Äù he announced at one point. ‚ÄúIt sees the speed limit as 35, it's highlighting it on the screen, because I'm going over the speed limit ‚Äî because it's going over the speed limit. It's warning itself.‚Äù


	‚ÄúI'm not quite sure why it completely ignored the sign,‚Äù he said.

	The excitement outside of New York's Beacon Theatre was palpable on Thursday night. Hours before Rolling Stone's Musicians on Musicians franchise took over the Upper West Side venue, fans lined up on the sidewalk off Amsterdam Avenue. Some played patty-cake to pass the time before doors opened, while others sported Paramore tote bags and Bleachers T-shirts. There were even unofficial vendors selling bootleg tees; the cover for our seventh-annual Musicians on Musicians issue of Rolling Stone was printed on each. Clearly, everyone was eager to see the stacked lineup, which included cover stars Hayley Williams and Jack Antonoff, as well as Mar√≠a Zardoya of the Mar√≠as and Role Model. 


	Every year since 2019, the Musicians on Musicians series has brought artists together for wide-ranging, revealing conversations with one another. Last night at the Beacon, presented by Sonesta International Hotels, marked the series' third-annual live event, and it was a vibrant display of the magic that happens when like-minded artists come together in one room.

Saturday Night Live star James Austin Johnson acted as the night's host and he kicked off the evening by cracking some of his trademark deadpan jokes. ‚ÄúI'm really enjoying getting to be the Trump voice guy on SNL,‚Äù Johnson said, referring to his infamous impression of the president during his second term. ‚ÄúAnd how wonderful it is that we get to be here in the Beacon Theatre before it is demolished, to be a part of Donald Trump's ballroom.‚Äù After getting a few more laughs, he invited Zardoya and Role Model, whose real name is Tucker Pillsbury, to join him onstage.

	











	Zardoya and Pillsbury sat in leather chairs at the center of the stage, in what Johnson jokingly called his living room. After praising both Zardoya and Role Model for their inescapable songs from the past year, Johnson started the conversation by asking how the musicians knew they had a hit song on their hands. Zardoya started by talking about ‚ÄúNo One Noticed,‚Äù the 2024 breakthrough track for her band, the Marias. ‚ÄúIt was kind of an anti-hit,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI definitely did not for a second think that it was going to resonate the way that it did.‚Äù Zardoya shared how an 84-year-old friend of the band had a singular response to the song.  ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI've never done drugs, but I think this song sounds like molly,'‚Äù she recounted. Pillsbury was particularly surprised by this reaction. ‚ÄúI've never done molly, but in my head I would go to Kesha or something,‚Äù he said.

	When Johnson asked Pillsbury if he knew that ‚ÄúSally, When the Wine Runs Out‚Äù was going to mark a pivotal moment in his career, the singer kept it real. ‚ÄúI don't think you can predict it ever,‚Äù he said. He used the Mar√≠as' track as the perfect example: ‚ÄúIn your case, it's very cool because it's not this big pop power song with a million things going on,‚Äù he told Zardoya. ‚ÄúYou stayed true to your sound and it worked.‚Äù


	Johnson wanted to know more about Role Model's ongoing series of viral moments where he brings up celebrity guests for live performances of ‚ÄúSally.‚Äù He asked who books the Sallys; Pillsbury said he does. Pillsbury went on to explain that the trend started from an online rumor that the track was written about podcaster Jake Shane. ‚ÄúI was like, it would be funny to just play into that,‚Äù the singer said. In the time since that first ‚ÄúSally‚Äù guest appearance, Zardoya has also joined Pillsbury onstage for the song (as have Charli XCX, Olivia Rodrigo, Conan Gray, Natalie Portman, the Dare, and many others). ‚ÄúIt was a sweet moment,‚Äù she said, recalling how her Mar√≠as bandmates cheered her on from side stage.


	The pair also talked about how their music was once categorized under the term ‚Äúbedroom pop‚Äù when they first started releasing it. Zardoya descrbed it as ‚Äújust a term.‚Äù Pillsbury was similarly ambivalent about the label. ‚ÄúWe all literally made it out of the bedroom,‚Äù he said, noting that many of the artists grouped under that description a few years ago have gone on to mainstream success.

	Next, the night segued into its first musical performance. Zardoya joined Role Model's backing band and her Mar√≠as co-founder Josh Conway on the guitar to deliver an entrancing set. In a black silk maxi-dress, she glided effortlessly around the stage, as if she was floating on a cloud. Zardoya shared an intimate moment with a die-hard fan as she sang ‚ÄúSienna‚Äù directly to them, holding their hand in hers. She closed out her set with Pillsbury backing her on ‚ÄúNo One Noticed‚Äù as she softly strummed an electric guitar.


	Pillsbury stayed onstage and brought the crowd to their feet. ‚ÄúDamn, I thought this was a corporate event, but everyone got up,‚Äù he joked before diving into a set full of raucous sing-alongs. Pillsbury leaned into his internet virality when he commanded the crowed to ‚Äúmake [him] look good tonight‚Äù for his popular TikTok track ‚ÄúSome Protector.‚Äù The audience responded by screaming nearly every word to the bridge, and upped the decibel levels for ‚ÄúSally.‚Äù It didn't even matter that Pillsbury opted to not have a guest for this specific performance ‚Äî the audience was loving it all the same.


	The vivacious crowd welcomed a brief intermission before Williams and Antonoff took the stage for their conversation. As soon as Williams sat down, she and Johnson started bonding over their shared Nashville roots. ‚ÄúWe got hot chicken, we got churches, we got bachelorette parties,‚Äù Johnson said, before asking Williams if her new solo album, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, was named after one occasion in particular. ‚ÄúLiving in Nashville is the bachelor party,‚Äù she responded.


	Johnson complimented Williams' new song ‚ÄúTrue Believer‚Äù off her album and noted its references to their shared hometown. ‚ÄúIt's a tiny blue dot in a red state, in the middle of everything we're going through right now,‚Äù Williams said of Music City. ‚ÄúIt just felt like I needed a snapshot of something that's on the ground,‚Äù she added.


	The political climate in the U.S. was omnipresent in the discussion between Williams, Antonoff, and Johnson, even as the two cover stars reminisced about their years-long friendship. At one point, the Bleachers frontman point-blank asked Johnson if Trump has ever contacted him over his ongoing impression. Johnson answered the only way he knew how: with a scary-good Trump impression. (He added that the president has yet to contact him directly.) Williams cackled and made sure to stress that Johnson's humor ‚Äúis helping us survive the worst times.‚Äù

	











	Antonoff spoke about how touring around the country acts as another salve to the current political turmoil, even as artists get front-row seats to how the nation is changing. ‚ÄúTouring is a real exercise in an amazing darkness and an amazing hope,‚Äù he said, emphasizing his optimistic outlook to ‚Äúhave a lot of hope in most of the people.‚Äù 


	Both Williams and Antonoff also bonded over shared tour memories. The Paramore singer even pulled out an inside joke about ‚Äúsandwiches with faces‚Äù that no one got, but it didn't matter because Antonoff remembered it. No matter what the pair talked about, whether it was sharing new music for each other early in their careers or meeting at Bamboozle Fest in the 2000s, their strong bond was evident. 


	Finally, it was time for Williams and Antonoff to show off their musical chemistry with a very special joint performance. Each harmonized on the other's songs, and Bleachers backed them both up ‚Äî saxophones and all. Williams jumped right in with the energetic rocker ‚ÄúMirtazapine,‚Äù which she and Antonoff live debuted at Newport Folk Festival this past summer. The pair seamlessly weaved between their catalogs, switching off on the melody and harmonies, delivering a true rock & roll party that got better with each song.


	Antonoff nearly brought the house down with a rare performance of Bleachers' 2024 ballad ‚ÄúMerry Christmas, Please Don't Call.‚Äù The song's cinematic chords echoed in the theater as Antonoff embodied his best Springsteen. Williams, meanwhile, gave two of the best tracks from Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party ‚Äî ‚ÄúKill Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúLove Me Different‚Äù ‚Äî very memorable live debuts with Bleachers backing her. Then she went one further, performing a new track she'd just released a few hours earlier. It's called ‚ÄúGood Ol' Days‚Äù, and it's full of references to her long career with Paramore. She performed it with buoyant confidence that was fitting for lyrics like ‚ÄúCall me Miss Paramour.‚Äù

	The gems that both musicians pulled out for their performance seemed to be just for those dedicated fans who waited in line before the show. And just when it didn't seem possible, those fans sang along with Antonoff and Williams louder than they had all night. Earlier in the conversation, Williams summed up the symbiotic experience of touring best: ‚ÄúWe see people in the sweetest moments and they get to experience that with us too.‚Äù

	These days, they are so many reasons to wake up in the middle of the night, bathed in your own cold sweat: the erosion of basic civil liberties, the rising tide of authoritarian rule (and lack of a rapid-response political resistance), the increasing number of goon squads conspicuously showing up in American cities, the sustained popularity of Love Is Blind. Kathryn Bigelow is here to remind you of one more waking nightmare that you may have conveniently forgotten about: the chance of an impromptu nuclear holocaust! A House of Dynamite, which drops on Netflix today after a three-week theatrical run, opens with the statement, ‚ÄúAt the end of the Cold War, global powers reached a consensus that the world would be better off with fewer nuclear weapons.‚Äù Then the Hurt Locker director drops the hammer: ‚ÄúThat era is now over.‚Äù Great. Awesome. Where did I put those Xanax again?


	An Oscar-winning filmmaker who specializes in profile-in-courage portraits of professionalism and thrillers that shred even the most steel-belted nervous systems, Bigelow is completely in her element with this story of how easy it might be for a rogue power to launch an attack on the United States. And for the first 30 or so minutes of the exercise in extreme what-if‚Äìism, you genuinely feel your blood pressure spiking. Everything initially seems perfectly normal on this morning in America. A major (Anthony Ramos) at a missile-defense base snipes at a co-worker about eating chips on duty. A four-star general (Tracy Letts) chats about last night's ball game while waltzing into a command center in Nebraska. Pilots stationed in the South Pacific take an early morning dip in the sea. Various Beltway workers catch the bus or commute into D.C. with their significant others, including Captain Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson). She's been up half the night with a feverish kid, but hey, someone's gotta run the White House Situation Room.

	











	When an alert signals that some random ICBM in mid-flight has just been spotted ‚Äî exactly where it was launched from and by whom is unknown ‚Äî no one is particularly concerned. The idea is that someone is conducting tests, or possibly making a passive-aggressive power flex in the region; it's the third time something like this has happened since Christmas, Walker notes to her superior (Jason Clarke). Then one of the soldiers in Alaska notes that the ‚Äúinclination is flattening‚Äù for the identified flying object. Translation: This is not a test. And if the missile is not stopped by the military's ground-based interceptors, it's likely to make impact somewhere around the city of Chicago in about 19 minutes.

	Once the threat level jumps to Defcon 1, so does the movie, and the cross-cutting between various parties issuing emergency orders and assessing the situation in terse acronym-heavy jargon begins in earnest. Watching high-ranking officials gravely discussing potential death rates, possible motives, and likely bad actors that may be responsible (could be Russia, could be North Korea, there's a lot of chatter happening in the Middle East), you're reminded what's been missing on screens since Bigelow gave us Detroit in 2017. Few working directors know how to tighten screws with more efficiency and effectiveness, not to mention that she knows a thing or two about ticking time bombs. Her first film in eight years underlines Bigelow's facility for making authentic political potboilers paced somewhere between ‚Äúrelentless‚Äù and ‚Äútotal fucking panic attack.‚Äù


	Then, with touchdown imminent, evacuations in full swing, and everyone waiting for orders from the Commander-in-Chief, the clock is suddenly reset. We're back to square one, with everything now seen from new angles and different perspectives. Folks who may have been fleeting presences, or reduced to talking heads in tiny squares on a group Zoom ‚Äî like the Secretary of Defense (Jared Harris) or a fresh-faced Deputy National Security Advisor (The Night Agent‚Äòs Gabriel Basso) ‚Äî become lead protagonists. Bigelow and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim will do this a third time before A House of Dynamite is done, relighting its fuse so we can eventually follow the film's POTUS (Idris Elba) as he wrestles with the moral dilemma of To Bomb or Not to Bomb? But it's somewhere within the middle of that first rewind that you begin to realize, with a feeling of dread in your belly: This is not the Armageddon procedural you're looking for.

	If the idea was to create extra tension by continually going back to zero and ramping up to 100 mph, the end result is merely a series of deflations that keeps slowing the momentum. It's feels less like an extension or expansion of an in-progress catastrophe and more like a cheap formal gimmick. And if the notion that following a host of individuals will offer a panoply of responses to the unthinkable, it might help to actually develop those individuals past a few traits and tics (this person's wife is pregnant, this person has a daughter in Chicago, this person is the First Lady). We never thought we'd say this, but we actually wished that Bigelow had slowed things down a tad, giving these characters room to breathe, and us a chance to know them better before reducing them to ants scurrying around a kicked anthill. The thought of her going full Altman with an ensemble piece like this is tantalizing in theory. But when you're giving first-rate actors just enough to not be background players, yet not enough for viewers to become fully invested in any of them, you've got a serious problem on your hands.

	In a perfect world, A House of Dynamite would either boil everything down to an extra-taut 90 minutes, pulling and stretching that 19-minute warning like taffy and leading up to a series of simultaneously colliding climaxes. Or it would be over three hours long, and allow audiences to truly get to know some of these policy wonks, security experts, and military brass. We personally would have watched a whole film devoted to Letts' general and his second-in-command, played by Gbenga Akinnagbe. Nobody can toss off authoritative snark or deliver dialogue through gritted teeth better than the playwright-actor, and Akinnagbe is the type of performer who excels in fleshing out supporting parts (his work in The Wire alone is a testament to making the most of minimal screen time). The double act they have in the middle section makes you lean in every time they exchange thoughts on what brought them to this do-or-die moment. Then the movie switches away to somebody somewhere else wringing hands and barking into phones, stopping just long enough to let you register that, right, Greta Lee and Moses Ingram and Kaitlyn Dever are in this drama as well, kinda sorta, and you find yourself slumping back in your seat.


	There's a moment late in A House of Dynamite where we find ourselves in the cockpit of a jet, receiving incoming orders that they should be ready to drop a payload should POTUS decide that's the course of action. Then we quickly cut to a sign in a military command center under a map charting the missile's arc, which says: The Big Board. A Dr. Strangelove shoutout by any other name smells just as sweet. What the film strives for, of course, is to be the serious version of Strangelove ‚Äî something like Fail-Safe, the 1964 thriller that tackled the same topic with a doomsday rigor and the shadow of Shiva hovering over every tightly edited sequence and every claustrophobic close-up. Even before an ending designed to avoid resolution and cause moviegoers to stifle screams of ‚ÄúWait, seriously?‚Äù this well-intentioned look at how close we are to the brink of extinction is the cinematic equivalent of an unexploded ordnance. For something so blessed with timeliness and talent, it leaves you feeling like you're buried in a hovel of disappointment.

	Most music biopics take place in a world of alternative facts where Queen broke up before Live Aid, Elton John named himself after John Lennon, M√∂tley Cr√ºe‚Äòs Vince Neil sang Billy Squier's ‚ÄúMy Kind of Lover‚Äù before it was released, Amy Winehouse didn't thank ‚ÄúBlake Incarcerated‚Äù at the Grammys, and Bob Dylan hooked up with Joan Baez the night of the Cuban Missile Crisis. These movies stretched the truth so thin that ‚ÄúWeird Al‚Äù Yankovic was inspired to make a glorious film about his life that was 100 percent factually inaccurate, culminating in a scene where (spoiler alert!) he's gunned down at the 1985 Grammys by a hitman working for Madonna.


	Every once in a while, however, a movie comes along that sticks shockingly close to the truth. It happened in 2014 with the Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy, even though the timeline was occasionally massaged a bit, and it's happened again with the upcoming movie Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Much like Love & Mercy, Deliver Me From Nowhere makes no attempt to tell the entire story of a great artist's life. It instead focuses squarely on the narrow window of time between 1981 and 1982 when Springsteen recorded his lo-fi masterpiece Nebraska, convinced his label to release it without modifications, and struggled with depression and his inability to connect with a romantic partner. Along the way, it flashes back to the Fifties and Springsteen's difficult relationship with his father.

	











	We normally focus on factual errors when music biopics roll out, but we're taking a different course this time since this one got all the big things right, and only cheated around the margins, most notably with the creation of a composite character. It should be noted that Springsteen was involved in this movie from the very beginning, and was present on set for much of the filming. He clearly helped them make most everything in the film accurate to his life and experiences. (This article is packed with spoilers, so we encourage you to only read after you've seen the movie.)

	Yes. The movie begins in the 1950s with Springsteen's mother, Adele (Gabby Hoffman), driving a young Bruce (Matthew Anthony Pellicano) up to a dingy bar and asking him to go inside. ‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMom said it's time to go home.‚Äù This might seem like a Hollywood flourish, but it's taken straight from the script of Bruce on Broadway, the star's successful one-man show that premiered in 2017.


	‚ÄúThis both thrilled and terrified me,‚Äù Springsteen told the crowd every night. ‚ÄúIt thrilled me because I had been given the license by my mother, the law, to go into the bar! I'm a kid! But it terrified me because to enter the bar is to enter my father's privileged, private, and sacred space. He was not to be disturbed when he's down at the bar. Everybody knew that‚Ä¶ I would stand there lost in the noise and the hustle of the crowd and I would drink in that dim smell of beer and booze and aftershave. Now, to a kid, that was the scent of adulthood. It was the scent of manhood. I wanted some of that.‚Äù


	Yes. The movie jumps from young Bruce at the bar right to the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati on Sept. 14, 1981. As the film correctly states, this was the last stop of the River tour. It's our first glimpse of Jeremy Allen White as adult Springsteen, and he's playing ‚ÄúBorn to Run‚Äù with the E Street Band. This was indeed one of the last songs of the set, though he closed out with ‚ÄúQuarter to Three‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDetroit Medley.‚Äù In a dressing room, a winded Bruce is met by manager Jon Landau (Jeremy Strong) and given the keys to a rental house in Colt's Neck, New Jersey, where he'll record Nebraska.

	In real life, Springsteen first went to Honolulu, Hawaii, to serve as the best man at saxophonist Clarence Clemons' wedding. The full E Street Band played at the reception. We can forgive Deliver Me From Nowhere for not mentioning this, since it has nothing to do with the Nebraska narrative. Also, it would have meant giving Clemons a speaking role in the film. Actor Judah Sealy looks very much like Clemons circa 1981, but no member of the E Street Band says a single word in this movie. This wasn't done out of cruelty. The movie is just simply not their story.


	Yes. Springsteen had a lot of free time on his hands throughout 1982, and he often hung out at the Stone Pony and other bars throughout New Jersey, like Big Men's West or Royal Manor North. It didn't take much to coax him onto the stage with whomever happened to be playing in Asbury Park. In May of that year, he began a Sunday-night tradition of jamming with Stone Pony house band Cats on a Smooth Surface, led by guitarist Bobby Bandiera, that carried on through October.

	











	In Deliver Me From Nowhere, we see Springsteen performing ‚ÄúLucille‚Äù at the Pony before he even starts creating Nebraska. To be a stickler, he started recording the album in December 1981, and the Cats on a Smooth Surface residency didn't start until May 1982. But ‚ÄúLucille‚Äù was indeed in their live repertoire. (As long as we're being sticklers, their portrayal of Bandiera as a long-haired, Bob Seger-like wild man is a bit off-model compared to the real guy.)


	No. A major plot point of Deliver Me From Nowhere is Springsteen's relationship with a young single mother named Faye Romano, played by Odessa Young. This is a composite character based on several girlfriends Springsteen had during this period. Model/actress Joyce Hyser isn't mentioned in the movie, but she was with him from 1978 through 1982. When they split, he had a series of short-term relationships. In his 2016 memoir, Born to Run, he refers only to a ‚Äúlovely 20-year-old girlfriend‚Äù from this time. Hyser was 25 years old in 1982, so he's presumably referring to someone else that he didn't want to make a character in the film for understandable reasons.


	Yes. In Born to Run, Springsteen writes bluntly about the trouble he had maintaining relationships with women. ‚ÄúTwo years inside of any relationship and it would simply stop,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs soon as I got close to exploring my frailties, I was gone. You were gone. One pull of the pin, it'd be over and I'd be down the road, tucking another sad ending in my pack. It was rarely the women themselves I was trying to get away from. I had many lovely girlfriends I cared for and who really cared for me. It was what they triggered, the emotional exposure, the implications of a life of commitments and family burdens.‚Ä¶ With the end of each affair, I'd feel a sad relief from the suffocating claustrophobia love had brought me.‚Äù


	Yes. In one of the most harrowing scenes in the movie, a drunken Douglas Springsteen cajoles a young Bruce into a bedroom slapping game that begins to border on genuine physical abuse. (It's unclear if this ever happened.) He then sneaks up behind his father during a vicious argument with his mother and smacks him in the back with a baseball bat.

	











	According to Born to Run, this actually happened. ‚ÄúThey were standing in the kitchen, my father's back to me, my mother inches away from his face while he was yelling at the top of his lungs,‚Äù Springsteen wrote. ‚ÄúI shouted at him to stop. Then I let him have it square between his broad shoulders, a sick thud, and everything grew quiet. He turned, his face barroom red; the moment lengthened, then he started laughing. The argument stopped; it became one of his favorite stories and he'd always tell me, ‚ÄòDon't let anybody hurt your mom.'‚Äù This is the exact line that Douglas says to Bruce in the movie.


	Yes. Once movie Bruce settles into his Colt's Neck home, he flips through the channels and comes across a hilariously Eighties exercise class, The Price Is Right, a split-second of original VJ Mark Goodman on MTV, and then a broadcast of the 1973 Terrence Malick film Badlands. The movie is a fictionalized account of real-life serial killer Charles Starkweather and his teenage accomplice, Caril Ann Fugate. This captures Springsteen's attention, and we later see him reading a book about the murders, and even scrolling through archival newspaper accounts on microfiche at the library. He begins writing a song called ‚ÄúStarkweather‚Äù that he eventually retitles ‚ÄúNebraska,‚Äù shifting it from third person to first person. This is exactly how it all went down.


	Yes. In the movie, Paul Walter Hauser portrays Springsteen's guitar tech Mike Batlan, who sets him up with a four-track TEAC Tascam Series 144 tape recorder in a bedroom of the Colt's Neck property. They run the tape through a Gibson guitar echo unit to give it reverb. Despite his limited recording knowledge, Batlan sets this all up himself, and records Springsteen while sitting on a bed. It's presented in the movie exactly how it happened, though the real Batlan was considerably slimmer than the actor playing him. (Later, in 1987, Batlan and fellow guitar tech Douglas Sutphin sued Springsteen for unpaid overtime, unlawful fines, and emotional distress. The case dragged on for years before they finally settled out of court in 1991. In more recent years, Batlan fell on some hard times.)


	Yes. In 1981, screenwriter Paul Schrader had the idea for a movie about two brothers playing in a bar band; he called it Born in the U.S.A. He passed the script o nto Jon Landau in the hopes that Springsteen would play one of the lead roles. Springsteen had little interest in an acting career, but he did like the title enough to use it for an in-progress song he'd been calling ‚ÄúVietnam.‚Äù The movie presents this the way it happened.

	











	It doesn't mention that Schrader eventually had to rename the movie since people would presume he took the title from Springsteen, as opposed to the other way around. It came out in 1987 as Light of Day, with Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett in the lead roles. Springsteen contributed a song of that name to the movie soundtrack, and it's a part of his live repertoire to this day. Schrader has no hard feelings about Bruce taking his title, and even attended the premiere of Deliver Me From Nowhere.


	Yes. Springsteen briefly forgot about this when he spoke to Rolling Stone earlier this year, but he did attempt to record many of these songs with the E Street Band; those ‚Äúelectric Nebraska‚Äù versions were then put aside for decades, growing to mythic status for many fans, before being released this fall as part of a new box set. The film shows how it all went down. ‚ÄúWe're losing everything I like about the demo tape,‚Äù movie Bruce tells Landau and his engineers after trying the full-band arrangements. ‚ÄúThis [demo tape] has something. It's got the atmosphere, rawness, the right kind of echo. This just doesn't have it. The band is overpowering the material and we're losing what makes it special. We gotta strip it down, let it breathe.‚Äù


	Yes. In a moment of great frustration, movie Bruce takes Landau outside of the recording studio and vents that the sessions aren't working. ‚ÄúWe've got an incredible take on ‚ÄòCover Me,' which thankfully we didn't give to Donna Summer,‚Äù says movie Landau. ‚ÄúWe have ‚ÄòGlory Days,' ‚ÄòI'm Going Down,' and a knockout ‚ÄòI'm on Fire.' Don't forget you've got ‚ÄòBorn in the U.S.A.' Did I tell you what [producer Jimmy Iovine] said about ‚ÄòBorn in the U.S.A.'? He was blown away. He said the album is done. It can be ‚ÄòBorn in the U.S.A.' and 10 other tracks and nobody would care. He said with that song leading, nothing else matters.‚Äù Springsteen did indeed have all these songs at this point, and ‚ÄúCover Me‚Äù was indeed initially written for Donna Summer. (Notice now movie Landau didn't mention ‚ÄúDancing in the Dark.‚Äù That one wasn't written until 1984.)


	Yes. Midway through the movie, Springsteen's mother calls him in a panicked state. ‚ÄúHe's lost somewhere in Los Angeles,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe can't find him. It's been three days. He was arrested out in the desert over a traffic ticket. They took him down to the county jail. The last thing I heard, they let him out. He was in an alley in Chinatown. Can you come find him?‚Äù Springsteen describes this exact situation in his book, but it's unclear when it happened, and it's quite likely the film moved it to 1982 so Springsteen could have a scene with his father as an adult.

	











	Yes. For many years, Bruce made it seem like his struggles to connect with his father were largely a result of an immense generation gap. It was only after Douglas Springsteen died in 1998 that Bruce slowly began to reveal that his father suffered from a deep mental illness. Things finally changed in the last decade of his life. ‚ÄúModern pharmacological medicine gave my father 10 extra years of life and a peace he might never have had,‚Äù Springsteen wrote in Born to Run. ‚ÄúHe and my mother got to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. He got to know his grandchildren and we became much closer. He became easier to reach, to know and love. I'd always heard my father in his youth described as ‚Äòfull of the devil,' ‚Äòrakish,' ‚Äòfull of fun,' as someone who loved to dance. I had never seen it. I only saw the lonely brooding man, always on edge, disappointed, never at home or at rest. But in the last years of his life, his softness came to the fore.‚Äù

	Yes. Springsteen's lifelong buddy Steve Van Zandt is a mute presence in the movie, and it's easy to miss his scenes if you blink. But a lot of screen time is given to Springsteen's childhood friend Matt Delia, portrayed by Australian actor Harrison Sloan Gilbertson. When Nebraska was done, they packed up a '69 Ford XL and moved Bruce out to Los Angeles, where he'd remain for much of the next decade.


	Somewhere along the way, they stop at a county fair, where Springsteen is overcome with emotion and nearly loses consciousness. This seems like a screenwriter's fantasy, but Springsteen describes the moment in his book. ‚ÄúA despair overcomes me,‚Äù Springsteen writes. ‚ÄúI feel an envy of these men and women and their late-summer ritual, the small pleasures that bind them and this town together. Now, for all I know, these folks may hate this one-dog dump and each other's guts and be screwing one another's husbands and wives like rabbits. Why wouldn't they? But right now, all I can think of is that I want to be amongst them, of them, and I know I can't. I can only watch.‚Äù

A viral video claiming to show a fleet of unidentified flying objects streaking across Japan's night sky has sparked feverish online debate.

While some users insist it's 'proof of alien activity,' experts and officials caution that the footage likely depicts drones, aircraft, or optical illusions rather than extraterrestrial visitors.

The clip, posted earlier this week on social media platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube, shows multiple bright objects racing in apparent formation before disappearing into the distance. Eyewitnesses described the lights as 'faster than any jet' and 'blinking in unison.'

As of Friday, no official confirmation has been issued by the Japanese government or Self-Defence Forces. However, analysts say the incident fits a broader regional surge in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) reports across East Asia.

The sighting comes as Japan intensifies its efforts to investigate unexplained aerial phenomena. In June 2024, more than 80 lawmakers formed a parliamentary group to study UAPs, following a US Department of Defence report that labelled East Asia‚Äîfrom western Japan to China‚Äîa 'hotspot' for sightings, according to CBS News.

Former Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada warned that 'leaving something unknown is a problem for national security,' adding that some objects could represent foreign surveillance drones, not alien craft, as cited by Popular Mechanics.

Japan's Self-Defence Forces are now working with US military officials to standardise reporting protocols, while civil aviation authorities assess potential safety risks to commercial aircraft.

Video analysts and atmospheric scientists have urged caution before jumping to conclusions. In the viral footage, the supposed UFOs appear to move in straight lines and at uniform speed, behaviours consistent with aircraft formations or meteors.

'The combination of consumer-grade cameras, long exposure, and motion blur can easily make normal lights look like high-speed anomalies,' one aerospace researcher explained to Popular Mechanics.

Science communicator Mick West added that Japan's reputation as a 'UFO hotspot' partly stems from heavy webcam coverage in areas such as Fukushima, where countless cameras constantly monitor the skies.

While no evidence suggests deliberate fakery, several possibilities are being considered:

Until Japanese defence or weather agencies confirm radar data or eyewitness reports from multiple locations, analysts say the 'fleet' remains unverified.

Japan is now one of the world's most active centres for UAP and UFO research. A Popular Mechanics report found the country records hundreds of aerial anomalies each year, driven by both public fascination and official acknowledgement of unknown phenomena.

Security analysts say the recent video underscores the challenge of distinguishing credible scientific evidence from viral misinformation. 'Whether atmospheric illusion or something else, this is exactly why Japan is formalising its UAP protocols,' a Tokyo-based defence analyst told IBTimes UK.

As of this week, no independent evidence supports claims that the Japan footage shows non-terrestrial craft. Yet the sighting highlights both public appetite for UFO stories and the growing need for scientific transparency.

For now, experts agree: the footage should be analysed objectively, not sensationalised. Whether the lights were drones, meteors, or something truly unknown, the event reaffirms that mystery still lingers above even the world's most closely watched skies.

A resident from New York state says that they witnessed quite an unusual sight late night October 17. The unidentified person says they saw the object as they were driving on one of the area's major interstates. The account states that the weird, flying craft moved in a ""zigzag"" motion, with an estimated speed of 100 to 200 MPH.

A resident in East Hampton filed a report to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center that they witnessed a flying object late night October 17. The witness claims the orb was a ""red orb moving in a zigzag at low altitude the sped away heading southeast"".

See Also: New York State Resident Reports Possible UFO Abduction

The report states that the witnesses was ""driving south on interstate 87 when the red orb appeared to be hovering just over the trees"". Then, the person says the orb ""moved westbound over the highway"" out of sight. However, the report alleges a ""few seconds later it appeared to be moving eastbound until it was out of sight again"".

The orb then moved westbound until it was barely visible through the trees, according to the report. The witness says that the object made no sound, and was moving much faster than their car, before veering off out of sight.

New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings. As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though.

Enigma, a popular UFO reporting app, monitors unusual aerial activity. However, they also receive reports of objects emerging from bodies of water or traveling underwater. Enigma has recently released a collection that serves as a repository for these reports and includes a history of anomalous underwater reports and statistics on the reports they have received.

Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) refer to any object or phenomenon detected underwater that cannot be immediately identified or explained. The term is similar to UFO/UAP but applies specifically to subsurface or underwater contexts. From medieval chronicles to present-day Navy radar logs, witnesses have reported observations both with the naked eye and through sensors like sonar. They are often described as moving at extraordinary speeds, taking sudden changes of direction with impossible precision, and transitioning between water and air without leaving a ripple ‚Äî‚Äútransmedium‚Äù capabilities.

USO reports go back to the 11th century when witnesses in England reported seeing a fiery object that ‚Äúrevolved, ascended on high, and then descended into the sea,‚Äù repeatedly reappearing off the Northumberland coast.

In a famous report from 1825, English naturalist Andrew Bloxam, sailing on the HMS Blonde, witnessed a red, luminous orb rising from the sea. He wrote that it was ‚Äúthe color of a red-hot [cannon] shot‚Äù and bright enough that ‚Äúa pin might be picked up on deck.‚Äù The orb rose and fell twice before vanishing from sight. 

Reports continue to this day. Veteran Navy sonar operator Aaron Amick has noted that unusual ‚Äúfast mover‚Äù contacts occasionally appear on sonar, but they are ‚Äúso quick that you can't measure the speed."" 

In his November 2024 testimony before the House Oversight Committee, Former Naval Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet made it clear that he sees these objects and incidents as a serious national security risk. 

Of the reports Enigma has collected, two include mysterious lights moving below the ocean's surface captured on phone cameras, and seafarers reporting objects coming up from the deep.

The most striking video is of two mysterious underwater lights captured from a boat.

As of August 2025, the Enigma app has logged over 9,000 U.S. sightings within 10 miles of shorelines and major waterways. Approximately 1,500 of those reports specifically mention ‚Äúwater,‚Äù ‚Äúocean,‚Äù ‚Äúlake,‚Äù or ‚Äúbeach‚Äù (‚âà17%), and roughly 500 of those occurred within 5 miles of a coastline (‚âà5.6% of the total). More than 150 reports describe objects hovering above or ascending into or descending from bodies of water. The U.S. states with the most USO reports are California (389) and Florida (306), which is not surprising, given their large coastal populations.

The track bridges classic groove and modern edge, channeling Mochakk's knack for blending timeless energy with forward-thinking production. Following the momentum of his previous release ‚ÄòLegumes', the Brazilian talent continues to expand his boundary-pushing discography, which already boasts standout records on Ninja Tune, Atlantic, Circoloco, Defected, and more.

Mochakk's newest release, ‚ÄòHyperSilent', drives forward with a steady, commanding pulse that sets an unmistakable groove. Hypnotic basslines lock into razor-sharp percussion for maximum dancefloor impact. Layered synth textures ripple across the mix, creating a dynamic that feels futuristic yet grounded.

The energy is taken to another level with vocal interjections from hip hop pioneers J.J FAD, whose timeless flair grounds Mochakk's sleek production in a throwback energy that bridges generations. The result is a track that's bold in spirit, playful in character, and entirely unmistakable.

‚ÄòHyperSilent' follows one of Mochakk's most ambitious moments to date, the debut of Mochakk Calling Sydney, a landmark edition that brought his boundary-pushing series to Australia for the first time. The sold-out event captured the raw energy and emotion that have defined his global rise.

Fresh from his performance at Circoloco, Mochakk now turns his focus to the United States, where he will continue his momentum with a sold-out 10,000 capacity headline show on Hollywood Boulevard on November 15th, followed by a run of dates that further cement his status as not just a producer and DJ, but a cultural force in dance music.



By teaming up once again with Disorder, a label celebrated for spotlighting the industry's most innovative acts, Mochakk underscores his refusal to stagnate, choosing instead to push the culture into new territory. With ‚ÄòHyperSilent', he reinforces his status as an artist driven by risk, fueled by creativity, and anchored in groove.

Mochakk (aka Pedro Maia) has emerged as one of Brazil's foremost electronic music exports, captivating global audiences with his high-energy performances and genre-blending sound. He has headlined renowned venues like Circoloco Ibiza and major festivals such as Coachella, Time Warp, and Primavera Sound, steadily building his reputation as one of the most dynamic acts in electronic music. In 2023, he released the breakout single ‚ÄúJealous‚Äù with Circoloco Records and joined the prestigious DC-10 family as a resident.

His signature event series, Mochakk Calling, has sold out iconic venues in Miami, S√£o Paulo, London, Lisbon, and New York. In 2025, the brand reached a new milestone with the inaugural Mochakk Calling Festival in Malta, which took place July 26‚Äì27.

Continuing his global momentum, Mochakk released the From the Stars EP on Ninja Tune in 2025, showcasing his evolving sonic palette. That same year, he closed the mainstage at S√≥nar by Day, brought Mochakk Calling events back to NYC and Miami, and hosted a vibrant Tricks & Tracks pop-up on Venice Beach. He also made a debut appearance at Glastonbury and was featured on the cover of NOTION Magazine.

‚ÄòHyperSilent' by Mochakk is out now on all streaming platforms.

It is not often that experts in the extraterrestrial visit Colgate University's campus, but Marie-Helene Bertino laid out what it means to be an alien ‚Äî and to be human ‚Äî on Thursday, Oct. 16 in Persson Auditorium. Bertino visited for the fifth event in the Colgate Living Writers series to discuss her novel ‚ÄúBeautyland.‚Äù

Associate Professor of English CJ Hauser introduced Bertino to the room as a true master in the craft of writing.

‚ÄúShe is one of our great sentence writers,‚Äù Hauser said. ‚ÄúLine by line, refrain by refrain, Bertino's work is put together with a watchmaker's flair for mechanics and a vaudevillian sense of timing, panache and showmanship.‚Äù

As a close friend of Bertino's, Hauser hinted at the content of Bertino's coming presentation, which would include much of her life experience.

‚ÄúMarie has been in the deep trenches of this hard and beautiful thing we call being alive, and still she believes in magic, and still she works to reveal the world's magic to her readers,‚Äù Hauser said. 

‚ÄúYou will meet her spirit in the pages of ‚ÄòBeautyland.'‚Äù

As Bertino began speaking, she outlined the essence of her novel.

‚ÄúA lot of what I'm going to talk about today is living ‚Äî about how we live and about how we notice more about the mundane parts of our lives to extract meaning,‚Äù Bertino said.

‚ÄúBeautyland‚Äù is the coming-of-age story of a girl named Adina who is an alien on Earth reporting the lives of humans. The novel follows her entire life, from growing up in Philadelphia to her career in New York and the loved ones she cherishes and ultimately loses along the way.

‚ÄúAdina documents what I would call the profound mundane,‚Äù Bertino said. ‚ÄúIn her adolescence and teens, she reports, like many writers do in their youth, on what is around her. But as she accrues losses in her 20s and 30s, her notes delve into the very marrow of life.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeautyland‚Äù got its start when Bertino wrote a short story about an alien reporting about life on this planet back to its superiors. After that story, she began to write one-off vignettes in this style.

‚ÄúI started a folder on my desktop called ‚ÄòNotes on Human Beings,' and all through my 30s, while I worked several jobs in New York, I kept these notes,‚Äù Bertino said. ‚ÄúSo, eventually, there were so many notes that a character began to glimmer around the edges.‚Äù

Bertino's talk was unique from this year's previous Living Writers events. She gave the background of the ‚ÄúBeautyland‚Äù writing process, complete with a presentation that included pictures and lots of jokes. Her humor was dry but witty, and the entire room was often filled with laughter.

Her presentation mirrored the emotional core of ‚ÄúBeautyland‚Äù in that it was filled with humor but also grief-tinged, becoming a microcosm of the human experience that Adina portrays in the novel. Adina's name comes from Bertino's friend Adina Talve-Goodman, a nonfiction writer who passed away from cancer in 2018. 

‚ÄúI felt like giving the alien her name was kind of written in the stars,‚Äù Bertino said.

Bertino discussed everything from her own family life, to Cher in ‚ÄúMoonstruck,‚Äù to Voyager 1's Golden Record containing images and recordings that were sent out into the universe. She also left time for a lengthy question-and-answer session to discuss the novel and the art of writing.

Senior Lara Blanton reflected on how humanity wound its way through every aspect of Bertino's talk.

‚ÄúMarie-Helene Bertino's talk was fresh and funny, and she managed to talk about heavy topics like death in a way that brought lightness to it,‚Äù Blanton said. ‚ÄúWhile she didn't do a lot of reading from the book itself, she did go in depth into her inspirations, which I personally found very interesting as an aspiring writer.‚Äù 

Bertino brought her novel to life in this talk. The next Living Writers event will welcome Emily Strasser to campus on Oct. 23 to discuss her biography, ‚ÄúHalf-Life of a Secret.‚Äù

By Denyse O'Leary

Published on October 24, 2025 ‚Ä¢ 


Science is supposed to be about finding and assessing facts. But when the topic turns to extraterrestrial life, much public discussion seems aimed simply to keep up hope that ‚ÄúThey're Out There.‚Äù There's nothing wrong with that in principle, as long as we acknowledge the nature of the situation. Otherwise, we are building empires of the imagination.

A few stories that hit the fan this year seem to fit that description.

At Aeon, a planetary scientist and an astrobiologist argue that extraterrestrial technology could be ‚Äúlurking in our backyard‚Äù while we patiently search for evidence of the simplest life forms:

But the idea of discovering technosignatures within our own solar system, on Mars, the Moon or even on Earth, is far harder to accept. One reason is that science simply isn't prepared for it. Theoretical discussions are limited, and serious search efforts remain rare. In mainstream scientific circles, the topic is still considered fringe ‚Äì which only reinforces the lack of rigorous enquiry into solar system technosignatures.

The deeper issue, though, may be psychological and political. A close encounter with alien technology could spark geopolitical instability. Unlike some abstract suggestion of a distant exoplanet signal, a discovery near Earth would carry the weight of perceived threat. World governments might scramble to respond, not out of curiosity, but fear. To consider such a possibility would demand new strategies, new science and a level of intellectual risk we've so far resisted. And if the discovery does ever come, it could provoke fear, confusion or overreaction.

Ravi Kopparapu and Jacob Haqq Misra, ‚ÄúHave they been here?,‚Äù April 18, 2025

This is basically a science fiction premise with a flourish of sociology. We have found no hard evidence of any kind of alien technology that would justify a search for it. The search is really for emotional gratification.

At the BBC's Science Focus, Jonathan O'Callaghan offers another take on panspermia, the idea that life came to Earth from somewhere else in the galaxy. ‚ÄúScientists are now seriously asking if humans were seeded by aliens. Here's why‚Äù:

That idea is gaining traction thanks to a pair of missions ‚Äì NASA's OSIRIS-REx and Japan's Hayabusa2 ‚Äì that, in the past few years, have returned rocks from asteroids back to Earth.

Analysis of those samples suggests that some of the building blocks of life are present in the asteroids, raising the prospect that those same building blocks, and perhaps even life itself, could have been delivered to Earth.

It's ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù plausible, says Dr Jason Dworkin, project scientist on the OSIRIS-REx mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. ‚ÄúEarly Earth had a bombardment of material.‚Äù (September 14, 2025)

The word ‚Äúplausible‚Äù is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. A thesis can be plausible without any evidence whatever. It need only remain within the rules of reasonable speculation.

At Medium, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb enthuses about the aliens we might meet:

Finding extraterrestrial siblings would inspire us to reach out beyond the limited experiences we had so far on our home planet. There are richer opportunities in our cosmic street than available at home‚Ä¶

Rolf [Dobelli] asked: ‚ÄúAnd why should we expect aliens to be kind to us and not have the gangster mentality?‚Äù I explained that gangsters often have a short life because they engage in conflicts and play Russian roulette under risky circumstances. Any interstellar visitors to our back yard must have survived under duress for billions of years. They might abide by the principle of ‚Äúsurvival of the kindest.‚Äù

‚ÄúFinding a Meaning to Our Existence from Extraterrestrial Siblings,‚Äù Sep 20, 2025

There is a novel lurking in there but not a taxpayer-funded research program.

From Gizmodo: In an excerpt from his new book, John Gertz argues it's time to ditch SETI's old dogmas and rethink how we prepare for first contact. Gertz, a former Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) chairman, admits that there is no evidence of any other life in the universe. But, he says,

The very fact that the universe is so silent and ET is not obvious may support an argument for pessimism. Perhaps benign alien civilizations are in the majority, but they know something that newbies such as ourselves do not, namely, that the universe is a very dangerous place, and there are some really bad actors out there. They therefore intentionally keep quiet and low profiles, lest they provoke the bad actors.

from Reinventing SETI: New Directions in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Oxford University Press 2025) (September 27, 2025)

Perhaps. We usually speculate about behavior when guessing the intentions of entities of whose existence we are already certain. Here we are asked to speculate about the psychology of intelligent aliens without finding so much as a single extraterrestrial bacterium.

Gertz believes that human civilization is relatively recent: ‚Äúthe oldest civilization may be five or more billion years in advance of us‚Äù At Science Alert however, Matt Williams turns the tables: Maybe we got smart first. Highlighting a recent paper by astrophysicist David Kipping, he breaks with Carl Sagan‚Äòs Principle of Mediocrity and emphasizes Earth's unusual nature ‚Äî perhaps the first suitable home for intelligent life.

But wait. That's very like the Privileged Planet hypothesis. Such reflections are more commonly associated with belief in a Creator than with belief in countless ET civilizations. And the only thing Privileged Planet's ideas have going for them is a much closer relationship to facts.

The question looms: How much can science avoid facts while retaining the character of science?

Astronomers have found signs that the small icy world Chiron, orbiting between Saturn and Uranus, may be forming a new ring system in near-real time.

In a universe where change usually unfolds over eons, astronomers have gotten a rare front-row seat to watch a small, icy world beyond Saturn build a brand-new set of rings in real time.

A team of Brazil-based astronomers found that the bands of material orbiting around (2060) Chiron, a 125-mile-wide (200 kilometers wide) object that circles the sun between Saturn and Uranus, are new and still taking shape. The findings suggest that Chiron's surroundings are in a transitional state somewhere between a chaotic cloud of debris and a fully formed ring system, offering scientists a rare snapshot of ring formation in progress, which has never been directly witnessed before.

""It was an exciting surprise,"" Chrystian Pereira, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Observatory in Brazil who led the study, told Live Science. ""In a way, it reminds us that the solar system is alive and continuously evolving, even on human timescales.""

Chiron joins the asteroid Chariklo and dwarf planets Haumea and Quaoar as one of only four small worlds in our solar system known to host rings, but it may be the most dynamic of them all.

Chiron's changing environment, detailed in a paper published Oct. 14 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, could help scientists understand how both small icy objects as well as giant planets like Saturn and Uranus built their iconic rings billions of years ago.

Composed of rock, water ice and organic compounds, Chiron belongs to a strange population of objects called centaurs, which orbit between Jupiter and Neptune and behave partly like asteroids and partly like comets. Chiron orbits the sun once every 50 Earth years.

Since its discovery in 1977, astronomers have seen it occasionally brighten and even sprout a faint tail, evidence that it sometimes vents gas and dust into space.

In September 2023, when Chiron briefly crossed in front of a distant star from Earth's point of view, the Pico dos Dias Observatory in Brazil detected tiny, repeated dips in the star's light. When the researchers compared this data to similar events cataloged in 2011, 2018 and 2022, they found that the three distinct, dense rings ‚Äî orbiting at a distance of about 170 to 270 miles (270 to 430 km) from Chiron's center ‚Äî had stayed in place for more than a decade.

 




In the 2023 data, the team also spotted a new disk-like structure stretching from about 120 miles up to 500 miles (200-800 km) around Chiron that hadn't appeared in previous data. The broader, diffuse disk likely formed only within the past decade, possibly from a collision or outburst that released fresh material into orbit, said Pereira.

Intriguingly, the team also discovered a faint outer feature nearly 870 miles (1,400 km) from Chiron ‚Äî well beyond what's known as the Roche limit, the boundary where ring material should clump together into a moon rather than stay as debris, the new study notes.

""This is the first time we've detected any signature of material in that region,"" Pereira told Live Science, adding that higher-resolution observations are needed to confirm it. ""Beyond that limit, particles forming a ring should naturally begin to coalesce into a satellite ‚Äî yet something seems to be preventing that from happening.""

The researchers aren't certain what caused Chiron's strange setup. One possibility is that volatile ices beneath its surface erupted in a comet-like outburst, ejecting dust and ice that later settled into orbit. Another is that a small moon shattered, scattering fragments that spread along Chiron's equator, according to the new study.

The latter theory could also explain Chiron's steady brightening over the past decade, which is hard to account for through cometary activity alone, Pereira said.

Other experts say the findings raise new questions about how rings around small bodies can survive for long periods.

""It may be that something is adding energy to these particles and allowing them to persist outside the limit without coalescing,"" Keighley Rockcliffe, a postdoctoral researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland who was not involved in the new paper, told Live Science via email.

It could also be that the ring is very diffuse or that it simply hasn't existed long enough to coalesce, Rockcliffe said. ""Maybe it's recently formed and it hasn't had the chance to form a little centaur-let.""

‚ÄîWhat are Saturn's rings made of?

‚Äî'Impossible' new ring system discovered at the edge of the solar system, and scientists are baffled

‚ÄîWhat if Earth had rings?

To confirm whether Chiron's rings are truly evolving, and not just appearing different from our changing vantage point, astronomers hope to capture more events in which Chiron passes in front of distant stars. Such events, when recorded with high-speed cameras at observatories across multiple continents, are the only direct way to see if the disk's material is changing in opacity, width, or position ‚Äî signs that, according to Pereira, would reveal the dust and ice are being actively redistributed, offering direct evidence of ongoing evolution.

""The ideal scenario to satisfy our curiosity, however, would be a space mission dedicated to in-situ observation of this intriguing system,"" Pereira said.

For centuries, dating back to long before the invention of the telescope, people have reported odd flashes that sometimes light up the Moon. While these claims go back over a thousand years, it took a long time for them to be taken seriously by scientists, and we still lack an agreed-upon explanation.

It is unclear how long we have seen these flashes of light or color on the lunar surface, but the observations date back at least to the sixth century CE.

""Literature and received reports of lunar transient phenomena (LTP) in lunar programs of observations provided a collection of 2,254 total observations, from 557-1994 [CE] with sufficient information for auxiliary data analysis,"" a paper collating these observations explains. 

""Among the 2,254 there were 645 that were independently confirmed and/or permanently recorded in photographs, spectra, photometry, and polarimetry. These are designated by +. In study of these reports 448 were found that could not be explained by terrestrial atmospheric or instrumental effects, so are probably intrinsically lunar and are designated * and + for those confirmed or permanently recorded *+.""

       

Notable witnesses to these phenomena include several monks, who on June 18, 1178 CE witnessed a surprisingly bright flash on the lunar surface.

‚ÄúNow there was a bright new Moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tilted toward the east; and suddenly the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of the division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals, and sparks,"" Medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury wrote of the event.

‚ÄúMeanwhile, the body of the Moon which was below writhed, as it were, in anxiety, and, to put it in the words of those who reported it to me and saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed like a wounded snake. Afterwards, it resumed its proper state. This phenomenon was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal.""

This is a pretty dramatic description of the phenomenon, but it has been observed in the centuries since, and is a real phenomenon. In 1939, amateur astronomer turned legendary science communicator Patrick Moore witnessed one for himself, and went on to coin the term ""transient lunar phenomena"" to describe it.

""There has been a great deal of recent discussion about t.l.p. or transient lunar phenomena. My only qualification for discussing them is that I have been watching for them over a period of almost forty years, and have recorded several, but it was only in recent years that they have been accepted as real,"" he explained in a 1977 paper. 

""They take various forms. Some are merely local obscurations, hiding surface detail which is normally visible; others are obviously coloured, generally red. The classic observation was made by Kozyrev in 1958, who recorded a red t.l.p. in the crater Alphonsus and obtained confirmatory spectrograms. His interpretations have been disputed, but there can be little doubt that an event of some sort took place.""

       

These events were assumed to be pretty rare. The nature of them, often being caught by amateur astronomers who may be unable to distinguish them from other spurious effects, meant that their abundance was hard to judge. 

But from 2017 to 2023, the European Space Agency's Near-Earth object Lunar Impacts and Optical TrAnsients (NELIOTA) monitored the Moon during parts of the month when most of it is not illuminated, in order to record any of these events. The team found that during 90 hours of observations, 55 events occurred.

""Extrapolating from this data, scientists estimate that there are, on average, almost 8 flashes per hour across the entire surface of the Moon,"" ESA explains.

Explanations for the phenomenon have been proposed. One explanation, which gained a little popularity, was that radon is outgassed from beneath the lunar surface.

‚ÄúPeople over the years have attributed TLPs to all sorts of effects: turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, visual physiological effects, atmospheric smearing of light like a prism, and even psychological effects like hysteria or planted suggestion‚Äù Columbia astronomy professor Arlin Crotts explained, suggesting this mechanism in 2007, ‚Äúbut TLPs correlate strongly with radon gas leaking from the moon. No earth-bound effect can fake that.‚Äù

More recently though, the favored explanation is that the Moon's surface, unprotected by atmosphere, is constantly bombarded with meteorites, producing the flashes. This seems like the best explanation, but it still is not perfect. For example, NASA's Clementine mission to the moon in 1994 recorded and photographed four events as they occurred, but looking at the surface later they found no apparent changes from a meteorite impact. 

More work is needed, though meteorite impacts and potentially a little geological activity remain the leading explanations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Nicholas Sparks and M. Night Shyamalan Coauthor Supernatural Romance That Haunts and Heals","https://booktrib.com/2025/10/24/remain-nicholas-sparks-m-night-shyamalan/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:02:50 GMT","

Nicholas Sparks has long been known for crafting deeply emotional stories of love, loss and the ties that bind us. With Remain, co-written with M. Night Shyamalan, Sparks steps into unfamiliar territory, blending his signature emotional depth with subtle supernatural suspense. The result is a novel that challenges expectations, combining romance, grief and eerie tension in a way that feels both intimate and unsettling.

The story follows Tate Donovan, a New York architect struggling with depression and the lingering pain of personal loss. Seeking a fresh start, he retreats to a remote bed-and-breakfast in Cape Cod. There he meets Wren, a mysterious woman whose presence is both comforting and disquieting.

As their connection deepens, Tate begins to experience events that blur the boundaries between the living and the spectral. Memories, emotions and the unknown intertwine, leading him to confront questions about love, mortality and the traces we leave behind. All while he strives to uncover the truth behind Wren's past.

Sparks has described Remain as a horror story, a label that might surprise longtime fans. While the novel contains eerie and suspenseful elements, it is far from traditional horror. The tension is psychological, not visceral, and the scares emerge from emotional uncertainty and haunting presences rather than gore or shock.

It is here that M. Night Shyamalan's influence and expertise become most apparent. Sparks leverages Shyamalan's mastery of layered suspense to craft a narrative in which unease builds gradually. Readers sense that something is not quite right, even as the emotional core of the story remains grounded in human connection and heartbreak. The supernatural elements are carefully balanced with romance and reflection, making the story eerie without overshadowing its emotional weight.

The partnership between Sparks and Shyamalan is evident in the novel's pacing and structure. Sparks's intimate character work provides the emotional anchor, giving readers a reason to care deeply about Tate and Wren. Shyamalan's influence is seen in the meticulous layering of tension, the subtle foreshadowing and the moments of revelation that feel both surprising and inevitable.

The story moves like a quiet suspense film, with the uncanny woven seamlessly into the ordinary. Fans of both authors will recognize their strengths: Sparks's ability to evoke empathy and Shyamalan's skill in creating unease that lingers long after the page is turned.

Thematically, Remain is as much about what we hold onto as it is about what we must release. It explores grief and love in tandem, showing how the past continues to shape us and how human connections can endure beyond conventional understanding. The novel's supernatural framing amplifies these questions, using the unknown to deepen the emotional stakes. Tate and Wren's story becomes a meditation on loss, forgiveness and the fragile, haunting beauty of love that remains even when the world feels uncertain.

Sparks's prose retains the clarity and accessibility his readers expect, yet it is elevated here by a deliberate sense of suspense. Small details ‚Äî the quiet creak of a floorboard, a fleeting shadow, a sudden realization ‚Äî build a sense of unease while keeping the focus on the characters' emotional journeys.

By the final chapters, the story's tension and tenderness converge, leaving the reader with the lingering sense that love can survive even the eeriest of trials, and that sometimes what remains is more profound than what is lost.

Ultimately, Remain is a novel that defies easy categorization. It is romantic and reflective, eerie and thrilling, grounded in human emotion yet touched by the supernatural. Sparks and Shyamalan have crafted a collaboration that invites readers to feel deeply while questioning the boundaries between life and what lies beyond.

In the end, the novel lives up to its title: love, memory, and connection endure. They remain.

Nicholas Sparks is the author of 25 books, including Counting Miracles and Dreamland, all of which have been New York Times bestsellers. His books have been published across more than 50 languages with over 150 million copies sold worldwide, and eleven have been adapted into films. He is also the founder of the Nicholas Sparks Foundation, a nonprofit committed to improving cultural and international understanding through global education experiences. He lives in North Carolina.

M. Night Shyamalan is an internationally acclaimed director, screenwriter and actor who has written and produced films such as The Sixth Sense, Signs and Trap. His movies have grossed over $3.3 billion globally, and he's best known for creating psychological thrillers with supernatural themes. He is the founder of the film and television production company Blinding Edge Pictures. Shyamalan lives in Pennsylvania.

In my 2014 book, Legendary Locals of Center City Philadelphia, I included the story of a talented clairvoyant, Arlene Ostapowicz of Northeast Philadelphia. 

Though not an attorney, singer, former mayor, artist or writer, Arlene has been a guest on many television and radio shows. In fact, she was once offered a guest spot on Bill Maher's show, Politically Incorrect, but had to decline because the live show was on too late at night. For several years she worked at the Courier-Post of New Jersey and was a monthly commentator on an Atlantic City cable TV station. In the 1980s, she was in high demand with City Hall politicians and judges.

Her life as a City Hall consultant started when Councilwoman Joan Krajewski (now deceased) stopped at Arlene's place one day for a reading. Krajewski had heard about Arlene's talents by ‚Äúword of mouth,‚Äù the poor person's powerful advertising tool, and decided to give it a try. After the reading, Krajewski became a fan and wanted to see Arlene on a regular basis. She liked what Arlene told her, not because it was what she wanted to hear, but because ‚Äî for better or worse ‚Äî of Arlene's accuracy. 

It wasn't long before word of Arlene's talents, thanks to Krajewski, spread among the vast network inside City Hall, especially among the judges, some of whom contacted Arlene and asked for appointments.


The judges were so eager to see Arlene they sent limos to her humble house in the city's Wissinoming section to pick her up and then drive her to their chambers. Once delivered to their chambers, Arlene gave them a reading, after which she was quietly chauffeured home again. After a few months of this, Krajewski came up with an idea. She asked Arlene if she would see former mayor Frank Rizzo, who was then set on running for a new term as mayor. This was in the 1980s, when Rizzo had his famous radio show.

Arlene agreed, and met Rizzo and Krajewski in a South Philadelphia house where the consultations began.

A little segue here: I met Rizzo in the 1980s and remember being awed by the size of the man. Tough, resilient, stubborn, and cut from a John Wayne mold, the former mayor could also be charismatic and warm. In an interview I conducted with him shortly before his death in the early 1990s, he spoke tenderly of a police officer friend dying of AIDS. 

During his time as police chief, however, officers under him routinely rounded up people on the street. I was taken into custody one summer night in 1975 while walking in the city; police were looking for a male suspect with red hair, and inside the van were 10 male redheads, plucked from city sidewalks who were subsequently arranged in a lineup. Rizzo's charm and charisma could win over his staunchest enemies. He spoke in a style that he used to disarm his critics. When I spoke with him, he said, ‚ÄúAnything you want to say about me you can say it, anything you want to add ‚Äî no problem.‚Äù 

Arlene never told me what Rizzo asked her, or even what she said to him, but what went down must have impressed him because the next time he saw her, he said, ‚ÄúIf I get elected, I'm going to get you an office in City Hall and put you on the payroll.‚Äù

Often psychics claim to be talented but they miss the mark on many levels. Arlene was said to have had an accuracy rate of 85 percent ,which is about as high as psychic accuracy gets. 

Arlene was also the teacher and mentor of Jacqueline Bigar, the star astrologer for the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News for many years.

When she did a television spot during the Goode administration when the city was on the verge of bankruptcy, she was asked by a reporter if the city would sink or swim, and she said swim ‚Äî meaning that the federal government would come to the city's rescue at the eleventh hour. 

When that prediction came true, there were more limos at her door.

Naturally, you'd think a woman this talented would charge the moon and the stars for consultations, or at least live in an exotic penthouse with busts of Egyptian gods and goddesses, and strut around town like a diva. She'd also have a press agent who screened calls and booked customers, and then she'd be a regular on the lecture circuit, all for very big fees of course. Had Arlene allowed her head to swell, she might even have started her own religion, a la psychic Sylvia Brown. 

But no, Arlene lived in a humble Northeast house with a ramshackle porch, yet she was reading for the high and mighty and also for the so-called ‚Äúlittle people‚Äù whom she said were just as important to her.

‚ÄúI never wanted to be famous,‚Äù she told me. This was true even when she studied metaphysics in England in 1972 and became an organizer of the Atlantean Society, and then came back to the U.S. to start a chapter here. The chapter studied things like auras and everything related to the paranormal, even possession and exorcisms.

A good many people equate people with a natural gift of prophecy (like Arlene), with the dark side. I don't know where this association comes from. Instead of something good, they see sinister shades of Aleister Crowley, Anton LaVey, black magic, or Satanic influences. Rather than these monsters, Arlene honored a number of Catholic saints, like Saint Therese of Lisieux. She also told me before her death that she had a special devotion to the Sacred Heart.

She also said the rosary and talked with many clients about the reality of angels. She often made believers out of skeptics. She once told me that St. Thomas was the medium for the twelve apostles, and that the gift of prophecy has always been with the world, from Moses on, and didn't disappear with the death and resurrection of Christ. Like the famous seer Jeanne Dixon, she was a devout Catholic.

Her clients included real estate agents, crusty businessmen battling out ugly real estate deals, worried moms and dads, nurses, physicians, judges, and politicians. 

The Philadelphia Police Department came to her door asking for help to solve murders or help find a missing person. She has worked with the police on many crimes, such as the Dolores Della Penna murder in 1972, the Candace Clothier killing in 1968, as well as far more recent cases.

She once told me about her experiences in a possessed house in Bridesburg. 

The malevolent presence was so bad that when the owner tried to get the pastor of his parish church to come by and say some prayers, the poor priest couldn't get up the steps. A force kept pushing him backwards. With her Atlantean Society friends, Arlene says that she then went into the house and to the troubled room in question where her group formed a circle, held hands and began some prayers when something unbelievable happened. She says that she was pushed all the way across the floor, as if gliding on ice, to the very edge of the stairs.

Conspiracy theorists are claiming that the audacious ¬£76million Louvre heist may have been faked - with wild speculation that the world's most famous museum was never actually burgled.

A gang posing as construction workers stormed the Louvre's Galerie d'Apollon last Friday, escaping in under eight minutes with eight pieces of the French crown Jewels.

The thieves used a hoist to access a side window before smashing reinforced glass cases and vanishing into the Paris streets.

Tourists were ushered out as alarms echoed through the marble halls in what officials have described as one of the boldest art thefts in recent memory. The daylight raid stunned museum staff and triggered an international investigation.

But now a series of wild claims are sweeping Reddit, TikTok and X suggesting the heist was not a crime at all.

One of the far-fetched theories proposes it was in fact a carefully staged stunt for the upcoming film Now You See Me 3.

The theory exploded after Lionsgate's official TikTok account posted a cryptic video days after the break-in, with fans insisting it contained hidden references to Paris and stage magic. 

Another viral clip, uploaded by user @phooxo, splices the supposed heist footage with scenes from earlier Now You See Me films, highlighting near-identical camera angles and the thieves' precision timing. 

Together, the clips have racked up millions of views and fuelled speculation that the burglary was an elaborate movie marketing trick.

Conspiracy theorists are claiming that the audacious ¬£76million Louvre heist may have been faked - with growing speculation that the world's most famous museum was never actually burgled.

One X user wrote: 'A conspiracy theory i can get behind is that the louvre staged the heist themselves as an elaborate marketing stunt because honestly how does this even happen anymore.'

Others online have pointed to the uncanny cinematic quality of the operation - the perfectly timed lift, the clean escape, even the choice of target - saying the whole thing felt 'more Hollywood than heist.' 

Some claim that posters showing illusionist imagery appeared near the Louvre in the days before the raid, while archived social-media posts from Lionsgate hinting at a 'big reveal in Paris' have since been re-examined as possible clues.

However, the studio has since weighed in, denying any involvement. 

In a follow-up TikTok posted from its official account, Lionsgate wrote: 'We love the theory - but the Louvre heist isn't one of ours.' 

The brief statement has done little to calm speculation, with many online commentators dismissing it as part of the marketing ploy itself.

Not everyone, however, believes Hollywood is to blame. 

A competing theory suggests the jewels were stolen to order for a wealthy private collector, with the precision of the operation reflecting professional planning rather than performance. 

French prosecutors have acknowledged they are investigating whether the crime was commissioned - but have refused to rule out 'inside assistance'. 

Further out on the fringe, others have tied the incident to long-running conspiracies surrounding the Louvre itself - including the debunked claim that the museum's glass pyramid was built with 666 panes, a number linked to occult symbolism. 

On TikTok and Reddit, amateur investigators have filled comments sections with theories ranging from from secret societies to government cover-ups, each claiming to have cracked the mystery.

Some have even speculated that the burglary was staged to hide damage to the jewels or to divert attention from deeper scandals within France's cultural institutions.

One person even suggested the heist was a 'Russian plot to send a message to Macron'.

But, for now, the Louvre insists the heist was real and police say they are following 'credible international leads'.

Footage captured the brazen thieves escaping down a ladder before fleeing on scooters. 

A video shows two thieves coming down a large ladder in a mechanical delivery basket parked by the famous museum in the heart of Paris.

One was wearing a hi-vis jacket, the other appeared to be in an all-black get-up. 

At least one other person was seen at the bottom of the ladder. The men are not threatened by anybody as security guards express their intense frustration.

'The individuals are on scooters ‚Äì they are about to leave,' says one, as police sirens can be heard in the background.

'Blast! Try the police. They've gone!,' can also be heard, along with swear words.

Though the investigation into the major theft is ongoing, some details of their escape have begun to emerge.

At 9.30am on October 19, the four thieves targeted the under-construction wing of the 232-year-old museum.

Once their getaway drivers pulled up on scooters, the men began their seven-minute raid ‚Äì propping their ladder up against the museum's wall, scurrying to the top and using an angle grinder to pierce through the window.

They also managed to evade the camera that monitored the room that was pointing completely in the wrong direction.

Inside, they threatened unarmed guards and visitors before breaking into two display cabinets and looting nine prized items, estimated to be worth up to ¬£76million.

The two thieves then fled via the same window, climbing down the ladder and then hopping onto the back of their accomplices' scooters below.

It came after the museum's director admitted that security cameras did not cover the window thieves used to break-in and steal uninsured jewellery.

Speaking for the first time since last Sunday's heist at the world's most popular art museum, Laurence des Cars, 59, offered her resignation for the embarrassing failure which allowed the four masked raiders inside the Paris landmark.

She said: 'The only camera installed is directed westward and therefore did not cover the balcony involved in the break-in. There are some perimeter cameras, but they are ageing.

'Despite our efforts, despite our hard work every day, we were defeated. We did not detect the thieves' arrival early enough.'

Ms Des Cars was grilled by senators on Wednesday, and they particularly wanted to know how a flatbed truck with an extendable ladder had been able to park in the wrong direction on the pavement directly outside the Louvre.

It made a U-turn on a three-lane one-way street by the Seine, and was used by the gang to get up to the first floor of the museum.

They spent just seven minutes carrying out the raid, which included breaking open two cabinets containing eight pieces of Napoleonic jewellery described as 'France's crown jewels'.

The pieces were not insured because of the massive cost of premiums, Ms Des Cars explained.

Ms Des Cars said the thieves had put bollards on the pavement, and wore hi viz yellow and orange jackets and balaclavas during the 9.20am heist.

'As soon as they broke a window and entered the museum, the alarm systems went off and the security protocol was followed,' she said.

Private security guards who heard the alerts on their radio system ran to the van and managed to prevent the thieves setting fire to it before they fled.

This helped save valuable evidence, included a gloves and a helmet, as well as the vehicle itself, but the men disappeared on two Yamaha motorbikes.

Ms De Cars said she had handed her resignation in to Rachida Dati, the Culture Minister, but it was refused.

She said 'security plans' had included 'video surveillance covering all facades' and 'the installation of fixed thermal cameras' but these plans had not been implemented in time. 

This was because they required extensive work on the electricity supply, including 40 miles worth of new cables.

Ms Des Cars said she had repeatedly warned that the centuries-old building's security was in a dire state, saying: 'The warnings I had been sounding came horribly true last Sunday.'

She pledged to set up no-parking perimeters around the Louvre, upgrade the CCTV network, and ask the Interior Ministry to set up a police station inside the museum.

Today it emerged that  a second French museum was raided just hours after the heist.

Roughly 2,000 gold and silver coins ‚Äì some dating back 235 years ‚Äì have been stolen from the Maison des Lumi√®res museum in Langres.

Staff discovered the theft on Tuesday morning when they arrived at work to find a display case smashed. 

Further investigations showed the burglary had actually taken place on Sunday ‚Äì the same day as the heist at the Louvre.

In this article

DETROIT ‚Äì General Motors laid off more than 200 salaried employees on Friday, as the automaker continues to reevaluate its businesses and cut costs to boost profits.

The impacted employees were largely Computer-Aided Design, or CAD, engineers who worked at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit, according to GM.

""We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities,"" GM said in an emailed statement. ""As a result, a number of CAD execution roles have been eliminated. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions.""

GM declined to comment on the number of employees affected, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it was more than 200 employees, which was first reported by Bloomberg News. The person spoke anonymously because the number had not yet been made public.

The employees were told their roles were being eliminated due to ""business conditions"" and not their performance via Microsoft Teams calls on Friday, the source said.

The Detroit automaker has been regularly reviewing its business units and organizations for years in an effort to cut costs, boost profits and eliminate what it considers unneeded or overstaffed roles for future operations.

The most recent layoffs represent a small percentage of the automaker's salaried workforce, but continue a trend of white-collar U.S. headcount reductions. GM's U.S. salaried headcount fell from 53,000 in 2023 to 50,000 to end last year.

GM's layoffs also come a day after all-electric vehicle maker Rivian laid off roughly 4.5% of its workforce, or more than 600 people, to restructure some teams as the EV market faces growing challenges amid policy changes and slower-than-expected demand.

The most recent cuts come as President Donald Trump touted on social media Friday that Ford Motor and GM are ""UP BIG on Tariffs"" amid tariff changes last week for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which he referred to as ""Big and Midsized Trucks.""

While both Ford and GM, including CEO Mary Barra, this week praised the tariff changes, which also included extending offsets on U.S.-produced vehicles, the automakers are still seeing additional cost burdens from the levies. These changes are simply helping to lower those added costs.

The layoffs come days after GM raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday as it beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, causing the stock to have its second-best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.

Shares of GM are up more than 29% this year, while Ford's stock is up roughly 38%. Both hit new 52-week highs on Friday.

Despite president's promise to preserve it, the eastern section of the building is now completely destroyed

The East Wing of the White House has now been completely destroyed to pave way for Donald Trump's $300m planned gilded ballroom, just days after the administration announced it would happen and contradicting Trump's earlier promise that the existing building would not be touched.

Satellite images on Friday showed the historic building's eastern section reduced to rubble, to the outrage of historians, former White House officials and much of the public.

The demolition marked a reversal of Trump's earlier promise in July that none of the White House's existing infrastructure would be torn down during construction of the ballroom.

Trump went ahead despite not first sending plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government buildings across the region.

On Thursday, a White House official told Reuters that construction plans ‚Äúwill be soon‚Äù submitted. A White House official also told the Guardian that ‚ÄúThe National [Capital] Planning Commission does not require permits for demolition, only for vertical construction. Permits will be submitted to the NPC at the appropriate time.‚Äù

Earlier this week, however, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a non-profit established by Congress, sent a letter to the White House stating that the demolition plans are ‚Äúlegally required‚Äù to undergo public review.

Meanwhile, a Virginia couple filed a motion in Washington federal court on Thursday, requesting a temporary restraining order on the project. In their motion, Charles and Judith Voorhees said that the construction was taking place ‚Äúwithout legally required approvals or reviews‚Äù.

‚ÄúDefendants are unilaterally decoupling the demolition of the East Wing of the White House from the construction approval process to expedite the project, effectively bypassing the historic preservation and planning reviews required under federal law for a project of this magnitude on a protected national landmark,‚Äù the motion added.

Donors of the proposed ballroom include a slew of major tech companies. Among those are Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google. Defense contractors and communications companies have also pitched in, including Lockheed Martin, Palantir, T-Mobile and Comcast.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said he assumes that the US will grant an exemption for the German subsidiary of Russia's state-owned oil giant Rosneft from newly imposed sanctions.

Speaking to reporters at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, Merz said the issue had already been discussed ‚Äúbriefly‚Äù with Washington.

Rosneft retains stakes in three refineries in Germany that were placed under state administration in 2022 following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict and ensuing sanctions. The company's German operations account for about 12% of the nation's total oil-processing capacity, according to Bloomberg.

Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump announced a new round of sanctions against Russia's energy sector, targeting Rosneft and another oil major, Lukoil. The measures bar US firms and financial institutions from dealing with the oil companies.

‚ÄúWe will discuss this with the Americans,‚Äù Merz said, adding ‚ÄúI assume that a corresponding exemption for Rosneft will be granted.‚Äù Berlin insists the US measures should not apply to Rosneft's German subsidiaries as they have been ‚Äúdecoupled from their Russian parent company.‚Äù

On Wednesday, the UK issued an exemption allowing business activity with Rosneft's German-based assets. The decision was announced shortly after London expanded its energy-related sanctions against Russia's largest oil producers.

The threat to Germany's refineries adds to the broader economic strain facing Berlin, as the government struggles to revive growth in an economy that saw two years of annual contraction in 2023 and 2024, partly due to the loss of cheap Russian energy. High fuel and electricity prices have negatively impacted domestic industrial output and competitiveness, leaving policymakers under pressure to secure stable energy supplies while maintaining alignment with Western sanctions.

Rosneft has condemned the transfer of its German subsidiaries into external management, calling the decision unlawful and a violation of fundamental market economy principles.

Russia has repeatedly dismissed Western sanctions as illegal, adding that it is immune to them. The Russian Foreign Ministry described the new US sanctions on Rosneft, Lukoil, and their subsidiaries as ‚Äúentirely counterproductive.‚Äù

Pete Hegseth claims six ‚Äònarco-terrorists' killed in Caribbean as US military conducts 10th strike

US politics live ‚Äì latest updates

The United States has carried out another military strike against a boat it claims was carrying illegal drugs in the Caribbean, killing six people onboard said Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon chief, on Friday morning.

Later on Friday, the Pentagon said that an aircraft carrier was being moved to waters off South America, as part of the administration's stated campaign to combat drug trafficking.

In a social media post on Friday morning, Hegseth said that the US military had conducted its 10th strike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel.

Hegseth alleged that the boat was ‚Äúknown by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics‚Äù.

He said that the strike, conducted in international waters, killed all six people who were onboard, and was ‚Äúthe first strike at night‚Äù.

No US forces were harmed, he added.

As has become common with announcements of such attacks, Hegseth shared a short video showing a boat at sea suddenly exploding as it was struck with military ordnance.

Sean Parnell, a Pentagon spokesperson, announced that Hegseth had also directed the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and its strike group to be sent to the US Southern Command to ‚Äúbolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the Western Hemisphere‚Äù.

‚ÄúThese forces will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs,‚Äù he said, referring to transnational criminal organizations.

According to the Associated Press, the Ford is currently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea along with three destroyers. The AP reports that it will likely take several days for the ships to get to South America.

Since early September, the Trump administration has announced 10 strikes against vessels that it alleges are trafficking narcotics. These attacks have taken place both in the Caribbean and, as of this week, off the Pacific coast of South America. According to the Associated Press, at least 43 people have been killed in the strikes since September.

The Trump administration has not disclosed many details about the targets other than the number of people killed and the allegations that the boats carried narcotics.

The strikes have drawn widespread condemnation, including from civil liberties groups and several South American countries, and some lawmakers and human rights groups have questioned the legality of the attacks.

On Tuesday, the Guardian reported that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was providing much of the intelligence used to carry out airstrikes. Experts have said that the agency's central role means much of the evidence used to select the targets will almost certainly remain secret.

On Friday morning, when announcing the latest strike, Hegseth claimed, without providing any evidence, that the target of the attack was ‚Äúa vessel operated by Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO), trafficking narcotics in the Caribbean Sea‚Äù.

The administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other gangs as terrorist organizations. Legal experts have suggested that simply characterizing gangs and drug cartels as terrorist organizations does not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force.

White House officials have also sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his powers under article 2 of the US constitution, which allows the president to use military force in self-defense in limited engagements.

Earlier this week, the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, condemned the US strikes, describing them as as ‚Äúmurder‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe US government's strategy breaks the norms of international law,‚Äù Petro said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Click here to follow the latest stories from our hub on disinformation.

With Ukraine heavily reliant on Western backing, Russian disinformation is laser-focused on driving a wedge between Kyiv and its allies.

After explosions at Russian-linked refineries in Romania and Hungary, reports on Oct. 22 claimed another blaze at a Druzhba-connected refinery in Slovakia. The incidents at Romania's Lukoil refinery in Ploiesti and Hungary's Szazhalombatta plant were real. The third one was not.

Declaring that ""oil refineries across Europe are burning one after another,"" pro-Kremlin propaganda outlets have been actively pointing a finger at Ukraine, alleging arson or a drone strike.

Reports often cited a story by an obscure English- and Russian-language website CZNews Info, which made no mention of Ukraine and added a note that the incident had not been officially confirmed.

While the Slovak oil company Slovnaft denied the fire altogether ‚Äî suggesting that active field burners might have caused the confusion ‚Äî the story nevertheless spread quickly.

The disinformation monitoring team at the LetsData company said the narrative was widely disseminated by malign pro-Russian actors, who framed it into the context of  ""a larger narrative blaming Ukraine for sabotage.""

The actual explosions in Hungary and Romania were then used to support the claim.

The narrative circulated primarily on Facebook and among Czech-language accounts, but was also present on other platforms, namely Telegram and X, and appeared in English, Slovak, and Russian, LetsData said.

Some Ukrainian media publications picked up a version that omitted Ukrainian involvement.

The story also seeped into the English-language social media space on X via several high-profile accounts.

LetsData's analysis confirms that the fake news about the ""fire"" was disseminated to a certain extent by non-malign actors.

Russian sources discussed the refinery fires ‚Äî the real and the fabricated ones ‚Äî in the context of Ukrainian strikes against Russian facilities linked to the Druzhba pipeline.

Hungary and Slovakia are the only EU countries still receiving oil via the Russian pipeline, which Kyiv says helps fund Moscow's war efforts.

Some Russian propagandists pointed out that the same week, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski ‚Äî in a public spat with his Hungarian counterpart ‚Äî voiced hope that Ukrainian drone forces would knock out the Druzhba pipeline.

Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's top envoy dealing with the U.S., instead linked the incident to a now-canceled summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest.

""Hungary under attack for working on a peace summit?"" Dmitriev wrote on X.

While the incident at the Danube facility fire is still under investigation, its owner, Mol, said there was no evidence of foul play.

This is not the first time Moscow has hinted at deliberate attempts to disrupt U.S.-Russia relations.

Russian propaganda networks became similarly active ahead of the first summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska in August, accusing Ukraine of planning ""provocations"" to disrupt the talks.

While flying its own drones and aircraft into NATO airspace, Moscow has been accusing Ukraine of plotting subversive activities and false flag operations on European soil.

Kyiv has dismissed such accusations, warning against Russia's attempt to sow distrust between Ukraine and EU countries, and weaken its international support.

""The main goal is to test NATO's reaction, sow fear in European societies, and reduce support for Ukraine,"" Alina Alieksieieva, deputy head of Ukraine's government-led Center for Countering Disinformation, told the Kyiv Independent in September.

Too bad Ontario bet so heavily on a battery-driven future","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-electric-vehicle-industry-ontario-investments/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:07:23 GMT","

Honda's postponing of a $15-billion electric vehicle investment in Alliston, Ont., is just one example of the tide turning away from EVs.Carlos Osorio/Reuters

Car makers are going back to the future. They are, once again, embracing gasoline engines at the expense of batteries. The electric vehicle bubble is bursting, and that's bad news for governments around the world, including Ontario's, that bet fortunes of taxpayers' money on the EV ‚Äúrevolution.‚Äù

Porsche this week became the latest car maker to roll back its EV strategy. The company is killing plans for a new electric SUV and booked an impairment charge of ‚Ç¨1.8-billion related to development costs. 

Porsche competitor Ferrari also has come to the conclusion that EVs are not ready for prime time. The company earlier this month said that all-electric models will make up about 20 per cent of its line-up by 2030, half the goal it had set three years ago to please the bike-loving technocrats in Brussels, who are determined to end the sale of internal-combustion engines by 2035.

Editorial Board: Canada's costly EV scheme stalls out again

Luxury cars such as Porsche and Ferrari are special cases. Their owners, by definition, are wealthy and are not repelled by the obscene prices for ultra-fast EVs. The Porsche Cayman EV starts at US$101,000 and tops out at US$232,000 for the fanciest versions, according to Car and Driver magazine. The problem is that aging, rich men who grew up with the thrilling snarl of high-revving gas engines don't want to trade them for the sedate hum of a battery car. Gearheads, as it turns out, are not electronheads. 

For the rest of the market, EVs of almost every size and shape are simply too expensive. Various reports say the sticker prices of EVs are US$6,000 to US$10,000 more than a comparable gas car in the United States. The cost of buying an EV will no doubt rise since Donald Trump's ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù has killed the federal US$7,500 EV tax credit. 

The bigger problem is residual values, since most EVs are leased, generally over three years, not bought. EVs depreciate far faster than regular cars, dropping their residual value and raising their monthly lease costs. EVs lose value fast because their batteries decay, albeit fairly slowly, and are hideously expensive to replace, and because EV technology improves every year, making old models unattractive. EV insurance costs are also higher. The Kelley Blue Book compared the depreciation rates of two top-selling cars in the U.S.‚Äì the Tesla Model Y and the Ford F-150 pickup truck. The Tesla, an EV, lost 42 per cent of its value over two years; the Ford, with a gas engine, lost only 20 per cent (and was much cheaper to buy).

With the glaring exception of China, and a few smaller countries that can afford purchase incentives, notably EV-mad Norway, the sales of battery cars are growing more slowly than expected, flat-lining or going into reverse, as they are in Canada, France and Germany. AlixPartners, a New York management consulting firm, recently halved its EV forecast, calling for the cars to make up only seven per cent of U.S. sales in 2026.

EV woes: Charging isn't so simple on a busy weekend

Ontario could be one of the biggest victims of the flagging fortunes of the EV industry. In 2024, Justin Trudeau, who was prime minister at the time, bragged that since 2020, Canada, mostly Ontario, had attracted some C$46-billion of investments across the EV supply chain, including battery-component plants. The incentives ‚Äì the polite term for corporate welfare ‚Äì have been lavish. The Office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that total government support for capital and operating expenses for the supply chain is up to $52-billion, or 14 per cent more than the announced value of the investments. 

Now look at what's happening. Some EV and battery plant investments are being postponed or vanishing as EV sales head south and Mr. Trump's trade war against Canada goes from unpleasant to nasty. On Thursday, he announced that U.S. had ended all trade talks with Canada, meaning that the existing 35 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods outside the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will stay put, along with duties of up to 50 per cent on steel and aluminum. They could even rise, depending on Mr. Trump's mood. 

Honda is postponing a $15-billion EV investment in Alliston, Ont., by at least two years. Construction of Umicore's $2.7-billion battery plant near Kingston has stopped. Northvolt of Sweden, which had been Europe's great hope to make a splash in the global battery market, went bankrupt this year, killing its plans to build a Quebec plant. Stellantis is delaying the overhaul of its Brampton, Ont., plant that would make EVs. It is also shifting production of the Jeep Compass, including its EV version, to the U.S.

Government bets on new technology are always risky. The technology evolves, sometimes turning into a game changer, sometimes fading away or failing with a bang. In this case, the customer has spoken and they don't much want EVs ‚Äì at least not yet. Canada, especially Ontario, may have bet wrong on battery cars.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford had said the ad campaign would run on U.S. networks on Friday during the World Series game, but a source told The Globe he would move to pull the ads next week.Jon Blacker/The Canadian Press

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says his government will pause its anti-tariff ads running in the United States after speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney so that ‚Äútrade talks can resume.‚Äù

The contentious ad had drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would end trade negotiations over the matter late Thursday night.

Mr. Ford said Friday the add will run as planned over the weekend ‚Äì including during the first two games of the World Series ‚Äì but will no longer be aired as of Monday.

‚ÄúOur intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,‚Äù Mr. Ford said.

A source told The Globe and Mail the ads have been locked in with television networks for the weekend. The source said the ads have been effective and Mr. Trump's harsh reaction to them will garner the attention of millions of Americans.

The Globe and Mail is not identifying the source because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

Mr. Carney and Mr. Ford spoke both Thursday night and Friday about the ad campaign and the Prime Minister expressed his preference that they be pulled off the air, according to a different source familiar with the conversation.

Mr. Trump abruptly cancelled the talks late Thursday night after he became annoyed at the ad, which features former president Ronald Reagan. Mr. Carney spoke while boarding a plane for an Asian trip, where he is expected to see Mr. Trump in South Korea next week for APEC summit but did not take questions from reporters.

‚ÄúWe can't control the trade policy of the United States,‚Äù he said, while noting ‚Äúdetailed and constructive progress‚Äù had been made in recent weeks to get tariff relief on steel and aluminum as well as possible deal on energy.

‚ÄúWe stand ready to pick up on that progress, to build on that progress when the Americans are ready to have those discussions because it will be to the benefit of workers in the United States, workers in Canada,‚Äù he said.

Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters Friday the government is prepared to resume talks, but cannot control the trade policy of the U.S.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Mr. Carney had not publicly called on Mr. Ford to pull the ads.

The Ontario government has said it is spending $75-million on the entire ad campaign, which is running on major U.S. networks.

Another source, with connections to the Canadian and U.S. governments, said the President's displeasure at Canada isn't just aimed at the Ontario ads.

The source said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has complained to the President that Canada had threatened to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he came to Canada. Mr. Rubio has informed the President that Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand had said that Beijing is considered a strategic partner of Canada at a time when the U.S. is in the midst of a trade war with the world's second biggest economy.

The source said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also weighed in with the President on Canada's decision to impose tariffs on some vehicles imported by General Motors and Stellantis.

The Globe is not identifying the sources who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations with the Trump administration and internal discussions between Ottawa and the premiers.

Brian Clow, who handled U.S. trade relations as deputy chief of staff under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, said it would be wise for Premier Ford to pull the ads to allow talks to get back on track.

‚ÄúThere is clearly some merit to hitting back and talking directly to the Americans, but unfortunately when the President reacts this way, Canada needs to adjust,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's not in anyone's interest for talks to be frozen.‚Äù

He added: ‚Äúif there's any chance to bring some near-term relief to the steel and aluminums sectors, then getting the talks back on has to be the objective.‚Äù

President Trump's tariffs go against Ronald Reagan's legacy.Doug Ford's ads are good ‚Äî keep them on TV :flag-ca: #elbowsup pic.twitter.com/wpBSYWWKwc

Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew expressed support on Friday for Mr. Ford, posting a video of himself reading an address on a vintage-inspired TV set. He urged the Ontario Premier to keep the ads on air, saying they reflect Mr. Reagan's views accurately and powerfully. 

‚ÄúPresident Trump's damaging tariffs go completely against Mr. Reagan's legacy. And it's clear that these ads are working. If you throw a rock at a lake and you don't hear a splash, you've probably missed,‚Äù Mr. Kinew said.

The Prime Minister said the U.S. tariff war has affected all of its trading partners, which is why his government is determined to diversify trade away from the U.S.

In Truth Social posts on Thursday night and Friday morning, Mr. Trump lashed out at Canada over the ad, accused Ottawa of trying to influence a U.S. Supreme Court case on the legality of his tariffs and defended the levies as necessary for national security.

‚ÄúCANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote early on Friday. ‚ÄúCanada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country.‚Äù 

The U.S. high court is set on Nov. 5 to hear arguments over whether many of Mr. Trump's sweeping global tariffs ‚Äì those imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ‚Äì are legal after a lower court struck them down.

In the Friday post, he accused Canada of ‚Äúfraudulently‚Äù claiming that Mr. Reagan opposed tariffs ‚Äúwhen actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.‚Äù

Kevin Hassett, Mr. Trump's economic adviser, said Friday morning that the U.S. President's ‚Äúfrustration has built up over time‚Äù because ‚Äúthe Canadians have been very difficult to negotiate with.‚Äù

The Government of Ontario released this TV ad which will be broadcast in the U.S. that uses a recording of Ronald Reagan to argue against tariffs.

Government of Ontario

Speaking with reporters outside the White House, he declined to get into detail about what specifically had soured in the talks. 

‚ÄúI guess the lack of flexibility and also, I would guess, the leftover behaviours from the Trudeau folks that can be very frustrating,‚Äù Mr. Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said when asked what Canada was doing that Mr. Trump did not like.

The tone was a notable shift from Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump's meeting at the White House earlier this month. Mr. Trump had repeatedly praised and complimented the Prime Minister, even as he said the two countries were in competition for auto sector jobs.

Mr. Reagan, who signed the original Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement, which later became NAFTA and now USMCA, was a major proponent of free trade. But the Ronald Reagan Foundation complained that the Ontario ad quotes portions of a speech in which Mr. Reagan criticized tariffs without specifying that, in the same speech, he defended imposing tariffs in some situations.

President Donald Trump claimed without citing legal authority on Thursday that he doesn't need the approval of Congress to conduct his boat strike campaign in the Caribbean, simply saying his administration is ‚Äújust gonna kill people.‚Äù

In a press conference on Thursday, Trump also claimed that Congress was in favor of the strikes. When asked why he wouldn't seek congressional approval for the attacks if Congress would be likely to grant him war powers, Trump dismissed the idea.

‚ÄúWell, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, okay? We're going to kill them. They're going to be, like, dead,‚Äù he said.

A wide variety of experts and lawmakers have pointed out that the campaign is illegal under both international and domestic law, as the Constitution declares that only Congress has the power to declare war.

Trump's comments come amid rising concerns that he is seeking to consolidate more and more power into the executive branch.

‚ÄúTo be clear, this is Trump not only admitting to using military force without Congress' constitutionally required authorization, but to committing extrajudicial killings ‚Äî or in other words, murder,‚Äù said Dylan Williams, vice president for government affairs for the Center for International Policy.

‚ÄúA blaring red warning signal for the rule of law; a President declaring ‚Äòwe're just gonna kill people' without a trial or even a shred of due process,‚Äù said American Immigration Council senior fellow Aaron Reichlin-Melnick.

Notably, members of Congress have said that the Trump administration has not shared any evidence to back its claims that it is targeting ‚Äúnarco-terrorists‚Äù in the drug trade who are carrying drugs to the U.S. 

But the administration has given Congress very few briefings on the operation. Further, even in those briefings, Pentagon officials have not given basic information about the strikes, lawmakers have said, including who they were targeting and the legal basis for the operation. 

Still, the illegal campaign is ever expanding. This week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. had struck two boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean ‚Äî after acknowledging on Sunday that the military had targeted Colombian nationals in a strike.

In remarks Wednesday, Trump said that drugs are also entering the U.S. by land and that that was the next stage for the U.S.'s assault.

‚ÄúI told them, the land is going to be next,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe may go to the Senate, we may go to Congress, and tell them about it, but I can't imagine they're going to have any problem with it.‚Äù

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized the strikes and have expressed frustration with the lack of transparency. Senate Democrats have launched a bid to pass a resolution to bar Trump from carrying out further boat strikes, despite the fact that they already are unconstitutional.

However, Republican senators united against the resolution earlier this month, shooting it down in a 51-48 vote largely along party lines. Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) were the only two Republicans to vote for the resolution, while Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pennsylvania) was the only Democrats to vote against it.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The blast that killed 16 people at a Tennessee workplace set off 24,000 pounds of explosives, authorities say","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/us/tennessee-plant-explosion-update","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:28:29 GMT","


            The catastrophe at a Tennessee explosives plant started in a building that made devices used for mining and detonated more than 24,000 pounds of explosives, authorities said Friday.
    


            The October 10 disaster killed 16 employees at Accurate Energetic Systems, which makes military and demolition explosives about 60 miles west of Nashville. The blast was so intense, it registered as a 1.6 magnitude earthquake, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey.
    


            Fourteen of the victims were quickly identified with the help of rapid DNA testing. But two weeks later, the remaining two victims' remains have not been found, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis said.
    


            The searches for the victims and the cause of the blast have been treacherous, with debris hurled miles away and possible landmines scattered throughout.
    


Witnesses who could shed light on the cause of deadly Tennessee blast were killed



            While the cause of the blast remains a mystery, investigators have figured out where the calamity started, said Brice McCracken, special agent in charge at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' National Center for Explosives Training and Research.
    


            The ‚Äúblast seat‚Äù was Building 602, a 15,000-square-foot structure that made explosives used for mining, McCracken said. By the end of the disaster, about 24,000 to 28,000 pounds of explosives had been detonated.
    


            Investigators have theories about what might have caused the explosion, said Jamey VanVliet, special agent in charge of the ATF's Nashville Field Division. But he declined to name those theories or speculate on a potential cause as the investigation continues.
    


            During their dangerous search, authorities scoured 500 acres of wooded property looking for victims and explosive hazards, McCracken said.
    


            They found about 1,000 pounds of undetonated explosives, all of which were safely disposed of, he said.
    


            ‚ÄúThere is no indication of threat to public safety,‚Äù VanVliet said.
    


Investigators tread carefully at charred Tennessee explosives plant as families of 16 blast victims learn of their loss



            Investigators have spent ‚Äúnearly every daylight hour processing this enormous scene‚Äù over the past two weeks, VanVliet said Friday.
    


            ‚ÄúToday, that part of our work ‚Äì processing the scene ‚Äì is complete,‚Äù he said.
    


            The next phase of the investigation will happen at ATF labs and testing facilities, where evidence will be examined in hopes of finding the cause of the tragedy.
    


            Authorities have identified the 16 victims as Jason Adams, Erick Anderson, Billy Baker, Adam Boatman, Christopher Clark, Mindy Clifton, James Cook, Reyna Gillahan, LeTeisha Mays, Jeremy Moore, Melinda Rainey, Melissa Stanford, Trenton Stewart, Rachel Woodall, Steven Wright and Donald Yowell.
    


            ‚ÄúIt really saddens me that we still have two souls that we have not been able to locate,‚Äù the sheriff said Friday. ‚ÄúI've talked with both of those families last night and this morning. We still have some testing to do,‚Äù which Davis said he hopes will be completed in the coming days.
    


            In recent years, safety concerns have been raised at the plant. Federal records show the plant faced fines several years ago related to workplace safety practices.
    


Massive blast that destroyed a Tennessee explosive plant leaves 16 dead, officials say



            The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations. The company contested the findings and eventually reached a formal settlement, OSHA records show.
    


            In a statement posted on its website, Accurate Energetic Systems said it is ‚Äúshocked and devastated‚Äù by the loss of 16 employees.
    


            ‚ÄúThese team members are our family, our friends, our neighbors ‚Äì it is impossible to comprehend,‚Äù CEO Wendell Stinson said.
    


            ‚ÄúWe maintain high industry standards and have regular reviews by state and federal regulators, and we also lead our industry with significant roles within national safety organizations. That is another reason why this tragedy is so difficult to comprehend.‚Äù

            Hot Stocks 





            Changpeng Zhao, one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry, is back in the spotlight this week after securing a pardon from President Donald Trump ‚Äî a reprieve that renews concerns that those with deep pockets have been able to buy their way out of trouble under Trump 2.0.
    


            It is hard to overstate how much Zhao, who goes by ‚ÄúCZ,‚Äù has shaped the crypto industry since he launched Binance in 2017 and grew it into the world's largest trading platform for digital assets.
    


            Put simply: If you want to take, say, $100 from your bank account and use it to buy or sell cryptocurrencies virtually anywhere in the world, Binance facilitates that process, and takes a small fee off of every trade. It also offers more complex financial services like margin trading and ‚Äústaking,‚Äù a way for investors to earn passive returns on their crypto holdings.
    


            Not only is Binance by far the world's biggest crypto exchange, as measured by both user count (280 million globally) and trading volume (more than $217 billion daily), it boasts 40% of the market share among centralized crypto exchanges.
    


            But Binance hasn't always complied with rules governing the sale of financial services in various jurisdictions, including in the US, which effectively banned the global version of the platform in 2019. (In response, Binance launched a more limited service, Binance.US, though in practice many users within US borders found ways around the ban, according to media reports and the Department of Justice.)
    


            US federal prosecutors said in a 2023 that Binance had become a hub for bad actors, enabling transactions linked to child sex abuse, narcotics, terrorist financing and money laundering. Binance also lacked protocols ‚Äî standard for financial services companies ‚Äî to report transactions for money laundering risks, according to the Justice Department, and employees were well aware that such an oversight would invite criminals to the platform. One compliance staffer wrote, according to court documents:  ‚Äúwe need a banner ‚Äòis washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.'‚Äù
    


            The company and Zhao pleaded guilty in the United States to money-laundering violations. As part of a settlement with the government, Zhao stepped down as CEO, paid a $50 million fine, and served a four-month sentence in federal prison. Zhao still owns an estimated 90% of the company, giving him an estimated net worth of more than $80 billion, according to Forbes.
    


            Zhao remains synonymous with Binance, and he retained his industry clout even after he went to prison. On Friday, Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian national who now lives in the United Arab Emirates, reflected on his recent ups and downs, stating: ‚ÄúMy official record was tarnished for a bit, but my reputation held strong. No one, not a single person, stopped doing business with me.‚Äù
    


            For years, crypto in the United States was a largely theoretical project ‚Äî a parallel financial system led by a community of extremely online pioneers, who believed the future of money lay in computer networks outside the control of governments or central banks.
    


            But 16 years in, crypto has ballooned to a $3.5 trillion industry with growing exposure to mainstream finance, due in part to Trump's evolution from skeptic to full-fledged crypto mogul. Just this week, Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller said crypto assets ‚Äúare no longer on the fringes‚Äù and ‚Äúincreasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems‚Äù ‚Äî a stunning acknowledgement for an industry that nearly imploded just three years ago with the collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's once high-flying competitor to Binance.
    


            Institutional interest in crypto has shot up with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, and Congress recently passed an industry-approved regulatory bill that proponents hope will increase adoption. There's a long way to go, however, as most Americans (63%) have little or no confidence in crypto as a safe investment, according to Pew Research. 



            Crypto proponents also embraced Trump's re-election ‚Äî the industry became the biggest corporate donor in the 2024 general election ‚Äî and Trump embraced crypto right back.
    


Trump's crypto conflicts keep piling up. He's not even trying to hide them



            Trump took to crypto with the zeal of the converted, promising to make the United States the ‚Äúcrypto capital‚Äù of the world, and even embracing fringe elements that made many advocates uneasy ‚Äî like launching his own memecoin, a kind of souvenir token closely associated with scams, pardoning the notorious founder of the criminal Silk Road marketplace, and calling for the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve, which would enrich early adopters while undermining the anti-establishment ethos of crypto's founding.
    


            The Trump family's vast crypto empire is perhaps the most problematic of the president's conflicts of interest, making earlier ethics debates over his hotel and casino business interests look downright quaint. There is virtually no cap on how much money can flow to the Trump family via crypto.
    


            The president's pardon of Zhao exemplifies those ethical concerns because Binance has direct financial ties to the Trump family's crypto business.
    


            In March, the Trump family's World Liberty Financial launched a dollar-pegged token known as a stablecoin ‚Äî popular assets in crypto because their value remains constant, while most other token prices are prone to volatility.
    


What are stablecoins? Everything to know about the crypto being debated in Congress



            According to Bloomberg, Binance wrote the basic code to power World Liberty's stablecoin, USD1, and has promoted the coin to its 280 million users around the globe.
    


            Shortly after the coin launched this spring, a UAE-based firm announced it would use USD1 to take a $2 billion stake in Binance ‚Äî using USD1, a deal that is expected to generate millions in returns for World Liberty, which is controlled jointly by the Trumps and the family of Steve Witkoff, Trump's Mideast negotiator.

President Donald Trump says he doesn't feel bad ordering U.S. strikes against suspected drug vessels, saying he is ‚Äúsaving‚Äù lives.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The U.S. military is sending an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America, the Pentagon announced Friday, in the latest escalation of military firepower in a region where the Trump administration has unleashed more rapid strikes in recent days against boats it accuses of carrying drugs. 

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to deploy to the U.S. Southern Command region to ‚Äúbolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,‚Äù Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on social media.

The USS Ford, which has five destroyers in its strike group, is now deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. One of its destroyers is in the Arabian Sea and another is in the Red Sea, a person familiar with the operation told The Associated Press. As of Friday, the aircraft carrier was in port in Croatia on the Adriatic Sea. 

The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, would not say how long it would take for the strike group to arrive in the waters off South America or if all five destroyers would make the journey.

Deploying an aircraft carrier will surge major additional resources to a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela. The latest deployment and the quickening pace of the U.S. strikes, including one Friday, raised new speculation about how far the Trump administration may go in operations it says are targeted at drug trafficking, including whether it could try to topple Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro. He faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.

There are already more than 6,000 sailors and Marines on eight warships in the region. If the entire USS Ford strike group arrives, that could bring nearly 4,500 more sailors as well as the nine squadrons of aircraft assigned to the carrier. 

Complicating the situation is Tropical Storm Melissa, which has been nearly stationary in the central Caribbean with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen into a powerful hurricane.

Hours before Parnell announced the news, Hegseth said the military had conducted the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead and bringing the death count for the attacks that began in early September to at least 43 people.

Hegseth said on social media that the vessel struck overnight was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. It was the second time the Trump administration has tied one of its operations to the gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison.

The strikes have ramped up from one every few weeks when they first began last month to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people. Two of the most recent strikes were carried out in the eastern Pacific Ocean, expanding the area where the military has launched attacks and shifting to where much of the cocaine from the world's largest producers is smuggled.

‚ÄúIf you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda,‚Äù Hegseth said in his post. ‚ÄúDay or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.‚Äù

The strike drew parallels to the first announced by the U.S. last month by focusing on Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization and blamed for being at the root of the violence and drug dealing that plague some cities.

While not mentioning the origin of the latest boat, the Republican administration says at least four of the boats it has hit have come from Venezuela. On Thursday, the U.S. military flew a pair of supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela. 

Maduro argues that the U.S. operations are the latest effort to force him out of office.

Maduro on Thursday praised security forces and a civilian militia for defense exercises along some 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) of coastline to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. attack.

In the span of six hours, ‚Äú100% of all the country's coastline was covered in real time, with all the equipment and heavy weapons to defend all of Venezuela's coasts if necessary,‚Äù Maduro said during a government event shown on state television.

The U.S. military's presence is less about drugs than sending a message to countries in the region to align with U.S. interests, according to Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region.

‚ÄúAn expression that I'm hearing a lot is ‚ÄòDrugs are the excuse.' And everyone knows that,‚Äù Dickinson said. ‚ÄúAnd I think that message is very clear in regional capitals. So the messaging here is that the U.S. is intent on pursuing specific objectives. And it will use military force against leaders and countries that don't fall in line.‚Äù

Hegseth's remarks around the strikes have recently begun to draw a direct comparison between the war on terrorism that the U.S. declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the Trump administration's crackdown on drug traffickers. 

President Donald Trump this month declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the U.S. was in an ‚Äúarmed conflict‚Äù with them, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11.

When reporters asked Trump on Thursday whether he would request that Congress issue a declaration of war against the cartels, he said that wasn't the plan.

‚ÄúI think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? We're going to kill them, you know? They're going to be like, dead,‚Äù Trump said during a roundtable at the White House.

Lawmakers from both major political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details.

‚ÄúI've never seen anything quite like this before,‚Äù said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., who previously worked in the Pentagon and the State Department, including as an adviser in Afghanistan.

‚ÄúWe have no idea how far this is going, how this could potentially bring in, you know, is it going to be boots on the ground? Is it going to be escalatory in a way where we could see us get bogged down for a long time?‚Äù he said.

Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who has long been involved in foreign affairs in the hemisphere, said of Trump's approach: ‚ÄúIt's about time.‚Äù

While Trump ‚Äúobviously hates war,‚Äù he also is not afraid to use the U.S. military in targeted operations, Diaz-Balart said. ‚ÄúI would not want to be in the shoes of any of these narco-cartels.‚Äù

President Donald Trump announced he's ending all trade negotiations with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs. The ad was paid for by the Ontario provincial government, not the Canadian federal government.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his country ‚Äúcan't control the trade policy of the United States.‚Äù Before boarding a flight to Asia, Carney told reporters: ‚ÄúWe have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can't control.‚Äù

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump announced he's ending ‚Äúall trade negotiations‚Äù with Canada because of a television ad sponsored by one of its provinces that used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs ‚Äî prompting the province's leader to later pull the ad. 

The post on Trump's social media site Thursday night ratcheted up tensions with the U.S.'s northern neighbor after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he plans to double his country's exports to countries outside the U.S. because of the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. White House officials said Trump's reaction was a culmination of the administration's long, pent-up frustration about Canada's strategy in trade talks.

Later Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province had sponsored the ad, said it would be taken down. 

Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Mark Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. Ford said they've achieved their goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. 

‚ÄúOur intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,‚Äù Ford said. ‚ÄúWe've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.‚Äù

The U.S. president alleged the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president who remains a beloved figure in the Republican Party, and was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of a hearing scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Trump is so invested in the case that he has said he'd like to attend oral arguments.




‚ÄúCANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!‚Äù Trump wrote on his social media site Friday morning. ‚ÄúThey fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY. Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country.‚Äù

The ad was paid for by Ontario's government, not the Canadian federal government. Ford, the premier, didn't initially back down, posting Friday that Canada and the U.S. are allies ‚Äúand Reagan knew that both are stronger together.‚Äù Ford then provided a link to a Reagan speech where the late president voices opposition to tariffs. 

Ford had said the province plans to pay $54 million (about $75 million Canadian) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987.

Even though the ad will eventually be taken down, it'll still run this weekend, including Game 1 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night.

Ford is a populist conservative who doesn't belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal.

For his part, Carney said his government remains ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors.

‚ÄúWe can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,‚Äù he said Friday morning before boarding a flight for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. Trump is set to travel to the same summit Friday night. 

Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that the ad ‚Äúmisrepresents the ‚ÄòPresidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.‚Äù It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission ‚Äúto use and edit the remarks‚Äù and said it was reviewing legal options. 

The foundation in Simi Valley, California, is perhaps best known for maintaining the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. Its board includes longtime Republican Party stalwarts such as former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose free-market philosophy often clashes with Trump's protectionist tendencies.

Another board member is Lachlan Murdoch, the son of Rupert, who is executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation. The board is chaired by Fred Ryan, the former publisher and CEO of The Washington Post.

Trump wrote Thursday night that ‚ÄúThe Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúTARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.‚Äù

Reagan did not actually love tariffs. He often criticized government policies ‚Äî including protectionist measures such as tariffs ‚Äî that interfered with free commerce and he spent much of that 1987 radio address spelling out the case against tariffs.

White House spokesman Kush Desai said the ad was the ‚Äúlatest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration.‚Äù

Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Friday that Canada has shown a ‚Äúlack of flexibility‚Äù and also cited ‚Äúleftover behaviors from the Trudeau folks,‚Äù referring to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a frosty relationship with the Trump administration.

‚ÄúIf you look at all the countries around the world that we've made deals with, and the fact that we're now negotiating with Mexico separately reveals that it's not just about one ad,‚Äù Hassett said.

Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on.

More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.

Trump said earlier in the week that he had seen the ad on TV and didn't seem bothered by it. ‚ÄúIf I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also,‚Äù he said Tuesday during a lunch with Republican senators. 

Ontario bought more than $275,000 of ad reservations for the spot to air in 198 of the nation's 210 media markets this month, according to data from the nonpartisan media tracking firm AdImpact. It was broadcast most frequently in the New York market, with more than 530 airings, followed by Washington, D.C., at around 280. The only other markets with more than 100 airings were those around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida.

Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs.

The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas.

Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois.

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) ‚Äî New York Attorney General Letitia James accused the Trump administration of using the justice system as a ‚Äútool of revenge‚Äù after she pleaded not guilty Friday in a federal mortgage fraud case the president pressed the Justice Department to bring. 

James' first court appearance in Virginia sets the stage for a high-stakes legal battle between the Republican administration and a longtime Democratic Trump foe who angered him with a major civil fraud case she brought against him. She's accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, where she has family.

James is the third Trump adversary to appear before a judge this month on federal charges, amplifying concerns that the president is using the government's law enforcement powers to seek retribution for his own legal troubles. Justice Department leaders have defended the cases and argue the Biden administration ‚Äî which brought two indictments against him ‚Äî was the one that weaponized the justice system. 




The attorney general left the courthouse smiling to cheers from dozens of waiting supporters, who chanted, ‚ÄúWe stand with Tish!‚Äù The indictment charging her with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, she declared, was about ‚Äúa justice system which has been used as a tool of revenge ‚Ä¶ and a weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy faith is strong, and I have this belief in the justice system and the rule of law, and I have a belief in America,‚Äù James said, adding, ‚ÄúThere's no fear today.‚Äù

The judge set a trial date for Jan. 26, James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, told the judge the defense will seek to have the case dismissed, arguing that it's a vindictive prosecution brought at the direction of the president. 

James was indicted this month after the top federal prosecutor who had been overseeing the investigation was pushed out by the Trump administration and the president publicly called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against James and other political foes. 

Prosecutors allege that when buying the Norfolk home in 2020, James signed a standard document called a ‚Äúsecond home rider‚Äù in which she agreed to keep the property primarily for her ‚Äúpersonal use and enjoyment for at least one year,‚Äù unless the lender agreed otherwise.

Rather than using the home as a second residence, the indictment alleges, James rented it out to a family of three. According to the indictment, the misrepresentation allowed James to obtain favorable loan terms not available for investment properties.

James was first elected in 2018 as New York state's top lawyer, after holding elected jobs in New York City. She is the first woman elected as the state's attorney general. 

James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud.

James' indictment followed the resignation of Erik Siebert as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring a case. Siebert was replaced with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor and presented James' case to the grand jury herself. 

After Siebert's resignation, Trump, in an extraordinary social media post, urged Bondi to prosecute James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote the administration ‚Äúcan't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúJUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!‚Äù

Defense lawyers have said they intend to challenge Halligan's appointment, a step also taken this week by attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey in a different case filed by Halligan. Comey has been charged with lying to Congress in a criminal case filed days after Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute him, and he has pleaded not guilty.

James' lawyers have also asked for an order prohibiting prosecutors from disclosing to the news media information about the investigation, or materials from the case, outside of court.

The motion followed the revelation from earlier this week that Halligan contacted via an encrypted text messaging platform a reporter from Lawfare, a media organization that covers legal and national security issues, to discuss the James prosecution and complain about coverage of it. The reporter published the exchange that she and Halligan had.

A third Trump adversary, former national security adviser John Bolton, pleaded not guilty last week to charges against him of emailing classified information to family members and keeping top secret documents at his Maryland home. 

The Justice Department has also been investigating mortgage fraud allegations against Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, whom Trump has called to be prosecuted over allegations related to a property in Maryland. In a separate mortgage investigation, authorities have been probing allegations against Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, who is challenging a Trump administration effort to remove her from her job. Schiff and Cook have denied wrongdoing.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on the meeting between President Donald Trump, the secretary of War and top military leaders on ‚ÄòAmerica Reports.'

The Department of War received an anonymous donation of $130 million Thursday to go toward paying U.S. troops during the government shutdown ‚Äî but Congress may need to get involved for it to actually get in the hands of service members due to legal limitations.

""On October 23, 2025, the Department of War accepted an anonymous donation of $130 million under its general gift acceptance authority,"" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement to Fox News Digital Friday. ""The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of Service members' salaries and benefits. We are grateful for this donor's assistance after Democrats opted to withhold pay from troops.""

But it's unclear how the Trump administration can legally use the funds to pay troops without Congress' involvement.

(Charley Triballeau/Agence France-Presse)

While the government may accept general donations that go toward general funds available to the government, Congress is the one who must appropriate that money to go toward federal employees' salaries, according to Romina Boccia, the director of budget and entitlement policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington.

WHITE HOUSE MAY 'RUN OUT' OF FUNDS TO PAY MILITARY IF SHUTDOWN CONTINUES, JOHNSON WARNS

""The department is welcome to acknowledge this donor's intent but that does not change the legal restrictions on Congress needing to appropriate funds to pay military salaries,"" Boccia said in a Friday email to Fox News Digital. 

Boccia said that the military is only permitted to accept private donations to support institutions like military schools, libraries, and museums, or to support service members or civilian employees who are wounded or killed in the line of duty.

Altering current restrictions would also require congressional intervention, she said.

""The only way to get around this restriction is if Congress decided to recategorize troop pay as mandatory or direct spending,"" Boccia said.

Mandatory spending does not require annual approval from Congress and applies to programs like Social Security and Medicare, according to the Treasury.

Congress has the power of the purse, and Article I of the U.S. Constitution establishes that Congress is the branch of government with the authority to manage the federal budget.

President Donald Trump announced Thursday that a ""friend"" of his sent the government a $130 million check to go toward paying U.S. service members as their paychecks are on hold due to the budget stalemate.

""He called us the other day and said, 'I'd like to contribute any shortfall you have because of the Democrat shutdown. I'd like to contribute personally, because I love the military and I love the country,'"" Trump said Thursday.

It's unclear who the donor is, and Trump said he would not identify the individual unless he received permission to do so, noting he didn't believe the individual wanted any recognition.

The White House referred Fox News Digital to the Department of War and the Department of the Treasury when asked for additional details.

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Trump previously signed an order allowing active-duty troops to receive their paycheck earlier in October by funneling unused Pentagon funds originally allocated for research and development. However, Republicans have said the solution is only temporary.

Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on New York Governor Kathy Hochuls endorsement of NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Special Report.

It took four months, but one of the top Democrats in New York State has finally endorsed New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani.

With Election Day closing in, Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the U.S. House, on Friday announced his support for Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from the New York City borough of Queens, in a statement to the New York Times.

""Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy,"" Jeffries said.

Jeffries added: ""In that spirit, I support him and the entire citywide Democratic ticket in the general election.""

Jeffries acknowledged in his statement that he has ""areas of principled disagreement"" with Mamdani.

Jeffries, whose congressional district covers much of neighboring Brooklyn, becomes the second major New York State Democrat to back Mamdani, following a late September endorsement from Gov. Kathy Hochul.

The endorsement from Jeffries comes the day before early voting begins in New York City on Saturday.

The top two Democrats in the New York State legislature backed Mamdani days after the governor announced her support.

The endorsements from Jeffries and Hochul may put intense pressure on longtime Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who is the top Democrat in the Senate, to also back Mamdani in an election that is a little over a week away. 

Mamdani shocked the political world in June with his convincing win over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic Party's mayoral nomination in the nation's most populous city.

The Ugandan-born Mamdani, if elected, would become the first Muslim and first millennial mayor of the nation's most populous city. He is the clear frontrunner in the latest public opinion polls in the mayoral race in the Democrat-dominated city.

Mamdani is sitting on a large double-digit lead over Cuomo in the latest New York City public opinion polls.

Guardian Angels co-founder Curtis Sliwa, who for a second straight election is the Republican mayoral nominee in the Democrat-dominated city, is a distant third in the polls. 

New York's current mayor, the embattled incumbent Eric Adams, had decided to run as an independent but announced late last month that he would no longer pursue the office amid anemic polling. President Donald Trump's advisors had floated administration roles for both mayoral hopefuls.

This week, Adams endorsed Cuomo, even though the two had repeatedly clashed earlier this year on the campaign trail.

POLL POSITION: JUST HOW LARGE IS MAMDANI'S LEAD IN THE NYC MAYORAL RACE?

Mamdani surged to the Democratic primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living. It was fueled by a massive grassroots army of supporters and backing from top national progressive champions, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) ""tuition-free,"" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering ""free childcare"" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores.

Mamdani has been heavily criticized by his rivals for his far-left platform, as well as his verbal attacks on Israel, his past critical comments about the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and his proposal to shift certain responsibilities away from the NYPD and focus on social services and community-based programs. 

""Assemblyman Mamdani has promised to focus on keeping every New Yorker safe, including the Jewish community that has confronted a startling rise in antisemitic incidents as well as Black and Latino neighborhoods that have battled deadly gun violence for years,"" Jeffries said in his statement on Friday.

Trump, a native New Yorker who now calls Florida home, has derided Mamdani ever since his primary victory as a ""communist"" and earlier this month came up with a new derogatory nickname.

""I call him my little communist. He's my little communist mayor,"" Trump said during an extended Fox News interview on ""Fox and Friends.""

Republicans have worked overtime the past three months to anchor the mayoral nominee to vulnerable congressional Democrats up for re-election in next year's midterms.

""'Leader' Hakeem Jeffries just bent the knee to the socialist left, and now the only place he's leading his party is down a cold, dark tunnel toward electoral humiliation. Every single Democrat owns the socialist agenda and is now a willing accomplice in their own party's collapse,"" National Republican Congressional Committee national press secretary Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Jeffries met with Mamdani for the first time in July, with a second meeting last month. While Jeffries praised Mamdani's affordability emphasis on the campaign trail, neither meeting resulted in an endorsement.

Most House Democrats, including many progressives, have given Jeffries plenty of latitude and have declined to criticize his lack of an endorsement.

Among the exceptions is Ocasio-Cortez, who said earlier this summer that ""we use our primaries to settle our differences, and once we have a nominee, we rally behind that nominee,""

Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a former House Democrat, similarly chastised congressional leaders for failing to rally around Mamdani.

While Jeffries joins Hochul in endorsing Mamdani, New York State Democratic Party chair Jay Jacobs said that he ‚Äî as an individual ‚Äî wouldn't endorse his party's mayoral nominee.

And Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, whose suburban swing congressional district includes a small portion of Queens, has previously announced that he wouldn't support Mamdani.

Rumors of the Friday endorsement earned immediate criticism from Republicans suggesting that Jeffries is succumbing to pressure from his far-left base to endorse Mamdani despite his socialist policies that will certainly become a target during next year's midterms.

Fox News State Department correspondent Gillian Turner reports on pushback within the Republican Party against the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug vessels on ‚ÄòSpecial Report.' 

The Trump administration has ordered the deployment of the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group in the Western Hemisphere as the U.S. continues to target suspected drug smuggling vessels in the Caribbean.  

""In support of the President's directive to dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) and counter narco-terrorism in defense of the Homeland, the Secretary of War has directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group and embarked carrier air wing to the U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) area of responsibility (AOR),"" chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.  

""The enhanced U.S. force presence in the USSOUTHCOM AOR will bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the Western Hemisphere,"" he added. ""These forces will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle TCOs.""

Ford Carrier Strike Group has been ordered to embark to the U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) area of responsibility, the Pentagon said Friday.  (Photo by JONATHAN KLEIN/AFP via Getty Images)

USSOUTHCOM's area of responsibility includes the land mass of Latin America south of Mexico, the waters adjacent to Central and South America and the Caribbean Sea.

The strike group includes the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, according to the U.S. Navy, as well as the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Mahan, USS Winston S. Churchill and USS Bainbridge. 

The USS Gerald R. Ford is currently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea along with three destroyers. It would likely take several days for the ships to make the journey to South America. In August, the strike group transited the Strait of Dover, the narrowest part of the English Channel. 

The deployment would mean there will be no U.S. aircraft carriers in the Middle East for the first time in years. 

The Trump administration has ordered a number of strikes in the Caribbean aimed at dismantling and disrupting drug cartels in the region. 

Most recently, War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday that a strike on a vessel allegedly operated by suspected members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Venezuelan street gang deemed a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO), killed six alleged narco-terrorists.

""If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat al-Qaeda,"" Hegseth wrote on X. ""Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you."" 

It marked the 10th strike targeting suspected drug trafficking boats since Trump returned to office. The president has made combating the nation's drug crisis a central policy focus.

Trump has accused Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro of being a drug cartel leader as he continues to increase pressure on the Maduro regime.

Last week, Trump confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, saying he did so because the South American nation has released prisoners into the U.S. and that drugs were coming into the U.S. from Venezuela through sea routes.

Meanwhile, the military strikes have attracted scrutiny from both sides of the aisle as questions swirl about their legality. 

Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., recently introduced a war powers resolution that would prohibit U.S. armed forces from participating in ""hostilities"" against Venezuela.

While speaking to reporters in Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was open to working with the United Nations, but not its agency for Palestinians known as UNRWA.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived in Israel shortly after Vice President JD Vance left for Washington, railed against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) amid the U.S.-brokered ceasefire.

""UNRWA's not going to play any role in it,"" Rubio said when asked about whether the controversial agency would assist in delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. ""The United Nations is here. They're on the ground. We're willing to work with them if they can make it work, but not UNRWA. UNRWA became a subsidiary of Hamas.""

UNRWA demanded in a post on X that it be allowed to do work in Gaza.

""As the largest U.N. agency operating in the Gaza Strip, by far, UNRWA has an unparalleled logistical network, longstanding trust from the community, managing the distribution of supplies based on vulnerability and clear criteria. Our teams are ready, inside and outside Gaza. Let us work,"" the agency wrote.

On Oct. 17, days after world leaders backed a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) opened a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), which is where Rubio spoke on Friday.

The CMCC is located in southern Israel and will serve as the main hub for Gaza stabilization efforts. It will also oversee implementation of the ceasefire agreement and has an operations floor designed to track real-time developments in Gaza.

During the U.N. General Assembly (UNGA) last month, U.N. Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres spoke at a meeting in support of UNRWA, saying that the agency has ""made invaluable contributions to development, human rights, humanitarian action, and peace and security, including for Israel.""

""UNRWA is vital to any prospects for peace and stability in the region,"" Guterres added.

US MILITARY TO OVERSEE NEXT PHASE OF PEACE DEAL FROM COORDINATION BASE IN ISRAEL

However, the U.S. and Israel have taken hard stances against the agency, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre.

President Donald Trump in February reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to not fund UNRWA. 

In the executive order, Trump said that ""UNRWA has reportedly been infiltrated by members of groups long designated by the Secretary of State as foreign terrorist organizations, and UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.""

UNRWA SCHOOLS ‚ÄòHIJACKED BY HAMAS,' WATCHDOG REPORT WARNS

In April 2025, when the International Court of Justice (ICJ) demanded Israel work with UNRWA, Washington backed Jerusalem, saying it was under no obligation to work with the agency and had ""ample grounds to question UNRWA's impartiality.""

UNRWA announced in August 2024 the end of an investigation by the Office of Internal Oversight Services into whether its staff participated in the attacks, as Israel claimed. Following the probe, which looked into 19 UNRWA staff members, nine staff members were fired over evidence that ""could indicate"" they were involved in the attacks.

The investigation found one case in which there was no evidence to confirm the staffer's involvement and nine other cases in which ""the evidence obtained by OIOS was insufficient"" to prove their participation, according to UNRWA.

Former FBI agent Bobby Chacon breaks down how investigators cracked the Palisades fire case after a Florida man's arrest, sharing key signs that tipped off authorities on 'America's Newsroom.'

The suspect accused of starting what prosecutors have described as ""one of the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles history"" reportedly had an outburst in federal court as he pleaded not guilty.

Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, of Melbourne, Florida, entered a not guilty plea Thursday to counts of destruction of property by means of fire, arson affecting property used in interstate commerce and timber set afire, according to FOX 11 Los Angeles.

Rinderknecht appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Rozella Oliver wearing a white jumpsuit. His attorney argued that Rinderknecht should be released on bail based on an evaluation by court officials in Florida, where he was arrested on Oct. 7.

However, Rinderknecht looked agitated when the judge in Los Angeles again ordered that he remain in jail.

""Can I actually say something about detainment?"" Rinderknecht interjected into the microphone in court, according to The Associated Press.

His attorney, Steve Haney, said they planned to return to the judge with additional evidence for why Rinderknecht should be released on bail.

""He's a frustrated young man,"" Haney said after the hearing. ""He doesn't know why he's in jail right now.""

Haney told the judge he took issue with the fact that Rinderknecht was facing charges for the Palisades Fire when he allegedly started the smaller fire beforehand known as the Lachman Fire.

""My client is being charged with a fire that started seven days after,"" he said.

Rinderknecht was staying at his sister's house in Orlando when he was arrested by federal officials on Oct. 7. He made his first court appearance the next day in Florida on a charge of malicious destruction by means of a fire.

A week later, a grand jury indicted him on additional charges, including one count of arson affecting property used in interstate commerce and one count of timber set afire. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in federal prison.

Rinderknecht's trial is set for December 16.

Rinderknecht has no documented history of mental health issues, drug use or prior criminal activity, Haney said.

However, the judge in Florida who initially ordered Rinderknecht to be detained said he had concerns about Rinderknecht's mental health and his ability to get to California for future court hearings.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California previously cited court documents as saying that, ""law enforcement determined that the Palisades Fire was a ‚Äòholdover' fire ‚Äî a continuation of the Lachman Fire that began early in the morning on New Year's Day 2025.""

""Law enforcement determined ‚Äî using witness statements, video surveillance, cellphone data, and analysis of fire dynamics and patterns at the scene, among other things ‚Äî that Rinderknecht maliciously set the Lachman Fire just after midnight on January 1 on land owned by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA), an organization that received federal funding,"" the office added. ""A week later, the same fire ‚Äî then known as the Palisades Fire ‚Äî burned federal property.""

NORFOLK, VA ‚Äî New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is scheduled to appear Friday morning in a Virginia federal courtroom for her arraignment on mortgage fraud charges.

James, 67, will be arraigned at 11 a.m. EST at the Walter E. Hoffman U.S. Courthouse in Norfolk, where she will enter a plea to a two-count indictment accusing her of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. She is expected to plead not guilty.

A federal grand jury indicted James on Oct. 9, alleging that she falsely claimed she would personally occupy a Norfolk home she purchased in August 2020 with a $109,600 mortgage loan. Prosecutors contend the property was instead used as a rental investment home occupied by her grandniece's family, including a relative currently wanted on outstanding warrants in North Carolina.

The alleged misrepresentation saved James nearly $19,000 over the life of the loan, according to the indictment. The attorney general listed the property as an investment in her state ethics disclosures until May of this year, one month after federal housing officials referred her to the Justice Department for potential fraud.

The case is being prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, the interim head of the Eastern District of Virginia and former personal attorney to President Donald Trump, and is being led by Roger Keller, a Missouri-based prosecutor detailed to assist in the Norfolk office's public corruption and financial crime docket, according to the court docket.

In announcing the charges earlier this month, Halligan said the indictment reflects ‚Äúintentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.‚Äù

James has called the prosecution politically motivated, accusing the Trump administration of ‚Äúweaponizing‚Äù federal law enforcement in retaliation for her prior civil case against the former president. ‚ÄúThese charges are baseless,‚Äù she said in a statement, adding that ‚Äúthe president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order.‚Äù

James is represented by Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney who currently represents former national security adviser John Bolton in his criminal classified documents case. He previously served as counsel to Hunter Biden in his gun and tax criminal cases.

If convicted, James faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million, though sentencing guidelines would likely recommend a lesser penalty for a first-time offender.

The James indictment came just one day after former FBI Director James Comey was arraigned in the same district on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation. 

Comey's case is being handled by two North Carolina-based federal prosecutors, amid reports that the Eastern District's office encountered resistance from some prosecutors when seeking charges for both defendants. Prior to Comey's indictment, then-U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned under pressure and was replaced by Halligan, who proceeded to file the charges against Comey days before the statute of limitations ran out on his alleged offenses.

In court filings on Thursday, a notice in Comey's case indicated an out-of-district judge will hold a hearing on Nov. 13 to weigh Comey's challenge to Halligan's appointment, as he has maintained she was improperly installed into the office. James, on Thursday, indicated she plans to make the same move as early as Friday.

‚ÄúIn the interest of efficiency and to avoid any unnecessary delay, particularly if this Court must designate this motion to an out-of-district judge, Attorney General James files the instant Notice to formally alert the Court,‚Äù a filing on her criminal court docket reads.

Separately on Thursday, the liberal watchdog group American Oversight announced it had launched an investigation into Halligan's use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to communicate with a journalist about the James case.

Earlier this week, Lawfare reporter Anna Bower published a transcript of her Signal exchange with Halligan, noting that the prosecutor had enabled an auto-delete feature to erase messages after eight hours.

‚ÄúThe story about U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's use of Signal is deeply troubling,‚Äù said Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group. ‚ÄúThat she used the app apparently to discuss government business with a reporter, and configured her messages to disappear after eight hours, raises serious concerns that she is actively violating the Federal Records Act and the Justice Department's own records-retention rules.‚Äù

American Oversight said Thursday it had submitted a public records request to obtain Halligan's Signal communications. In a separate court filing Thursday, James's counsel also requested the federal court issue an order requiring the government to follow the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by barring the government from making extrajudicial statements, citing the Signal texts.

LEAKED SIGNAL TEXTS FROM LETITIA JAMES PROSECUTOR DON'T VIOLATE ETHICS RULES, EXPERTS SAY

However, former federal prosecutors told the Washington Examiner that the content of Halligan's texts, as published by Lawfare, did not appear to violate ethical obligations, though her use of disappearing messages could draw further scrutiny amid the public records request.

Friday's proceeding will mark the first time a sitting New York attorney general has faced federal criminal charges. James's courtroom appearance is expected to draw national attention, given her past prominence in pursuing high-profile civil and criminal cases, including a $500 million civil fraud case she brought against Trump in the fall of 2022.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A few years ago, FAANG engineers were famously ""locked in"" by massive equity windfalls. Today, the same dynamic is playing out with AI chipmakers.

According to Levels.fyi data, engineers at AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia are sitting on life-changing stock gains.

Heavy equity-based offers made in late 2023 have ballooned as these stocks have soared. Some Nvidia mid-level engineers, for instance, have seen total compensation swell from roughly $360,000 to $670,000.

Broadcom and AMD engineers are experiencing similar locked-up wealth increases, according to Levels.fyi estimates.



This is the new cost of leaving. Imagine getting 10,000 restricted stock units at $100 a share, which would be worth $1 million over four years. That's the typical vesting period for equity awards like this.

At a normal company, the stock might go up a bit, or it might fall. So your year 3 and 4 vests would probably be worth about $500,000 in total, or maybe $750,000 if you're lucky and the stock goes up a bit.

What if you're at a fancy AI company, and the stock triples? That total 4-year award would balloon to $3 million. Walking away after year 2 could mean forfeiting about $1.5 million. So people often stay.

The ""golden handcuffs"" haven't disappeared; they've just migrated from Big Tech software giants to the silicon stars powering the AI boom.

Levels.fyi calls these ""silicon handcuffs.""

Private-equity investors, I know you've heard this before, but I have a great investment opportunity for you.

I've never worked a day in finance, and I'm arguably closer to the NBA than an MBA, which is saying something considering how bad my jump shot is. But hear me out.

I understand the most basic principle in investing: Buy low, sell high. And I've got an asset that would consider the Mariana Trench a step up.

My beloved New York Jets.

Your immediate reaction might be to laugh (most people do when I tell them I'm a fan). But the NFL has finally opened its doors to institutional investors, and PE firms are rushing to get a piece of the action.

The New England Patriots, San Francisco 49ers, and New York Giants got the green light from the NFL to receive outside investments this week. For the Giants, the deal reportedly valued the Jets' MetLife Stadium roommates at a whopping $10.3 billion. The Pats' ($9 billion) and Niners' ($8.6 billion) valuations weren't anything to sneeze at either.

Admittedly, it won't be a bargain. CNBC has the Jets' valuation at $9.1 billion, which ranks them sixth-highest in the league. Forbes has the Jets slightly lower at $8.1 billion. It's tough to say the price tag definitively, but being based in the largest US city likely means it comes with a nice premium.

Meanwhile, the Jets are 0-7 this year with a real shot at finishing 0-17, which would be the worst season in NFL history. They're tied with the Buffalo Sabres for the longest active playoff drought ‚Äî 14 seasons ‚Äî across the four major US professional sports. (At least we're champs at something.)

A terrible team with a high price tag. Where do I sign up?

There's also a catch. League rules don't allow these new investors to take more than a 10% stake, making them passive investors without voting power. (Man, I'm really doing a good job selling this.)

But getting a foot in the door will give you an edge if the league looks to raise the limit. And if the NFL does change the rules, private-equity investors are known for orchestrating massive turnarounds (or at least trying to).

Now is PE's chance. And don't worry about driving the team into the ground. We're already almost six feet under.

The Jets come with some silver linings.

Fortunately, unlike the English Premier League, the NFL doesn't relegate teams. So, as bad as the Jets are, they get to stay in a league that's minting money.

There are three guarantees in life: death, taxes, and the NFL getting boatloads of money to broadcast its games. The league is reportedly looking to renegotiate its media deals as soon as next year, and it's bound to have a long list of suitors.

The money from the NFL's TV deals is evenly split across all 32 franchises. Private equity loves recurring revenue. How about a few hundred million dollars you can bank on every year?

Jets fans are also devoted. They are committed. You have to be to cheer for a team like this. Looking for a loyal partner? Marry a Jets fan, because anyone who still roots for them definitely won't leave you. (My wife is a Jets fan, too, so I guess we're really stuck together.)

Just look at this poor sap after Sunday's loss to the Carolina Panthers. (This was sent to me no less than three times in 24 hours.)

A post shared by D'Andre McKenzie (@dandremac)

Think of the dedication they'd show to the rest of your portfolio companies! Oh, you own a business that sells water skis? I'll buy 10 of them if you get the Jets a Super Bowl, and I don't even own a boat.

I once had a friend stop eating Kraft products the week leading up to a game against the Patriots to protest team owner Robert Kraft. Only after the game, which we probably lost, did he realize Kraft has nothing to do with the food company he shares a name with. Stupid? Maybe. Loyal? Absolutely.

Bringing the Jets some success could also help you cut more deals. After all, if you can turn the Jets around, what company can't you improve?

Whatever it takes, Jets nation will have your back.

Oops, something went wrong

Wall Street's newest steps reach directly into crypto's core collateral, and that shift could decide where bitcoin's DeFi experiments actually take root once markets turn volatile and balance sheets matter more than slogans.

JPMorgan is preparing a program that lets institutions pledge Bitcoin and Ethereum for loans, while Fidelity's product page now offers Solana trading to eligible U.S. clients. Together, these channels route funding and access through familiar rails that large investors already use.

As collateral and spot activity settle inside incumbent systems, Bitcoin native DeFi will need clear utility, steady settlement, and transparent rules to attract deposits during busy periods, not just during calm sessions when risk feels distant.

JPMorgan plans to let institutional clients pledge Bitcoin and Ethereum for loans, which would place crypto inside a familiar collateral workflow rather than at the edge of bespoke arrangements. The timing matters because collateral that funds against coin holdings can reduce the need to unwind spot or perpetual positions during routine cash needs, particularly when the listed basis is thin.

Bloomberg frames the work as an end-of-year goal and aligns with earlier Financial Times coverage that described internal exploration of crypto-secured lending.

‚ÄúThe expansion underscores how quickly crypto is being pulled into the financial system's core plumbing,‚Äù the report reads. ‚ÄúWith Bitcoin rallying this year and the Trump administration rolling back regulatory hurdles, major banks are starting to bring digital assets deeper into the lending system.‚Äù

If that corridor opens, desks will still price every decision against live markets. Collateral mobility can compress haircuts during calm periods and widen them more predictably during stress, which tends to smooth forced selling rather than amplify it, although the effect ultimately depends on the specific limits that a dealer sets.

Fidelity's product page now lists Solana alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin inside Fidelity Crypto, which places a large-cap token directly inside a mainstream brokerage workflow for eligible U.S. clients. Access alone does not create demand, yet when users already keep cash and securities at the same firm, friction drops during periods when portfolios are rebalanced across asset classes.

Because Solana venues already show deep order books at peak hours, an integrated path through a large broker can change where retail flows land during macro headlines, which in turn shapes how quickly spreads stabilize.

None of this ensures sustained inflows, and it does not imply a policy stance from the broker beyond product availability, yet the operational change is clear on the public page and therefore part of the new baseline for access.

While banks pull crypto closer to traditional funding, Bitcoin-focused DeFi stacks are trying to move liquidity without relying on custodial bridges.

The stated goal is to allow lending, swaps, and other smart contract activity that references native Bitcoin rather than wrapped substitutes, which would let BTC and ETH liquidity meet in programmable venues without surrendering entirely to centralized rails.

How these efforts meet in practice will be visible in the data. If collateral acceptance by large dealers keeps coin balances on institutional books, on-chain programs will need to offer yields or functionality that justifies moving funds into noncustodial systems.

If DeFi primitives deliver that utility with clear rules and dependable settlement, some liquidity will return to those paths during normal conditions and even during stress. Either outcome will be easier to track by pairing protocol disclosures with the aggregate reads, which together show where volume concentrates when policy and product access change at the same time.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade sideways after multiple failed attempts to break above the $4,000 mark. The lack of investor support has stalled its recovery momentum, keeping the second-largest cryptocurrency under pressure. 

Market uncertainty is worsening as long-term holders (LTHs) appear to be moving toward selling their positions.

On-chain data shows a sharp spike in Ethereum's Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric over the last 24 hours. This indicates that long-term holders, or LTHs, have started to liquidate their holdings. The recent surge marks the largest increase in over two months, reflecting a decisive shift in investor sentiment.

LTHs are often viewed as the most influential group within the market due to their substantial holdings and long-term conviction. When they begin selling, it signals growing doubt about near-term performance. This selling activity can trigger broader market reactions, amplifying bearish momentum and putting additional pressure on Ethereum's price stability.

Ethereum's broader macro momentum appears weak as technical indicators show fading bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering below the neutral 50.0 level, indicating that buyers are losing control. This suggests a lack of enthusiasm among investors, even as prices remain near key support levels.

An RSI reading below 50.0 typically signals sustained selling pressure and limited recovery potential. With broader market conditions also showing weakness, Ethereum could struggle to regain traction.

Ethereum's price sits at $3,950 at the time of writing, stuck below the critical $4,000 resistance. The altcoin has been oscillating near $3,872, showing no clear directional bias.

The current indicators suggest that this consolidation phase above $3,742 support is likely to persist. However, if market conditions worsen and ETH slips below $3,742, a further decline toward $3,489 could follow. Such a move would confirm a bearish continuation pattern.

Conversely, if buying activity strengthens and overall sentiment improves, Ethereum could breach the $4,000 resistance level. A successful breakout would open the path toward $4,221, invalidating the bearish outlook and signaling renewed investor confidence.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin price saw a sharp upside to $111,500 levels, extending its daily gains to 2.5% on softer-than-expected US CPI numbers for the month of September.

With inflation on a clear decline in the US, the chances of Fed rate cuts next week has surged to 99% as per data from CME Fed Watch tools.

As a result, altcoins are staging a quick rally with Ethereum , XRP , Binance Coin , gaining over 3% each.

Bitcoin price bounced back from the $110,000 support levels following the release of the US CPI data.

Crypto analyst Ted Pillows stated that Bitcoin (BTC) needs to reclaim the $113,000-$114,000 range to confirm further upside potential.

He also warned that if the current rally turns out to be another false breakout, the market could experience a sharp correction in the near future.

The US Labor Department released a ‚Äúrare exception‚Äù Consumer Price Index (CPI) report amid the ongoing government shutdown, showing inflation cooled more than expected in September.

Headline CPI rose 3.0% year-over-year, slightly below the 3.1% forecast, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, also came in at 3.0%, under expectations of 3.1%.

Both the monthly headline and core CPI readings were weaker than projected, signaling softer inflationary pressures. This has once again triggered the risk-ON sentiment and paved the way for another Federal Reserve rate cut next week.

Amid the CPI inflation data, the US market is also showing strength with the S&P 500 gaining nearly 1% to record highs and approaching nearly 6,800.

The overall cooling of inflation is good for altcoins, as the Federal Reserve could pivot further towards quantitative easing. The data from CME Fed watch tool shows a 99% chance of another 25 bps rate cut coming next week on October 29.

However, it remains to be seen whether the bulls could pull this off for a sustained altseason. On-chain data shows that the Trump insider whale reportedly opened $150 million in long positions ahead of former President Trump's speech today.

The trader, who claims a 10/10 success rate, is said to have accurately predicted every major pump and dump in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

VERACITY IN GAMING

VERACITY IN GAMING

With multiple major titles including Sega's KAI Sangokushi Taisen announcing service terminations, Japan's blockchain game boom is declining.

So-called play-to-earn (P2E) games, which rely on blockchain and NFT technology, started gaining significant traction in Japan's game industry a few years ago, with even major console game publishers like Sega, Square Enix and Konami hopping onto the trend with crypto-related games. However, the boom seems to be fizzling out now, with some of the biggest reasons being how complicated it is to both develop and play these games, as well as the unsustainable economies they're built upon. 

In recent months, several major blockchain games have announced service terminations. This includes Tokyo Beast (developed by Japanese studio gumi), the Sega-published KAI Sangokushi Taisen and Captain Tsubasa: Rivals. Of note, Sega has openly admitted to losing interest in blockchain games as of 2023, with plans to shelve all internally developed projects (source: Gameindustry.biz).  

According to an analysis by Sumaholife, developing and running blockchain games is complex for traditional game developers, and it comes with a range of unique operating costs that make it very difficult to achieve stable revenue. On top of that, from a player's perspective, they're not exactly easy to pick up, as just getting started comes with requirements like opening a crypto exchange account and creating a wallet ‚Äì not things the average casual gamer is familiar with. 

That means the market for blockchain games is extremely niche, but in order to keep functioning, most of these games require a steady flow of new users. The play-to-earn model generally rewards playtime with native tokens of NFT items that can be traded for real profit, but the earnings of existing players rely on money coming from new players. ‚ÄúOften resembling a Ponzi scheme,‚Äù Sumaholife notes, ‚Äúthese in-game economies collapse when token prices fall in response to the playerbase's growth stalling.‚Äù In turn, as existing players realize they're earning less, they end up leaving too. 

Add the overall volatility of the crypto market to these issues, and it's not very surprising that Japan's blockchain game fad is showing signs of dying out. However, it is interesting to note that ever since their emergence, these games have had relatively high media coverage from conventional gaming outlets in Japan, especially when compared to their counterparts in the English-speaking sphere, where there's been a much clearer line drawn between regular games and the not-very-liked ‚Äúblockchain stuff.‚Äù

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The list of donors to President Donald Trump's latest passion project ‚Äî a massive, glitzy new ballroom at the White House ‚Äî include Big Tech corporations, cryptocurrency firms, private equity titans and even some members of his own administration.

The entire East Wing of the White House was surprisingly demolished this week to make room for Trump's $300 million, 90,000-square foot ballroom.

Trump has said the ballroom, which will accommodate about 1,000 guests, is needed so the White House can host large gatherings. He has defended the project by saying he and donors ‚Äî not taxpayers ‚Äî will foot the bill.

Critics, meanwhile, have accused Trump of destroying a historic structure, ignoring a widely held belief that the founders intended for the White House to be a relatively modest building and skirting legally required public review processes for the project. 


The White House has responded by noting that previous presidents have also overseen construction projects on White House grounds.

The list of about three dozen donors released Thursday by the White House includes Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta Platforms, Micron Technology and Microsoft as well as cryptocurrency companies Coinbase, Ripple and Tether America.

Other big name donors include Comcast Corp., which owns NBCUniversal; defense and aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin; and Stephen A. Schwarzman, CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone. 

The family of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Small Business Administration head Kelly Loeffler, along with her husband, have also donated to the ballroom, according to the White House.

Here is the complete list, which did not disclose the amounts each donor has given:

 A major update to Counter-Strike 2's item mechanics wiped nearly $2 billion from its $5.8 billion skin market, igniting debate over central control in gaming. 

The multibillion-dollar market for cosmetic items in the popular esports first-person shooter game Counter-Strike 2 crashed following an update to its mechanics.

According to an Oct. 8 report by Esports News, the Counter-Strike 2 skin market at the time reached a new high of nearly $5.78 billion. A separate Thursday report by Eurogamer said that almost $2 billion of this market was liquidated following a recent game update.

The game's producer, Valve, has changed the trade-up system so that players can now convert five low-rarity (covert level) skins into a knife or a pair of gloves, which were previously exceedingly rare. That instantly increased the supply of knives and gloves, driving down their prices, while the value of the skins spiked amid newfound demand.

A change by a video game company that led to consequences felt by vast ranks of players is one of the reasons cited by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as an inspiration for creating the blockchain. 

He explained that he used to play World of Warcraft from 2007 until 2010, until the company behind the game ‚Äúremoved the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell.‚Äù ‚ÄúI cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit,‚Äú Buterin said at the time.

While blockchain and non-fungible tokens see widespread opposition from the gaming community, they may offer potential solutions to issues such as this one. NFTs, most associated with tradeable digital art, can and are used for any digital goods, such as video game items.

By implementing a smart contract-based digital item using NFTs, it is possible to provide assurances about what the issuer can and cannot do. Smart contracts can set a limit on the number of NFTs in a series that can be issued, or set permanent rules for converting NFTs across different series.

Still, Martin Kupka, a general partner at the crypto gaming advisory firm Win Win, told Cointelegraph that using NFTs alone is not enough. ‚ÄúEven if every item were an NFT, the market would have crashed in the same way, because Valve retains complete control over the items' features and utility,‚Äù he said, adding: 

He suggested that once a game becomes large, establishing a community council and making key decisions transparent would benefit all stakeholders.

While Kupka explained that NFTs do not offer protection against such scenarios, he said that smart contracts could. ‚ÄúThat's the premise of ‚Äúfully on-chain‚Äù games: core game rules are encoded immutably on a blockchain, preventing unilateral, sudden changes,‚Äù he said.

Kori Leon, the co-founder of crypto gaming infrastructure Pixelverse, agreed, saying that ‚Äúsmart contracts could have defined clear rules from the start, making any change predictable and transparent.‚Äù

Catie Romero-Finger, CEO of crypto services agency Babs, told Cointelegraph that the Counter-Strike 2 skin crash ‚Äúis a harsh reminder that even billion-dollar economies can be built solely on borrowed trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat I see is centralization at play, changing the rules mid-flow. Blockchain doesn't make markets less volatile; instead, it replaces unilateral control with transparent code,‚Äú she said.

Nokkvi Dan Ellidason, CEO at crypto gaming infrastructure company Gaimin, told Cointelegraph that the crash ‚Äúexposed the fundamental flaw of centralized digital economies.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's not a true economy; it's a company store,‚Äú he said.

Ellidason said that players just ‚Äúdiscovered, in real-time, that their ‚Äòassets' are just a line item in Valve's private database, a privilege that can be altered at any time.‚Äù 

Joana Barros, chief marketing officer at crypto game My Neighbor Alice, told Cointelegraph that transparency and immutability will be key as gaming economies continue to scale. ‚ÄúAs gaming economies grow to rival real-world markets, transparency and immutability are not just ‚ÄòWeb3 buzzwords', they're basic consumer rights,‚Äù she said.

 The FET token's price fell by over 93% since the merger of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, a drop that is unrelated to Ocean Protocol's actions, according to its founder. 

Update Oct. 24, 4:56 pm UTC: This article has been updated to include comments from an Ocean Protocol Foundation spokesperson.

The feud between Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol Foundation may be drawing to a close as the two sides look to reach a middle ground without escalating into a full-blown legal battle.

On Thursday, Fetch.ai said it would cancel all pending legal claims against the Ocean Protocol Foundation if the latter returned the 286 million Fetch.ai (FET) tokens that were allegedly sold during their merger.

‚ÄúThey are expecting a legal proposal from us for the return of the tokens,‚Äù said Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh, during a Thursday X Spaces show, adding:

Sheikh also offered to cover the legal costs of the pending contract, which would lead to the recovery of the tokens.

Ocean Protocol will agree to return the tokens if the offer is officially put on paper, said FET-based validator node GeoStaking, the protocol that helped broker the deal.

However, the Ocean Protocol Foundation was still awaiting an official written proposal from Fetch.ai at the time of writing.

‚ÄúWe have asked time and again for a written proposal to our attorneys which can then be properly vetted, digested and have received none. Until then, we cannot take any verbal offers seriously or at face value,‚Äù a spokesperson for the Ocean Protocol Foundation told Cointelegraph.

The agreement would enable the two parties to resolve the misunderstandings without the need for a lengthy lawsuit, which could be detrimental to the reputation and finances of both parties.

The latest proposal came days after Sheikh offered a $250,000 reward for more information on the signatories of OceanDAO's multisignature wallet and their connection to the Ocean Protocol Foundation.

A multisignature or multisig wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that requires multiple signatures to execute and process a transaction.

Despite Ocean Protocol denying the misappropriation allegations, blockchain data indicates that an Ocean Protocol-linked multisignature wallet converted about 661 million Ocean tokens into 286 million FET coins, worth around $120 million at the time, according to blockchain data platform Bubblemaps.

This included 160 million FET tokens transferred to Binance and 109 million transferred to GSR Markets.

Ocean Protocol withdrew from the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance on Oct. 9, with no mention of the token transfers.

Since the announcement of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) in March 2024, the FET token has fallen by over 93%, from a peak of $3.22 to about $0.26 at the time of writing.

Still, the price drop was not catalyzed by Ocean Protocol leaving the ASI, according to Bruce Pon, the founder of Ocean Protocol. He wrote in a Thursday blog response:

‚ÄúOcean decided that it could not in good conscience remain a part of the ASI Alliance,‚Äù added the founder, promising to publish a ‚Äúclaim-by-claim rebuttal‚Äù to all the recent allegations.

Why Do Some Comets Dazzle While Others Fizzle?

A comet's brightness depends on how it's made, how and when we see it, and even a bit of unpredictable luck

No two comets are exactly alike.

Of course, they can appear similar. Two decently bright comets that share a superficial resemblance are gracing our skies right now, in fact: C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) and C/2025 R2 (SWAN). They both are on orbits that swoop through the inner solar system and then back out into deep space, past the orbit of Neptune. Lemmon has a period (the time it takes to orbit the sun) of about 1,300 years, while SWAN's is about 650 years. Neither gets particularly close to Earth.

While SWAN's orbit is very well aligned with the plane of the planets as they orbit the sun, Lemmon's orbit is highly inclined, tipped by more than 140 degrees, implying that the two comets have very different histories: in the past, SWAN may have interacted with some of the planets, notably Jupiter, which would've shortened its orbit over time.

Lemmon is somewhat brighter than SWAN and a fine object for binocular-based viewing, but neither is particularly dazzling when compared with others from recent history. In mid-2020, for instance, the beautiful comet C/2020 F3 NEOWISE was bright enough to see easily by eye. And C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) was so bright in 1997 that I saw it from inside my house while looking out a window in a well-lit room!

All this variation raises an obvious question: Why do some comets glow spectacularly while others seem to fizzle out?

The most obvious reason is proximity. If a comet gets closer to Earth, it will generally look brighter.

The best example of this is arguably from the most famous comet of them all: 1/P Halley, also called Halley's Comet (or more correctly, Comet Halley). In 1910 it became extremely bright as it approached within 25 million kilometers of Earth, but the viewing geometry for its next apparition in 1986 was much worse, so it appeared much dimmer. I remember standing in a huge line to look at it through a telescope at the University of Michigan's observatory, where I was an undergrad, but only seeing it as a somewhat dull fuzzy dot. That wasn't the best view for my first actual comet, but‚Äîbeing a supernerd even then‚Äîmy enthusiasm for astronomy wasn't diminished by the experience.

Distance from Earth isn't the only factor, however. The closer a comet gets to the sun, the more the former is heated up, and the more likely it is that the comet will release volatile material and brighten. But even then, it's difficult to say in advance how any given comet will perform. Two comets might have favorable orbits, but one might be so radiant that it makes headlines, while the other may never get bright enough to see without a telescope. As my fellow astronomer (and renowned comet hunter) David Levy likes to say, ‚ÄúComets are like cats: they have tails, and they do precisely what they want.‚Äù That almost feline fickleness mostly has to do with the structure of the comet itself, which can change over time.

It's hard to demarcate what comets even are; astronomers don't actually have a formal, officially accepted definition for them. But for our discussion here, we can generalize to say that comets are bodies made of ice and rock, usually a few to a few dozen kilometers wide, that orbit the sun. They're classified into two broad groups: short-period comets have orbits of less than 200 years around the sun, and long-period comets have orbits that take longer. Short-period comets don't get all that far out from the sun. For example, Comet Halley barely crosses the orbit of Neptune before falling back into the inner solar system. Long-period comets can get so far away that the sun can barely hold on to them gravitationally. C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS), a brilliant comet that was so bright that it was visible during the day in October 2024, gets 10,000 times as far as Halley does out into the black!

Long-period comets also tend to be intrinsically brighter than ones with smaller orbits. That's because they so rarely drop into the inner solar system, which means they're usually more pristine. When a comet gets close enough to the sun, various ices on or just beneath its surface warm up and can turn directly into gas. This gas leaks into space and carries dust‚Äîtiny grains of rock‚Äîalong with it. Together the gas and dust form a fuzzy, enveloping coma (from the Latin for ‚Äúhair‚Äù) around the solid nucleus of the comet. While the nucleus may be a few kilometers across, the coma can be tens of thousands of kilometers wide, which is bigger than some planets. This ejected material reflects a lot of sunlight, making the comet appear much brighter.

As the gas and dust are pushed away by the solar wind and the pressure of sunlight, they can form a long tail (or sometimes separate tails), which can stretch for millions of kilometers, making the comet even more eye-catching. In 2007 the incredible comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught) sprouted a 75-million-km tail, half the distance from Earth to the sun!

Short-period comets get close to the sun much more often than their long-period kin, and every time they do, they deplete more of their gas and dust. Consequently, they don't typically emit as much reflective material per orbit, so they don't get as bright.

Then again, much like cats, comets are notorious for breaking such basic rules. Consider Comet C/1973 E1 (Kohoutek), which astronomers discovered in 1973, when it was still relatively far out in its multimillion-year orbit around the sun. Despite the distance, it was already fairly bright, raising hopes that it would brighten more to become one of the most spectacular comets ever seen. For reasons unknown, it didn't brighten as much as expected, however, and was generally considered a disappointment.

It's thought that the comet had an outburst of some kind shortly before its discovery; perhaps a pocket of ice erupted and blasted out an unusual amount of gas. This would have made the comet seem brighter than it would otherwise be at that distance, setting great expectations for what would ultimately be a lackluster display.

This can work the other way, too: in late 2007 Comet 17P/Holmes, normally a faint short-period object that is only visible through a telescope, suddenly brightened by a factor of a million, becoming a conspicuous naked-eye object. The culprit could have been an outburst of gas or a collision with a small asteroid‚Äîno one knows for sure. But the resulting expanding cloud of material grew so huge that it was apparent to the naked eye as a disk, even though the comet was about 240 million km from Earth at the time‚Äîfarther away than the average distance of the planet Mars.

The overwhelming lesson in observing comets is simple: you never really know what they'll do next. A dull one may suddenly and flamboyantly become a spectacle, while another that initially looks promising may instead dwindle to obscurity. This reinforces an even simpler lesson from astronomy: Keep your eyes on the sky! Eventually, it'll pay off.

Two years ago, former SpaceX engineers used rocket tech to develop a power plant capable of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, with a small asterisk. To draw down CO2, it burned plant waste, making it a sort of ‚Äúvegetarian rocket engine‚Äù for the grid.

This week, Arbor Energy said it had raised a $55 million Series A led by Lowercarbon Capital and Voyager Ventures on the heels of a partial pivot. Its power plant, rather than sticking to a strict vegetarian diet, is going to be more of an omnivore, capable of burning natural gas in addition to biomass. 

The shift happened this year as electricity demand from data centers has boomed. The existing design was fully capable of powering AI servers, but its reach would be limited by sources of wood and agricultural waste. Natural gas is more widely available.

Arbor still plans to capture CO2 from the power plant, which uses oxy-combustion, which transforms hydrocarbons into syngas and then burns it in the presence of pure oxygen. The result is CO2 that doesn't need much preparation for sequestration.

Because of tax credits, storing the CO2 will be cheaper than dumping the pollutant into the atmosphere, Arbor spokesperson Patrick Mahoney told TechCrunch. The company does not plan to sell its technology to businesses that don't plan on capturing the carbon for use or sequestration, he said.

But waste CO2 isn't the only climate consideration when it comes to burning natural gas. The main component of natural gas is methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas that generates 84 times more warming than carbon dioxide over 20 years. 

Because of that, any leaks in the natural gas supply chain can have an outsized effect on the climate impact of a natural gas-fired power plant. Leakage rates as low as 0.2% mean the carbon footprint of a gas-fired power plant could be the same as a coal plant, according to recent research. The U.S. government has estimated that leakage rates throughout the oil and gas supply chain to be around 1%, while satellite measurements show rates of about 1.6% across the U.S.

Arbor said it is working with natural gas providers that are certified to have low leakage rates, with a goal of getting the climate impact of one kilowatt of electricity it generates below 100 grams (about a quarter of a pound). 

The startup confirmed that it is still in the process of building a power plant in Louisiana that will burn biomass. That plant is being funded in part by a $41 million deal with Frontier, the advanced market commitment backed by Stripe, Google, and others. Under that agreement, Arbor must remove 116,000 tons of carbon dioxide by 2030.

The browser wars are heating up again, this time with AI in the driver's seat. 

OpenAI just launched Atlas, a ChatGPT-powered browser that lets users surf the web using natural language and even includes an ‚Äúagent mode‚Äù that can complete tasks autonomously. It's one of the biggest browser launches in recent memory, but it's debuting with an unsolved security flaw that could expose passwords, emails, and sensitive data. 

On TechCrunch's Equity podcast, Max Zeff, Anthony Ha and Sean O'Kane break down Atlas's debut, the broader wave of alternative browsers, and more of the week's startup and tech news.

Also I wonder if the LLM ""knows"" that it has this capability after fine-tuning. If it encounters multiplication as part of some larger chain-of-thought, will it solve that internally, or will it continue to do it step-by-step in the chain-of-thought?

You can sit here and force me to recite (""train me on"") multi-digit multiplication problems and their result until the day I die, and my language model is only going to get marginally better. It is in practicing my symbolic manipulation that I'm going to get better and faster.It seems to me that expecting a Language Model to be very good at multiplication is asking for a substantially superhuman level of performance from them, and one that we have little reason to believe will scale anyhow. What we need is symbolic manipulation, better than the approximation they achieve when ""reasoning"".I find it rather ironic to sit here and use the aforementioned 15 orders of magnitude improvement over the Commodore PET to use that level of symbolic manipulation firepower to  laboriously recreate a software system that is as bad as we are at multiplication for what may well be the same fundamental reasons... and then have the audacity to complain about it. My metaphorical dude, you did a couple trillion multiplications just to get to this single bad multiplication output... maybe another approach is called for.

I think most humans that do math aren't actually literally computing things as some kind of logic machine.We can produce logic, and follow the steps of using that logic, but it doesn't seem to me that our cognition is some kind of logic machine itself.

I guess the challenge is, where would the training data come from? Data on the internet is in its final form so ""next token"" is never a delete.Edit: I guess in essence, that's what reasoning LLMs already do. IIUC the thought blocks are ephemeral, and only the response is maintained for the chat. Maybe there'd be some benefit of doing this recursively? But that's also kind of what subagents are for. So, perhaps nothing new here.

To disprove my point, please generate a list of 5 random 5-digit numbers and demonstrate multiplying them in your head as quickly as you can read them. Since you can't, clearly there is something about that that is hard for you, despite the fact that the act of reading this text, maintaining physical homeostasis while you do it, and all the other things your brain is doing as you do this represents a staggering amount of raw computation that is vastly, vastly in excess of what is nominally needed to achieve that computation.

reply

Mathematics was born out of very careful reasoning that we do through language, we only use formalisms as they allow us to avoid the massive ambiguities that exist in natural language. Formal symbolic manipulation came out of our already existing abilities of symbolic manipulation through language.

If the numbers are represented with the most significant digit first as usual, you need a bunch of intermediate steps before outputting even the first digit just to determine whether it is affected by a carry or not.The paper looks at multiplication of numbers represented with the least significant digit first as a toy task requiring several additions as intermediate steps to study why a model large enough to perform those additions in principle fails to learn to do so in practice.They compare with a model that is first trained to produce the intermediate additions explicitly (as a ""chain of thought"" with a specific format) and then has this CoT progressively shortened during training until there's nothing left of it. But that second model successfully multiplies.The difference appears to be that the presence of the intermediate results induces a better number representation in latent space, whereas the model without CoT gets stuck in a less efficient local minimum.So the answer to the question ""Why can't transformers learn multiplication?"" is that the training process is insufficient for the model to discover the best intermediate steps on its own.You could do a similar experiment where the CoT involves first taking the logarithm, adding, and then exponentiating to get the final result, but I think logarithms are probably another computation that's too difficult to learn without additional hints for intermediate steps.

I suppose you're probably right, but LLMs probably have a lot of log tables in their training data so I'm not so sure.

That lack of capability prevents it from being my daily driver, even if the rest were good enough (I'm not saying it isn't, I'm saying I have no reason to find out).I am certain I have inadvertently pushed many people away from Firefox for that reason alone, because when they ask for me to add Firefox support for my tools, I have to tell them it's impossible.I have tried to talk to Firefox developers about that a few times, at open-source conferences and such, but they think AppleScript is some power-user feature and fail (refuse?) to understand power users drive adoption and create tools that regular users rely on.I remember whenever a Firefox story was submitted on HN, multiple people commented ‚ÄúI want to use Firefox but it's missing <whatever>‚Äù. Then Mozilla started doing a lot of questionable stuff (all of which they eventually abandoned) outside their core competency and even pulling distasteful marketing stunts, and at some point people started commenting even that. I presume many got tired and gave up on Firefox entirely. I almost have. I now root for them only conceptually, because browser diversity is good.I also noticed that no matter how politely someone pointed out on HN ‚ÄúFirefox doesn't fit for me because of <whatever>‚Äù, they always got downvoted. If valid polite criticism is buried, no wonder things stay the way they are.

However, my main reason for ditching Chrome years ago was the fact that I think a browser engine monoculture is bad for the web as a whole, especially if that engine is primarily controlled by a single corporate entity.Manifest v3 and other Google nonsense came later, and are extra reasons to stay away from Chrome, but I still feel strongly that a good alternative needs to use a different engine.

I'm not a content creator and I don't really care about Ladybird. I use Safari.I'm just pointing out that browsers have decades of legacy cruft from mis-steps deciding what the web even should be and someone smart can carve out a path to covering 90% of use cases in 10% of the effort and code. And there are the huge organizational costs Google and others pay that a small organization doesn't have to.Your argument is the same as looking at a large company (say Microsoft) and saying no one can compete without trillions of dollars and tens of thousands of engineers. Ladybird has the benefit of hindsight, as well as a non-idiotic structure (I assume).The defeatism among engineers is sad

If you're really smart and you say ""I can do it with half or a quarter of the resources with hindsight"", sure I might give you the benefit of the doubt, but if you're going to claim you can do it with 0.1% of the resources in a volunteer Discord server effort, no. Not because I wouldn't be happy if that was possible, but because that's not how the world works. Linux is being able to compete with Microsoft because there are now large billion dollar companies like RedHat, Steam and others investing into the development. It takes real money and developer time.And that's the second point, Mozilla has to make these compromises because they are one of the few companies that actually maintains an independent software project at this scale. And if any other competitor ever wants to get there, they'll need to answer these funding questions too. Even if they're ten times as clever, they'll still need tens or hundreds of millions.

I've been fully on DDG for years but becoming slowly skeptical & looking for alternatives.1. They're leaning heavily into ""responsible AI"", much like Mozilla2. Might be just me but I feel like their algorithm became significantly worse recently. Over the years they've gone from being worse than Google in the early days to steadily improving & overtaking Google on quality (I made heavy use of !g until I started slowly realising it was no longer giving me better results). But now I feel like they've reversed & regressed again.

Yes, both the President and the Attorney General have been doing this openly, and explicitly citing it as the basis for their instructions to federal law enforcement. They have also been prosecuting based on false testimony of federal officers about assaults (and being forced to dismiss a stunningly high number of filed cases on that basis), and still using the numbers from those false claims as basis for asserting a huge spike in assaults on federal offficers, which also is being cited directly as justification for reallocating resources and setting enforcement prioirities.

There are some moments that tech nerds will never forget. Like Steve Jobs introducing the first iPhone with a live demo of its groundbreaking ‚Äúmulti-touch‚Äù screen or that time that Jobs pulled the first MacBook Air from a manila envelope to demonstrate how insanely thin it was. Okay, whatever, we mostly just remember shit that Steve Jobs said and did, but still, we remember it all the same.

And however epic those moments were, they're just so, I don't know, obvious. So pass√©! That's why I'm creating new tech moments in my head so big and groundbreaking that I will remember the time and date I witnessed them. Moments like when I learned that smart candles are technically a thing. That's right: smart candles. Welcome to the f*cking future.

For this momentous achievement in the world of gadgetry, we have a Chinese company called SwitchBot (the same company that makes the cuddly Kata plushie AI robot) to thank.  SwitchBot recently announced the Candle Warmer Lamp. Candle warmer lamps, for those heathens out there who are still lighting candles on fire with matches like some kind of over-privileged Neanderthal, are a type of lamp that warms your candle to activate the scent instead of using a burning wick. SwitchBot's Candle Warmer Lamp does basically the same thing, but theirs is smart. That means the same thing it always means in this day and age, which is that it's internet-connected.

SwitchBot's Candle Warmer Lamp is Matter-enabled (meaning it works uniformly across all your major smart home platforms, including Google Home and Alexa) and comes with an app that lets you fine-adjust parameters like the scent and lighting levels from your phone. Yes, you can use your phone to make your candle smellier (or less smelly). Sure, you could do the same thing with a candle warming lamp that isn't connected to the internet, but walking over to a lamp and moving a slider with your hands? Yuck, who's got time for that? I'm a man of refinement. So refined, in fact, that I might even yell at my ancient Google smart speaker to turn my smart candle warmer on just so that it can accidentally turn my lights off instead.

In case you were wondering, SwitchBot's Candle Warmer Lamp does support different candle sizes, though there's a maximum of 9.5cm in diameter and 14cm in height. You can also change the brightness level, which is great if you're trying to set the mood with, ya know, candlelight. Oh, and you can set schedules to turn the lamp on or off at certain hours, which is great for candle o'clock when everyone traditionally burns candles and says a prayer to the wax gods.

If you're ready to exit the Stone Age of torching candles with fire, you can purchase SwitchBot's Candle Warmer Lamp for $39, which is pretty cheap, but even cheaper when you consider the fact that you'll be able to participate in the historic leap from regular-ass candle warming lamps to smart regular-ass candle warming lamps. I can't say for certain, but I think Steve Jobs would approve.

In the badlands of Wyoming lies the ‚Äúmummy zone.‚Äù This section of rocks dating back to the Cretaceous Period has produced several strikingly well-preserved dinosaur specimens over the last century, and now, scientists have used two of them to definitively determine what one long-lost species looked like.

In the early 2000s, researchers found two specimens of Edmontosaurus annectens, a large duck-billed dinosaur, in the mummy zone. The fossils were remarkably preserved, still showing fine details of scales and hooves 66 million years after these animals walked the Earth. In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, the team used these fossils to reveal exactly how this happened and reconstruct the species' living appearance.

‚ÄúIt's the first time we've had a complete, fleshed-out view of a large dinosaur that we can really feel confident about,‚Äù co-author Paul Sereno, a professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago, said in a release.

In the early 1900s, researchers found several exceptionally well-preserved dinosaur fossils in a particular section of the Lance Formation‚Äîa division of rocks in east-central Wyoming dating back to the Cretaceous Period. Decades later, Serrano and his colleagues used historical photos and field sleuthing to map the area, dubbing it the ‚Äúmummy zone.‚Äù

In 2000 and 2001, they excavated two E. annectens mummies‚Äîa late juvenile and an early adult‚Äîwith large portions of their external skin surface still preserved. Unlike human mummies found in Egyptian tombs, however, the skin, spikes, and hooves of these dino mummies were preserved not as tissue but as an extremely thin clay film that formed on the carcass.

‚ÄúThis is a mask, a template, a clay layer so thin you could blow it away,‚Äù Sereno explained. ‚ÄúIt was attracted to the outside of the carcass in a fluke event of preservation.‚Äù

Using a variety of imaging techniques and observations of the discovery site, he and his team figured out exactly how this preservation process‚Äîcalled clay templating‚Äîoccurred. Soon after these two dinosaurs perished, a flash flood struck, burying their bodies in sediment.

The decaying carcasses were coated in a film of bacteria, which electrostatically attracted clay found in the sediment. This covered the bodies in a clay mask no more than 0.01 inches (0.02 centimeters) thick, creating a 3D cast of their true surface. The organic material decayed away, and over millions of years, the skeleton beneath the cast fossilized.

The two E. annectens mummies allowed the researchers to reconstruct the species' living appearance, determining that it had a fleshy crest along its neck and back that turned into a single row of tail spikes. Its thin skin was mostly covered with small pebble-like scales. Most surprisingly, the hind feet of the adult mummy bore wedge-shaped hooves.

‚ÄúThere are so many amazing ‚Äòfirsts' preserved in these duck-billed mummies‚Äîthe earliest hooves documented in a land vertebrate, the first confirmed hooved reptile, and the first hooved four-legged animal with different forelimb and hindlimb posture,‚Äù Sereno said.

Digital artists used these insights to recreate the appearance and movement of the duckbill walking on soft mud near the end of the Cretaceous Period.

This work ‚Äútells a coherent story about how these remarkable fossils come to be and what we can learn from them,‚Äù Sereno said. As researchers continue to explore the mummy zone, there's no telling what new discoveries await them.

Here's something to unnerve you during your next trip to the supermarket. Research out this week shows that a substantial portion of urinary tract infections can be traced back to store-bought meat tainted with dangerous Escherichia coli bacteria.

Researchers at George Washington University and others examined thousands of samples taken from people with UTIs. They found that roughly one in five infections were likely caused by foodborne strains of E. coli. The results suggest that contaminated meat is an underappreciated source of these often miserable infections, the researchers say.

‚ÄúThese findings highlight zoonotic transmission as an important driver of UTIs,‚Äù they wrote in their paper, published Thursday in the journal mBio.

UTIs are one of the most common infections around, and they're estimated to result in 3 million visits to the emergency room in the U.S. alone every year. Over 80% of UTIs are caused by E. coli. These bacteria are found most everywhere, including the guts of people and many of the animals that we regularly eat, though only some strains can make us sick.

The George Washington University researchers have been investigating the possibility of foodborne UTIs for quite a while.

In 2018, for instance, they published a study showing clear evidence of human UTIs caused by E. coli bacteria first found in store-bought meat, especially chicken. But the researchers say it's still been unclear just how often UTIs are likely to originate from food, particularly in major metropolitan areas. To help answer this, they teamed up with other researchers at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.

Together, they collected a large amount of E. coli samples from both real-life UTI patients in Southern California and packages of retail meat, ultimately sequencing the genetics of over 5,000 samples. They then developed an algorithm, based on 17 specific genetic markers, to identify whether a particular sample of E. coli originally came from animals or humans.

All told, they found that 18% of human UTI infections diagnosed in the region between 2017 and 2023 were probably zoonotic in origin‚Äîfoodborne, in other words.

The researchers note that their findings are limited to a single, if large, region. So more studies should be done to quantify the extent of this issue in other parts of the country. But given their earlier research, it certainly seems likely that tainted meat plays a significant and underrecognized role in UTIs.

‚ÄúUrinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem,‚Äù said senior study author Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, in a statement from the university.

The current findings might also help inform prevention efforts moving forward. The most dangerous foodborne UTI strains tended to come from chicken and turkey, for instance. And people living in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to have foodborne UTIs.

Fortunately, the same tips used to prevent foodborne illness in general should also lower your risk of these UTIs. That includes buying meat that's securely sealed and won't leak onto your other groceries, thoroughly cooking your meat, and washing your hands after handling raw food.

CyberPowerPC attempts to be all things to all people with systems aimed at gamers on a low budget and players with deep pockets. Our Gamer Xtreme review unit definitely skews to the budget end of the spectrum with a price tag of just $1,099.

That price gets you a Core Ultra 200 Series CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 2TB SSD, and an RTX 5060 GPU. Throw in a stylish case and RGB lighting galore, and you'll see that CyberPowerPC aims to please people on a budget with the Gamer Xtreme.

The latest edition of the Gamer Xtreme utilizes a Phanteks NV5 mid-tower case. It's an interesting design constructed of black-painted stainless steel with a glass front and a glass side panel to give you an unobstructed view of the system's interior components. There's also plenty of ventilation, with a grill on the right-side panel for three vertically-mounted 120mm RGB fans. The top panel also includes ventilation, with support for another three 120 mm fans or a 360 mm radiator (although our review unit didn't have the additional fans) and a removable dust filter. There's a fourth 120mm RGB fan at the rear of the case for exhaust.

In addition to the RGB fans, there's a light strip at the base of the front glass, and another light strip that traces the ‚Äúramp‚Äù housing the power supply. The final piece to the lighting scheme is the air cooler for the CPU, which features a 120mm RGB fan.

The case offers good cable management options, with all of the power cables routing beneath the motherboard, mainly leaving uninterrupted airflow to keep everything nice and cool.

The Gamer Xtreme measures 9.4 x 18.8 x 20.8 inches. For comparison, the CyberPower Gamer Supreme has dimensions of 19.5 x 9.3 x 18.1 inches, and the iBuyPower Y40 Pro comes in at 18.58 x 17.28 x 9.44 inches

CyberPowerPC opted for an Asus B860M Max Gaming AX motherboard for the Gamer Xtreme, which uses Intel's B860M chipset and supports Intel LGA1851 processors. In our review unit, the socket was populated with a Core Ultra 5 225F processor.

The motherboard features four DIMM slots, supporting a maximum of 256GB DDR5 memory. Our review unit featured two slots filled with 16GB Team Group T-Force Vulcan DDR5-6400 modules.

There are three M.2 slots onboard (PCIe 5.0 x4, PCIe 4.0 x4, PCIe 4.0 x2), along with four SATA 6 Gbps ports for storage. In addition, there is one PCIe 5.0 x16, one PCIe 4.0 x16 (x4 mode), and two PCIe 4.0 x16 slots (x1 mode). For additional storage you can mount HDDs and SSDs to a vertical bracket behind the right-side panel (beneath the motherboard).

Our Gamer Xtreme review unit came with an Intel Core Ultra 5 225F ""Arrow Lake"" processor, which is a 10-core design (6 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores) with a base clock of 3.3 GHz and a maximum turbo clock of 4.9 GHz. You also get 32GB of DDR5-6400 memory and an MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Shadow 2X OC (8GB) with a maximum graphics clock of 2,527 MHz.

We don't have any additional RTX 5060 prebuilts in our desktop gaming PC testing database, so we have assembled the closest matches that we could find. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme is equipped with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 32GB of DDR5-6000, and an RTX 5060 Ti. The iBuyPower Y40 Pro enters the ring with a Ryzen 9 7900X, 32GB of DDR5-5200, and an RTX 5070 Ti.

I've been playing through Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in my downtime and averaged between 120 to 145 frames per second (FPS) at 1080p using Ultra settings.

Beginning with Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest settings), the Gamer Xtreme delivered 128 FPS at 1080p and 39 FPS at 4K. The Gamer Supreme, with its RTX 5060 Ti, was able to improve on those numbers, garnering 149 FPS and 46 FPS, respectively. Of course, the Y40 Pro came out, guns blazing, delivering 100 more FPS than the Gamer Xtreme at 1080p (228 FPS) and 89 FPS at 4K.

Cyberpunk 2077 (Ray Tracing Ultra settings) shows no mercy when it comes to graphics hardware demands, as the Gamer Xtreme could only extract 39 FPS at 1080p. Cranking the slider to 4K turned things into a slideshow, at just 2 FPS. The Gamer Supreme clocked in at 53 FPS at 1080p resolution, and 15 FPS at 4K. Not surprisingly, the Y40 Pro was the clear leader in the benchmarks, with 87 FPS and 29 FPS at 1080p resolution and 4K resolution, respectively.

Far Cry 6 (Ultra settings), is another veteran of our gaming benchmark suite, and here the Gamer Xtreme pulled 109 FPS at 1080p and a playable 50 FPS at 4K. The Gamer Supreme was about 20 percent faster in each benchmark, while the Y40 Pro doubled the Gamer Xtreme's performance at 4K (102 FPS).

Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium settings), is still one of the most beautiful PC games I've ever played, even six years after its release. The Gamer Xtreme is capable of 84 FPS at 1080p, which drops to 31 FPS at 4K resolution. The Y40 Pro shows the true power of the RTX 5070 Ti, nearly doubling performance at 1080p (161 FPS) and more than doubling at 4K (66 FPS).

Finally, our Borderlands 3 benchmark (Badass settings), showed the Gamer Xtreme delivering 116 FPS at 1080p and 44 FPS at 4K. For comparison, the Gamer Supreme with its RTX 5060 Ti hit 135 FPS at 1080p and 52 FPS at 4K.

The gaming performance of the Gamer Xtreme was quite good, all things considered. The Core Ultra 5 225F is no match for the Ryzen processors in CPU-intensive games or higher-spec RTX 50 Series graphics cards at 4K resolution. But when you consider the $1,099 price tag of the Gamer Xtreme versus the $1,859 price of the Gamer Supreme, the roughly 10 to 20% performance differential between the two systems becomes a lot more palatable for budget shoppers.

Metro Exodus is our go-to resource for gaming PC stress tests, and we used a 15-run loop on the Gamer Xtreme. The system averaged 89.57 FPS at 1080p, with a low of 87.96 FPS and a high of 89.98 FPS. During the test, the Core Ultra 5 225F's performance cores averaged 4.47 GHz, the efficiency cores clocked in at 4.11 GHz, and the CPU package measured 71 degrees Celsius. The RTX 5060 averaged 2.45 GHz at an average temperature of 69 C.

Fan noise from the 120mm CPU cooler is loud, even at idle. Unlike the gentle hum that you'll get with AIO coolers, the Gamer Xtreme's air cooler can get a bit irritating if all you're trying to do is browse the internet or write a document. Once you start gaming and the fans on the RTX 5060 ramp, the noise becomes even more offensive. Not all air coolers are this loud, so CyberPower's fan choice here is a bit curious.

The Gamer Xtreme features a Core Ultra 5 225F processor (6 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores), 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. As you'll see in the benchmarks, the Core Ultra 5 225F's shortage of cores compared to the Ryzen systems in this test is readily apparent. However, there's a huge delta in price between the Gamer Xtreme and the other two systems, so always keep that in the back of your mind.

The Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark saw the Gamer Xtreme come to the table with 2,893 in the single-core test and 14,873 in the multi-core test. For comparison, the Gamer Xtreme with its raucous Ryzen 7 9800X3D hit 3,335 and 18,601, respectively.

What it lacked in CPU muscle, the Gamer Xtreme made up for it in storage performance. During our 25GB file transfer test, the MSI M470 Pro SSD sped past the radar gun at 1,964.94 Mbps, putting it well ahead of the more expensive systems in this test. The Gamer Supreme managed 1,664.11 Mbps, while the Y40 Pro was even further back at 1,501.55.

Finally, the Handbrake test really showed the real-world shortfall on multi-threaded performance. When we transcode our 4K video test file to 1080p, the Gamer Xtreme took four minutes and 27 seconds, compared to just two minutes and 58 seconds for the Gamer Supreme. The Y40 Pro was faster still, completing the task in two minutes and 29 seconds.

CyberPowerPC includes a basic keyboard and mouse in the box with the Gamer Xtreme. It's nothing that I would have purchased for my personal use, but as a pack-in with a gaming desktop, it's quite good.

 




The NOHI 2 keyboard has multi-colored RGB lighting effects and relatively good tactile typing. There are flip-out feet to adjust your typing angle and you can cycle through the different lighting modes using the FN key plus numbers 1 through 0. Using the keyhero.com typing test, I averaged 90 words per minute with 95.67 percent accuracy.

A CyberPowerPC Elite M2 RGB gaming mouse is included, but it's a little on the small side for my tastes and designed for right-handed folks. The mouse has six buttons (including two on the side and a top button that by default controls DPI). There's nothing particularly outstanding about the mouse and it works ‚Äújust fine.‚Äù

I can gladly say that CyberPowerPC doesn't include any extraneous software or utilities on the Gamer Xtreme. No system utilities, no warranty apps, no resource-robbing antivirus trials, and no trials for games or VPNs. Instead, you get a bone stock install of Windows 11 Home, which is great news for gamers who want zero bloat to contend with first booting up the system.

Systems purchased directly from CyberPowerPC.com come with a three-year labor and two-year parts warranty. Our particular system, which is available exclusively from Costco, comes with a two-year warranty.

Our Gamer Xtreme review unit (Model GXi2000CSTV3) is a Costco exclusive, and features an Intel Core Ultra 5 225F processor, MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Shadow 2X OC graphics card, 32GB of Team Group T-Force Vulcan DDR5-6400 (2x 16GB) RAM, a 2TB SSD, and Windows 11 Home. It's priced at a reasonable $1,099.99.

Best Buy also sells a higher-spec version (Model GXi3400BSTV17) with a Core Ultra 7 265F, GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD for $1,599.

You get quite a bit for your $1,099.99with the CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme. You get 32GB of RAM and a generous 2TB SSD for installing your favorite AAA games. Although the keyboard and mouse that are included in the box aren't the best, they're perfectly serviceable for gamers on a budget.

You also get niceties like a roomy case with plenty of cooling and RGB vividness, standard Wi-Fi (albeit the older Wi-Fi 6 standard), and a bloat-free install of Windows 11.

At this price point, it's hard to find fault with the Gamer Xtreme, other than the grating sound from its CPU cooler, which is loud even at idle, and only gets louder when you start gaming. If CyberPowerPC could swap out the air-cooled solution for one with a quieter fan or AIO unit and bump the price slightly, it'd have a real winner here.

The glymphatic system is a recently discovered waste clearance system, most active during sleep, that removes toxins and waste materials, including those associated with dementia, from the central nervous system. 

A new study has found that people with an impaired glymphatic system have a higher risk of developing dementia.

The study, published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, suggests that improving glymphatic function could be a powerful tool in reducing the risk of dementia.

‚ÄúThese findings are largely expected, building on a growing body of research that implicates impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, often referred to as the ‚Äòglymphatic system', in dementia. Animal studies have long shown that disrupted CSF flow hampers the clearance of toxic proteins such as amyloid beta and tau, which are central to Alzheimer's disease pathology. What makes this study significant is that it provides large-scale, human-based evidence from over 45,000 participants in the UK Biobank, confirming that MRI markers of CSF dysfunction [‚Ä¶] are associated with higher dementia risk.‚Äù

‚Äî Dr Steve Allder, consultant neurologist at Re:Cognition Health, who was not involved in the study.

In their study, researchers used machine-learning algorithms, developed by Yutong Chen, one of the paper's authors, while a medical student at the University of Cambridge. These algorithms can assess glymphatic functions from multiple MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans.

The researchers applied the algorithms to MRI scans from around 45,000 adults. They identified 3 biomarkers, linked to impaired glymphatic function, that predicted dementia risk over the following decade.

The three biomarkers, all of which provide insights into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, were:

‚ÄúThis newly published study uses brain imaging to look at different snapshots of the glymphatic system in about 45,000 people from the large UK Biobank. They found three biomarkers related to CSF movement that, in the study population, were predictive of new cases of dementia. These factors were also related to the ways in which heart health issues can contribute to dementia risk.‚Äù

‚Äî Ozama Ismail, Ph.D., Director of scientific programs at the Alzheimer's Association, which published the study in its journal

During a median of 5.3 years of follow-up, the researchers recorded 133 cases of incident dementia. 

They found that higher DTI-ALPS was associated with a lower dementia risk, whereas lower BOLD-CSF coupling and higher choroid plexus volume were associated with increased dementia risk.

Additionally, they found that several cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking and alcohol, all impaired glymphatic function and increased dementia risk.

Allder explained with these findings: 

‚ÄúCardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure reduce arterial pulsation and disrupt perivascular flow, as confirmed by this study's association between higher arterial stiffness and lower DTI-ALPS scores. Diabetes was also identified as a contributor to impaired CSF flow, possibly due to microvascular damage and inflammation.‚Äù

Allder told Medical News Today:

‚ÄúThe brain's waste clearance system, driven by CSF circulation through the perivascular and interstitial spaces, removes metabolic by-products and neurotoxic proteins such as amyloid beta and tau.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen this system becomes inefficient, due to reduced CSF flow, vascular stiffness, or choroid plexus dysfunction, waste products accumulate, promoting neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage. Over time, these processes accelerate cognitive decline and increase dementia risk,‚Äù he explained.

This study suggests that improving the flow of CSF may decrease the risk of dementia, so is it possible to enhance brain clearance?

Glymphatic activity is greatly increased during sleep, and suppressed during waking hours. While you are sleeping, the system clears waste products, including potentially neurotoxic products, such as Œ≤-amyloid which forms plaques that interfere with nerve transmission in Alzheimer's disease, from the brain.

‚ÄúThere are emerging strategies to support or improve glymphatic clearance. Good cardiovascular health is key ‚Äî maintaining optimal blood pressure, managing diabetes and exercising regularly all enhance vascular pulsatility and CSF flow. Quality sleep is also critical, as glymphatic clearance is most active during deep sleep. Avoiding excessive alcohol, staying hydrated and possibly using interventions that improve arterial elasticity (e.g., aerobic fitness, dietary omega-3s) may further help preserve waste clearance efficiency.‚Äù

‚Äî Steve Allder, MD

So getting a good night's sleep could be one way to help improve your brain clearance. Experts advise several ways to improve sleep, including exercising daily, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding large meals, beverages and alcohol near bedtime, and taking time to wind down before bed in the evening.

Allder said that with further validation, the findings could help lead to earlier diagnosis and preventive measures for dementia:

‚ÄúThese findings suggest that MRI-based markers of CSF dynamics ‚Äî particularly DTI-ALPS, BOLD-CSF coupling, and choroid plexus volume ‚Äî could become early, noninvasive indicators of dementia risk before cognitive symptoms appear. If validated across diverse populations, these measures could be integrated into routine brain imaging protocols for at-risk individuals, especially those with cardiovascular or metabolic conditions.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis would enable earlier identification of people with impaired brain clearance, and open opportunities for preventive interventions targeting vascular health, sleep quality and lifestyle modification. Additionally, these imaging markers could serve as biomarkers in clinical trials, helping to evaluate whether therapies aimed at improving glymphatic flow (such as sleep optimization or vascular therapies) reduce dementia risk or progression,‚Äù he told MNT.

‚ÄúThe study adds to our understanding of the complex relationships between vascular changes in the brain, removal of harmful waste, and incident dementia. In this way, it may help us identify future targets for treatment and risk reduction.‚Äù

Impaired glymphatic function ‚Äî the brain's waste clearance system ‚Äî could help explain how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors may drive dementia. 

In a large UK Biobank study, MRI markers of disrupted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and glymphatic flow predicted future dementia and were closely linked to vascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and arterial stiffness.

Discovered just over a decade ago, the glymphatic system depends on the efficient circulation and drainage of CSF. When this process is impaired, the brain's ability to clear amyloid, tau, and other toxins diminishes, potentially accelerating the development of dementia.

‚ÄúThe study shows, with very convincing data, that these markers predict dementia risk, and also that the markers relate to cardiovascular risk factors,‚Äù study author Hugh S. Markus, MD, professor of stroke medicine in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, UK, told Medscape Medical News.

‚ÄúThis offers a novel way in which one might be able to target or treat dementia. If one could improve glymphatic flow, one could then reduce the risk of dementia.‚Äù

The study results were published online on October 23 in Alzheimer's & Dementia and simultaneously presented at the 17th World Stroke Congress (WSC) 2025 in Barcelona, Spain. 

Over the years, studies in animal models of dementia and cerebral small-vessel disease have helped clarify how the glymphatic system functions. 

As the authors explain, CSF is continuously produced by the choroid plexus (CP), creating pressure that drives its flow from the brain's ventricles into the subarachnoid space. From there, CSF enters the brain tissue via perivascular spaces (PVS), where it exchanges with interstitial fluid. This exchange facilitates the clearance of metabolic waste from the brain through the PVS.

Until recently, glymphatic function could be studied only in mice. Advances in MRI now make it possible to assess this system indirectly in humans. Researchers are using machine learning-based methods to quantify imaging markers of glymphatic function across large populations.

‚ÄúWe applied these techniques to see whether glymphatic drainage in the brain was impaired in people who had cardiovascular risk factors or had small-vessel disease of the brain, and, particularly importantly, to see whether this predicted dementia,‚Äù said Markus.

The researchers examined several MRI-based biomarkers that serve as proxies for CSF and glymphatic dynamics. These included:

The study included 44,384 participants (median age, 65 years; 47.9% male) with available MRI data. Over a median follow-up of 5.3 years, 133 participants developed dementia. Higher baseline DTI-ALPS values were associated with a lower risk for dementia after adjustment for age, sex, and education (hazard ratio [HR], 0.866; 95% CI, 0.797-0.942; P = .001).

Higher CP volume predicted dementia conversion (corrected HR, 1.185; 95% CI, 1.088-1.291; P < .001), as did lower BOLD-CSF coupling (corrected HR, 0.875; 95% CI, 0.806-0.951; P = .001).

However, PVS volume did not predict dementia conversion (corrected HR 1.013; 95% CI 0.940-1.091; P = .730).

All major CVD risk factors were associated with signs of impaired glymphatic flow across multiple imaging markers. Higher systolic blood pressure, for instance, correlated with larger PVS volume, lower DTI-ALPS, higher CP volume, and weaker BOLD-CSF coupling (P <.001 for all). Diabetes showed a similar pattern, with lower DTI-ALPS, higher CP volume, and reduced BOLD-CSF coupling, although it was not associated with PVS volume.

When the researchers examined potential mediators of dementia risk, diabetes emerged as particularly important, said Markus. Both DTI-ALPS and CP volume partially mediated the associations between white-matter hyperintensities and dementia, as well as between diabetes duration and dementia. 

The imaging markers were also linked to measures of cardiac and arterial function ‚Äî including maximum carotid intima-media thickness, left ventricular ejection fraction, and arterial stiffness ‚Äî though the strength of these associations varied.

The findings shed light on how CVD risk factors could contribute to dementia. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes can damage the brain's small blood vessels, leading in turn to glymphatic dysfunction, Markus said.

In addition to the vascular risk factors examined in the study, impaired sleep can also disrupt the brain's waste-clearance system, Markus noted. It has been suggested that poor sleep is an important factor that interferes with glymphatic function and reduces the clearance of toxins from the brain, he said. 

With a clearer picture of the pathologic processes driving dementia, the next step is to identify ways to target the glymphatic system to reduce risk. Markus pointed to emerging research testing investigational agents designed to restore or enhance the brain's natural waste clearance function.

Aside from controlling blood pressure, there are at present few effective treatments for vascular dementia, which results from reduced blood flow to the brain, Markus said. The same is true for Alzheimer's disease, where antiamyloid therapies ‚Äúdon't help all that much,‚Äù he added. 

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Ozama Ismail, PhD, director of scientific programs at the Alzheimer's Association, said the study helps clarify the complex relationships among vascular changes in the brain, removal of harmful waste, and incident dementia.

‚ÄúIn this way, it may help us identify future targets for treatment and risk reduction,‚Äù he said.

Ismail added that research has consistently shown a close link between heart health and brain health and noted that the Alzheimer's Association's US POINTER study recently demonstrated that a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise can help delay cognitive decline in individuals at increased risk. 

Researchers plan to incorporate in-home sleep assessments into a US POINTER substudy to examine whether lifestyle changes can improve sleep. The glymphatic system appears to be most active during sleep, Ismail noted.

The study was supported by the British Heart Foundation, Cambridge British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, Cambridge University Hospitals National Institute for Health and Care Research Biomedical Research Centre. Markus reports no relevant conflicts of interest.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

My name is Husam Issa. I'm an infectious disease doctor at CLS Health. I think the type of pneumonias that stick out the most are Staph pneumonias. 

These tend to be very aggressive, sometimes cavitary, nodular, and with very rapid progression, especially if it's a type of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that produces PVL, or Panton-Valentine leukocidin. This tends to cause a large amount of disease that's very rapid and necrotizing. 

Usually, we need to treat that aggressively with antitoxin production, probably with linezolid over vancomycin because of the antitoxin production of linezolid, or maybe with vancomycin plus clindamycin, if there's a toxin effect, to counteract the toxin production. 

These are the most aggressive types of pneumonias, S aureus pneumonias. They are cavitary. They could be hospital-acquired or they could be community-acquired early, but most of the time they're hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonias.

According to the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA), biosimilars helped Italy save more than ‚Ç¨3.1 billion in pharmaceutical spending by public health facilities between 2013 and 2022, with 8 of every 10 biologic drug prescriptions in the country being biosimilars.

An analysis published in Value in Health Regional Issues found that biosimilars reduced drug spending by approximately 5% for the Italian National Health System, driven by rising use and lower prices of both originator biologics and their biosimilar equivalents.

The researchers identified all the biologics (reference products) and related biosimilars approved in Europe and marketed in Italy until December 2022. Savings were estimated by multiplying the biosimilar sales volume by the annual cost difference between the reference products and the biosimilars.

Expenditure and prescription volumes were extracted from the Medicines Utilization Monitoring Centre (Osservatorio Nazionale sull'impiego dei Medicinali, OsMed) administrative database.

Twelve off-patent biologic medicines were included: adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, bevacizumab, epoetin, filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, follitropin, insulin glargine, rituximab, somatropin, and trastuzumab.

Patent protection for epoetin and filgrastim expired before 2013, and the biosimilars for the remaining products entered the market later.

Three active ingredients, ie, low-molecular-weight heparin, fast-acting insulin, and teriparatide, were excluded because public health facility spending accounted for less than 60%, and public tenders were not applied.

By 2022, the mean biosimilar uptake of all active ingredients reached 80%. Uptake exceeded 95% for bevacizumab, infliximab, rituximab, trastuzumab, and filgrastim. The uptake was 80%-90% for etanercept (80%), adalimumab (85%), pegfilgrastim (86%), and epoetin (90%).

Biosimilar and reference product use was lower for somatropin (58%) and follitropin (42%) and under 40% for insulin glargine.

For nine of the 12 active ingredients, the mean price difference between the reference products and biosimilars exceeded 100%, ranging from 13% to 359%.

‚ÄúThis study confirmed a high biosimilar uptake in Italy and a decreasing trend in the mean cost per cost per defined daily dose in the 2013 to 2022 period, both for biosimilars and reference products. However, the difference between the biosimilar and reference product cost was maintained high,‚Äù the authors wrote.

Over the study period, the Italian National Health Service saved a total of ‚Ç¨3.09 billion, rising from ‚Ç¨37.7 million in 2013 to ‚Ç¨762.6 million in 2022, representing 5% of overall pharmaceutical spending by public health facilities in 2022.

Another study in France found that biosimilars generated ‚Ç¨2.4 billion savings between 2012 and 2022.

AIFA experts noted that in the market for small-molecule generics, originator brands often retain a large market share after patent expiry, and prices tend to stabilise after an initial drop. Instead, in the biologicals market in Italy, ‚Äúit seems that the effects of competition are disclosed in the subsequent years as well, leading to a descending trend in costs of both biosimilars and reference products.‚Äù

The authors anticipate further savings as new biosimilars enter the market, stating that ‚Äúbiosimilars also allow freeing up economic resources that can be used to treat a wider range of patients and addressing other aspects of patients care.‚Äù

Computerised chest radiograph analysis revealed that the surfactant treatment led to better aeration in the right lung than in the left lung among infants born extremely preterm with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Basal regions showed improved aeration compared to apical regions regardless of surfactant treatment, suggesting anatomical influences on distribution patterns.

""We hypothesize that surfactant probably reaches the right side more easily and the basal regions of the lung to a greater extent than the apical ones, leading to focal heterogeneous air distribution that might reflect a combination of both over-expanded and collapsed alveoli, observations that warrant continued future studies,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Julia Fall, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. It was published online on October 14, 2025, in the European Journal of Pediatrics.

The initial selection of infants on the basis of surfactant treatment status and the timing of chest radiographs within 6 hours of administration might have introduced selection bias. The pre-surfactant group likely included infants with less severe initial RDS who did not meet the criteria for early surfactant replacement therapy. Additionally, the small sample size may have limited the ability to establish correlations between imaging findings and long-term outcomes.

This study was funded by Gillbergska Stiftelsen, Uppsala, Sweden. Open access funding was provided by Uppsala University. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Sirona, an oral gastro-retentive hydrogel, is well tolerated, leading only to mild gastrointestinal side effects, and produces sustained reductions in body weight and dietary intake.

‚ÄúSirona has potential as a nonpharmacological treatment for weight management, encompassing initial weight loss and weight-loss maintenance through long-term use, to be tested in larger trials,‚Äù the authors wrote.

This study was led by James P. Byrne of the University Hospital Southampton in Southampton, England. It was published online in Obesity.

The small pilot sample limited generalizability. The 3:1 randomization resulted in only eight individuals completing the placebo regimen. The 12-week randomized phase may have been inadequate to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.

Sirona was developed by Oxford Medical Products Ltd., which supported the study alongside an Innovate UK Biomedical Catalyst grant.

A novel study on the natural coordination of tooth development in time and space, led by Dr. Han-Sung Jung at the Yonsei University College of Dentistry, Korea, has discovered that ""lingual"" cells on the side of the tongue form the tooth, whereas those toward the cheek, called ""buccal cells,"" form the bones and gums, guided by signaling molecules like WNT and BMP. These insights could shape future modalities for tooth regeneration, replacement, and repair.

Tooth development is a dynamic process that involves the stages of the bud, the cap, and the bell, followed by root development and subsequent tooth formation. Processes such as the bud-to-cap transition are mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. In addition, the position of a cell in a developing embryo determines its fate due to the relative differences in concentration of signaling molecules and growth factors.

Scientists have long known that a single tooth develops as a small bud of outer ""epithelial"" cells into the deeper ""mesenchymal"" cells. It then curves to form a cap shape and then folds in further to form the bell shape of a mature tooth, with surrounding bone and gums. Dr. Han-Sung Jung and his team at the Yonsei University College of Dentistry, Korea, extended these findings by examining how the position of young epithelial and mesenchymal dental cells would influence what they grow into and have published their findings in International Journal of Oral Science.Lead author Dr. Jung said that his team ""performed this study to identify how positional identity along the lingual-buccal axis determines distinct developmental fates of dental mesenchyme. This research has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of tooth development,"" he says.The investigators separated the mesenchymal cells on the lingual and buccal sides at both cap and bell stages of a developing mouse embryo and -compared their gene expression profiles through RNA-seq followed by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to understand the differences with position and time. They then transplanted the cap-stage lingual and buccal cells separately under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice to see what each grew into. Analysis showed that cells on the lingual side were mainly geared toward making the tooth itself and shaping its structure, while cells on the buccal side were more focused on stem cell activity, forming surrounding tissues, and supporting tooth growth and repair. Not surprisingly, only the lingual cells in the mouse kidney grew into tooth enamel.The researchers also reported haphazardly mixing up cap-stage, tagged buccal and lingual cells of genetically engineered mice. ""We were curious to know if they could find their original place and reorganize when the fluorescently labled lingual and buccal mesenchymal cells were mixed randomly, which they not only did, but the lingual cells grew into dentin to form the tooth as before. This phenomenon is called cellular self-organization,"" says first author Eun-Jung Kim.Furthermore, they have extensively studied the signalling molecules in each group and found that WNT signalling and R-spondins (Rspo1/2/4) are enriched in lingual cells, along with high proliferation, low cell death, and higher migration rate, aiding tooth formation. On the other hand, buccal cells show increased expression of BMP inhibitors, lower proliferation, higher apoptosis, and slower migration, favoring bone and surrounding tissue formation.In conclusion, the authors proposed a model of dental cell positioning based on the lingual-buccal axis for tooth and surrounding tissue formation. The characteristics of dental mesenchymal cells were found to vary along this axis, and the fate of the tooth and surrounding tissue formation is determined by mesenchymal cells via WNT/BMP signaling. Deeper knowledge of the molecular nuances of tooth development will inspire further research in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, which may ultimately lead to advancements in stem cell-based tooth regeneration and more effective therapeutic applications for dental restoration and repair.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Researchers map the complex sugar chains attached to rat serum proteins","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251024/Researchers-map-the-complex-sugar-chains-attached-to-rat-serum-proteins.aspx","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:54:00 GMT","

A comprehensive study mapped the dynamic glycosylation landscape of rat serum proteins, uncovering sex- and time-dependent variations with clear cell-type specificity. Researchers found distinct cell-type-specific glycosylation patterns: liver-derived proteins carried O-acetylated Neu5Ac, while B cell-derived antibodies (IgG) exclusively utilized Neu5Gc. Female rats exhibited pronounced daily fluctuations in these sugar structures, unlike the stable profiles in males, suggesting regulation by hormonal and circadian cycles. This work provides the first integrated map of glycosylation dynamics in rat serum, establishing a foundation for future studies in comparative glycobiology and biomarker research.

In this study, researchers systematically mapped the complex sugar chains (N-glycans) attached to rat serum proteins, revealing dynamic differences based on sex and time. Researchers identified distinct sialylation signatures that define liver- and immune-derived proteins: liver proteins featured the unique rat-specific modification O-acetylated Neu5Ac, while B cell-derived immune proteins (IgG) exclusively carried N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Notably, female rats exhibited pronounced daily fluctuations in these sugar patterns, unlike the stable profiles in males, suggesting strong hormonal regulation.

Glycosylation--the attachment of complex sugar chains (glycans) to proteins--is a fundamental modification crucial for biological processes, and changes in these structures are often associated with development, disease, or aging. Rats serve as essential model organisms, often preferred over mice due to their greater physiological homology to humans and suitability for functional assessments. Previous research highlighted a distinctive feature of rat serum glycans: the unusually high abundance of O-acetylated N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a modification that is virtually absent in humans. Understanding how physiological factors like sex and daily cycles affect this unique glycosylation pattern is essential for validating rats in studies modeling human pathophysiology.

Researchers employed systematic glycomic (MALDI-TOF-MS) and glycoproteomic (LC-MS/MS) profiling on rat serum collected daily over five consecutive days from male and female rats. To focus on non-IgG proteins, serum albumin and IgG were first depleted from the general serum fraction. A distinguishing feature of the approach was the separate purification and analysis of IgG, which was enzymatically cleaved into its Fab and Fc fragments to obtain cell-type-resolved insights into immune system glycosylation.

The analysis confirmed that the predominant N-glycans are disialo-biantennary complex-type structures, and identified 87 glycoproteins, including protease inhibitors and immune-related proteins like complement C3. A striking finding was the cell-type-specific sialylation profile: liver-derived glycoproteins carried N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), with over half being uniquely O-acetylated (Neu5,9Ac2). In contrast, B cell-derived IgG exclusively carried Neu5Gc and entirely lacked O-acetylation. Crucially, temporal analysis showed that while male rats maintained stable sialylation levels, female rats exhibited significant day-to-day fluctuations, indicating a link to hormonal and circadian rhythms. Furthermore, IgG Fab fragments were approximately three times more sialylated (44% of glycans) than their Fc counterparts (15%).

This comprehensive mapping provides a quantitative framework for future studies using rat models in glycobiology and disease research. The dataset serves as a reference for understanding how hormonal and circadian cycles shape the glycosylation landscape of serum proteins. The observed sex-dependent daily fluctuations in glycosylation patterns highlight a dynamic regulatory link between N-glycosylation and hormonal cycles, which is important for understanding protein stability and function under different physiological states. Elucidating the unique segregation of sialic acid types (Neu5Ac vs. Neu5Gc) between liver and immune tissues underscores the necessity of considering cell-type specificity, informing biomarker discovery and comparative glycoengineering.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Football: From first goal to final goodbye: Alex Morgan's farewell to U.S. Women's National Team","https://www.olympics.com/en/news/alex-morgan-honoured-uswnt-football","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 15:28:00 GMT","

In the same place she scored her first senior international goal, Alex Morgan bids a final farewell to the USWNT having left the sport in a better place than she found it.

Fifteen years ago, Alex Morgan introduced herself to U.S. football fans with her first goal in Chester, Pennsylvania.

On Thursday (23 October), the recently retired forward waved goodbye from the same place. The arc of her phenomenal career, in which she bloomed into a global icon, had come full circle‚Äîending where it began.

‚ÄúIt was one of the best moments that I can remember with the team because it was really the start of something great for me,‚Äù she told U.S. Soccer.

‚ÄúIt was a great first goal and I'm excited to be back at the stadium to be honoured this way so many years later.‚Äù

Few could have predicted just how much of a global powerhouse the then 21-year-old would go on to become.

Achievements on the pitch speak volumes ‚Äì multiple World Cup titles, Olympic medals, and 123 goals in 224 appearances.

Yet it was what she did off the pitch that really kick-started a legacy which would send the women's game soaring worldwide.

Morgan's activism is another aspect that sets her apart.

Her fight for better conditions domestically and on the national team has ensured that the California native retires from a sport in much better condition than when she came into it.

Alex Morgan scores her first USWNT goal in Chester, Pennsylvania in 2010

In the run-up to honouring Morgan, the current head coach of the USWNT‚ÄîEmma Hayes‚Äîhad plenty to say about the player who defined a period of this team's success.

The English coach called for recognition of a career that transcended all expectations, winning it all on home soil and in Europe.

‚ÄúThere was nothing she didn't achieve; she was a player that epitomised everything this program is about,‚Äù Hayes said of the iconic no.13.

‚ÄúShe is an unbelievable credit to her family because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none.

‚ÄúYou can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan, and I think the sport should show a lot of gratitude to that. She is, without question, one of the most recognisable faces in our sport.‚Äù

For Morgan, however, nothing matters more than people recognising her as someone who fought on and off the pitch ‚Äì for herself and for her teammates.

‚ÄúI would love for people to know that I was as dedicated on the field as I was off the field,‚Äù she expressed to TNT Sports.

‚ÄúOff the field, that was fighting for women's sports, fighting for girls to have equal opportunity, fighting for and prioritising my family.

‚ÄúJust know that I fought for my team on the pitch and I fought for myself and my team off it.‚Äù

Alex Morgan wins the World Cup with the USWNT in 2015

Morgan bows out of the playing side with so much pride for everything she has achieved over the last 15 years.

Given her mainstay status, fans can expect to still see her in and around anything involving women's sports as she aims to continue driving them to the very top.

That includes her work with the San Diego Wave in the NWSL, where the striker spent the last few years of her playing career.

‚ÄúI am part of the ownership group and intend to have an active role,‚Äù she told FIFA.

‚ÄúI am continuing to stay active in other ways like with my media company, which focuses on women's sports and highlights female athletes in general.

‚ÄúThere are always threads that keep me busy and connected to the sport‚ÄîI also have a foundation which is a vehicle for girls to gain self-esteem and confidence, with girls' empowerment camps.‚Äù

Morgan helped redefine the sport, leaving a legacy that lives on in others who dare to dream because she showed them what was possible.

It may be the end of an era and the changing of the guard, but the passion remains.","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics.com'}","soccer"

Emma Hayes was far from happy with how her team played. Brad Smith / Getty Images

Standing on the sideline of a mostly silent Subaru Park as her U.S. women's national team lost to Portugal on Thursday, Emma Hayes felt stuck in ‚Äúa game of Whac-A-Mole.‚Äù

For the first time in her 17 months in charge, she watched her players try to solve problems as individuals rather than as the collective that rolled through her first 17 games unbeaten, including a gold medal run at the 2024 Olympics.

Advertisement

As one problem after another arose, she felt ‚Äúfrustrated.‚Äù Not with the result, a 2-1 loss, but with the performance.

‚ÄúI don't think anybody came out with flying colors,‚Äù Hayes said when asked about a few specific players. ‚ÄúI think as a team, we were poor, to be honest with you.‚Äù

She told the players exactly that and more in an animated, minutes-long speech on the field after the game, with starters, substitutes and staff all huddled in a circle around her. She jabbed her right pointer finger and patted her chest.

‚ÄúI think everyone was trying to maybe fix it on their own,‚Äù said midfielder Rose Lavelle, who scored the USWNT's only goal 33 seconds into the game.

‚ÄúDefensively,‚Äù Hayes said, ‚Äúfrom front to back, we just mistimed everything.‚Äù

Though full of experience and talent, the midfield three of Lavelle, Sam Coffey and Lindsey Heaps got outnumbered and overwhelmed by Portugal's midfield diamond. The Americans were slow to adjust. ‚ÄúWe could have solved things a bit earlier on,‚Äù Heaps said.

But their shortcomings were not tactical. They were not confined to any one area of the field or any one line. They were everywhere because everyone felt disconnected.

‚ÄúA lot of things did not go our way, in terms of playing together, playing as a team, doing things together,‚Äù Heaps said. ‚ÄúSometimes it felt a little bit like we were on islands.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn attack, it felt like we just hadn't played together in a long time,‚Äù Hayes added. ‚ÄúI didn't recognize us. I felt we just rushed everything. We went direct. We didn't look like the team that we've been working on.‚Äù

They did not look like the team they had been over the past 25 games under Hayes. Not the team that grinded to Olympic gold; nor the one that won five straight matches, by an aggregate score of 18-0, this summer; not even the team that lost to Japan or split a back-to-back with Brazil earlier this year.

Those losses, to international powers, were understandable; the performances were creditable and the team, as Hayes said, was ‚Äústill working on our principles.‚Äù

Thursday was something else.

The opponent, although praised by Hayes and U.S. players, had never reached the knockout rounds of a major tournament. They were outscored 8-2 at the 2025 Women's European Championship, with five of those goals coming from Spain, failing to make it out of the group stage. The win on Thursday was not only Portugal's first in 12 meetings since 1994, but the first time the team had scored against the U.S., who has 40 goals against them. Nonetheless, Portugal kept the ball while the U.S. looked disjointed.

Hayes added: ‚ÄúSometimes, when the panic gets in the head, or you try to do something, instead of starting to do the things we want you to do, it just felt like we didn't get a rhythm the whole night.‚Äù

Their lack of rhythm, which Hayes referenced in yells from the touchline mid-game, seemed to spiral. Problems multiplied.

‚ÄúWhen certain things go wrong, or we're not patient, or in one mind we're transitioning and in the other mind we want to retain the ball‚Ä¶ It's hard,‚Äù Heaps explained.

She later continued: ‚ÄúI wanted to calm the game down. When it gets a very chaotic game like that, or you feel like you're not controlling the game, it's like, ‚ÄòHow can we get that control back? How can we complete the next pass, and the next pass, and the next pass?' But once we miss that next pass, it's like, ‚ÄòS***. We gotta get back in. We gotta solve what they're implementing.'

‚ÄúThat was hard, too. We were running a lot, we were trying to figure out defensively what we needed to be in, the shape that we needed to be in, the press.‚Äù

At times, it felt a lot like the 2023 World Cup game between the same two teams, albeit in a different setting and with a lot of different players. That time, under the leadership of former head coach Vlatko Andonovski, the U.S. settled for its first draw against Portugal, a scoreless affair capping a poor group stage performance. The U.S. lost the following knockout round game to Sweden in penalty kicks, making its earliest World Cup exit in program history. When asked about that comparison, Heaps, who co-captained that team, responded with a chuckle: ‚ÄúOh, don't bring me back to that game.‚Äù

In the more recent matchup, the U.S. ultimately conceded twice from corners, and Hayes, as she descended from the podium after her post-match news conference, assured everyone in the room: ‚ÄúNo coach likes giving up f***ing set pieces. And neither do the players.‚Äù

But it was the entire 90 minutes that frustrated her. On multiple occasions, she, her staff and the players tried to tweak their tactical approach, but ‚ÄúI still don't think we got a grip of the game,‚Äù she said.

Her attitude afterwards, however, was not so gloomy.

‚ÄúSometimes you need a kick up the backside like that,‚Äù Hayes said.

And this, of course, was a kick up the backside in an October 2025 friendly, not a June 2027 World Cup game in Brazil. Players arrived Monday, some after Sunday games; they trained Tuesday and Wednesday, and even then, ‚ÄúI actually felt it,‚Äù Hayes said. ‚ÄúThere were so many misconnections. Just taking a bit of time for us to get on the same page.‚Äù

Then, on Thursday, they played together for the first time in more than 100 days.

‚ÄúWe haven't been together in four months; we gotta remember that,‚Äù Heaps said. ‚ÄúWe've had two days of training; you gotta remember that. You don't want to be super negative right now, because you'll just beat your head in.‚Äù

Neither players nor Hayes were interested in making excuses, but they were realistic. They were, after all, without center back Naomi Girma and forward Trinity Rodman, due to injury, as well as several other key players. The back four ‚Äî Avery Patterson, Tara McKeown, Emily Sonnett and Emily Fox ‚Äî were starting together for the first time.

And more importantly, all of them, players and coaches, are still at an experimental phase of their build toward 2027.

When asked how she would assess Thursday's game in that context, Hayes began: ‚ÄúAs Ben Northey, the Sydney Philharmonic conductor, would say, ‚Äòlet it go.'‚Äù

They will travel to Connecticut on Friday to play Portugal again on Sunday, this time at Rentschler Field in East Hartford.

‚ÄúWe have to get better,‚Äù Hayes said. ‚ÄúAnd I promise you, we will be better. We better be.‚Äù

Alex Morgan scored the first of her incredible 123 goals with the U.S. Women's National Team almost exactly 15 years ago, on Oct. 6, 2010.

China was leading the U.S. Women's National Team late into the match. Following a China goal kick, the U.S. won the 50-50 ball around midfield. Defender Heather Mitts played the ball forward from her position at right back. While forward Abby Wambach chased the ball down, Morgan anticipated how the play was unfolding, as a proficient forward often does. She made an overlapping run toward goal so when Wambach flicked a header into Morgan's path, the budding star stayed composed to give herself the opportunity to score. She smashed the ball into the net.

The rest was history.

‚ÄúIt was one of the best moments that I can remember with the team because it was really the start of something great for me,‚Äù Morgan said. ‚ÄúIt was a great first goal, and I'm excited to be back at that stadium and be honored in this way so many years later.‚Äù

Two Women's World Cups and an Olympic gold medal later, Morgan will have the chance to revisit that epic beginning when the U.S. Women's National Team returns to Pennsylvania for a friendly on Oct. 23. Prior to kickoff against Portugal at Subaru Park, Morgan will be honored for her illustrious career, and the first 2,000 fans through the gate will receive a limited-edition bobblehead.

Morgan and Wambach, the two players who combined for the iconic equalizer, would become two of the most prolific goal scorers in Women's National Team history. Wambach will be there at the stadium on Thursday to help celebrate her former forward line running mate. 

‚ÄúTo have the first assist ever be from Abby was very fitting because I had so many great years up top with her,‚Äù Morgan said. ‚ÄúShe's one of my favorite people ever and one of the best players ever in the history of soccer.‚Äù

The goal was symbolic of the type of high-octane scoring prowess the two brought to the U.S. After Wambach retired in 2015 as the No. 1 goal scorer in Women's National Team history, Morgan elevated to become the team's primary target up top for the next several years. The pair scored a total of 307 goals combined during their international careers and individually finished top-5 in program history in scoring.

Last fall, Morgan announced her retirement from club and country, finishing her international career with 176 combined goals and assists, the fifth most all-time. The 36-year-old is one of several notable names from a star-studded class of U.S. Women's National Team icons who have retired in the last few years including Megan Rapinoe, Julie Ertz, Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Tobin Heath and most recently Christen Press.

‚ÄúTo retire around the same time and really have this be the end of an era for myself and these players that played all through the 2010s and some of the 2020s, we had a really great run,‚Äù Morgan said.

That run includes titles at the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, where Morgan recorded a total of seven goals across those two tournaments. Among her nine World Cup goals is the epic ‚Äútea sipping‚Äù game-winner against England on her birthday that led to her taking home the Silver Boot in 2019. 

‚ÄúIt's the end of an era that I'm really proud of,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think we carried the team to where we needed to get it to, and now we feel really confident in where we've left it and with who we've left it with, and that's this next team that has already done incredibly great.‚Äù

For Morgan, retirement means a plethora of new opportunities that she's primed to tackle with the same fearless tenacity she displayed on the pitch. As one of the most iconic female athletes in the world, Morgan takes pride in using her position to raise awareness for female athletes and champion women's causes.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of things that I'm doing now on the business side that I'm really proud of,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHaving the background in sports has given me so much to be able to feel like I can accomplish a lot now in the business world.‚Äù





Her venture fund, Trybe Ventures, which she runs with her husband Servando Carrasco, invests in early-stage companies focused on sports and health technology. She is also a co-founder of Togethxr, a media company that focuses on female athletes, highlighting women's sports and creating a community for fans of women's games. 

‚ÄúIt's not a rinse and repeat situation,‚Äù Morgan explained when talking about looking at sports through a female lens. ‚ÄúYou look at the demographic of the fans, you look at the companies and brands that can resonate with female athletes and the fans of female athletes are much different than the men's side. Women's sports versus men's sports are inherently different. And that goes for every sport. It doesn't matter if it's soccer, basketball, golf, lacrosse, whatever it may be.‚Äù

Morgan's advocacy for highlighting the women's game reflects the narrative driven by fellow industry leaders such as U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes and Washington Spirit majority owner Michele Kang. These thought leaders in the sport support viewing soccer through a female lens. Women's bodies are not the same as men's bodies; they should be studied differently and not lumped together. 

‚ÄúThe biggest thing is conversations about it,‚Äù Morgan said. ‚ÄúBrands having the awareness to do that and in the studies that are being looked at, in regard to them being female-specific, it is incredibly important.‚Äù

With two children of her own, Morgan is also a fierce, vocal advocate for working mothers. 

‚ÄúParental leave is a huge thing, and as we look at support for parents in the game, the things that mothers have to go through when growing a baby is different than men,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of things that can be looked at differently, but we're in a really good place where people now acknowledge that. We're evolving when it comes to women's sports and looking at that from a different lens.‚Äù

While Morgan may be hanging up her boots, her business endeavors will now expand her reach into new areas of the sport. Accessibility is one opportunity for improvement, she noted. She also wants to see European-style academies develop at women's clubs in the United States so kids have a better steppingstone to enter the game.

With everything that she's already accomplished, the sky is the limit for Morgan, and the World Cup winner is set on accomplishing so much more. But after more than 15 years of rigorous training and constant competition, both internationally and on the club level, Morgan is also allowing herself to take a well-earned breath.

‚ÄúBefore retiring, I never had a weekend free ‚Äì it just didn't exist as an athlete,‚Äù Morgan explained. ‚ÄúNow, I get to really take it slow and enjoy it. Go to my daughter's soccer game, go to the beach. Not plan anything, which is really different. Getting used to that is really nice.‚Äù

CHESTER, Pa. ‚Äì In the words of U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes, there's nothing that Alex Morgan didn't achieve.

Two FIFA Women's World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal, fifth all-time in USWNT scoring, a distinguished legacy to her name, Morgan will go down in history as one of the all-time greats for the U.S. Women's National Team.

Morgan, who retired from soccer last fall, will be celebrated for her remarkable accomplishments and illustrious career prior to the upcoming U.S. Women's National Team match against Portugal on Thursday, Oct. 23. The pre-match celebration has garnered excitement from U.S. players present and past, including Abby Wambach. The program's all-time leading scorer assisted Morgan's first-ever USWNT goal, which also came in Chester, Pennsylvania, and will be in attendance Thursday to show her support.

Like Wambach, the current roster for the U.S. Women's National Team is ready to give Morgan her flowers. The 14-year international, who finished with 224 caps for the U.S., has left an indelible legacy on soccer fans everywhere, which includes some of her former teammates:

As the captain and most capped player on the camp roster, Lindsey Heaps spent the most time with Morgan on the pitch. The two appeared in 117 matches together for the U.S. Women's National Team and combined to contribute six goals, including Morgan's ‚Äútea-sipping‚Äù goal in the semifinal against England in the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Heaps was the player who sent a beautiful cross into the box to set up Morgan's flying, graceful header ‚Äì and iconic celebration. 

‚ÄúStepping into this National Team and seeing what she's done prior on the field and off the field, and the role model that she's become and what she stands for with U.S. Soccer, she's taken on the job of being the face of our National Team for so long but fought for so many things for us and made our lives easier growing up on this team. She's been such a crucial person in the team itself.

‚ÄúIndividually, I had the pleasure of being co-captains with her in the 2023 World Cup, and I think I got to see more ins and outs of what it takes to be that kind of player for this team. I'm very grateful for her and everything she's done for this team. It's very cool we get to celebrate her.‚Äù





She's earned 38 caps with the U.S. Women's National Team entering October, though sometimes it feels like Sam Coffey has been around for much longer. For a while, Coffey was simply an admirer of Morgan and had a poster of the USWNT legend hanging up inside her childhood bedroom.

‚ÄúI grew up watching her. Every young girl growing up and playing is like, ‚ÄòI love Alex Morgan.' I had a poster of her on my wall. I had to take it down too recently...but she's an incredible player and an incredible person. She's done so much for the women's game. She deserves all the flowers in the world, and it's really exciting to be a part of the game that we get to honor her at. I feel really grateful that I've been able to be her teammate, too. I've learned so much from her, both on and off the field.‚Äù

The Portland Thorns FC midfielder faced Morgan in the NWSL, and the two appeared in 12 international matches together as U.S. teammates.

‚ÄúShe's like a hero for all of us and is someone that epitomizes what it means to leave something better than you found it.‚Äù





Like Heaps, Rose Lavelle was part of a championship roster with Morgan in 2019. Back then, Lavelle was a Washington Spirit midfielder and a rising star in the National Team program. Meanwhile, Morgan was a holdover from the squad looking to defend the United States' trophy from the 2015 FIFA World Cup. 

‚ÄúAlex has influenced my career so much, on and off the field. What she's done and continues to do for women's sports in general has been huge. We have all benefited greatly from that, and hopefully we can continue to pass on that legacy in the same way. Huge shoes to fill.‚Äù

The pair have linked up a total of four times, two goals for Lavelle and two goals for Morgan, including a World Cup goal for Lavelle in the group stage en route to the U.S. winning the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.

‚ÄúOn the field, she and all of these players that have been retiring recently, that's who taught us how to be excellent in this environment, and that's what we consistently try to match and uphold. It's the reason that this program has been in such a good spot is because of that legacy on the field that they have all left. She's taught me so much, and now being in a position where I'm now a veteran leader, having her to look up to and learn from leading up to this moment has really been huge and has put all of us in a better position to be the best versions of ourselves.‚Äù





Although their time together was brief ‚Äì Morgan played just once under Hayes, a match against Korea Republic on June 4, 2024, in Hayes' second official match in charge ‚Äì Hayes has been entrenched in the sport for decades. The London native has a strong understanding of the impact Morgan has had beyond the United States and across the globe.

‚ÄúThere was nothing she didn't achieve. She was a player that epitomized everything this program is about. She's an unbelievable credit to her family because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none. You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan, and I think the sport should show a lot of gratitude to that because it's important for our players to be recognizable and she is, without question in recent times, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport. 

‚ÄúI love this tradition when we honor our players in retirement. I know the fans will be coming out, not just to support us, but absolutely to acknowledge what a wonderful career she had. She had so many telling moments that were difference-making moments in her career and the impact she's had on this team is immeasurable.‚Äù

GOAL US writers discuss the biggest USMNT developments as Mauricio Pochettino continues the build up to 2026 World Cup

It's time for a U.S. soccer check in. With the World Cup now less than eight months away, the national team is always simmering. There are stars playing for big sides in Europe, and plenty of action in domestic soccer, too.

Tim Weah has enjoyed a solid start to life at Marseille. Tanner Tessmann has gone from hipster pick to irrelevant to suddenly a key figure for Mauricio Pochettino's side. For those USMNT players in MLS, a few names that didn't figure to have a shot a few months ago might yet be in the national team picture next summer

A pair of October friendlies showed that Pochettino's side have a reliable system - and World Cup success could follow

Perhaps the most encouraging part is what happened after Christian Pulisic limped off the Dick's Sporting Goods Park field with a hamstring injury. That really should have been game over. The U.S. men's national team is supposed to lean on its star man, improve every time he touches the ball, and see their chances of winning improve exponentially when he makes things happen.

In short, they can't win without him. 

So much for that narrative. Pulisic was removed from last Tuesday's match against Australia in the 31st minute. The U.S. scored in the 33rd. They did so again in the 52nd. Without their main man, Mauricio Pochettino's side quite comfortably saw off an opponent set up to make their life a nightmare.

It is such a soccer cliche to suggest that ""these are the kinds of games that they used to lose."" But there is a thin veil of truth to that. The U.S. were supposed to lose in that scenario. But they didn't.

Of course, the USMNT are always better with Pulisic. But without him, they turned in the kind of performance that offered that most valuable of commodities in soccer: hope. Part of this is down to the intangibles - vibes, motivation, the apparently crucial ""fighting spirit.""

But it's also tactical, a change in formation and crucial flexibility around it that might just turn that hope into something even more tangible: winning.  ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

It was a mild September day in Lima, and south of the city centre, Peru's Davis Cup team faced underdog status against Portugal. In front of a vocal home crowd, Ignacio Buse delivered the clinching blow, defeating Nuno Borges to close the tie in the stadium that carries his family name ‚Äî Estadio Hermanos Buse (Buse Brothers Stadium), honouring his grandfather Eduardo and twin brother Enrique, who both were tennis players.


Eduardo competed at the majors as early as 1942, when he played on the grass courts of West Side Tennis Club in New York for the US National Championships. Ignacio never met his grandfather, but his legacy shaped a tennis tradition in the Buse family.


Although the stadium court at Club Lawn Tennis de la Exposici√≥n bears the family name, Buse began his journey across town at Country Club de Villa. He started alongside his father, Hans, a tennis coach who moved to Miami in 2019 and has since worked at Royal Palm Tennis Club.


‚ÄúI always remember the best moments with my dad,‚Äù Buse told ATPTour.com. ‚ÄúBefore we started practice, we played mini tennis and that was such a battle for me. Sometimes I was confused with the situation, sometimes getting pissed. My dad just wanted to practice and I was so happy playing mini tennis against him.‚Äù


Buse, World No. 111, is Peru's top-ranked player in the PIF ATP Rankings. He competes mostly on the ATP Challenger Tour, the level at which he has captured two titles this year. His goal for 2025 was to finish inside the Top 150 ‚Äî a quest he is on pace to achieve with flying colours.


As a teen, Buse climbed inside the junior Top 10 before facing a pivotal decision in 2022 of playing college tennis or turning pro. After struggling to secure a visa to attend school in the United States, Buse decided to chase pro tennis, a difficult challenge coming from a country that has had five players crack the Top 100 in PIF ATP Rankings history (since 1973).


‚ÄúIt was like a dream, but it never seemed realistic. I always saw it really far,‚Äù Buse said of playing pro tennis. ‚ÄúThen I wanted to go to college and when I couldn't go to college ‚Äî basically there was a problem with the residence ‚Äî there I said, ‚ÄòOkay, I will go professional', when I was 18.‚Äù


Buse made his Challenger debut in 2022 as a teenager ranked outside the Top 1,400. In his second appearance ‚Äî a home outing in Lima ‚Äî then-No. 886 Buse met top seed Federico Coria, a former Top 50 player. Buse pushed the match to a decider and ended the night with newfound confidence despite the loss.


‚ÄúI was starting to believe in myself that I could do it,‚Äù he reflected.


Now based in Barcelona, Spain, Buse considers his father his greatest mentor. Having made his maiden Grand Slam appearance at this year's US Open, where he fell to sixth seed Ben Shelton, Buse has come a long way. He is doing it all while holding true to the biggest lesson his parents taught him.

Ignacio Buse has left his mark in Seville ‚úçÔ∏è#ATPChallenger | @CopaSevillaCh pic.twitter.com/WIwdw9HkV5


‚ÄúFirst of all, always be humble,‚Äù Buse said. ‚ÄúI learned it from my dad and mom also. I don't think saying you're humble means you are humble. You have to demonstrate with facts. It has to be natural.


‚ÄúIf you are known more in the world, that doesn't mean you are above the others. That's the most important thing. That's why sometimes society is confused in those terms. I feel that we all have the same importance.‚Äù


Buse's family extends this philosophy beyond tennis. His uncle, Gaston Acurio, is a world-renowned chef with restaurants worldwide and over one-million Instagram followers. Buse greatly admires Acurio and his values.


‚ÄúHe's not my idol just because of how he cooks or whatever, but he always wants to help people,‚Äù Buse said. ‚ÄúHe has a foundation in Peru for the people that want to be a chef who have no money. He helps him, forms them and then they work in a restaurant around the world. 


‚ÄúFor me, what he does there is an example that he not only cares about the world, but also about humanity.‚Äù


With Christmas quickly approaching, Buse looks forward to a big family gathering and eating the delicious food that Acurio will make.


‚ÄúIt's like an event,‚Äù Buse said. ‚ÄúHe's such an amazing chef. It's always so delicious. He made all his recipes and a lot of his recipes came from his grandmother that I didn't get to meet.‚Äù


Around the table with loved ones, Buse will be able to proudly reflect on his 2025 season.


‚ÄúIf you would have told me that today I would be at the ranking I am, I would tell you that I don't believe you. I wanted to end in the Top 150, more or less,‚Äù Buse said. ‚ÄúIt was the goal we set. I think the start of the year was not as we imagined, but we managed to keep improving, keep believing in the process.‚Äù

Russell believes he and Mercedes have extracted the most from races this season more often than not.

George Russell admits that while he wouldn't say ""I'm proud to be P4"" in the Drivers' Championship, the Mercedes driver believes ""we're getting the best result possible most weekends"".

The Briton, who agreed to a new contract ahead of the United States Grand Prix last weekend, that will keep him at Mercedes for 2026, has been one of the standout drivers this season.

Russell sits behind only McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, as well as Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the standings, and joins them as the only drivers to win this season.

The 27-year-old's two wins in Canada and Singapore have both come from pole position, while Russell has added a further six podiums from 19 races so far.

‚ÄúIt's been a solid season. I don't think I'm going to say I'm proud to be P4, but I'm proud that every race, we're getting the best result possible most weekends out,"" he said on Thursday's media day ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix this weekend.

""Last weekend, we didn't, so I left Austin feeling a bit disappointed, and how confident are we that we can be on the right side of those fine margins?

""You can never be, because it is literally... last weekend it was 20 milliseconds between P2 and P4, and that probably was the difference between being on the podium or not on the podium. So you just know that come Q3, come the race start, you just really need to bring your A-game if you want to step on the podium.‚Äù

While Russell remains mathematically in contention for this year's world title, realistically the battle is between Piastri, Norris and Verstappen, with just 14 points separating the McLaren drivers and 40 covering all three.

Although Verstappen has been on a charge and reduced a 104-point gap courtesy of three wins in the last four Grands Prix, Russell believes it will still be a step too far.

""I still think it's going to be one of the McLaren drivers ‚Äì or it should be, because I still think they have the fastest car,"" he said.

‚ÄúBut obviously, Max is doing a great job at the moment, and they seem to have found some form which they haven't shown all season, and they look good on every kind of circuit.

""But they struggled a lot here last year. Ferrari won here and McLaren were quick here last year ‚Äì we finished ahead of Max.

‚ÄúAfter this weekend, if it's a McLaren 1-2 and Max in P7, everything changes again, so I think it'll be one of the McLaren guys.‚Äù

2025 Mexico City GP: Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar meet the fans on stage

2025 Mexico City GP: Hulkenberg and Bortoleto greet the crowd on the Fanzone stage

For Sergio Perez, the Mexico City Grand Prix is more than a date on the racing calendar ‚Äì it's personal. While he won't be on the grid this year, his connection to the race and his fans remains as strong as ever. This is the story of how Checo's home race became one of Formula 1's most powerful weekends, a celebration of his journey and a love letter to Mexico, with a highly anticipated return in 2026.

A decade since it arrived back on the calendar, the Mexico City Grand Prix will look and sound much the same ‚Äì the mariachi bands, the flags, the roar from the Foro Sol. But there's one big difference this time. For the first time since its glorious 2015 return, Sergio Perez won't be on the grid.

That's right ‚Äì for the first time in 10 years, the number 11 car won't be lining up on the grid this weekend at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. After parting ways with Red Bull at the end of 2024, this year Checo finds himself watching from the sidelines. Yet home fans need not worry. His break will be a short one, because Perez is set to return next season with the brand-new Cadillac F1 Team ‚Äì the sport's 11th entrant ‚Äì in what promises to be an exciting new chapter both for the team, the driver, and even for Mexican motorsport.

Still, his presence will certainly be felt everywhere. In the streets where murals of his Red Bull stint still shine bright, in the grandstands that carry his number and Mexican flags, and in the hearts of the thousands who've made the Mexico City Grand Prix what it is: a celebration of this special driver, of national pride, and of home.

To understand why Sergio Perez means so much to Mexican motorsport fans, you have to go back to where it all began ‚Äì Guadalajara, Western Mexico. It was there, on a local kart circuit that a six-year-old Checo first climbed into a kart built for racers twice his age. When racing, he was often the youngest in his class but never the slowest ‚Äì and so he quickly developed a handy knack for overtaking...

By his mid-teens, Perez's talent and ambitions had outgrown his homeland. At just 14, he left Mexico for Europe to race in Formula BMW in Germany ‚Äì alone and far from his family and any sense of familiarity. But he told himself, ‚ÄúNo, I can't give up. If I return to Mexico I'll never come back. Maybe it's worth giving everything and fight for it and try to make it.‚Äù That determination carried him through the toughest early days ‚Äì and good thing he stuck it out!

Those struggles clearly hardened him. Within a decade, he would become the first Mexican to reach Formula 1 in over 30 years ‚Äì following in the footsteps of legends Pedro and Ricardo Rodriguez, whose names still echo around the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez every race weekend.

When F1 returned to Mexico in 2015, the event quickly established itself as one of the most colourful and passionate on the calendar. The reception Perez received each year from the adoring home crowd was enough to give even the coldest cynic butterflies. But when he joined Red Bull in 2021, it evolved into something even more profound.

For the first time, a Mexican driver had a car capable of winning at home. The fans knew it ‚Äì and the energy inside the Autodromo reflected that. The noise, already formidable, hit a whole new level.

That year, Checo climbed onto the podium after finishing P3 ‚Äì the first Mexican driver ever to do so at home ‚Äì and the sight was unforgettable. He stood wrapped in the flag, confetti raining down, the crowd in the Foro Sol stadium singing his name in unison ‚Äì a pure goosebumps moment. ""I have pretty much everyone that has been with me since day one up there,‚Äù he said afterwards. ‚ÄúIt's a very special day for my family, for my country, for all the fans and also for the team.""

The post-race celebrations were on another level. Swipe for more images

Ask any driver what it's like to race in Mexico City and they'll all mention the same thing: the noise. The Foro Sol stadium section of the circuit ‚Äì where the track snakes through an old baseball arena ‚Äì has become one of the sport's best viewpoints.

It's there that the emotion of the crowd takes more of a physical form. Fans are singing, dancing, waving flags, and raising banners in every corner of the stadium. And when Checo's car appeared, the sound reached another level entirely. Perez admitted himself that when he drives through the stadium section at his home race he ‚Äúcan feel the energy of the fans‚Ä¶ I could actually hear the crowd‚Äù ‚Äì an amazing feat considering the overpowering noise of the V6 engines.

Of course, the utter devotion of the crowd brings pressure. Every lap, every pit stop, every strategic decision is amplified when you're racing in front of ‚Äì and for ‚Äì your nation. For Checo, the stakes have always been highest when racing in Mexico City.

The last few seasons brought challenges. Racing alongside four-time World Champion Max Verstappen has meant constant comparison and scrutiny, which only amplified the emotional rollercoaster of competing on home soil. Reflecting on his 2023 Mexican Grand Prix, where he retired early after a first-lap collision, Perez admitted, ‚ÄúI've had some really sad moments in my career, but certainly this race is the saddest one, because of the end result.‚Äù

It's a stark reminder that with the weight of expectation on him ‚Äì yes, the high moments feel higher... but the lows are even lower. Yet even in difficult moments, the fans' unwavering support for their driver never falters. Whether Perez finishes first or struggles with setbacks, the cheers remain as loud as ever.

Few relationships in Formula 1 capture the spirit of a nation quite like Sergio Perez and the Mexico City Grand Prix. Together, they've reignited the country's relationship with motorsport, turning what used to be seen as a niche passion into an opportunity for national celebration and showcasing Latin American talent.

Since its return to the calendar a decade ago, the Autodromo Hermanos Rodr√≠guez has come to be a platform for up-and-coming Mexican motorsport talent. Across the Grand Prix weekend, the circuit comes alive with support races from the Formula 4 NACAM Championship, TCR Mexico and GTM Super Copa, each brimming with young drivers chasing their own dreams of reaching the top.

For many of those youngsters, Checo is the benchmark ‚Äì the driver who proved that a kid from Guadalajara could take on the world and win (six times at that!). They've grown up watching him, cheering him through the highs and lows, and now they race on the same circuit, and no doubt fuelled by the same belief that carried him from karts as a kid all the way into F1.

Their impact has been seen in grassroots, where in recent years motorsport has surged in popularity across Mexico. Local circuits are busier, fan clubs are thriving, and 'Checo' has become a household name well beyond F1 circles. The race weekends have also become community events, with families, schools, and local businesses embracing motorsport culture.

In many ways, Checo and his home race have grown together. Each has lifted the other, showing how sport can reflect the soul of a country. And although he'll be watching from the sidelines this year, that bond will only grow stronger.

When he returns to the grid in 2026 with the Cadillac Formula 1 Team, few moments will feel more magical than seeing Mexico's hero back where he belongs ‚Äì and he'll once again be cheered on by his adoring crowd that never stopped believing in him.

The tech platform and streaming service will let users experience locations featured on the show, including a romantic pasta-making class and a behind-the-scenes tour of an iconic deli.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Fans of the Netflix smash Nobody Wants This that want a little taste of what life is like for the stars of the show will get their chance, thanks to a partnership between the streaming giant and Airbnb.


	Airbnb says that it is creating three Airbnb Originals experiences based on the romantic comedy, including one based on a scene from the upcoming season two, which returns to Netflix today. The show follows sex and dating podcaster Joanne Williams (Kristen Bell), who falls in love with a handsome and unconventional rabbi, Noah Roklov (Adam Brody).

One experience will include a romantic pasta-making class for two at Los Angeles' Osteria Mozza, a class that will be featured in the new season of the show.

	Another experience is based around another L.A. staple (and favorite of the show's creators Sara and Erin Foster): Canter's Deli, providing fans a taste of the history and stories from the restaurant, which will also be featured in Netflix and Airbnb social content.


	And finally, the platform gave 10 users access to the show's season two premiere last week.


Nobody Wants This is featured on the cover of this week's The Hollywood Reporter, which dives into the origins of the show and its troubled first season, which despite its issues became a global smash.


	‚ÄúThe fact that I saw pictures of Halloween costumes feels like the benchmark of cultural penetration,‚Äù Brody told THR.

	











	Airbnb has been leaning on Hollywood stars and partnerships as it seeks to build out its experiences business. Brian Chesky, its CEO, told THR earlier this year that flagship experiences based on famous people, institutions or IP can help bring new people to the platform and help it accomplish its goals. The company announced experiences with Sabrina Carpenter and Patrick Mahomes, at the time.


	‚ÄúWe did a few homes where there was a celebrity at the home, and then at some point, we said wait, maybe we can just do celebrities without the home,‚Äù Chesky said, noting that as part of its new Airbnb Originals program, users will be able to book things like music lessons from up-and-coming musicians, or beach volleyball lessons with Olympic stars.


	‚ÄúWe had this basic idea that from an upcoming musician to Sabrina Carpenter and everything in between, that there was no gaps. Every stage of someone's career, almost like as if Sabrina Carpenter was unknown, she could be on our platform, and as she becomes more popular, she can become an Original, and then eventually she becomes a superstar, and she still has a place in Airbnb. Why does she do it? She does it to create a one ime experience for fans and really allow them to connect, and other fans can live vicariously through them,‚Äù Chesky added.

	A logline reads: ‚ÄúIn this all-new series, struggling actress Trina Vega (Daniella Monet) returns to her former high school, Hollywood Arts, as an unqualified substitute teacher, quickly finding herself both clashing with and unexpectedly inspiring a new generation of ambitious and talented students as they learn to find their true path at Hollywood's most elite performing arts school.‚Äù


	After a bow on Netflix, Hollywood Arts will get additional play on Nickelodeon and Paramount+.


‚ÄúComing back as Trina alongside such a dynamic, powerful cast of newcomers is something I feel very lucky and grateful to do. Victorious was in a lot of ways life changing for all of us, our cast is forever bonded by that experience, and to think that I have an opportunity to steward anything close to that is a feeling I can't begin to describe. As an actress, producer, and mom, I am so eager to create something we can all be proud to share with the world,‚Äù Monet said in a statement.


Victorious premiered on Nickelodeon in March 2010 ahead of a four-season run to 2013. The scripted half-hour series followed teenager Tori Vega navigating her way through the performing arts high school Hollywood Arts, alongside her older sister Trina and other students.

Sony Is Betting On It","https://www.billboard.com/pro/bruce-springsteen-movie-music-catalog-value-streaming-boost/","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 16:37:16 GMT","

As previous biopics have proven, films have the capacity to bring new audiences to a star's music ‚Äî and help justify the cost of a pricey catalog acquisition.


													By
												

	Steve Knopper



Bruce Springsteen and Sony Music had different reasons for signing on to Deliver Me From Nowhere, the new biopic starring Jeremy Allen White as the Boss.


	‚ÄúI'm old. I don't give a f‚Äìk what I do anymore,‚Äù Springsteen told Time. ‚ÄúAs you get older, you feel a lot freer.‚Äù And while Sony was willing to do whatever Springsteen wanted to do, the label had other considerations, too: Its publishing company paid $500 million for Springsteen's catalog in 2021, and one of the most powerful weapons it can deploy to boost streaming and revenue is a star-studded film. ‚ÄúThe biopic is the cherry on top of the sundae, if you will,‚Äù says Sony marketing exec Monica Cornia. ‚ÄúFilms bring more awareness to the artist brand and fans to the funnel.‚Äù


	Cornia, senior vp of marketing and partnerships for Sony's Commercial Music Group, adds that the late-2024 Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown and the 2022 Elvis Presley biopic Elvis ‚Äúcreated a new baseline for streaming‚Äù both artists' catalogs. They had ‚Äúdouble-digit growth post-release and have sustained elevated streaming levels to date,‚Äù adds a Sony rep. 


Deliver Me From Nowhere focuses on 1982's Nebraska ‚Äî not the most commercial of Springsteen's albums. But the star power from The Bear‚Äòs Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen and Succession‚Äòs Jeremy Strong as his manager, Jon Landau, will ‚Äúcreate a huge cultural moment,‚Äù says Cornia, which Sony can use as ‚Äúthe initial exciting point for us to start to lean in.‚Äù


	Over the past five years, the music business' most successful songwriters have sold their catalogs (and sometimes other assets) for astronomical sums. In 2020, Dylan received a reported $300 million to $500 million for the publishing of his 600-plus songs, and Paul Simon, Stevie Nicks, David Bowie, James Brown and many others followed with deals estimated between $90 million and $250 million. ‚ÄúEverybody who's acquiring a catalog is looking for opportunities to find new audiences and tap into a fanbase that's already engaged,‚Äù says Sophia Dilley, executive vp of Concord Originals, the indie-label division that co-produced last year's HBO doc Stax: Soulsville, U.S.A., about the storied Memphis recording home of Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others. ‚ÄúA natural place to do that is within the documentary or biopic space.‚Äù


	After its November 2018 premiere, Queen‚Äòs Bohemian Rhapsody biopic hit more than $1 billion worldwide in box-office sales over just five months, increasing the value of the band's publishing and recording catalogs. In 2024, Sony purchased them for $1.27 billion. 


	Two months before the release of Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen's catalog streamed 15 million times per week. Afterwards, it spiked to nearly 62 million, and settled by the end of 2018 to 38.2 million, according to Luminate. By comparison, Dylan's catalog drew 7.1 million weekly streams two months before A Complete Unknown, spiked to 19.5 million after the biopic and dropped to 12 million in February, also according to Luminate.


	It isn't just the biopic itself that sets the streaming bar higher for iconic artists like Queen, Dylan, Presley and Springsteen ‚Äî it's the marketing campaign and social-media activity surrounding the films. In Springsteen's case on Friday (Oct. 24), the heavily advertised Deliver Me From Nowhere arrives with a new release geared to superfans, the five-disc box set Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition, which includes Springsteen's long-awaited electric version of the album and a performance film. ‚ÄúOur goal is to take advantage of the moment, but also to make sure we're consistently marketing the catalog and the artist going forward,‚Äù Cornia says. 


	Concord, like many labels and publishers, plans similarly broad marketing campaigns for its upcoming biopics on Mississippi Delta bluesman Robert Johnson (release date unknown) and R&B keyboardist and Beatles collaborator Billy Preston (sometime in 2026). ‚ÄúThe risk is it doesn't have the longevity you want it to,‚Äù Dilley says, ‚ÄúBut in the immediate, it definitely has an impact, because you're spending money on a campaign, which helps audience awareness.‚Äù


	The timing of Deliver Me from Nowhere and A Complete Unknown, after the Springsteen and Dylan catalog sales, is probably not coincidental, according to Alaister Moughan, founder of Moghan Music, a London-based company that specializes in valuations of publishing catalogs. Major artists who sell catalogs, and top companies that spend big money to buy them, are highly aware that a well-timed biopic can improve the songs' future value. ‚ÄúThe past five years in particular, when an artist is looking to sell their catalog, they've been quite strategic,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey're tying in, ‚ÄòWe'll be interested in a biopic.'‚Äù 


	Still, the focus on the lesser-known Nebraska, rather than, say, Springsteen's later blockbuster Born in the U.S.A., which made him a worldwide star, suggests Springsteen and the filmmakers are not focused on quick streaming revenue. ‚ÄúMaybe it's more of a long-term view,‚Äù Moughan adds, ‚Äúrather than, ‚ÄòWe want the Bohemian Rhapsody of Springsteen this year.'‚Äù

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Magnolia Pictures will be opening its Toronto Film Festival acquisition Normal on April 17, 2026 in 2,000 theaters, the distributor's widest release in its 24-year history.


Normal, which we first told you about selling to Magnolia at TIFF, is directed by Ben Wheatley and written by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad. The pic reps a reteam between Kolstad, producer Marc Provissiero and Bob Odenkirk, who previously worked on the Nobody franchise; those movies propelled the two-time Emmy-winning Better Call Saul star to action leading man status. The Nobody movies, the latest of which was released in August, have cleared close to $100 million at the global box office.

	











Normal will share the marquee on its spring weekend with Lee Cronin's The Mummy from New Line and Blumhouse, and Amazon MGM Studios' Liam Neeson action movie 4 Kids Walk Into a Bank. 


	In Normal, Odenkirk plays an unassuming substitute sheriff with a troubled past who, after moving to a small, sleepy town, responds to a bank robbery and unknowingly uncovers something far more explosive. Henry Winkler and Lena Headey also star.


	Magnolia picked up Normal soon after TIFF wrapped. It's becoming more of an anomaly for an acquisition title to be sold so quickly around its premiere at a fest. Kolstad told Deadline that a sequel to Normal is already in the works.


	Previously the June Squibb caper Thelma was Magnolia Pictures' widest release with an opening of 1,290 theaters in June 2024. That movie did close to a 4x multiple off its $2.3 million opening for a $9 million domestic take. Magnolia acquired Thelma out of the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.

	Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps will begin streaming November 5 on Disney+. 


	The film, which grossed more than $521 million worldwide at the box office, stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Marvel's First Family. It opened to a record $117.6 million domestically, repping the biggest domestic B.O. opening for director Matt Shakman and castmembers Pascal, Kirby, Quinn and Moss-Bachrach.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Set against the backdrop of a '60s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, Marvel's First Family faces a daunting challenge. Forced to balance being heroes with their family bond, they must defend Earth from a space god and his enigmatic herald.

	











	The film follows Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), Sue Storm (Invisible Woman), Johnny Storm (Human Torch), and Ben Grimm (The Thing) as they journey across the cosmos, and discover the heart, humor, and family bonds that make them truly fantastic. 


	In Deadline's review, Damon Wise said it was ‚Äúthe best by far of the company's attempts to translate the long-running comic book's appeal to the big screen.‚Äù He noted, ‚ÄúIt also benefits from a smart script and ‚Ä¶ really quite moving performances from its four charismatic leads, being arguably the best of Pedro Pascal's releases this year.‚Äù


	The film was among the top ten highest-grossing films of 2025, both domestically and globally. Critics called it ‚Äúone of the best superhero movies of all time‚Äù (Ryan Britt, Men's Journal), praising its ‚Äújaw-dropping spectacle and epic action‚Äù (Josh Wilding, Comic Book Movie).

	











WandaVision‚Äòs Shakman directed from a script by Eric Pearson, Josh Friedman, Jeff Kaplan, and Ian Springer. Peter Cameron (WandaVision) also did some writing on the project, produced by Kevin Feige for Marvel Studios.

	Sony/Crunchyroll's Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc revved up $3.4 million in previews Thursday in screenings that began at 4 p.m. at 2,500 locations.


	By the way, that preview number is close to the $3.8M posted by Demon Slayer: Mugen Train back in April 2021, on its way to a three-day total f $21.2M as movie theaters were reopening from Covid. That title, released by Funimation/Aniplex, had a Friday of $9.5M.


	The Tatsuya Yoshihara-directed Chainsaw Man based on the popular magna is expected to ring up $11M+ in a weekend that might now be too close to call with Universal/Blumhouse's Black Phone 2 with an expected $12M+ second frame.

	











Chainsaw Man is 100% fresh from 18 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 99% audience score.

	Meanwhile, 20th Century Studios' $55M Scott Cooper-directed Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere strummed $850,000. The movie is expected to bring in $9M-$11M. Note that preview take is under the $1.4M Christmas preview gross of Searchlight's Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, which went electric over the holidays with a $7.2M opening day, $11.6M 3-day and 5-day total of $23.2M. Springsteen is opening at 3,460 theatres including 250 Imax screens and 750 Premium Large Format screens. Critics aren't wowed by this rock performer biopic at 61% fresh, but fans last night enjoyed it better at 85%.


	Jeremy Allen White plays Bruce Springsteen and Jeremy Strong plays his manager Jon Landau in a semi-biopic about The Boss recording the personal 1982 album Nebraska which preceded his global phenomenon Born in the U.S.A.


Paramount is not reporting grosses on Regretting You given its limited run in under 500 theaters last night, with one showtime for the A Night of No Regrets fan event that included a Q&A with cast and director Josh Boone with a special performance by Hannah Cohen. Nonetheless, sources say the movie did better than Springsteen last night. Regretting You was forecasted at $9M-$11M this weekend in what is the second Colleen Hoover novel feature adaptation to hit the screen after the massive success of It Ends With Us. Critics don't like the schmaltziness of Regretting You at 34% on RT, but there was also never beginning with them on It Ends With Us which they threw Kleenex boxes at with 54%.

	











	Neon this frame has the psychological thriller Shelby Oaks, which did $515K from combined mystery screenings and last night's previews. The movie is expected to file in the low single digits.

feels more like 8-9 for springsteen. a lot of staring off into space for this one.

Springsteen was a huge miscalculation‚Ä¶

Can New Jersey single-handedly make the Springsteen biopic a success?

Never been a huge Boss fan, but it feels weird to be opening this movie at the end of Oct before Halloween. Wouldn't this have been better in mid-Nov, early Dec?

This really would've been better if it was counterprogramming The Running Man, and Predator Badlands was opening the week before Halloween.

Rebel Wilson's directorial debut may be stuck in purgatory, but her next feature is pushing ahead. The actor, writer, and director shared a post on Instagram this morning confirming that Nicole Scherzinger and Jennifer Coolidge had joined her upcoming film Girl Group, though it's not clear that the actors will be part of the titular girl group. Per The Hollywood Reporter, Melanie Chisolm of the Spice Girls, Shaznay Lewis of All Saints, and Scherzinger's fellow erstwhile Pussycat Doll Ashely Roberts have already filled those parts. 

Girl Group will follow a pop diva played by Wilson, who was kicked out of her girl group's reunion tour and sentenced to community service. (Presumably, there is some tie between these plot points, but it isn't laid out in the synopsis shared by THR.) Randall Park, Sheridan Smith, and Jamie Lee O'Donnell are among the rest of the cast. Also to be determined is whether Girl Group will be a musical or simply a movie with music (or perhaps even a third option). Wilson starred in three Pitch Perfect movies and the aforementioned directorial debut The Deb is also a musical, so she certainly has bona fides in the genre. Live Nation will executive produce Girl Group through its Live Nation Studios banner. 

Scherzinger and Coolidge, meanwhile, have both recently hit new career peaks. Scherzinger won a Tony Award in June for her leading role in Sunset Boulevard on Broadway. Coolidge won two Emmys and a Golden Globe for her two-season role on The White Lotus and also appeared in the money-printing endeavor that was A Minecraft Movie.

Garcelle Beauvais is making it clear she's at peace with leaving ‚ÄúThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.‚Äù The 58-year-old actress and TV personality recently spoke candidly about her exit from the hit Bravo show, explaining why she walked away, what she really thinks of her former co-stars, and how she's focusing on new projects ‚Äî not past drama.

During her October 22 interview on ‚ÄúThe Breakfast Club,‚Äù shared on the show's official Instagram page, Garcelle was asked if she missed filming ‚ÄúThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.‚Äù Her answer was short and direct: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was great in terms of like, I got a new audience and there were really wonderful things that happened because of the show,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúBut I think my time was up.‚Äù

When pressed about whether money or contract disputes played a role in her departure, Garcelle quickly shut down the speculation. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was nothing like that. I just couldn't do it anymore. It was really hurting my spirit. I couldn't physically, spiritually, mentally, do it anymore.‚Äù

The actress, who joined RHOBH in season 10, said her decision came from choosing herself over chaos. ‚ÄúI've been really great about choosing me when I'm faced with something,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI've done it with relationships. I've done it in other places where I've felt like, ‚ÄòIf I don't choose me, it will probably not work out for me.' So I have faith, and I just knew it was time.‚Äù

As for how Sutton Stracke, her longtime friend on the show, would handle her absence, Garcelle replied bluntly, ‚ÄúGirl, I don't know. That's on her.‚Äù

Following her exit, Garcelle unfollowed her castmates ‚Äî a move that sparked plenty of headlines. She explained that it wasn't about drama, but about boundaries. ‚ÄúI just needed space,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI follow people who I want to see what they're doing and I want to support. If you're out of my life, I don't see why I need to follow you.‚Äù

Garcelle also reacted to a moment from ‚ÄúWatch What Happens Live‚Äù when Erika Jayne and Bozoma ‚ÄúBoz‚Äù Saint John were asked about her departure. After an awkward pause, Erika joked that it must have been ‚Äúa divine act,‚Äù which Garcelle didn't appreciate. ‚ÄúThey were mean girls,‚Äù she said.

Still, Garcelle admitted she doesn't understand why she and Boz were ever portrayed as rivals. ‚ÄúI met with Boz prior to her coming onto the show for lunch. We got along great,‚Äù she said, noting that the tension may have been more about editing than real-life friction.

When the hosts pressed her on the lack of support she received from her former castmates, Garcelle shifted gears to focus on her current work. ‚ÄúI really don't want to go back there, honestly,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI'm here for my movie. I'm selling shows. I just would like to stay on a positive note.‚Äù

Her new Lifetime film, ‚ÄúTaken at a Truck Stop: A Black Girl Missing Movie,‚Äù premieres Saturday, October 25, at 8/7c.

Depending on who you ask, Kwame Nkrumah is either a hero tragically robbed of the opportunity to see his visions materialize or a narcissistic would-be dictator.

The first prime minister and president of Ghana, Nkrumah oversaw the African country's peaceful separation from Great Britain and became a passionate advocate for Pan-Africanism. He called for African nations to unite as a body that he dreamed of calling the United States of Africa, believing that unifying to control the continent's natural resources would allow Africa to free itself from colonial influences and become a major player on the world stage. But he also embraced authoritarian tactics like declaring Ghana a one-party state with himself as president for life, eventually leading to a coup that toppled statues of him and forced him out of power for life.

Like so many great figures of history, Nkrumah is a complicated person, one who preached lofty ideas that his own human nature prevented him from consistently living up to. But if anyone can claim to truly know him, it would be Chris Hesse. The 90-year-old reverend served as Nkrumah's personal filmmaker throughout his tenure leading Ghana, following him around the world with a camera as he met with leaders like John F. Kennedy and tried to rally the heads of other African states to join his cause. Hesse shot over 200 hours of documentary footage in the early 1960s, creating an archive of negatives that capture the first few chapters of a nation's history.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






‚ÄúThe Eyes of Ghana,‚Äù Ben Proudfoot's new documentary about Hesse that explores how the nation's origins are inextricably tied to filmmaking, begins with the reveal of a juicy secret. Hesse's films were all burned during the 1966 coup that ousted Nkrumah, but the filmmaker secretly maintained an archive of his negatives in London. Even as a nonagenarian, he continues to make the trip from Ghana to London each year to ensure that his life's work is being kept safe, holding onto the hope that the archive will be digitized and his side of the Nkrumah story will finally be told.

Hesse is starting to lose his vision ‚Äî a reality that a man who spent his life looking through a camera is unwilling to accept just yet ‚Äî but his passion for filmmaking hasn't dulled in the slightest. ‚ÄúThe Eyes of Ghana‚Äù sees him lecturing to a class of film students, mentoring documentary filmmaker Anita Afonu, and waxing poetic about the Ghanaian film industry that briefly flourished in the 1960s. As he tells it, Nkrumah saw how Hollywood movies helped forge a coherent cultural identity and thought Ghana could achieve something similar with a strong government-backed film industry (yet another choice that toes the line between liberal support of the arts and authoritarian tendencies). He built an entire studio ecosystem, and the nation was filled with cinema palaces showing both American and Ghanaian films to crowds of eager moviegoers.

 










‚ÄúThe Eyes of Ghana‚Äù is simultaneously a tribute to the way movies can change the world, a postmortem for a nation's film industry (a lack of which Hesse believes has permanently hindered its identity), and a portrait of two men who were with Ghana from the very beginning. Hesse is infectiously charismatic, and seeing 15 minutes of his film footage digitized for the first time is a treat for history buffs. (Profits from the film will go toward digitizing the rest of the archive.) 

The question of Nkrumah is more complicated: Hesse clearly reveres his late boss and believes he got an unfair shake from Western media, who were threatened by his anti-capitalist, pro-Africa views. That seems like a reasonable possibility, though the film doesn't much engage with the opposing view. Hesse insists that he's not trying to sway anyone's opinion one way or another; he just wants his films to be seen so that his country's history can be documented and people can form their own ideas about Nkrumah's legacy. That comes across as a half-truth ‚Äî it's apparent that he believes that his films will cause the world to see his friend in a more positive light ‚Äî but it's hard to argue with the notion that our understanding of history would be better off if we had access to more primary sources about a complicated but highly influential figure.

 










A skilled documentarian who has won two of the previous three Oscars for Best Documentary Short, Proudfoot clearly understands the goldmine that his subject provides. Hesse's life experiences would make for a fascinating movie, even without charisma, but the fact that the 90-year-old overflows with the joy of being alive and unending passion for cinema makes the director's job a lot easier. 

Proudfoot and his team, including Kris Bowers, pull all the right (if predictable) emotional strings, underscoring Hesse's memories with majestic orchestral music fit for an Old Hollywood epic. The camera team finds angles that capture the twinkle in Hesse's eye as he pores through old negatives and gazes up at shimmering projectors. Ditto for Edmund Addo, the aging theater owner who has devoted his entire life to reopening the Rex Cinema in Ghana, even at the expense of his relationships with his children. The video production is lush, the sentimentality laid on thick ‚Äî this is a movie that's far more interested in playing familiar notes about how cinema is magical and storytelling is vital for the already converted than taking a critical look at its subjects.

But‚Ä¶ cinema is magical, and storytelling is vital. Clich√©d as these tropes might be, they work for a reason, and it's hard to walk away from ‚ÄúThe Eyes of Ghana‚Äù without a spring in your step caused by the 90-minute love fest for this incredible medium. Hesse and Proudfoot take the long view of history, making the case that even if Nkrumah failed to implement his vision for a United States of Africa ‚Äî hell, even if the next 10 people to pick up the baton fail too ‚Äî the dream will endure because we have Hesse's films keeping it alive. The arc of time is long, but it bends toward justice, ‚ÄúThe Eyes of Ghana‚Äù argues, and movies can help bend it a little further.

 










‚ÄúThe Eyes of Ghana‚Äù screened at AFI Fest 2025 after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

In 1967, Charles Chaplin directed his final film, ‚ÄúThe Countess From Hong Kong.‚Äù An ill-fated project doomed by the differences in working methods of director Chaplin and star Marlon Brando, ‚ÄúCountess‚Äù broke Chaplin's spirit ‚Äî and his ankle when he tripped in the studio during production. By then, he no longer bore any resemblance to the inspired artist behind masterpieces like ‚ÄúThe Great Dictator,‚Äù ‚ÄúMonsieur Verdoux,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLimelight.‚Äù

Yet not long after the artistic and commercial failure of ‚ÄúCountess,‚Äù Chaplin's imagination got fired up again when he conceived of ‚ÄúThe Freak,‚Äù an allegorical fantasy about a young woman born with wings whose condition attracts both the best and worst of humanity. At the age of 80, Chaplin not only wrote a complete script for the film but had wings built, designed sets, oversaw a shooting schedule and budget, and had an artist storyboard many of the shots.

‚ÄúThe Freak‚Äù got tantalizingly close to production, but Chaplin never shot any footage outside of some tests of the heroine's wings. One problem, as usual, was financing ‚Äî the living legend struggled to raise the necessary funds, at one point suffering the indignity of rejection by United Artists, the studio he had co-founded during the silent era. Another was Chaplin's deteriorating health; though he felt invigorated by the prospect of a new project, his wife Oona feared that the movie's logistical challenges would kill him and secretly worked to keep the film from ever moving forward.

 










While it will never be possible to see Chaplin's final dream project, Sticking Place Books and the Cineteca Bologna have collaborated to give us the next best thing: ‚ÄúCharles Chaplin‚Äòs ‚ÄòThe Freak': The Story of an Unfinished Film,‚Äù a book that reproduces the final shooting script and provides context with hundreds of documents taken from the Chaplin Archives and newly discovered papers of producer Jerry Epstein. The volume is a treasure trove for Chaplin enthusiasts, containing everything from the auteur's handwritten script notes and wing designs to production documents and miscellania like a list of film prints Chaplin reserved for personal viewing (among them ‚ÄúBarbarella‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Absent-Minded Professor‚Äù).

The archival material is organized and annotated by Chaplin biographer David Robinson and editor Cecilia Cenciarelli, who have done essential work here detailing Chaplin's biggest final burst of creativity. Robinson uses the documentation to provide signposts for a narrative in which he takes the reader step-by-step through Chaplin's creative process, a valuable endeavor even when related to a never-completed film ‚Äî maybe even especially for a film that was never completed, as this is the closest we'll ever come to sharing Chaplin's final dream along with him.

Anyone who has consumed the Criterion Collection's indispensable editions of Chaplin masterworks knows he was a unique director with a time-consuming approach that yielded great films only after many false starts and turns down blind alleys. ‚ÄúThe Freak‚Äù was no exception, and Robinson clearly lays out discarded ideas while tracing the evolution of the script, working from thousands of random pages found among Chaplin's papers.

 










The deep dive into Chaplin's working methods is compelling and illuminating, and the shooting script itself shows that the always politically and philosophically probing Chaplin hadn't lost any of his fire or originality in his old age. Interviews with two people close to the process ‚Äî Chaplin's daughter Victoria, who was slated to play the title character, and storyboard artist Gerald Larn ‚Äî add a human touch to the tome and confirm the passion and desire that ‚ÄúThe Freak‚Äù inspired in the octogenarian filmmaker.

For those of us who revere Chaplin, ‚ÄúThe Story of an Unfinished Film‚Äù is a vital and riveting work of film history and scholarship ‚Äî for the uninitiated, it's a great introduction to the obsessive working methods of one of the 20th century's true cinematic geniuses.

‚ÄúCharles Chaplin's ‚ÄòThe Freak': The Story of an Unfinished Film‚Äù is currently available from Sticking Place Books.

							By 

	Jonathan Bernstein



	Following her 2018 breakthrough, By the Way, I Forgive You, Brandi Carlile embraced many roles: Brandi the Underdog, a singer who conquered the mainstream after a decade of hustling; Brandi the Steward, ushering in the resurgences of icons like Elton John, Tanya Tucker, and Joni Mitchell; Brandi the Author, with her 2021 bestselling memoir; and Brandi the Collaborator, following her supergroup the Highwomen and her production work with Brandy Clark and Lucius.


	None of these roles left much space for Brandi the Artist, or Brandi the Person. That's the thesis of Returning to Myself, Carlile's eighth solo album. It's a frequently moving, occasionally spellbinding, and sporadically frustrating statement that represents Carlile's finest work since By the Way. But it's more than a return to form, pointing toward new textures in Carlile's voice, sense of melody, and instincts as a co-producer (alongside heavyweights Aaron Dessner and Andrew Watt).


	See ‚ÄúNo One Knows Us,‚Äù the album's memoiristic centerpiece (‚ÄúEighties movies and Everclear/What if we're gay?‚Äù), and the one that best utilizes the yin-yang of Dessner and Watt. Other highlights: the gorgeous verse melody on soft rocker ‚ÄúHuman,‚Äù the hushed acoustic ballad ‚ÄúAnniversary,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Without Me,‚Äù a gut-punch meditation on parenting adapted from her recent Elton John collaboration: ‚ÄúHeavy are the hands,‚Äù she sings, ‚Äúthat you are free to slip right through.‚Äù

Returning to Myself is at its best when most committed to Carlile's interiority. When it strays from that, namely on the Joni Mitchell tribute ‚ÄúJoni,‚Äù its premise gets diluted. And while the Eighties arena rocker ‚ÄúChurch & State‚Äù is a clear future live set piece, it also feels slightly out of place.

	











	That's mostly because the rest of this album  feels so of a piece. In the Dessner-influenced ‚ÄúA War With Time,‚Äù Carlile sneaks the album's thesis into a sweet reflection on a trip she took to New York as a young adult: ‚ÄúWhen you find yourself alone,‚Äù she sings, ‚Äúretrace your steps and come back home.‚Äù

	Joseph Hudak



	When Ace Frehley played what would be his final concert last month, he took the stage with a rhythm guitar player who had been by his side longer than any other in his solo bands: Nashville shredder Jeremy Asbrock. Together, they tore through Kiss classics like ‚ÄúDeuce‚Äù and ‚ÄúCold Gin,‚Äù Frehley solo staples like ‚ÄúNew York Groove,‚Äù and Frehley's Comet's enduring battle cry ‚ÄúRock Soldiers.‚Äù


	Asbrock, who played in bands like the Shazam and with John Corabi before joining up with Kiss' Spaceman guitarist in 2018, was the ultimate rock soldier. He calls playing with Frehley, who died Oct. 16 at 74, a dream gig for a Kiss superfan like himself.


	‚ÄúAce isn't just an influence of mine. This is the person that laid the path before me when I was four years old. I've never wanted to do anything else, and he was the guy that brought it all to me,‚Äù Asbrock tells Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúSome nights onstage, it was extremely surreal, especially when he was having a really great show, and he'd get in that stance and start doing his thing. It was like, ‚ÄòMan, there it is. That's it right there, and it's standing right beside me.'‚Äù

A post shared by Rolling Stone Nashville Now (@rollingstonecountry)


	Along with Asbrock, Frehley's final solo band included fellow Nashville player Ryan Spencer Cook on bass and Scot Coogan on drums. Ironically, perhaps, the group was born out of Gene Simmons' band. Asbrock says they were playing with the Kiss bassist on a tour of Australia that Frehley was booked to open when Frehley asked Simmons if he could borrow his players.

	











	‚ÄúGene said, ‚ÄòIf it's OK with them, it's OK with me,'‚Äù Asbrock recalls. ‚ÄúLater on, Gene pulled me into his dressing room, and the Kiss cruise was coming up, and he told us that Ace was going to ask us to do the cruise. Then we went to Japan from there with Ace and he asked us to be the band. I joined in September of 2018, so I've held the guitar-player position longer than any musician he's had, consecutively.‚Äù

	Nashville's Philip Shouse also performed in Frehley's solo band, playing bass from 2018 to 2022 until he took a full-time gig in German metal band Accept. He, Asbrock, and Cook are longtime friends and are essential to Nashville's vibrant rock scene: For years they hosted a weekly hard-rock showcase called Thee Rock N Roll Residency that featured surprise guests like Alice Cooper, Halestorm's Lzzy Hale, Cheap Trick's Robin Zander, and more of the local rock community.


	Shouse says that touring with Frehley was a chance to see the guitarist's keen sense of humor up close. ‚ÄúHe was really funny. He was really goofy. And I mean this in the best way, sometimes it was like, ‚ÄòWow, he is from another planet, isn't he?'‚Äù Shouse says. ‚ÄúHe just had this way about him that was unlike anybody I've ever met.‚Äù


	Like his pal Asbrock, he credits Frehley with his decision to become a guitar player. ‚ÄúAce taught me how to play lead guitar. I was taking guitar lessons and learning the scales, but nothing sounded like music to me. It never made sense until I heard Ace, and that was in 10th grade,‚Äù Shouse says. ‚ÄúWhen I heard his solos, it all clicked.‚Äù

	Asbrock and Shouse, who also lost his father a few months ago, are still struggling to make sense of a world without the Space Ace. But Asbrock says fans should be aware of just how much of a regular guy Frehley was behind the face paint.


	‚ÄúHe's totally human. We've had conversations where he's been very vulnerable to me, just like, real dude conversations,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúGene was not going to call me up and talk about real-life things. And, you know, Ace has.‚Äù

The Beatles have previewed their upcoming Anthology 4 by unearthing an unreleased take on the Help! classic ‚ÄúI've Just Seen a Face.‚Äù


	Recorded at Abbey Road Studios (Studio Two) on June 14, 1965 ‚Äî just over 60 years ago ‚Äî this never-heard rendition of ‚ÄúI've Just Seen a Face‚Äù captures the rollicking third take the Beatles laid down in the studio; the Fab Four ultimately recorded six takes of the song, with the last one serving as the foundation for what appeared on Help! 


	‚ÄúI've Just Seen a Face (Take 3)‚Äù opens with raw audio of the Beatles in the studio, with John Lennon quipping that ‚ÄúLonnie‚Äù ‚Äî presumably Lonnie Donegan, a Scottish skiffle singer who influenced the band ‚Äî is ‚Äúgonna regret not singing this one,‚Äù followed by Lennon missing his cue when the song opens.


	Due out November 21, Anthology 4 features 36 tracks, including 13 previously unreleased outtakes and demos. The set will be accompanied by an expanded and restored version of the Beatles' Anthology documentary, with the now-nine-part series premiering on November 26 on Disney+.

	All four volumes of the Anthology will also be released as one giant collection, a 12-LP box set on 180-gram vinyl and an 8-CD box set, from Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMG, as well as digitally.

Warning! Spoilers ahead for Supernatural #1!

Supernatural is returning to its roots, with a new comic story set during Season 1 of the longrunning horror-action series. Sam and Dean are young again, and just starting out on their demon-hunting journey, in an arc that can shed more light on how they came to be the iconic duo fans love today. 

Supernatural #1 is written by Grek Pak, with art by Eder Messias. The preview for the issue starts with the familiar grisly imagery of someone bursting into flames, before cutting to the Winchester brothers.

Already, the new comic series is teasing a connection to the franchise's OG villain, Azazel, or the ‚ÄúYellow-Eyes Demon‚Äù in its debut storyline. 

At its core, Supernatural is about the relationship between Sam and Dean Winchester. As expansive and sprawling as the franchise's mythology became as it progressed, its universe always fundamentally revolved around Sam and Dean. The new Supernatural comic series returns to a simpler time in the brothers' history, when they had no idea the extent of the horrors in store for them. 

Or at least, when they're starting to get an idea. In Supernatural #1, Sam is still processing the trauma of losing his girlfriend Jess; the issue flashes back to the nightmarish moment at the end of the show's pilot episode, in which Jess shared the Winchester boys' mother's fate, pinned to the ceiling by an unknown force and set ablaze. 

The similar spontaneous combustion of a seemingly unrelated character just beforehand suggests that the Supernatural comic's story is going to tie into the early seasons' Azazel storyline in some way. Or, alternatively, it's possible that it, at least, it will tease the antagonist's presence, considering where Dynamite Entertainment's new Supernatural comics are situated in the series' overall timeline. 

By going back to Season 1, Supernatural is giving fans more of what they want, first and foremost: Sam and Dean's dynamic. As much as the preview for Supernatural #1 makes it clear the series isn't going to shy away from the franchise's trademark horror imagery, its true highlight is the brothers' banter, which feels straight out of Season 1. 

Author Greg Pak is a pro, and this teaser for Supernatural #1 confirms that he already has a firm grasp on the main characters' voices. This suggests that Supernatural's return to its earliest era is going to be a gratifying experience for fans who have missed the OG versions of Sam and Dean. 

Supernatural #1 will be available October 29, 2025 from Dynamite Entertainment.

The algorithm is both a pickpocket and a smothering blanket disguised as a friend when it comes to grief. Whether you lose a person, a place, or a thing, a void of understanding begins to grow like the Earth splitting in two. We may never get the answers to the question of why bad things happen, but there's a hell of a lot of theories to fertilize our raw feelings and prey on our own insecurities. Tales of a new world order and lizard people walking among us might sound ridiculous to the everyday person ‚Äî but those most susceptible to the ills of corporations and the uber rich ‚Äî might be more susceptible to those who man the pulpits of the absurd and far-fetched. 

Yorgos Lanthimos's ‚ÄúBugonia,‚Äù a remake of Jang Joon-hwan's 2003 sci-fi black satire ‚ÄúSave The Green Planet!,‚Äù is aware that the breaths of the world are becoming more strenuous and labored. The title of the English adaptation is an Ancient Greek word meaning ‚Äúox-birth,‚Äù referring to bees spontaneously born from a cow's carcass in ritual. Lanthimos and writer Will Tracy leave this up to interpretation, but this choice becomes very apparent given the source material and the characters at play. Teddy (Jesse Plemons) lives with his neurodivergent cousin Don (Aidan Delbis) tucked away in a house in a rural part of town. They both take up beekeeping as a hobby, and Teddy also works at an Amazon-style distribution center.

A theory has been festering inside Teddy‚Äîthat perhaps the people of Earth are not what they seem. He believes that a superior alien race, Andromedans, has secretly taken over and is both killing and ruling the planet with an iron fist. Thus, it is his and Don's job to save the planet they love from an undetected threat. Even though Teddy is made up, his ethos is not fictional; rather, he is a metaphor for the post-COVID echo chamber people were enmeshed with. 

In fact, many parts of Teddy's world are dying off. The town in which he and his cousin reside is worn and devoid of energy. The bees he attends to are starting to disappear, and his mother, Sandy (Alicia Silverstone), is in a coma due to an experimental trial medication gone wrong. Depictions of their last conversations and Teddy's pain are captured in abstract black-and-white flashbacks paired with Jerskin Fendrix's eerie score. While the film returns to regular color, Teddy's world doesn't. The home he and Don reside in might as well double as an emotional museum of artifacts from past generations. You can see they are the type of people, just by sheer circumstance, that would welcome podcasts named ‚ÄúTHE INVASION IS HERE‚Äù because something has to be at fault.

They direct their ire at Michelle (Emma Stone), the CEO of the pharmaceutical company Auxolith. (Lanthimos chooses to gender swap the character as one of a few deviations from Joon-hwan's film.) She's got the whole world in her hands, complete with her morning smoothie, expansive home, and boxing coach, before she heads into work. Little does Michelle know, her day is about to go south. After some difficulty, Teddy and Don kidnap the CEO and hold her hostage in their basement. Teddy implores Michelle to cut her hair (as he feels it's just a way to contact her mothership) and lathers her in antihistamine cream as another preventive measure.

It's there that ‚ÄúBugonia‚Äù settles into an adversarial dance between worker bees and the ‚Äúunruly‚Äù queen. There's a more personal connection at stake.  Michelle's company was in charge of developing the medication, which adversely affected Sandy. Michelle says it was in the spirit of moving toward a greater good, and Teddy is not convinced in the slightest. 

Lanthimos doesn't dress his thoughts in metaphors to what his remake is about. These are two different groups of people entrenched in worlds that have no interest in understanding one another. Much of the film's delight derives from seeing the verbal jousting between Stone and Plemons. Teddy is passionate, but there's something childlike about him that yearns for some reprieve. He and Don have very little and need to scratch and claw for the little they have. It's a little irrational to think that kidnapping a high-profile figure is the ill to solve their problems, but desperation mode wins out. Their hopes are pinned on boarding an alien spaceship during a lunar eclipse. 

Michelle uses corporate speak, where every detail feels like it's scrolling on a teleprompter. As ‚ÄúBugonia‚Äù goes on, you'll find out she's not as helpless as she appears. The CEO knows when to turn on the naivety and go for the jugular in an attempt to dress down Teddy's line of thinking. Yes, it is wild to think an alien race has us all under a live pitri dish. However, if they don't destroy us, humankind will do the job for them.

Ari Asher's ‚ÄúEddington‚Äù and Lanthimos's ‚ÄúBugonia‚Äù are looking at the rubble of post-2020's society and collectively wondering what the hell happened. In their own ways, both films are trying their hands at damage assessment. ‚ÄúEddington‚Äù explores the vampiric nature of social media and how it morphs a small New Mexico town. ‚ÄúBugonia‚Äù is a confined encounter between the haves and have-nots in a somewhat comedic but sad thriller. For Teddy, Don, and Michelle, no mediator is coming to help. Casey (Stavros Halkias), a local police officer, has an unsavory history with Teddy‚Äîan example of abuse of power by a pillar of hierarchy in Lanthimos's film. 

‚ÄúBugonia‚Äù doesn't definitely say which side is right, driving full speed into a bombastic, gloomy finale ‚Äì it merely presents how belief can look on both sides of the coin. Higher-ups believe their mission is above all else, without fully considering the fallout. Desperation spurns belief in the unfathomable, leaving those who deserve help at odds with morality. Perhaps the end won't come with a ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù style invasion, but because we are now far too alien to one another.

He has the surname, has just embarked on a nationwide tour to promote his memoir about life in the political spotlight, and won't rule anything out.

So is Eric Trump, the US president's second son and a recently (if briefly) minted billionaire, planning to step into the spotlight with a 2028 run for president?

For the first time, we have an idea of how it might go. A new poll reveals that although he has a fighting chance of winning the Republican nomination, he is far from being the heir to the Trump White House.

Donald Trump Jr, his rabble-rousing, podcasting elder brother, has a head start in taking over the family politics business.

JL Partners ran two polls. In the first, Eric, 41, would take 6 per cent of the Republican vote if the nomination battle were held today, trailing far behind JD Vance, on 41 per cent, as well as Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.

In the second, his name was taken out and replaced with his brother, Don Jr, who ranked second, with 14 per cent, even though he says he has ‚Äúzero interest‚Äù in running.

The numbers reflect their different lives since their father first took power in 2016.

Eric took over the Trump Organisation, masterminding the opening of a new golf course in Scotland this summer and travelling the world to pursue property and crypto deals.

In contrast, Don Jr entered the political arena. He built a huge following with his punchy social media presence and Triggered podcast, touring the country in support of Trump-endorsed candidates.

Yet Eric's profile has surged this year. He has made a series of high-profile appearances centred around cryptocurrency that saw him briefly crowned a billionaire by Forbes when his cryptomining venture went public.

Today, his wealth is estimated at about $750 million (¬£546 million), up from $40 million (¬£30 million) in 2024.

At the same time, his memoir, Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation, is at number one in the New York Times bestseller list.

The result is a corresponding surge in questions about whether he planned to succeed his father as president in 2029 when Donald Trump's two terms are up.

‚ÄúI'm not ruling it out,‚Äù he said in a recent interview with Nikkei Asia: ‚ÄúI'm not saying no, but I'm also not saying yes.‚Äù

It is part of a pattern that leaves the door open to a run, even as he continues to build his profile.

‚ÄúNever say never, but hopefully I can avoid the nightmare... of politics for a little while longer,‚Äù he said this week at a book event in South Carolina, according to the Greenville News.

Some have even floated the idea of a Trump-Trump ticket, with the two brothers joining forces with their complementary styles.

‚ÄúThink of it, you could have Eric at the top of the ticket as the chief executive, the businessman who would keep the markets onside, backed by a running mate who would inspire the Maga movement,‚Äù said an attendee at the recent National Conservatism conference in Washington, DC.

‚ÄúThen you have Lara as well. Two for the price of one.‚Äù

Lara Trump chaired the Republican National Committee during the 2024 presidential campaign, winning plaudits for her fundraising prowess.

She is frequently linked with vacant Senate seats and has floated a return to politics ‚Äî if family life will allow it.

It sets the field up for an intriguing race to replace the president at the top of the ticket, unless Mr Trump makes good on his norm-busting hints that he might run for a third term.

James Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners, said the race is Mr Vance's to lose.

However, a lot could change during the next two years, and the president's endorsement would be crucial, he added.

‚ÄúThis is a race that JD Vance still has a rock-solid hold on. He's seen a small dip, but this is close to being within the margin of error ‚Äì no other candidate makes double digits, with Marco Rubio in a distant second place,‚Äù he said.

Mr Vance has dropped six points since the question was last polled in July.

Other big contenders from 2024, such as Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur who briefly worked alongside Elon Musk at the Department of Government Efficiency, are barely registering with Republican voters.

‚ÄúAs always, though, Trump reigns supreme: His intervention in this race is going to be the thing that makes all the difference,‚Äù said Mr Johnson.

TOPLINE:

Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems lowered A1c levels and increased percentage of time in range in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), regardless of C‚Äëpeptide level, a secondary analysis of a clinical trial showed.

‚ÄúA benefit of AID is present with high C-peptide levels and low C-peptide levels. Thus, requiring a low C-peptide level as a prerequisite for AID therapy is not warranted,‚Äù the authors wrote.

The study was led by Irl B. Hirsch, University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. It was published online in Diabetes Care.

C-peptide levels were not necessarily measured in participants who were fasting. The number of participants in the low C-peptide subgroup was relatively small. The trial duration was limited to 13 weeks. 

The study received funding and AID systems from Tandem Diabetes Care. One author declared being an employee and shareholder of Tandem Diabetes Care. Other authors reported receiving grants and other payments from several pharmaceutical companies including the funding agency; these payments were made either to the authors or to their employers.
