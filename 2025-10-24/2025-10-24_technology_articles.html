                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the badlands of Wyoming lies the “mummy zone.” This section of rocks dating back to the Cretaceous Period has produced several strikingly well-preserved dinosaur specimens over the last century, and now, scientists have used two of them to definitively determine what one long-lost species looked like. The fossils were remarkably preserved, still showing fine details of scales and hooves 66 million years after these animals walked the Earth. Decades later, Serrano and his colleagues used historical photos and field sleuthing to map the area, dubbing it the “mummy zone.” In 2000 and 2001, they excavated two E. annectens mummies—a late juvenile and an early adult—with large portions of their external skin surface still preserved. Unlike human mummies found in Egyptian tombs, however, the skin, spikes, and hooves of these dino mummies were preserved not as tissue but as an extremely thin clay film that formed on the carcass. Using a variety of imaging techniques and observations of the discovery site, he and his team figured out exactly how this preservation process—called clay templating—occurred. Soon after these two dinosaurs perished, a flash flood struck, burying their bodies in sediment. This covered the bodies in a clay mask no more than 0.01 inches (0.02 centimeters) thick, creating a 3D cast of their true surface. The two E. annectens mummies allowed the researchers to reconstruct the species' living appearance, determining that it had a fleshy crest along its neck and back that turned into a single row of tail spikes. Its thin skin was mostly covered with small pebble-like scales. “There are so many amazing ‘firsts' preserved in these duck-billed mummies—the earliest hooves documented in a land vertebrate, the first confirmed hooved reptile, and the first hooved four-legged animal with different forelimb and hindlimb posture,” Sereno said. This work “tells a coherent story about how these remarkable fossils come to be and what we can learn from them,” Sereno said. As researchers continue to explore the mummy zone, there's no telling what new discoveries await them. It's “an important reminder that evolutionary paths can be unpredictable.” Rock layers deposited before and after the major dinosaur extinction event 65 million years ago are surprisingly different. The amber fossils preserve an impressive array of ancient bugs and plants that scientists are using to piece together a previously unknown Cretaceous ecosystem. A revisit to a pterosaur-abundant fossil site uncovered how two baby pterosaurs met an unusually chilling death 150 million years ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instagram announced on Friday that it will now let you go back and see your previously watched Reels thanks to a new “Watch History” feature. For example, you could be watching an interesting Reel and then receive a phone call, or accidentally close the app while watching, or get distracted by something else and lose your place in the Reels feed. “Well, there is a new feature that should help. Just like on TikTok, you can sort your Watch History by date, the past week or month, or a specific date range. Instagram's Watch History offers a bit more flexibility when compared to TikTok's, as you can sort videos in chronological or reverse chronological order, or by author. Instagram says the feature was highly requested among users. Before this, users had found workarounds to recover lost videos, such as downloading their data from the app and sifting through it to retrieve their watch history. Plus, it brings the Instagram Reels viewing experience on par with TikTok's. Since its launch as a TikTok clone, Meta has been building out Instagram Reels with features that are already available on the popular short-form app. Most recently, Instagram started allowing creators to connect multiple reels in a series and launched support for Picture-in-Picture viewing, both of which are already available on TikTok.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two years ago, former SpaceX engineers used rocket tech to develop a power plant capable of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, with a small asterisk. The shift happened this year as electricity demand from data centers has boomed. The existing design was fully capable of powering AI servers, but its reach would be limited by sources of wood and agricultural waste. Arbor still plans to capture CO2 from the power plant, which uses oxy-combustion, which transforms hydrocarbons into syngas and then burns it in the presence of pure oxygen. The result is CO2 that doesn't need much preparation for sequestration. The company does not plan to sell its technology to businesses that don't plan on capturing the carbon for use or sequestration, he said. But waste CO2 isn't the only climate consideration when it comes to burning natural gas. The main component of natural gas is methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas that generates 84 times more warming than carbon dioxide over 20 years. Because of that, any leaks in the natural gas supply chain can have an outsized effect on the climate impact of a natural gas-fired power plant. That plant is being funded in part by a $41 million deal with Frontier, the advanced market commitment backed by Stripe, Google, and others. Under that agreement, Arbor must remove 116,000 tons of carbon dioxide by 2030. Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

The CyberPower PC Gamer Xtreme offers strong 1080p performance at a reasonable price. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. CyberPowerPC attempts to be all things to all people with systems aimed at gamers on a low budget and players with deep pockets. Our Gamer Xtreme review unit definitely skews to the budget end of the spectrum with a price tag of just $1,099. Throw in a stylish case and RGB lighting galore, and you'll see that CyberPowerPC aims to please people on a budget with the Gamer Xtreme. It's an interesting design constructed of black-painted stainless steel with a glass front and a glass side panel to give you an unobstructed view of the system's interior components. There's also plenty of ventilation, with a grill on the right-side panel for three vertically-mounted 120mm RGB fans. The top panel also includes ventilation, with support for another three 120 mm fans or a 360 mm radiator (although our review unit didn't have the additional fans) and a removable dust filter. MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Shadow 2X OC (8GB GDDR7, 2,527 MHz boost clock) On the top of the case, starting from the front, you'll find the power button, reset button, a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, two USB-A 3.0 ports, an RGB mode button, and an RGB color button.The rear I/O panel is home to one DisplayPort, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2, four USB-A 2.0, four USB-A 5 Gbps, one USB-A 10 Gbps, 2.5 GbE, two antenna ports for the onboard Wi-Fi 6 module, and three audio jacks. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. CyberPowerPC opted for an Asus B860M Max Gaming AX motherboard for the Gamer Xtreme, which uses Intel's B860M chipset and supports Intel LGA1851 processors. In our review unit, the socket was populated with a Core Ultra 5 225F processor. The motherboard features four DIMM slots, supporting a maximum of 256GB DDR5 memory. Our review unit featured two slots filled with 16GB Team Group T-Force Vulcan DDR5-6400 modules. For additional storage you can mount HDDs and SSDs to a vertical bracket behind the right-side panel (beneath the motherboard). Our Gamer Xtreme review unit came with an Intel Core Ultra 5 225F "Arrow Lake" processor, which is a 10-core design (6 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores) with a base clock of 3.3 GHz and a maximum turbo clock of 4.9 GHz. You also get 32GB of DDR5-6400 memory and an MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Shadow 2X OC (8GB) with a maximum graphics clock of 2,527 MHz. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme is equipped with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 32GB of DDR5-6000, and an RTX 5060 Ti. I've been playing through Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in my downtime and averaged between 120 to 145 frames per second (FPS) at 1080p using Ultra settings. Beginning with Shadow of the Tomb Raider (Highest settings), the Gamer Xtreme delivered 128 FPS at 1080p and 39 FPS at 4K. The Gamer Supreme, with its RTX 5060 Ti, was able to improve on those numbers, garnering 149 FPS and 46 FPS, respectively. Cyberpunk 2077 (Ray Tracing Ultra settings) shows no mercy when it comes to graphics hardware demands, as the Gamer Xtreme could only extract 39 FPS at 1080p. Cranking the slider to 4K turned things into a slideshow, at just 2 FPS. Far Cry 6 (Ultra settings), is another veteran of our gaming benchmark suite, and here the Gamer Xtreme pulled 109 FPS at 1080p and a playable 50 FPS at 4K. Red Dead Redemption 2 (Medium settings), is still one of the most beautiful PC games I've ever played, even six years after its release. The Core Ultra 5 225F is no match for the Ryzen processors in CPU-intensive games or higher-spec RTX 50 Series graphics cards at 4K resolution. Metro Exodus is our go-to resource for gaming PC stress tests, and we used a 15-run loop on the Gamer Xtreme. The RTX 5060 averaged 2.45 GHz at an average temperature of 69 C. Fan noise from the 120mm CPU cooler is loud, even at idle. Unlike the gentle hum that you'll get with AIO coolers, the Gamer Xtreme's air cooler can get a bit irritating if all you're trying to do is browse the internet or write a document. Not all air coolers are this loud, so CyberPower's fan choice here is a bit curious. The Gamer Xtreme features a Core Ultra 5 225F processor (6 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores), 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. For comparison, the Gamer Xtreme with its raucous Ryzen 7 9800X3D hit 3,335 and 18,601, respectively. When we transcode our 4K video test file to 1080p, the Gamer Xtreme took four minutes and 27 seconds, compared to just two minutes and 58 seconds for the Gamer Supreme. It's nothing that I would have purchased for my personal use, but as a pack-in with a gaming desktop, it's quite good. The NOHI 2 keyboard has multi-colored RGB lighting effects and relatively good tactile typing. There are flip-out feet to adjust your typing angle and you can cycle through the different lighting modes using the FN key plus numbers 1 through 0. Using the keyhero.com typing test, I averaged 90 words per minute with 95.67 percent accuracy. A CyberPowerPC Elite M2 RGB gaming mouse is included, but it's a little on the small side for my tastes and designed for right-handed folks. The mouse has six buttons (including two on the side and a top button that by default controls DPI). There's nothing particularly outstanding about the mouse and it works “just fine.” I can gladly say that CyberPowerPC doesn't include any extraneous software or utilities on the Gamer Xtreme. Instead, you get a bone stock install of Windows 11 Home, which is great news for gamers who want zero bloat to contend with first booting up the system. Systems purchased directly from CyberPowerPC.com come with a three-year labor and two-year parts warranty. Our particular system, which is available exclusively from Costco, comes with a two-year warranty. Our Gamer Xtreme review unit (Model GXi2000CSTV3) is a Costco exclusive, and features an Intel Core Ultra 5 225F processor, MSI GeForce RTX 5060 Shadow 2X OC graphics card, 32GB of Team Group T-Force Vulcan DDR5-6400 (2x 16GB) RAM, a 2TB SSD, and Windows 11 Home. You get quite a bit for your $1,099.99with the CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme. You get 32GB of RAM and a generous 2TB SSD for installing your favorite AAA games. You also get niceties like a roomy case with plenty of cooling and RGB vividness, standard Wi-Fi (albeit the older Wi-Fi 6 standard), and a bloat-free install of Windows 11. At this price point, it's hard to find fault with the Gamer Xtreme, other than the grating sound from its CPU cooler, which is loud even at idle, and only gets louder when you start gaming. If CyberPowerPC could swap out the air-cooled solution for one with a quieter fan or AIO unit and bump the price slightly, it'd have a real winner here.

The company canceled its planned third quarter earnings call on Friday. “We do not yet have an estimate of the financial impact of the operational disruption on our fourth quarter results,” Alaska said in a regulatory filing. The company reported revenue of $3.8 billion, up 1.4% year-over-year, while profit dropped 69% to $123 million.

I had never heard of this before, and I find the idea absolutely delightful.  As I understand it, the "knots" are stable vortices in the aether. It was popular from 1870 - 1890, and it blows my mind that only a few years later the electron was discovered (1897), and less than 50 years later (1938), the scanning electron microscope was invented!  1955 was when the atom was first imaged.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_theory_of_the_atom

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Tim Chen tried to break into venture capital six years ago, multiple firms in Seattle turned him down. “Nobody wanted to hire me,” he recalled in an interview with GeekWire. Chen, a University of Washington graduate and infrastructure engineer who had just sold a startup, decided to launch his own firm. Six years later, Chen's investors — known as limited partners, or LPs — line up to give him money before he even opens a pitch deck. Chen recently raised $41 million for a fourth fund at Essence VC, his venture firm that backs infrastructure startups. His LPs include institutional investors such as Andreessen Horowitz's Martin Casado and Cendana Capital's Michael Kim. Chen used AngelList to raise $1 million for his first fund in 2019, focusing on developer tools and infrastructure — categories he knew inside out. What started as rejection has become a calling for Chen — and an unconventional venture capital success story. After studying computer science at the UW, Chen worked at Microsoft and VMware, helped launch open-source cloud startup Mesosphere, and later founded Hyperpilot, an “AIOps” company acquired by Cloudera. Chen's experience as a software engineer and operator has become his edge in VC — especially amid the AI boom. He's able to make faster decisions and gain respect from founders. “From a founder perspective, this let me trust that he actually believed in what we were doing and was coming to his decisions on his own.” Seattle entrepreneur Patrick Thompson raised capital from Chen twice — with his previous startup Iteratively, which was acquired, and his current company Clarify. “He's one of the most technically-minded people, but also super humble and easy to work with,” Thompson said. The combination of engineering depth and empathy has helped Chen win competitive early-stage deals. “I'm looking for people that have a deep enough background, with high intensity, and huge flexibility on learning,” he said. LPs ask Chen why he hasn't moved to the Bay Area yet. Chen is staying in Seattle, where he's lived since high school. He believes Seattle's tech scene is under-networked but brimming with talent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Fantastic Four: First Steps was released earlier this summer and now, io9 can exclusively reveal that it's coming to Disney+ on November 5. That's right, in less than two short weeks, Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach will bring their stretching, invisible, burning, and rocky selves to the streamer. The news will be made official later today at an event called SpaceCon in San Antonio, Texas, but we figured we'd give you a little preview. Fantastic Four will also be “the latest film available in IMAX Enhanced on Disney+, featuring IMAX's exclusive expanded aspect ratio for all Disney+ subscribers, ensuring that the filmmakers' creative intent is fully preserved for a more immersive viewing experience at home. Subscribers with certified TVs and AV receivers can also experience IMAX Enhanced sound powered by DTS:X.” In addition to the news, io9 is happy to debut this brand-new featurette with the entire cast, which includes Julia Garner and Ralph Ineson, talking about what makes the perfect Fantastic Four movie night. One that, even before it was released, was already tying into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to Thunderbolts. And then, of course, this film also ends with a tease of what Sue and Reed's child could become, especially with a certain Doctor Doom noticing. We'll find out in a little over a year when the whole crew returns in Avengers: Doomsday. So, again, The Fantastic Four: First Steps is coming to Disney+ on November 5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite billions spent on generative AI, most enterprises still fail to see measurable ROI. Experts say storage, scalability, and performance bottlenecks are holding back enterprise AI from moving beyond pilot projects into profit-driving production. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study found that despite U.S. companies investing an estimated $30–40 billion into generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), 95% have seen no measurable return, with only 5% successfully deploying tools at scale. A key finding revealed that a vast chasm exists between a small group of companies that extract millions of dollars in value from AI and the vast majority, which have zero measurable impact on their profit and loss statements. Only 5% of over 300 public implementations successfully scale to production with a measurable impact. Flawed enterprise integration, not the quality of the AI models themselves, results from tools that fail to learn from feedback and are not well-integrated into daily operations. Another contributing factor to the low ROI results is that employees are using “shadow AI economy” tools, such as ChatGPT, independently. A further reason for failure is mismatched priorities when allocating AI budgets. Sales and marketing receive roughly 50% of the funding, even though back-office automation is more likely to yield significant, measurable returns. The ROI failure extends across all corporate layers, according to Björn Kolbeck, CEO and co-founder of Quobyte. He noted that some come from products forced onto users by CEOs or half-baked “AI features.” On the technical side, models are often delayed or undertrained due to weak infrastructure, with storage frequently being the primary bottleneck. “All suffer if you can't feed GPUs at scale — [in terms of] memory, adaptability, and integration,” he told TechNewsWorld. Kolbeck sees companies investing billions while overlooking adequate storage to support their AI infrastructure as one of the major mistakes corporations make. He said that oversight leads to three key failure factors — festering silos, lack of performance, and uptime dilemmas. The most critical resource for AI is data training. “Storage systems must be able to scale and provide unified access to enable an AI data lake, a centralized and efficient storage for the entire company,” he observed. This causes expensive resources to sit idle, frustrates data scientists, and delays projects. “Similarly, when storage solutions aren't built for maximum performance and availability – like many HPC storage systems – you end up with the same problem: delayed projects,” he warned. The MIT report noted that successful AI deployments integrate at scale. Kolbeck explained the difference between scale-out architecture versus a scale-up approach as a better option for handling the massive and unpredictable data demands of modern AI and ML. “The storage needs to keep up with this horizontal scaling. AI workflows involve a mix of small and large files. “Developing and training AI technology is still a very experimental process and requires the infrastructure — including storage — to adapt quickly when data scientists develop new ideas,” Kolbeck noted. Quobyte's policy-based data management engine rapidly adapts to changing business, user, and workload requirements, providing complete control. Kolbeck described traditional enterprise storage as built around 30-year-old technology, including the NFS protocol, which Sun Microsystems designed in 1984. This old-school approach cannot keep up with the scale-out requirements of AI. The company's software-defined storage system applies distributed systems algorithms to deliver reliable performance on commodity servers, scaling seamlessly from a handful of machines to entire data centers.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA) chairman and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) senior vice president and co-COO Cliff Hou said during a question-and-answer session that TSMC has enough rare-earth supply from its sources that it is not concerned about the short-term direct impact of any rare-earth export controls from China. Digitimes reports that TSIA has been monitoring the situation and that it does not expect any significant impact within the next couple of years. However, the primary issue lies in the transition to suppliers from Australia and other regions, should China completely stop rare-earth exports, which he says will take time. However, the limited infrastructure required to extract and refine them is what makes them quite difficult to attain, with China owning over 85% of global processing capacity. The country has used this advantage in global trade negotiations, with Beijing declaring in 2024 that all its rare earth resources are now state-owned. It then banned some rare earth exports in April 2025, when President Donald Trump announced his far-reaching tariffs on all imports into the United States. All this instability had the semiconductor industry reeling, especially as it affects chips that are 14nm and smaller or those that have more than 256 layers. There are other sources of rare-earth minerals, but they lag sorely behind China in output. As for processing and refining, Malaysia hosts the largest non-Chinese refining facility in the Lynas Advanced Materials Plant, owned by the Australian Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. Incidentally, China has also been in talks with Kuala Lumpur, offering it assistance to develop so that it can tap its own rare earth reserves, which some estimates say are worth approximately $175 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For regular school, I've grown more skeptical, because it didn't work well for either of my kids. One switched to special education during primary school and is doing excellent there (but that has much more guidance and costs more, though I wish it was available for everybody), the other switched to a regular school during secondary school after almost failing to pass year after year despite his extraordinary intelligence. He's doing somewhat better now.It's a good option to have, but it's quite likely the advantage is bigger for preschool than school.

I compared Montessori and non Montessori labeled daycares/preschools for my 3 and 4 year olds, and was unable to discern a meaningful difference in the course of the day.Edit:  I ended up going with the daycare that had cameras (so that at least management could audit employees), and a livestream for the parents, which was at a non Montessori daycare. Was more expensive, but have been happy with results.

Once I asked some advocate of the method, what was it exactly; the reply was very good and detailed, but then I pointed out institutes that “follow” the method, which were nothing as what he described. “Well, you must not absolutely do it that way” “there are variations” etc. The difference between these two, from my experience, is HUGE. Certified AMI schools, while a little more rigid in terms of teaching fine motor skills, generally have been better at making my kid more independent at doing things he likes to do.</p>

With the price and quality of laptops these days, it can be difficult to recommend prebuilt desktop PCs—especially when they aren't focused on gaming. The Dell Tower Plus straddles the line, offering strong performance in a more modern, office-friendly aesthetic. It's not flashy, but tasteful compared to competition like the Lenovo IdeaCentre Tower. I've always liked Dell's simple latch system for removing the panel and getting into your system. There's a single screw to loosen on the back, and that lets you pop off the side panel. Inside, you'll find a fairly roomy setup. There are removable plastic brackets on either side of the GPU. The slim, 750-watt power supply is held in place by a metal bracket with two screws, but the graphics card is simple to swap. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The real benefit is being able to swap it out in future generations of Nvidia graphics cards. For future-proofing purposes, you can always configure it with a 1,000-watt power supply, which Dell charges an extra $50 for. The CPU cooler is a passive, tower heat sink. Once you get the GPU out of the way, this would be fairly simple to swap out for something more powerful, but it certainly keeps things quiet. CPU temperatures are decent, averaging 83 degrees Celsius under full load, only spiking up to a max of 96 degrees in bursts. The balance here is weighted more toward quieter operation, which is important in a system designed for work. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The inclusion of a headphone jack and an SD card slot is also super convenient. On the back, you'll find your usual assortment of ports, including one more USB-C port. That should cover all the bases, depending on what peripherals and accessories you use. For versions of the PC without discrete graphics, you now get HDMI 2.0 and a USB-C Thunderbolt 4 port, which lets you connect up to two 4K displays. You also have the usual assortment of four USB-A ports, an Ethernet jack, stereo audio ports, and a Kensington lock. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Dell Tower Plus doesn't exactly use off-the-shelf parts, but it does give you fairly good upgradability, which is one of the main reasons for buying a desktop in the first place. As for extra expansion, there are two overhead empty storage bays for 3.5-inch SATA hard drives, as well as an extra M.2 for an additional SSD. There are two DIMM slots, which will allow you to pack up to 64 GB of DDR5 memory, if your heart so desires. My review unit came with two sticks of DDR5 RAM, 16 GB each, as well as a single-terabyte M.2 SSD. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Adding or replacing these components is fairly straightforward, and there are even some instructions printed on the inside of the side panel. No, it's not the Framework Desktop in terms of ease of use, but there's a lot more space for your hands when tinkering with components or troubleshooting something. This isn't a system inherently made for true DIYers. The custom motherboard makes upgrading the motherboard or CPU more difficult, but for the basics, Dell has done a good job of giving you a foundation you can build on. My review unit is one of the more powerful configurations, with both the unlocked Intel Core Ultra 7 265K and RTX 5070. (You can upgrade to the Core Ultra 9 285K and RTX 5080.) The cheapest is $800 for Intel graphics, but it doesn't make much sense to buy that when you can get a Dell 14 Plus laptop with better specs for less money, especially given the added benefit of the display and portability. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I've seen discounts dropping the RTX 5070 configuration down to $1,050. If you can nab it at that price, that's a really strong value for an RTX 5070 desktop. This isn't our favorite GPU in the RTX 50 series, and if you aren't using any upscaling, you'll get the best frame rates if you stick to 1080p or possibly 1440p, depending on the type of game. 4K is possible, but only once you start tweaking settings and using some upscaling. For example, in Cyberpunk 2077, you can get 74 frames per second in 4K resolution at Ultra settings, but only if you set the DLSS upscaling to the “Balanced” preset. You can even crank it up to the path-traced RT Overdrive setting, so long as you drop the resolution to 1080p and keep DLSS at Balanced. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. In a lighter game like Marvel Rivals, I was able to average around 75 frames per second in 4K without upscaling at all at High settings, or in 1440p at Ultra. But if you really want those fast frame rates (over 100 frames per second) for twitchy competitive games, you'll be playing either in 1080p or using upscaling. Neither of those is a bad solution necessarily, but I could see it being disappointing performance for your brand-new, fairly large desktop. Either way, performance in the Dell Tower Plus feels within the ballpark of what you'd get in a gaming desktop at this price, so you're not making a substantial sacrifice by sticking with something more work-friendly. Gaming is not this PC's primary use case, but it's a good example of just what the Dell Tower Plus can do. A designer, video editor, music producer, or anyone who runs fairly heavy software for work will appreciate the combination of the RTX 5070 and Core Ultra 265K. There's a lot to like about the Dell Tower Plus. (Even though there's not much new here over the previous Dell XPS Tower, outside of a name change.) The updated Intel CPU and Nvidia graphics are both appreciated, especially since some manufacturers are slow to keep these lower-profile systems up to date.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not long into his new documentary, Oobah Butler tells the cofounder of his newly minted company, Drops, that they should create a piece of luxury luggage that “looks like a bomb” and will sell for $200,000. Butler is a British prankster documentarian who is known for his stunts, like managing to get Amazon to sell its drivers' urine as energy drinks or creating a fake restaurant called the Shed and gaming TripAdvisor to make it the top-rated London restaurant on the platform. Set in London and New York, it takes on the worlds of startups, venture capital, crypto, and what ultimately comes across as a lot of bullshitting, in the name of striking it rich quick. Butler opens the film by saying, as someone who didn't grow up with money and isn't particularly motivated by it, he's fascinated by the fact that people “idolize” wealthy entrepreneurs. “It came from a place of wanting to understand why ... everyone is so obsessed with money in this way,” he tells WIRED. I'm talking about ... being addicted to the making of money.” His only rules for getting £1 million ($1.3 million USD) are that he's not allowed to break the law and whatever costs he incurs trying to make it are his to bear. He employs several strategies to rack up the cash, including simply asking rich people for it (this doesn't go well) and creating hype for crypto company UNFK by doing things like tricking bankers into committing crimes on camera. He also creates Drops, a company that makes news for its controversial stunts and then tries to capitalize on the attention by selling “very overpriced” items. Butler seeks the advice of Venmo cofounder Iqram Magdon-Ismail, who quickly declares himself Butler's cofounder on Drops and seems very enthusiastic at first, musing that the company is already “worth at least $10 million” just because the two of them are attached to it, and that they might be able sell out Madison Square Garden in a year's time to tell their story. Butler then embarks on a memecoin adventure that goes south, before coming back to Drops and launching the “first legal child sweatshop in Britain in over a century.” He finds a loophole to avoid paying the child workers, reasoning that because he is filming the kids for the documentary, they are technically performers. His underage staff help him come up with marketing ideas to sell bespoke soccer jerseys featuring a fake religious cigarette brand called Holy Smokes. Though the clothing line gets coverage in GQ, Butler doesn't sell anything close to £1 million worth of jerseys. There are more ups and downs, culminating in a reunion with Magdon-Ismail as Butler is still short of his goal and running out of time. So Magdon-Ismail introduces Butler to a group of investors where Butler tries to auction off himself—or more specifically, a 10 percent stake in him for the rest of his life—for £1 million. (“What if he gets hit by a car tomorrow?” one potential investor asks in earnest.) While hilarious, the documentary is an eye-opening commentary on the house of cards many modern business ventures seem to be built on. It's also a study of society's obsession with getting rich, which has only blossomed with the rise of influencer and manosphere-led self-help advice. WIRED asked Butler what he learned from doing business with 1 percenters, if he feels compelled by hustle culture, and how he keeps convincing people to be a party to his ridiculous hijinks. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Oobah Butler: It was coming as a result of being bombarded with hustle culture. I understand we're at a point where people are really struggling to find any of the things that provide them with security and an easier life. It's almost like an addictive mindset that somehow makes you feel like you're actively doing something, but it's not actually effective. I moved from London to New York during the film. The way that people talk about money here, the way that people pursue money here, it's a lot more open and a lot more, in some ways, grotesque. Most industries are ruled by people who went to the same schools or are from a certain set of families. There's something that I learned in a film ... which is this idea of, no matter what experience you go through, and how the reality of it is way more complicated, [still] selling it as this massive win. There's almost a shamelessness and an indefatigable nature of these people. Jordan Belfort went to prison for fraud and fucked a load of people over. There's something very New York about, like, doing white-collar crime and then just rolling back out and just starting again. With respect to some of these ideas, like the first legal child sweatshop, the suitcase that looks like a bomb. I thought that would be a good idea. And it basically led to him fucking completely ghosting me. Everything he says is, like, let's make a dope-ass Shopify for creators. And you know, he's a proper business guy. Do you find it intimidating to be around super wealthy people? My great grandmother was a servant at the local hall, like the Downton Abbey of where we grew up. I've always been around people who are quite posh and quite rich, even though we grew up working class. So I quite like cosplaying as a different class. The thing that I didn't want to do was make a film about crypto. Seems like you can kind of do anything you want in this space without any fear of any consequence. Initially you think, oh OK, so this is a bit odd. But then you think, well, I can have a million tomorrow and I don't immediately have to give anything away. But yeah, being on stage and having a room full of private equity people and venture capitalists and stuff discussing the life insurance policy they want to take on you is not the greatest. I just think the excitement of being around potentiality is addictive. But to be honest, after this project, I was massively burnt out.
