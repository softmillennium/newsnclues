South Africa and Nigeria were taken off a global watchdog's dirty-money list, providing a fillip for increased remittances and foreign investment in two of Africa's largest economies. 

The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force on Friday said the countries — along with Mozambique and Burkina Faso — are no longer on the list of jurisdictions subject to increased monitoring, after their governments stepped up efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT – General Motors laid off more than 200 salaried employees on Friday, as the automaker continues to reevaluate its businesses and cut costs to boost profits. The impacted employees were largely Computer-Aided Design, or CAD, engineers who worked at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit, according to GM. "We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities," GM said in an emailed statement. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions." GM declined to comment on the number of employees affected, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it was more than 200 employees, which was first reported by Bloomberg News. The employees were told their roles were being eliminated due to "business conditions" and not their performance via Microsoft Teams calls on Friday, the source said. The Detroit automaker has been regularly reviewing its business units and organizations for years in an effort to cut costs, boost profits and eliminate what it considers unneeded or overstaffed roles for future operations. The most recent layoffs represent a small percentage of the automaker's salaried workforce, but continue a trend of white-collar U.S. headcount reductions. GM's layoffs also come a day after all-electric vehicle maker Rivian laid off roughly 4.5% of its workforce, or more than 600 people, to restructure some teams as the EV market faces growing challenges amid policy changes and slower-than-expected demand. The most recent cuts come as President Donald Trump touted on social media Friday that Ford Motor and GM are "UP BIG on Tariffs" amid tariff changes last week for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which he referred to as "Big and Midsized Trucks." While both Ford and GM, including CEO Mary Barra, this week praised the tariff changes, which also included extending offsets on U.S.-produced vehicles, the automakers are still seeing additional cost burdens from the levies. These changes are simply helping to lower those added costs. The layoffs come days after GM raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday as it beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, causing the stock to have its second-best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy. Shares of GM are up more than 29% this year, while Ford's stock is up roughly 38%. Both hit new 52-week highs on Friday. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

America's retirees will get an extra $56 in their wallets monthly, as Social Security checks adjust to keep up with rising prices. Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment, which is tied to a key inflation measure, will be 2.8% for 2026. That will shake out to an additional $56 a month for nearly 71 million beneficiaries starting in January, according to the Social Security Administration, with Supplemental Security Income recipients getting their beefed-up checks starting at the end of December. "Social Security is a promise kept, and the annual cost-of-living adjustment is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security," Frank Bisignano, the Social Security Administration commissioner, said in a release. The cost-of-living adjustment skyrocketed to 8.7% in 2022 for 2023, when inflation was much higher than it has been. The Bureau of Labor Statistics didn't publish its September jobs report earlier this month because of the ongoing government shutdown, and it has yet to be released. "No other releases will be rescheduled or produced until the resumption of regular government services," the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in an October 10 statement. While older Americans can take some solace knowing that their payments should proceed on time — and with requisite increases — other social safety net programs are floundering during the shutdown, which could cause ripple effects. Some states have warned that they'll need to pause distributing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in November, meaning that many low-income Americans may struggle to afford groceries with smaller or nonexistent monthly checks. That could mean even the 2.8% increase may not be enough for some: An AARP survey of 1,001 American adults ages 50 and up, conducted between September 18 and 23, found that 77% disagreed that a COLA of around 3% would be enough to keep up with rising prices. Are you a retiree looking forward to the Social Security increase?</p>

President Donald Trump said late last night that he is ending all U.S. trade negotiations with Canada over an ad aired by Ontario's provincial government featuring the voice of former President Ronald Reagan. In the ad, Reagan is heard speaking negatively about tariffs and their impact on Americans. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said the ad misrepresents Reagan's 1987 remarks, which it said were edited without permission. After a nine-day delay thanks to the ongoing government shutdown, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release September's consumer price index report this morning. The index, which tracks a broad basket of goods and services, is closely followed by both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve as a gauge of inflation. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs, its first major layoffs in a decade. The retailer will lay off about 1,000 employees and cut 800 open positions, a company spokesperson told CNBC's Melissa Repko. The cuts also come as incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke prepares to take the reigns from Brian Cornell next year. Ford Motor sped past Wall Street's expectations on both lines for the third quarter. Investors took the results well, with shares jumping more than 4% in extended trading. However, the automaker slashed its full-year outlook, citing the impact of a fire at one of its aluminum suppliers in New York. Ford said the fire, which has hampered production of its large trucks and SUVs, is expected to cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. Elsewhere in the auto industry, electric vehicle maker Rivian told employees it is laying off about 4.5% of its workforce. A source confirmed to CNBC's Michael Wayland that more than 600 jobs will be cut. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups were arrested yesterday in connection with bombshell gambling investigations. The NBA said Rozier and Billups have been placed on immediate leave and that the league has been cooperating with authorities. An indictment criminally charging former NBA player Damon Jones — who was also arrested Thursday — suggests that he leaked information to bettors about LeBron James and Anthony Davis while affiliated with the Los Angeles Lakers. A person familiar told CNBC that James was not aware that his information was being shared for betting. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Michael Wayland, Alex Sherman, Dan Mangan, Kevin Breuninger and Melissa Repko contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's largest private oil refiner Reliance Industries is reportedly halting purchases of Russian crude, following the U.S.' decision to sanction Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Reliance has become a major buyer of Russian crude. Reliance has not responded to CNBC requests for comment on reports that it is stopping the purchase of Russian crude. It comes as the U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday levied sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's "lack of serious commitment" to ending the war in Ukraine. If Reliance does halt Russian purchases, it will have "negative impacts on [Reliance's] margin and profitability as Russian crude constitute more than 50% of [its] crude diet," Pankaj Srivastava, SVP of commodity oil markets at market research firm Rystad Energy said in emailed comments. He added that the availability of "similar crude is not an issue" and can be sourced from West Asia, Brazil, or Guyana, but Reliance is unlikely to get the same price as it does on Russian crude, as it has long-term deals with suppliers like Rosneft. Last December, Reliance Industries signed a deal to import crude oil worth $12 billion-$13 billion a year from Russia's Rosneft for 10 years, which would translate to roughly 500,000 barrels per day, according to a report by Reuters. The purchase of Russian oil by Indian refiners was "opportunistic buying" driven by discounts versus comparable grades, said Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights. India bought 38% of Russia's crude exports in September, second only to China at 47% according to Helsinki-based think tank Centre for Energy and Clean Air. Hari added that Indian refineries can easily pivot to buying from sources with the trade-off being "pressure on refining margins." Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler, said the Indian refining giant might face some short-term issues as it looks to replace the Russian crude. "Given the large volumes under the Reliance-Rosneft deal, we expect some short-term friction for Reliance in securing replacement barrels," says Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler. She added that "Russia's medium-sour Urals remains about $5–6/bbl [barrel] cheaper than Middle Eastern crude of similar quality. A report by Jefferies last month indicated that the impact of Reliance Industries moving away from Russian oil was "manageable." The brokerage said in September that it had received queries from investors about the possible financial impact on Reliance if it halts its imports of Russian oil due to sanctions. Reliance's consolidated EBITDA for the six months of fiscal year 2026 was 1.08 trillion Indian rupees ($12.3 billion), of which 295 billion rupees were from its oil-to-chemicals segment, while its telecom and retail ventures together contributed to nearly 500 billion rupees. Other Indian refiners are also looking to cut imports of Russian oil. Weaning off Russian oil might raise India's import bill, but it won't be "as big a sticker shock as [it] might have been if crude was in the $70 or $80 range," said Hari of Vanda Insights. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were trading around $61.83 a barrel on Friday. According to Natixis' Senior Economist Trinh Nguyen, the arbitrage that Russian oil offered during the energy crisis has tapered off, and there is no need for India now to have significant purchases of Russian oil.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kay Richards, a woman in her 60s, who lives in Manassas, Virginia. When my husband and I moved into our home over a decade ago, there were no data centers to be found. It was just an idyllic little neighborhood full of trees. Today, there are 14 data centers within a mile radius of our home, belonging to various companies. The constant buzzing and smell of what I believe is diesel make it hard for me to even go in my backyard. It's disheartening to see our community transformed by these industrial warehouses, but we're not going anywhere. Amazon was one of the first to start building its data center in our immediate area several years ago, and it's still the closest one to us. The company tore down so many trees to build what looks like an industrial park — rows and rows of one-story concrete boxes. There's a small buffer of green space, about two blocks, between our backyard and the data center, but we sit directly in its line of fire. At night, I can see its lights through my windows. The whole back of our house used to be filled with green space, and it was really beautiful. Thank god there's still some left, but it's just not the same. It feels like everywhere I turn in the neighborhood, there's another data center. It's a constant electrical hum that I can almost feel behind my eyes. Some people seem to notice it more than others. We have a lovely deck and backyard, but I can't spend much time outside anymore. It's even worse when the diesel generators kick on, and we have to deal with that smell. The lights from a nearby Amazon data center shine directly into my kitchen. It's not as bad during the summer, but in the winter, it's like somebody is shining a spotlight through our window. So many people in our community are going to county supervisor meetings, making noise, and doing anything they can to take a proactive stance against the development of future data centers. Unfortunately, our advocacy has not been very successful. No matter what happens, this is still our dream home. Check your ordinances and make sure the developers have done their environmental studies before they break ground. Once they break ground at a data center site, it's much more difficult to make any changes. If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.</p>

"Congratulations JPMorgan on the opening of your new headquarters!" The bank officially opened its $3 billion headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan on Tuesday. Experts previously told Business Insider that the building's design sends a clear message about JPMorgan's tough expectations for work-life balance and putting in face time. With a 24/7 grab-and-go food and an on-site pub, it's clear that "there'll be people there at night, there'll be people on the weekends," said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation consultancy Johnson Associates. Alluring well-being perks aside, the four-screen setup seen in Dell's photo is perhaps a clearer indicator of the hustle culture expected when you come to work at America's biggest bank. Congratulations @jpmorgan on the opening of your new headquarters! Dell has played a key part in the technology experience at the Park Avenue headquarters, said Larry Feinsmith, the head of global technology strategy at JPMorgan Chase, during an appearance onstage with Michael Dell at Dell Technologies World 2025, the tech company's annual conference, in May. "Dell has been such a strategic partner for us as we think about our next-gen modern workspace," he said. The headquarters features "Dell thin clients and peripherals, and with tremendous efficient desk power as low as 125 watts," as well as Dell servers on the backend, which enable the "immersive audio video, which is going to be everywhere in that building," Feinsmith said. Dell Thunderbolt for monitors, a fast-connectivity docking port, has been installed across stations to create "a flexible experience so that you can either bring your own device or for our traders, who have very complex configurations with four monitors," Feinsmith said. Dell and JPMorgan have a partnership stretching back nearly thirty years, during which Dell has provided solutions for the bank's private cloud storage, compute hardware, software device storage, and GPUs. Dell and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. Revenue from Dell's infrastructure solutions group (ISG) — which sells the servers and data infrastructure that companies need to harness AI — has shot up. ISG's annual revenue was up 29% in Dell's last full financial year.</p>

Private-equity investors, I know you've heard this before, but I have a great investment opportunity for you. I've never worked a day in finance, and I'm arguably closer to the NBA than an MBA, which is saying something considering how bad my jump shot is. I understand the most basic principle in investing: Buy low, sell high. And I've got an asset that would consider the Mariana Trench a step up. Your immediate reaction might be to laugh (most people do when I tell them I'm a fan). But the NFL has finally opened its doors to institutional investors, and PE firms are rushing to get a piece of the action. The New England Patriots, San Francisco 49ers, and New York Giants got the green light from the NFL to receive outside investments this week. The Pats' ($9 billion) and Niners' ($8.6 billion) valuations weren't anything to sneeze at either. Admittedly, it won't be a bargain. Forbes has the Jets slightly lower at $8.1 billion. It's tough to say the price tag definitively, but being based in the largest US city likely means it comes with a nice premium. Meanwhile, the Jets are 0-7 this year with a real shot at finishing 0-17, which would be the worst season in NFL history. League rules don't allow these new investors to take more than a 10% stake, making them passive investors without voting power. (Man, I'm really doing a good job selling this.) And if the NFL does change the rules, private-equity investors are known for orchestrating massive turnarounds (or at least trying to). We're already almost six feet under. The Jets come with some silver linings. So, as bad as the Jets are, they get to stay in a league that's minting money. There are three guarantees in life: death, taxes, and the NFL getting boatloads of money to broadcast its games. The league is reportedly looking to renegotiate its media deals as soon as next year, and it's bound to have a long list of suitors. How about a few hundred million dollars you can bank on every year? Marry a Jets fan, because anyone who still roots for them definitely won't leave you. (My wife is a Jets fan, too, so I guess we're really stuck together.) Just look at this poor sap after Sunday's loss to the Carolina Panthers. (This was sent to me no less than three times in 24 hours.) A post shared by D'Andre McKenzie (@dandremac) Oh, you own a business that sells water skis? I'll buy 10 of them if you get the Jets a Super Bowl, and I don't even own a boat. I once had a friend stop eating Kraft products the week leading up to a game against the Patriots to protest team owner Robert Kraft. Only after the game, which we probably lost, did he realize Kraft has nothing to do with the food company he shares a name with. Bringing the Jets some success could also help you cut more deals. After all, if you can turn the Jets around, what company can't you improve? Whatever it takes, Jets nation will have your back. Are you a PE investor looking to invest in the Jets? Are you a beleaguered Jets fan who just needs some support?</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The retail giant is moving to a new performance-based plan that accounts for factors like attendance, teamwork, and overall store performance, EVP of store operations Cedric Clark said in a memo to managers last week that was shared with Business Insider. The new approach marks a shift from the across-the-board raises that were based on years of service with the company, which Clark said rewarded loyalty but not other individual factors. "It's about recognition, accountability, and growth," Clark wrote. More than half a million of those people are in non-supervisory hourly roles, making this one of the largest-scale changes for worker pay in the country. The changes also come as companies across the economy increasingly emphasize worker performance and efficiency, and workers look for a stronger sense of loyalty from employers, in addition to a paycheck. Years of service are still the most significant factor in determining raises, but now worker and store performance can nudge that number up or down by as much as one percentage point, according to additional internal documents obtained by Business Insider. Workers who joined in the last six months are eligible for a 1% baseline raise, while those who have been at the company for five years see a baseline of 2%, followed by 2.5% for up to 10 years. From there, three factors are equally weighted to account for an employee's attendance and completion of scheduled shifts, their behavioral contributions to the team, and the overall store performance in both sales and customer satisfaction ratings. In each of these three areas, employees receive a rating of "exemplary," "successful," or "opportunity," and a new dashboard shows how they are tracking in real time. An employee who scores the highest rating — exemplary — in all three factors would receive the highest performance-related adjustment of one percentage point, according to a chart included in the documents. The share of employees rated opportunity is typically small. For example, in separate guidance for corporate managers, Walmart estimates that one in 20 employees would likely get the lowest rating, "opportunity," two would likely get the highest rating, "exemplary," and most would default to "successful." A spokesperson said there is no such guidance for store managers and there are no quotas or caps for ratings. The spokesperson also said the final raise percentage only affects employees' base pay, not any bonuses or other compensation. Walmart said the system is now active and will gather data for the fiscal year until January 31, after which raises will be calculated. Clark's memo also says the new structure enables team leaders and coaches to provide clearer feedback to workers. It is for corporate employees, not store workers.</p>
