                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced he's ending all trade negotiations with Canada because of a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his country “can't control the trade policy of the United States.” Before boarding a flight to Asia, Carney told reporters: “We have to focus on what we can control and realize what we can't control.” President Donald Trump greets Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney during a summit to support ending the more than two-year Israel-Hamas war in Gaza after a breakthrough ceasefire deal, Monday, Oct. 13, 2025, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. President Donald Trump answers questions from reporters during a roundtable on criminal cartels in the State Dining Room of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney meet in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced he's ending “all trade negotiations” with Canada because of a television ad sponsored by one of its provinces that used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs — prompting the province's leader to later pull the ad. White House officials said Trump's reaction was a culmination of the administration's long, pent-up frustration about Canada's strategy in trade talks. Later Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province had sponsored the ad, said it would be taken down. Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Mark Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. Ford said they've achieved their goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. “Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said. “We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.” !” Trump wrote on his social media site Friday morning. “They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY. Ford, the premier, didn't initially back down, posting Friday that Canada and the U.S. are allies “and Reagan knew that both are stronger together.” Ford then provided a link to a Reagan speech where the late president voices opposition to tariffs. Ford had said the province plans to pay $54 million (about $75 million Canadian) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,” he said Friday morning before boarding a flight for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. Its board includes longtime Republican Party stalwarts such as former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose free-market philosophy often clashes with Trump's protectionist tendencies. Trump wrote Thursday night that “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.” He added, “TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.” He often criticized government policies — including protectionist measures such as tariffs — that interfered with free commerce and he spent much of that 1987 radio address spelling out the case against tariffs. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Friday that Canada has shown a “lack of flexibility” and also cited “leftover behaviors from the Trudeau folks,” referring to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a frosty relationship with the Trump administration. “If you look at all the countries around the world that we've made deals with, and the fact that we're now negotiating with Mexico separately reveals that it's not just about one ad,” Hassett said. Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Trump said earlier in the week that he had seen the ad on TV and didn't seem bothered by it. It was broadcast most frequently in the New York market, with more than 530 airings, followed by Washington, D.C., at around 280. The only other markets with more than 100 airings were those around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida. Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas. Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on the meeting between President Donald Trump, the secretary of War and top military leaders on ‘America Reports.' The Department of War received an anonymous donation of $130 million Thursday to go toward paying U.S. troops during the government shutdown — but Congress may need to get involved for it to actually get in the hands of service members due to legal limitations. "On October 23, 2025, the Department of War accepted an anonymous donation of $130 million under its general gift acceptance authority," Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement to Fox News Digital Friday. We are grateful for this donor's assistance after Democrats opted to withhold pay from troops." While the government may accept general donations that go toward general funds available to the government, Congress is the one who must appropriate that money to go toward federal employees' salaries, according to Romina Boccia, the director of budget and entitlement policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington. Boccia said that the military is only permitted to accept private donations to support institutions like military schools, libraries, and museums, or to support service members or civilian employees who are wounded or killed in the line of duty. Altering current restrictions would also require congressional intervention, she said. President Donald Trump speaks during a visit with Michigan Air National Guard Troops April 29, 2025, at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan. "The only way to get around this restriction is if Congress decided to recategorize troop pay as mandatory or direct spending," Boccia said. Mandatory spending does not require annual approval from Congress and applies to programs like Social Security and Medicare, according to the Treasury. U.S. troops react as President Donald Trump walks to deliver remarks, near a banner reading, "Peace Through Strength", during a visit to Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, May 15, 2025. President Donald Trump announced Thursday that a "friend" of his sent the government a $130 million check to go toward paying U.S. service members as their paychecks are on hold due to the budget stalemate. "He called us the other day and said, 'I'd like to contribute any shortfall you have because of the Democrat shutdown. It's unclear who the donor is, and Trump said he would not identify the individual unless he received permission to do so, noting he didn't believe the individual wanted any recognition. The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Trump previously signed an order allowing active-duty troops to receive their paycheck earlier in October by funneling unused Pentagon funds originally allocated for research and development. However, Republicans have said the solution is only temporary. Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering the White House.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump says he doesn't feel bad ordering U.S. strikes against suspected drug vessels, saying he is “saving” lives. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during a roundtable on criminal cartels with President Donald Trump in the State Dining Room of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to deploy to the U.S. Southern Command region to “bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on social media. The USS Ford, which has five destroyers in its strike group, is now deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations, would not say how long it would take for the strike group to arrive in the waters off South America or if all five destroyers would make the journey. Deploying an aircraft carrier will surge major additional resources to a region that has already seen an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and the waters off Venezuela. The latest deployment and the quickening pace of the U.S. strikes, including one Friday, raised new speculation about how far the Trump administration may go in operations it says are targeted at drug trafficking, including whether it could try to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. There are already more than 6,000 sailors and Marines on eight warships in the region. Complicating the situation is Tropical Storm Melissa, which has been nearly stationary in the central Caribbean with forecasters warning it could soon strengthen into a powerful hurricane. Hegseth said on social media that the vessel struck overnight was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. The strikes have ramped up from one every few weeks when they first began last month to three this week, killing a total of at least 43 people. “If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat Al-Qaeda,” Hegseth said in his post. “Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you.” On Thursday, the U.S. military flew a pair of supersonic heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela. Maduro on Thursday praised security forces and a civilian militia for defense exercises along some 2,000 kilometers (about 1,200 miles) of coastline to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. attack. In the span of six hours, “100% of all the country's coastline was covered in real time, with all the equipment and heavy weapons to defend all of Venezuela's coasts if necessary,” Maduro said during a government event shown on state television. “An expression that I'm hearing a lot is ‘Drugs are the excuse.' “And I think that message is very clear in regional capitals. President Donald Trump this month declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and said the U.S. was in an “armed conflict” with them, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11. When reporters asked Trump on Thursday whether he would request that Congress issue a declaration of war against the cartels, he said that wasn't the plan. “I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK? They're going to be like, dead,” Trump said during a roundtable at the White House. Lawmakers from both major political parties have expressed concerns about Trump ordering the military actions without receiving authorization from Congress or providing many details. “I've never seen anything quite like this before,” said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., who previously worked in the Pentagon and the State Department, including as an adviser in Afghanistan. “We have no idea how far this is going, how this could potentially bring in, you know, is it going to be boots on the ground? Is it going to be escalatory in a way where we could see us get bogged down for a long time?” he said. Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who has long been involved in foreign affairs in the hemisphere, said of Trump's approach: “It's about time.” While Trump “obviously hates war,” he also is not afraid to use the U.S. military in targeted operations, Diaz-Balart said. Associated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, and Ben Finley and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report. This story has been corrected to show there have been a total of at least 43 deaths from the strikes, not 46.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on New York Governor Kathy Hochuls endorsement of NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Special Report. It took four months, but one of the top Democrats in New York State has finally endorsed New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. "Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy," Jeffries said. Jeffries added: "In that spirit, I support him and the entire citywide Democratic ticket in the general election." Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, speaks at an endorsement event from the union DC 37 on July 15, 2025, in New York City. Jeffries acknowledged in his statement that he has "areas of principled disagreement" with Mamdani. Jeffries, whose congressional district covers much of neighboring Brooklyn, becomes the second major New York State Democrat to back Mamdani, following a late September endorsement from Gov. The endorsements from Jeffries and Hochul may put intense pressure on longtime Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who is the top Democrat in the Senate, to also back Mamdani in an election that is a little over a week away. Mamdani shocked the political world in June with his convincing win over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates to capture the Democratic Party's mayoral nomination in the nation's most populous city. Mamdani is sitting on a large double-digit lead over Cuomo in the latest New York City public opinion polls. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks during his weekly press conference in Washington, D.C., on May 13, 2025. New York's current mayor, the embattled incumbent Eric Adams, had decided to run as an independent but announced late last month that he would no longer pursue the office amid anemic polling. President Donald Trump's advisors had floated administration roles for both mayoral hopefuls. This week, Adams endorsed Cuomo, even though the two had repeatedly clashed earlier this year on the campaign trail. New York City mayoral candidates, from left to right: Zohran Mamdani, Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo, Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani surged to the Democratic primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living. It was fueled by a massive grassroots army of supporters and backing from top national progressive champions, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mamdani made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) "tuition-free," freezing rents on municipal housing, offering "free childcare" for children up to age 5 and setting up government-run grocery stores. Mamdani has been heavily criticized by his rivals for his far-left platform, as well as his verbal attacks on Israel, his past critical comments about the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and his proposal to shift certain responsibilities away from the NYPD and focus on social services and community-based programs. "Assemblyman Mamdani has promised to focus on keeping every New Yorker safe, including the Jewish community that has confronted a startling rise in antisemitic incidents as well as Black and Latino neighborhoods that have battled deadly gun violence for years," Jeffries said in his statement on Friday. Trump, a native New Yorker who now calls Florida home, has derided Mamdani ever since his primary victory as a "communist" and earlier this month came up with a new derogatory nickname. Republicans have worked overtime the past three months to anchor the mayoral nominee to vulnerable congressional Democrats up for re-election in next year's midterms. Every single Democrat owns the socialist agenda and is now a willing accomplice in their own party's collapse," National Republican Congressional Committee national press secretary Mike Marinella told Fox News Digital in a statement. While Jeffries praised Mamdani's affordability emphasis on the campaign trail, neither meeting resulted in an endorsement. Most House Democrats, including many progressives, have given Jeffries plenty of latitude and have declined to criticize his lack of an endorsement. Among the exceptions is Ocasio-Cortez, who said earlier this summer that "we use our primaries to settle our differences, and once we have a nominee, we rally behind that nominee," Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a former House Democrat, similarly chastised congressional leaders for failing to rally around Mamdani. While Jeffries joins Hochul in endorsing Mamdani, New York State Democratic Party chair Jay Jacobs said that he — as an individual — wouldn't endorse his party's mayoral nominee. And Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, whose suburban swing congressional district includes a small portion of Queens, has previously announced that he wouldn't support Mamdani. Rumors of the Friday endorsement earned immediate criticism from Republicans suggesting that Jeffries is succumbing to pressure from his far-left base to endorse Mamdani despite his socialist policies that will certainly become a target during next year's midterms. !," Maureen O'Toole, National Republican Congressional Committee Eastern Regional press secretary, posted on X.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The catastrophe at a Tennessee explosives plant started in a building that made devices used for mining and detonated more than 24,000 pounds of explosives, authorities said Friday. The October 10 disaster killed 16 employees at Accurate Energetic Systems, which makes military and demolition explosives about 60 miles west of Nashville. Witnesses who could shed light on the cause of deadly Tennessee blast were killed The “blast seat” was Building 602, a 15,000-square-foot structure that made explosives used for mining, McCracken said. Investigators have theories about what might have caused the explosion, said Jamey VanVliet, special agent in charge of the ATF's Nashville Field Division. But he declined to name those theories or speculate on a potential cause as the investigation continues. During their dangerous search, authorities scoured 500 acres of wooded property looking for victims and explosive hazards, McCracken said. “There is no indication of threat to public safety,” VanVliet said. Investigators have spent “nearly every daylight hour processing this enormous scene” over the past two weeks, VanVliet said Friday. “Today, that part of our work – processing the scene – is complete,” he said. Authorities have identified the 16 victims as Jason Adams, Erick Anderson, Billy Baker, Adam Boatman, Christopher Clark, Mindy Clifton, James Cook, Reyna Gillahan, LeTeisha Mays, Jeremy Moore, Melinda Rainey, Melissa Stanford, Trenton Stewart, Rachel Woodall, Steven Wright and Donald Yowell. “It really saddens me that we still have two souls that we have not been able to locate,” the sheriff said Friday. “I've talked with both of those families last night and this morning. We still have some testing to do,” which Davis said he hopes will be completed in the coming days. In recent years, safety concerns have been raised at the plant. Federal records show the plant faced fines several years ago related to workplace safety practices. Massive blast that destroyed a Tennessee explosive plant leaves 16 dead, officials say The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations. In a statement posted on its website, Accurate Energetic Systems said it is “shocked and devastated” by the loss of 16 employees.

(AP Photo/John Clark) James' first court appearance in Virginia sets the stage for a high-stakes legal battle between the Republican administration and a longtime Democratic Trump foe who angered him with a major civil fraud case she brought against him. She's accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, where she has family. The attorney general left the courthouse smiling to cheers from dozens of waiting supporters, who chanted, “We stand with Tish!” The indictment charging her with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, she declared, was about “a justice system which has been used as a tool of revenge … and a weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law.” Prosecutors allege that when buying the Norfolk home in 2020, James signed a standard document called a “second home rider” in which she agreed to keep the property primarily for her “personal use and enjoyment for at least one year,” unless the lender agreed otherwise. James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud. James' indictment followed the resignation of Erik Siebert as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring a case. Siebert was replaced with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor and presented James' case to the grand jury herself. After Siebert's resignation, Trump, in an extraordinary social media post, urged Bondi to prosecute James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote the administration “can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,” adding: “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!! Defense lawyers have said they intend to challenge Halligan's appointment, a step also taken this week by attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey in a different case filed by Halligan. The motion followed the revelation from earlier this week that Halligan contacted via an encrypted text messaging platform a reporter from Lawfare, a media organization that covers legal and national security issues, to discuss the James prosecution and complain about coverage of it. A third Trump adversary, former national security adviser John Bolton, pleaded not guilty last week to charges against him of emailing classified information to family members and keeping top secret documents at his Maryland home. The Justice Department has also been investigating mortgage fraud allegations against Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, whom Trump has called to be prosecuted over allegations related to a property in Maryland. In a separate mortgage investigation, authorities have been probing allegations against Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, who is challenging a Trump administration effort to remove her from her job.</p>

Fox News State Department correspondent Gillian Turner reports on pushback within the Republican Party against the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug vessels on ‘Special Report.' "In support of the President's directive to dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) and counter narco-terrorism in defense of the Homeland, the Secretary of War has directed the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group and embarked carrier air wing to the U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) area of responsibility (AOR)," chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday.

(Photo by JONATHAN KLEIN/AFP via Getty Images) USSOUTHCOM's area of responsibility includes the land mass of Latin America south of Mexico, the waters adjacent to Central and South America and the Caribbean Sea. The USS Gerald R. Ford is currently deployed to the Mediterranean Sea along with three destroyers. It would likely take several days for the ships to make the journey to South America. Most recently, War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday that a strike on a vessel allegedly operated by suspected members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a Venezuelan street gang deemed a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO), killed six alleged narco-terrorists. U.S. strikes on drug boats near Venezuelan waters may be targeted at taking out Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. "If you are a narco-terrorist smuggling drugs in our hemisphere, we will treat you like we treat al-Qaeda," Hegseth wrote on X. "Day or NIGHT, we will map your networks, track your people, hunt you down, and kill you." It marked the 10th strike targeting suspected drug trafficking boats since Trump returned to office. Trump has accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of being a drug cartel leader as he continues to increase pressure on the Maduro regime. Last week, Trump confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, saying he did so because the South American nation has released prisoners into the U.S. and that drugs were coming into the U.S. from Venezuela through sea routes. Meanwhile, the military strikes have attracted scrutiny from both sides of the aisle as questions swirl about their legality. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., recently introduced a war powers resolution that would prohibit U.S. armed forces from participating in "hostilities" against Venezuela.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Entering a plea: New York Attorney General Letitia James has entered pleas of not guilty at her Norfolk, VA, federal court arraignment on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. James won a civil suit against Trump, his adult sons, and the Trump organization for inflating the value of his properties to obtain favorable interest rates on loans and insurance. Friends and family filled the courtroom in Norfolk, Virginia, for Letitia James' arraignment Friday morning. When James entered through a side door she leaned forward and smiled at them. After the hearing, two of her friends told CNN they came to court to show support to James and that family members lined the back row of the courtroom. James replied “yes judge” that she understood her right to remain silent and her right to an attorney. “Not guilty judge to both counts,” James said. Roger Keller, a US attorney out of Missouri, represented the Justice Department. She spoke only once to inform her colleague that they did have a copy of a pretrial report. The Virginia federal prosecutor who resisted bringing mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James sent investigative files with James' personally identifying information to her own private email account, according an email reviewed by CNN. Yusi's attorney Margaret Donovan, however, told CNN that the former prosecutor “has no record of any such email” and “has never used her personal email account for any portion of any investigation.” Before her ousting, Yusi authored an internal memo that explained why prosecutors believed there was not enough evidence to bring charges against James. Her firing drew immediate criticism from those who have accused the Justice Department of following directives from the White House to target Trump's political opponents. After her arraignment in federal court, New York Attorney General Letitia James said she “will not be deterred” by her prosecution. “There's no fear today, no fear,” James said in a brief statement outside the Norfolk, Virginia, federal courthouse as protesters chanted alongside her. She decried the case she faces, saying the justice system was being used as a “tool of revenge” and a “weapon against those individuals who simply did their job and who stood up for the rule of law.” I will do my job each and every day … there's work to be done standing up for the rule of law.” The motion from James to have the case against her dismissed based on President Donald Trump's appointment of Lindsey Halligan as interim US Attorney in Northern Virginia will be combined with a similar motion from former FBI Director James Comey. The president handpicked Halligan to serve as interim US attorney in the Virginia district and see through the James and Comey prosecutions amid questions internally over whether there was evidence to indict either of them. Comey's defense attorneys are saying that Halligan can't serve as interim US attorney because that position hit its 120 day limit. They also say Halligan's new role does not appear to fit two exceptions for appointments to such vacancies under the law: She is not Senate confirmed nor is she someone who has been employed in Justice Department for at least 90 days. James' attorney told the he expects to file a motion to dismiss the case against her based on claims that the Justice Department is engaging in vindictive and selective prosecution. New York Attorney General Letitia James was released on personal recognizance after entering her not guilty pleas. A small group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse where Letitia James is being arraigned. New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The federal judge in Virginia overseeing New York Attorney General Letitia James' case has a long history of public service in the Commonwealth. Walker was randomly assigned James' case after a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted her this month on two felony charges. Prior to becoming a federal judge, Walker worked in the same US Attorney's Office in Alexandria that is now handling James' case. After graduating from the University of Virginia School of Law, Walker clerked for Judge Raymond A. Jackson, whose seat he now occupies. Walker's confirmation made him the first openly gay federal judge to serve in Virginia. Lindsey Halligan, a fierce Trump ally, assumed the job of top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia last month Within days, she pursued indictments against the former FBI Director James Comey and then James. Halligan's predecessor, Erik Siebert, was pushed out of the job amid political pressure to indict James, CNN reported. Halligan, a former insurance attorney from Florida, served as one of Trump's personal attorneys during the initial investigation into whether Trump was illegally keeping classified documents in his Mar-a-Lago estate. The president handpicked her to serve as interim US attorney in the Virginia district and see through the James and Comey prosecutions amid questions internally over whether there was evidence to indict either of them. Halligan, who had no previous prosecutorial experience,  was the only prosecutor to sign the two indictments against Trump's perceived enemies. Halligan faces new scrutiny this week after contacting a reporter - Lawfare's Anna Bower - on the messaging platform Signal two days after securing the grand jury indictment against James about the case. James attorneys filed a motion Thursday evening asking a federal judge to bar Halligan and other prosecutors from making public statements outside of court referencing Halligan's recently revealed conversations with Bower. Those comments – which Bower reported earlier this week - represented “a stunning disclosure of internal government information,” attorneys for James said in the filing Thursday. James' defense team also wants the judge to require prosecutors to keep a list of all contacts they have with members of the media. For months, President Donald Trump has openly discussed his plans to have a list of his perceived political enemies prosecuted. Now his Justice Department has been making good on that promise in recent weeks with the indictments of Letitia James, former FBI Director James Comey and former Trump adviser John Bolton. He's pleaded not guilty to two felony counts for allegedly lying to Congress during testimony he gave in 2020. The indictment came down days after James was charged though Trump has been calling for charges against his former ally since the release of Bolton's 2020 memoir that was highly critical of the president. The Justice Department, led by its weaponization working group head, Ed Martin, is reportedly investigating Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and the former Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over potential mortgage fraud, CNN previously reported. Trump has also publicly said he thought billionaire George Soros, known for backing liberal causes, could be another “likely candidate” for an investigation. New York Attorney General Letitia James is facing one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. It also alleges James filed a tax form indicating she received thousands of dollars in rental income. New York Attorney General Letitia James has arrived at the federal courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia, to be arraigned on charges related to alleged mortgage fraud. Lindsey Halligan, President Donald Trump's handpicked interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is also present at the courthouse. James and Trump have a long history of animosity toward each other. James campaigned for New York attorney general in 2016 vowing to “shine a bright light” into Donald Trump's real estate business. In 2022, she filed civil fraud charges alleging Trump, his adult sons, and the Trump organization inflated the value of hotels, golf courses, and other properties to obtain favorable interest rates on loans and insurance. A judge found Trump liable and ordered him to pay $454 million, including interest. A panel of appeals court judges upheld the fraud finding but dismissed the penalty, finding it excessive. Trump has called James “racist” and “corrupt” and in 2024, while campaigning for president, said “she ought to be looked at.” Last month, Trump posted publicly on Truth Social a message, which was allegedly supposed to be private, to Attorney General Pam Bondi calling on her to move quickly. They're all guilty as hell,” the president wrote. New York Attorney General Letitia James is set to be arraigned Friday at a federal courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia, two weeks after she was indicted on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The judge will also inform James of her rights and decide whether she will be detained as she awaits trial or set conditions of her release. The judge could also chose a trial date during Friday's arraignment. The arraignments this month of former FBI Director James Comey and ex-Trump national security adviser John Bolton both lasted less than 30 minutes. Lowell is well known for defending politicians and has won acquittals or mistrials for several high-profile clients, including former Democratic presidential candidate and Sen. John Edwards, who was charged with campaign finance violations. A long-time Washington insider, Lowell served as counsel to House Democrats during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. He also represented Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner during the special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, and later Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges. After years working at a large DC law firm, earlier this year  Lowell set up his own shop driven by “the Trump administration's attempts to use the legal system to silence perceived opponents and critics.” His roster of clients includes former national security adviser John Bolton, whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security Miles Taylor, and several former FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors who were fired from their positions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Changpeng Zhao, one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry, is back in the spotlight this week after securing a pardon from President Donald Trump — a reprieve that renews concerns that those with deep pockets have been able to buy their way out of trouble under Trump 2.0. It is hard to overstate how much Zhao, who goes by “CZ,” has shaped the crypto industry since he launched Binance in 2017 and grew it into the world's largest trading platform for digital assets. Put simply: If you want to take, say, $100 from your bank account and use it to buy or sell cryptocurrencies virtually anywhere in the world, Binance facilitates that process, and takes a small fee off of every trade. It also offers more complex financial services like margin trading and “staking,” a way for investors to earn passive returns on their crypto holdings. Not only is Binance by far the world's biggest crypto exchange, as measured by both user count (280 million globally) and trading volume (more than $217 billion daily), it boasts 40% of the market share among centralized crypto exchanges. (In response, Binance launched a more limited service, Binance.US, though in practice many users within US borders found ways around the ban, according to media reports and the Department of Justice.) US federal prosecutors said in a 2023 that Binance had become a hub for bad actors, enabling transactions linked to child sex abuse, narcotics, terrorist financing and money laundering. Binance also lacked protocols — standard for financial services companies — to report transactions for money laundering risks, according to the Justice Department, and employees were well aware that such an oversight would invite criminals to the platform. One compliance staffer wrote, according to court documents:  “we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you. Zhao still owns an estimated 90% of the company, giving him an estimated net worth of more than $80 billion, according to Forbes. On Friday, Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian national who now lives in the United Arab Emirates, reflected on his recent ups and downs, stating: “My official record was tarnished for a bit, but my reputation held strong. No one, not a single person, stopped doing business with me.” For years, crypto in the United States was a largely theoretical project — a parallel financial system led by a community of extremely online pioneers, who believed the future of money lay in computer networks outside the control of governments or central banks. Just this week, Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller said crypto assets “are no longer on the fringes” and “increasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems” — a stunning acknowledgement for an industry that nearly imploded just three years ago with the collapse of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's once high-flying competitor to Binance. Institutional interest in crypto has shot up with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, and Congress recently passed an industry-approved regulatory bill that proponents hope will increase adoption. There's a long way to go, however, as most Americans (63%) have little or no confidence in crypto as a safe investment, according to Pew Research. He's not even trying to hide them The Trump family's vast crypto empire is perhaps the most problematic of the president's conflicts of interest, making earlier ethics debates over his hotel and casino business interests look downright quaint. There is virtually no cap on how much money can flow to the Trump family via crypto. The president's pardon of Zhao exemplifies those ethical concerns because Binance has direct financial ties to the Trump family's crypto business. In March, the Trump family's World Liberty Financial launched a dollar-pegged token known as a stablecoin — popular assets in crypto because their value remains constant, while most other token prices are prone to volatility. Everything to know about the crypto being debated in Congress Shortly after the coin launched this spring, a UAE-based firm announced it would use USD1 to take a $2 billion stake in Binance — using USD1, a deal that is expected to generate millions in returns for World Liberty, which is controlled jointly by the Trumps and the family of Steve Witkoff, Trump's Mideast negotiator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And why it matters for the future of U.S.-Israel relations Everything went according to script—until Vance torched his hosts on the way out. Before boarding Air Force Two, the vice president was asked by a reporter about a vote that had been held the day before in Israel's Parliament. Hard-right lawmakers from Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition had advanced a measure calling for Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians claim for their future state. Asked about the Knesset vote on the tarmac, Vance acknowledged that it was symbolic, but he was not amused. That will continue to be our policy.” That same day, Time published an interview with Trump in which the president was asked about annexation. “It won't happen, because I gave my word to the Arab countries,” he replied. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Netanyahu didn't take long to shift into damage-control mode. This dustup will not harm the U.S.-Israel relationship in the near term, but it portends more consequential conflict to come. That's because the Israeli hard right—a crucial and dominant component of Netanyahu's coalition—is at war with Trump's regional agenda, and its aspirations are incompatible with the president's ambitions. Previously, the Trump administration was divided between accordists, including the envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who were more aligned with the Gulf states, and annexationists, such as Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who were more sympathetic to the Israeli right. But in recent weeks, the president has made his decision: The accordists have won in a rout, and that outcome has implications well beyond the West Bank. Read: Can Trump contain Israel's hard right? In his Time interview, Trump claimed that Saudi Arabia—whose crown prince will reportedly visit the White House next month—would normalize relations with Israel by the end of the year. But Saudi Arabia has demanded a path to Palestinian statehood, however limited, as its condition for such a move—and, as Wednesday's annexation vote showed, the Israeli settler right will do all it can to block this. “If Saudi Arabia tells us ‘normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friends, no thank you,” Bezalel Smotrich, Netanyahu's far-right finance minister, said at a conference yesterday. “Keep riding camels in the desert in Saudi Arabia.” The remark, which Smotrich was later forced to walk back, was almost certainly not an accident. Its casual racism can be construed as an act of sabotage—an effort to derail the Middle East–normalization train. Smotrich and his anti-Arab allies—such as his fellow lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech, who boycotted Trump's victory speech in the Knesset—likely see the president's agenda as an existential threat to their project. Ultimately, the far right's program of unfettered settler expansion and violence, unending war and eventual settlement in Gaza, and no negotiations with the Palestinian Authority is irreconcilable with a more regionally integrated Israel and an expanded Abraham Accords. In practice, this means that as long as Israel's settler right holds power over Netanyahu, it will continue to threaten the Trump administration's agenda. Polls show that most Israelis, unlike Netanyahu's unpopular minoritarian coalition, support Trump's goals. One September survey found that 72 percent of Israelis believe that preserving the Abraham Accords and deepening regional alliances with moderate Arab countries is in Israel's “supreme interest.” Another survey in August found that 73 percent of Israelis would support a normalization deal that includes recognizing a Palestinian state. Trump is astronomically popular in Israel today following his Gaza deal, far more so than Netanyahu himself. Should the president publicly make the case for his plans, he will be pushing on an open door—and might even push Netanyahu and Israel's far right out of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In this new series, the big conflict begins with a book every bit as dangerous as Pullman's critics used to claim his were. Lyra, Pullman's scrappy and charismatic heroine, has become infatuated with two books by modern philosophers who preach a kind of post-truth moral relativism. Under the sway of their clever wording, Lyra becomes estranged from her daemon Pantalaimon, the animal companion who accompanies her everywhere — which is to say, within the metaphysical constructs of Pullman's world, she becomes estranged from her soul. Book recommendations — both old and new — that are worth your time, from senior correspondent and critic Constance Grady. Ironically, that used to be the religious right's line about His Dark Materials: that it put children's souls in danger. Conceived as Paradise Lost for teens, it is, after all, a series that metaphorically denounces the Catholic Church for child abuse and ends with two children literally killing God, then saving the multiverse by falling in love with each other. A planned series of film adaptations puttered out after just one release in 2007, in part due to pressure from the anti-defamation group the Catholic League. Pullman pulled no punches when it came to his thoughts on religiously motivated censorship. “Religion grants its adherents malign, intoxicating and morally corrosive sensations,” he wrote for The Guardian in 2008. Pullman's new series doesn't call for censorship. But it does make it clear that he believes that there are such things as dangerous books and dangerous ideas, and that they can both put us in danger of becoming estranged from our fundamental selves. What exactly those dangerous ideas are is what's at stake in the center of Pullman's two Lyra trilogies — and in all the debates about which ideas children should be exposed to. Pullman's His Dark Materials books were written in response to and as a reaction against C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia and their Christian allegory. “It is monumentally disparaging of girls and women,” Pullman said at The Guardian's Hay festival in 2002. The Narnia books, it is true, do not mesh nicely with today's sexual and racial politics. Susan Pevensie, as Pullman said, is declared “no longer a friend to Narnia” and thus ineligible to be transported to heaven with her family at the end of the series because she is “interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations.” As for the plot about the swarthy brown people in turbans who worship a god who turns out to be the devil — well, it's probably best not to think about it too much. What seems to have bothered Pullman most about Narnia, though, was not just the racism and the sexism but Lewis's idea that heavenly Narnia is more real and more important than the ordinary world of England. That would be the republican thing to do. That's why Lewis doesn't let his characters do it, and why the Narnia books are such an invaluable guide to what is wrong and cruel and selfish.” In His Dark Materials, meanwhile, while the spirit and the soul and other worlds are all very real, they are not what is most valuable. Instead, Pullman's characters are taught that what really matters is our own material world, our bodies, and the things that we can experience through them. Those are our greatest sources of pleasure and joy, and they are the tools through which we can create the utopia Pullman calls the Republic of Heaven. One of his most lyrical passages comes when a woman is able to slow the entropy of the universe by drawing on her memories of physical sensation: “The delicate dancing of her fingers on a computer keyboard. … Tasting an iced margarita in California, sitting under the lemon trees outside a restaurant in Lisbon, scraping the frost off the windshield of her car.” These were “all the sensations that made up being alive,” and they are, for Pullman, what makes life so precious to experience — not the promise of dying and being reborn in another, better world, but the reality of being alive in our own world, right now. Moreover, in Pullman's world, unusually for children's literature, becoming an adult is more a gift than it is a loss. As a child, Lyra has a supernatural knack for reading her alethiometer, the titular golden compass and “truth meter” that mystifies grown-ups but always answers all of Lyra's questions. She can learn how to read the alethiometer again, an angel tells her, by working at it for a lifetime. “But your reading will be even better then, after a lifetime of thought and effort, because it will come from conscious understanding,” the angel says. “Grace attained like that is deeper and fuller than grace that comes freely, and furthermore, once you've gained it, it will never leave you.” The value of experience over innocence, body over spirit, earth over heaven: The whole original trilogy is written in service of this deeply held belief, and in a kind of outrage at all the children's literature that ever came before it and told children otherwise. Pullman's books were immediately controversial, especially in the US, where his publishers weren't above trying to cut off any outcry at the root. When 13-year-old Lyra goes through her sexual awakening in The Amber Skyglass, her physical sensations are a lot clearer and more specific in the UK (“she felt a stirring at the roots of her hair: she found herself breathing faster”) than they are in the US (“Lyra felt something strange happen to her body”). Bowdlerizing Lyra's adolescence wasn't enough to address the bigger issue, however. When it came to His Dark Materials, no decoding was necessary. Outraged articles in the religious press were frequent, but they ramped up significantly in 2007, when Hollywood adapted The Golden Compass into a film. The Catholic League called for a boycott. “It is not our position that the movie will strike Christian parents as troubling,” the Catholic League had said in a statement. To be specific, if unsuspecting Christian parents take their children to see the movie, they may very well find it engaging and then buy Pullman's books for Christmas. In 2010, he published a new novel titled The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, with the premise that Jesus Christ was two brothers, one holy and one obsessed with worldly power. Faced with a reader at a live event who found the idea offensive, Pullman responded, “No one has the right to spend their life without being offended. If a person did read and dislike Pullman's book, he went on, “You don't have to remain silent about it. You can do all those things, but there your rights stop. No one has the right to stop me writing this book. Plenty of people felt that they did have the right to stop Pullman's books from being kept in school libraries. Conservative groups have astroturfed school board meetings, decrying books about LGBTQ issues as “pornographic” and books that dealt with structural racism in America as crypto-commie critical race theory. “Never before in the life of any living American have so many books been systematically removed from school libraries across the country,” a report earlier this month from free speech advocacy group PEN America said. The right's embrace of book banning comes after a decade of complaints that the left had become too censorious and obsessed with progressive purity tests. Few protests from the left turned into attempts to ban books from shelves, but it is true that messy controversies in the YA sphere saw some authors bullied into withdrawing their books from publication after allegations that they were insufficiently antiracist. Those books may not have been banned by the state, but they weren't on shelves where readers could look at them, either. Partisans on both sides of the aisle began to fight over which side could be said to really, truly be on the side of free speech, and which side owned book bannings. In the midst of this arguing, a consensus emerged. Most people did agree that there were limits to what ideas children should be exposed to, and that, for instance, while adults might have a legal right to read hardcore pornography and Nazi propaganda if they wanted to, such books did not belong in elementary school libraries. Moreover, it was clear that school libraries did not have infinite space or the ability to store all possible books for their children, just as publishers did not have the capacity to publish every book submitted to them. Some books would have to be excluded, because kids weren't interested or because they weren't age appropriate or because they were filled with false information — or, perhaps, because they were somehow found to be immoral. But where are librarians supposed to draw the line? In Pullman's new companion trilogy, books really can do what the Catholic League feared His Dark Materials would do: they put people's souls in danger. The two books that enchanted Lyra make the argument that daemons aren't real, which Lyra regards as a thrilling but ultimately silly provocation. First, fashionable young people begin to ignore their daemons. Gradually, the daemons lose their names and power of speech, and begin to drop dead in a kind of spiritual murder. These anti-daemon ideas haven't spread just on their own, however. They're the result of a campaign by powerful people — church, state, and industry, all united by the power of money — to consolidate their own power and reshape the world for their convenience. They spread books denying the existence of absolute truth or of the existence of daemons on purpose, to render the populace too confused to fight back until it's too late. Here, daemons are refigured as not just our souls but as the irrational and bodily part of ourselves, the part that understands metaphor and revels in corporeal sensations, the part that Pullman has been championing all along. Lyra, without him, retains her logical mind but has lost the scrappy force of will that saw her through the experience of His Dark Materials — “that lost rebellious part of her,” Pullman writes, “that woodland-smelling self who'd set off in anger.” Without our souls, our rational animating spirits become alienated from both our bodies and the material world, because powerful people find us more compliant that way. Pullman's target is less religion here than it is power more broadly — especially power as guided by modern capitalism, which he describes as “the universal solvent,” which dissolves all bonds with its implacable force. But then, after all, there's that problem again: what do we value? “We have the truth,” a Christian commenter declared back in 2002, in response to a debate over what to do with His Dark Materials, “so why worry and fret when someone challenges that?” Pullman's response to this problem is that of a classic liberal. He has never argued in favor of banning the Narnia books, and Lyra doesn't suggest that the books that so enchanted her should be banned. Instead, Pullman argues for answering one person's true story with your own, for fighting it out in the marketplace of ideas. Pullman is not on the cutting edge anymore. These new books aren't getting banned, in a bit of a tell that they are not considered as vital as their predecessors. Nonetheless, the battle Pullman once defined — of what we should teach children, of whose values they should learn — rages on without him. The sports gambling reckoning is finally here.</p>

They then dye large swaths of that yarn a dusty indigo hue before weaving it into a denim fabric that will eventually be cut and sewn into your favorite pair of light-washed low-rise jeans. They're the kind that fit in that particular way so that you too can look like a member of the girl group Katseye, decked out in Gap denim at a cost of $90 apiece. But after President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on Indian goods went into effect this August, those $90 jeans effectively now have to pay a $45 toll just to get into the United States. That is, if India — the world's second-largest textile manufacturer — gets to make them at all. The export-heavy factories once bustling across the country's textile belt have all but come to a standstill since tariffs took hold. And suicide rates are rising among the cotton farmers who supply the factories with raw materials — as a result, thousands of farmers have taken to the streets to protest their government's tariff response. Trump's slate of double-digit export fees has battered global supply chains across a map that seems to be all but gerrymandered against the global poor. The tariffs aren't just going to raise prices on your favorite Gap jeans, Nike shoes, or Costco Lululemon dupes — they are also poised to threaten decades of progress in countries where exports have collectively lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades. Not that those rules were very fair to begin with, she said, but “having some rules is better than having no rules, where the big bully can come and beat you up in the playground.” There are millions of people whose ability to feed their families and send their kids to school depends on the often meager wages they earn stuffing your Labubus or even assembling your Mercedes-Benz. And in places where global trade has been a major driver of economic growth, these tariffs could reverse decades of substantial but often fragile progress. Then, in the early '90s — the original age of baggy jeans and politically tinged celebrity denim ads — India hit a currency crisis that eventually led to short-term financial assistance from the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which helped support a domestically-led opening of India to trade and foreign investment. By the time jeans got skinny in the mid-2000s, companies like Gap had begun to see India as a promising manufacturing hub. In China, which dominated American clothing manufacturing at the time, wages were rising — meaning $4 to $8 per day. But in India, Gap's subcontractors could pay workers, some of them children, closer to just $2 per day. That might seem miserly, but it's worth noting that most low-skilled women workers in India at the time earned under $0.50 per day. So, as exploitative as those garment industry wages could be, they also unlocked a lot of prosperity for the country and job opportunities for a mostly female workforce. Over a decade, Indian exports ballooned — at an annual pace of 26 percent in 2006. A child living in India today is nearly three times more likely to finish high school, over five times more likely to have basic plumbing, and 11 times less likely to die from hunger than just a few decades ago. Most economists credit trade liberalization — and the economic growth it can bring — for propelling those changes. “You can't eat GDP, but you can enjoy a lot of the benefits of human development that come with higher incomes,” said Cullen Hendrix, an expert in development at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But as brutal as the garment industry can be — women are often forced to work overtime in unsanitary conditions and many face harassment from their supervisors — it is still seen as the first rung in climbing up the ladder of the global supply chain and away from exporting raw materials like cotton or cobalt. The country is now Gap's second-largest manufacturing hub, with 88 factories in total, eight of them added between 2021 and 2024. Other major apparel brands like Zara, H&M, and Primark manufacture their clothing there, too. But the 50 percent tariff from India's largest trade partner — which is so high on tight-margin products like clothing that it is an effective embargo — has been a blow to this growing industry. Gap recently told investors that the tariffs will cost the company up to $175 million, and it has already halted shipments from India. That is a catastrophe for workers who are often paid per piece of clothing sewn. Every lost order of blue jeans means less money for workers and “their children, their education, their health,” and even basics like food, shelter, and clean water, said Revathy Rugmini, regional director for Asia at the advocacy group Transform Trade. “There are things that you can control and there are things that you can't control,” Gap CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in August. “The things that we can control, we're doing really well.” The company did not respond to a request for comment from Vox. Talks to reach a trade deal between India and the US are ongoing, but India's garment industry is nevertheless bracing for an up to 10 percent drop in revenue this year as companies like Gap shift production elsewhere. “Time is of the essence here,” said Rugmini, who noted that the poorest families — to whom export-driven gains have not been evenly distributed — could easily slip back into poverty if production remains slow. The deal slashed US tariffs on Vietnam from a high of 40 percent to just 4 percent, opening the doors to a wave of foreign investment. At the time, Bugs Bunny and basketball icon Michael Jordan Nike ads for the new Air Jordans were everywhere, sneaker sales were skyrocketing, and Nike suddenly needed a lot of new factories to make a lot of new shoes. In 2000, Nike employed just 45,000 workers at five factories in Vietnam, but the company now makes over half of its shoes in Vietnam, employing nearly 450,000 workers at 135 independent factories.And as the number of companies manufacturing in Vietnam ballooned — and as workers got jobs, cities got factories, and Americans got sneakers — the level of extreme poverty in the country fell at one of the fastest rates the world has ever seen. Along the way, foreign companies like Nike regularly came under fire for exposing garment workers to toxic fumes, restricting toilet access, and employing children as young as 14. Still, even the sweatshops' meager wages were often much higher than what workers could earn elsewhere. But Vietnam's explosive export-driven growth did have a catch. The country's economy now revolves largely around the whims of foreign factory owners from Taiwan and Singapore, who subcontract for even further-flung global conglomerates like Nike. “There's a lot of positivity about what global integration has given Vietnam,” he says, but that dependence has also left them vulnerable. “If you put all your eggs in this export basket, then you become critically dependent on your export markets,” said Ghosh. In this case, Vietnam's largest market is an increasingly protectionist United States. The company's stock nosedived more than 14 percent and Nike warned that its losses could add up to $1 billion, costs that the company would likely look to offset within its supply chain — namely, by lowering wages. One messy trade deal rollout later, Trump eventually lowered tariffs on Vietnam to 20 percent, plus a vaguely defined 40 percent fee for the roughly one-third of Vietnamese exports that pass through China first. (Many export manufacturers shifted parts of their production line to Vietnam as a way to sidestep the steep tariffs Trump placed on China during his first administration.) Nike stocks recovered somewhat, but what remains is still a very large tariff. And if the 40 percent tariff is eventually applied on any so-called transshipments originating overseas, the impact could be even more dramatic. Huge swaths of Vietnam's export manufacturing sector are intertwined with Chinese supply chains. “We have a very expansive and diverse global supply chain that we've built over 50 years,” Nike CEO Elliott Hill recently told CNBC. “We're working through some of the levers that we have to offset those tariffs,” including “working with our factory partners” overseas. Vox reached out to Nike about the tariffs, and in response, the company emphasized its commitment to ethical labor practices and noted that it was actively exploring new options for sourcing its products. Even with the reduced tariff, sneaker sales are already slipping. “The real lesson is that you really should not tether your entire economy to another one, even if it's as big as the United States, because there's simply too much unpredictability,” said Karen Mathiasen, an expert at the Center for Global Development. He must have never read the label on his own Trump-branded golf polos, some of which are manufactured by Lesotho's fragile but vibrant garment industry. And though the US eventually reduced Lesotho's tariff to 15 percent, down from 50 percent in his initial declaration, the damage was already done in the textile sector, which employs around 30,000 people, most of them women earning less than roughly $40 per week. Without export fees, cocoa farmers from Côte d'Ivoire could suddenly compete more easily to get their products into Hershey's chocolate bars. Kenya's vast fields of rose flowers could find their way into your Valentine's Day bouquets. And Namibian cattle herders could ship Philadelphians their beef (for cheesesteaks, presumably). But the biggest beneficiaries of AGOA were countries like Lesotho, Madagascar, and Ethiopia, where the program offered a way to break into the global fast-fashion market, and away from mining, farming, and extracting raw materials for export. And few countries embraced the program as doggedly as Lesotho, which exported over $237 million worth of goods like golf polos, Levi's jeans, and Walmart tees to the US last year. The International Monetary Fund predicts that those tariffs will lower GDP across Africa. At a recent visit to his store in midtown Manhattan, most Trump-branded clothing showed labels from Vietnam, Taiwan, and El Salvador. Lesotho's garment workers, though, have no such flexibility. The textile industry in Lesotho was a pillar “that has been driving that country's economy,” said Shimukunku Manchishi, senior policy officer at the African Future Policies Hub. The tariffs will stifle broader investment and development in a country where most adults only live into their late 50s and almost one-third of kids are so chronically hungry that they never fully grow. More and more, African countries feel likewise, experts say, with most instead prioritizing their trading relationships with China, the European Union, and each other over an increasingly hostile US. But for a nation like Lesotho, which had become a small manufacturing powerhouse for Levi's jeans in recent years, it seems unlikely that denim will be the path to development anytime soon. Most African countries already trade more with China than they do with the US, but China's still the world's largest textile exporter — and it's unlikely to become a big market for African-made garments anytime soon. “This is a policy that is going to have adverse effects for some of the poorest people on Earth,” Hendrix said, “and provide limited, if any, benefit to the US economy.” Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NORFOLK, VA — New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is scheduled to appear Friday morning in a Virginia federal courtroom for her arraignment on mortgage fraud charges. Prosecutors contend the property was instead used as a rental investment home occupied by her grandniece's family, including a relative currently wanted on outstanding warrants in North Carolina. James is represented by Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney who currently represents former national security adviser John Bolton in his criminal classified documents case. He previously served as counsel to Hunter Biden in his gun and tax criminal cases. The James indictment came just one day after former FBI Director James Comey was arraigned in the same district on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation. Comey's case is being handled by two North Carolina-based federal prosecutors, amid reports that the Eastern District's office encountered resistance from some prosecutors when seeking charges for both defendants. Prior to Comey's indictment, then-U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned under pressure and was replaced by Halligan, who proceeded to file the charges against Comey days before the statute of limitations ran out on his alleged offenses. In court filings on Thursday, a notice in Comey's case indicated an out-of-district judge will hold a hearing on Nov. 13 to weigh Comey's challenge to Halligan's appointment, as he has maintained she was improperly installed into the office. “In the interest of efficiency and to avoid any unnecessary delay, particularly if this Court must designate this motion to an out-of-district judge, Attorney General James files the instant Notice to formally alert the Court,” a filing on her criminal court docket reads. Earlier this week, Lawfare reporter Anna Bower published a transcript of her Signal exchange with Halligan, noting that the prosecutor had enabled an auto-delete feature to erase messages after eight hours. “The story about U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's use of Signal is deeply troubling,” said Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group. “That she used the app apparently to discuss government business with a reporter, and configured her messages to disappear after eight hours, raises serious concerns that she is actively violating the Federal Records Act and the Justice Department's own records-retention rules.” American Oversight said Thursday it had submitted a public records request to obtain Halligan's Signal communications. However, former federal prosecutors told the Washington Examiner that the content of Halligan's texts, as published by Lawfare, did not appear to violate ethical obligations, though her use of disappearing messages could draw further scrutiny amid the public records request. Friday's proceeding will mark the first time a sitting New York attorney general has faced federal criminal charges. James's courtroom appearance is expected to draw national attention, given her past prominence in pursuing high-profile civil and criminal cases, including a $500 million civil fraud case she brought against Trump in the fall of 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top Trump administration officials from multiple agencies are taking steps behind the scenes toward further exposing what they say was a far-reaching scheme to weaponize the government against President Donald Trump, as one of his top allies hints the evidence could soon come together before a grand jury in Florida. Federal prosecutors in South Florida are quietly preparing a new grand jury that could set the stage for criminal charges against former Obama- and Biden-era officials accused of orchestrating an alleged yearslong conspiracy to undermine Trump during his first presidency and after his 2020 election defeat. A recently-posted order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Sept. 26 shows that Chief Judge Cecilia Altonaga authorized a grand jury to convene in Fort Pierce beginning Jan. 12, 2026. She also authorized the convening of a federal grand jury, triggered by a criminal referral from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who has suggested the evidence released by him and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard show that officials under former President Barack Obama made a coordinated attempt to invent allegations that Trump's campaign had colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. “We will leave no stone unturned to deliver justice,” Bondi said at the time. Earlier this week, Gabbard revealed that since April, a so-called Interagency Weaponization Working Group, coordinating officials at ODNI, DOJ, FBI, and CIA, among others, had been meeting biweekly to “share information, coordinate, and execute,” though the group has no clear connection to the planned grand jury proceedings in Florida. Obama spokesman Patrick Rodenbush dismissed the allegations as “outrageous” and “a weak attempt at distraction,” while former intelligence officials rejected Gabbard's conspiratorial claims. “There's no doubt South Florida is a more logical venue for this kind of case,” former federal prosecutor James Burnham posted to X at the time, noting that U.S. Attorney Jason Reding Quiñones, confirmed by the Senate in July, would likely oversee such a proceeding. “The conspiracy didn't end in 2016,” said former prosecutor David Gelman, a previous Trump 2024 campaign legal surrogate. “It's a continuation—Obama-era officials embedded in the FBI and DOJ were still trying to block Trump's reelection years later.” The push to hold Obama-era leaders accountable may explain recent remarks by one of Trump's most prominent legal allies. Gelman said Davis's comments about the Fort Pierce grand jury should be taken seriously. “If Mike thinks there's going to be a grand jury impaneled, I would take that as word. So I think it's a very relevant and appropriate place for this kind of investigation.” He added that the breadth of any potential case could surprise even close observers. You could see new individuals implicated, maybe even some heavy hitters, depending on what the evidence shows.” A separate review by CIA Director John Ratcliffe supported that finding, alleging that Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey fought to include unverified opposition research from the Steele dossier, funded by the Clinton campaign, in official intelligence assessments. Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) referred Brennan to the Justice Department for criminal investigation this week, a move largely symbolic absent evidence of contempt or obstruction, underscoring rising GOP pressure for accountability. Trump, while meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in late July, accused Obama and his senior aides of “treason” and said his administration had uncovered “irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious.” Legal experts caution that while the declassified evidence may be politically explosive, criminally charging a former president or his aides presents formidable obstacles, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's decision last year that found former presidents enjoy some immunity for official acts taken while in office. “The immunity decision only talks about things that happen while you are president,” he explained. “If Obama participated in certain things after leaving office, policy decisions, political meddling, anything illegal, he does not enjoy that protection. So yeah, Obama could potentially be a subject of an indictment if the evidence points that way. Additionally, a potential conspiracy case, rather than discrete charges, could allow prosecutors to argue that the alleged conduct forms part of a criminal scheme, effectively eliminating statute-of-limitations barriers that might otherwise protect Obama-era figures. Whether the Fort Pierce grand jury ultimately results in criminal charges against former high-ranking officials remains to be seen. But with the court order now public and Trump allies openly discussing its implications, expectations are mounting that 2026 could bring the first-ever criminal case alleging a coordinated Democratic conspiracy against a sitting or former president.</p>
