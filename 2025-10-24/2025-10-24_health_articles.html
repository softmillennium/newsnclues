                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A comprehensive study mapped the dynamic glycosylation landscape of rat serum proteins, uncovering sex- and time-dependent variations with clear cell-type specificity. Researchers found distinct cell-type-specific glycosylation patterns: liver-derived proteins carried O-acetylated Neu5Ac, while B cell-derived antibodies (IgG) exclusively utilized Neu5Gc. Female rats exhibited pronounced daily fluctuations in these sugar structures, unlike the stable profiles in males, suggesting regulation by hormonal and circadian cycles. This work provides the first integrated map of glycosylation dynamics in rat serum, establishing a foundation for future studies in comparative glycobiology and biomarker research. In this study, researchers systematically mapped the complex sugar chains (N-glycans) attached to rat serum proteins, revealing dynamic differences based on sex and time. Glycosylation--the attachment of complex sugar chains (glycans) to proteins--is a fundamental modification crucial for biological processes, and changes in these structures are often associated with development, disease, or aging. Rats serve as essential model organisms, often preferred over mice due to their greater physiological homology to humans and suitability for functional assessments. Previous research highlighted a distinctive feature of rat serum glycans: the unusually high abundance of O-acetylated N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a modification that is virtually absent in humans. Understanding how physiological factors like sex and daily cycles affect this unique glycosylation pattern is essential for validating rats in studies modeling human pathophysiology. A distinguishing feature of the approach was the separate purification and analysis of IgG, which was enzymatically cleaved into its Fab and Fc fragments to obtain cell-type-resolved insights into immune system glycosylation. The analysis confirmed that the predominant N-glycans are disialo-biantennary complex-type structures, and identified 87 glycoproteins, including protease inhibitors and immune-related proteins like complement C3. A striking finding was the cell-type-specific sialylation profile: liver-derived glycoproteins carried N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), with over half being uniquely O-acetylated (Neu5,9Ac2). In contrast, B cell-derived IgG exclusively carried Neu5Gc and entirely lacked O-acetylation. Crucially, temporal analysis showed that while male rats maintained stable sialylation levels, female rats exhibited significant day-to-day fluctuations, indicating a link to hormonal and circadian rhythms. Furthermore, IgG Fab fragments were approximately three times more sialylated (44% of glycans) than their Fc counterparts (15%). This comprehensive mapping provides a quantitative framework for future studies using rat models in glycobiology and disease research. The observed sex-dependent daily fluctuations in glycosylation patterns highlight a dynamic regulatory link between N-glycosylation and hormonal cycles, which is important for understanding protein stability and function under different physiological states. Elucidating the unique segregation of sialic acid types (Neu5Ac vs. Neu5Gc) between liver and immune tissues underscores the necessity of considering cell-type specificity, informing biomarker discovery and comparative glycoengineering.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>T cells play central roles in the adaptive immune response against cancer. Their functional inactivation is a primary driver of tumor progression, making the reactivation of T cell function a main goal in immunotherapy. The review details how T cells specifically recognize and eliminate malignant cells by engaging tumor antigen peptides presented by MHC molecules. The targets that can be recognized by T cells in tumors mainly include two types", the authors point out. Highly immunogenic, tumor-specific "neoantigens" derived from somatic mutations, and more widely shared "tumor-associated antigens" that are overexpressed in cancers. The review also illustrates how tumors evade this immune surveillance through multiple mechanisms, including suppressing T cell activation, inducing T cell exhaustion within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, undergoing immunoediting to lose target antigens, and creating physical barriers to T cell infiltration. "No single immunotherapy modality is sufficient to address the complex challenges of tumor heterogeneity, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and on-target/off-tumor toxicities," explains Professor Dong. "The future lies in rationally designed combination therapies that integrate these approaches." The review identifies two critical frontiers for current research on immunotherapy: first, the discovery of more precise tumor antigens and the establishment of corresponding T cell receptor libraries to develop broader, more specific therapies; second, a deeper mechanistic understanding of T cell biology to identify key functional subsets and biomarkers for improved patient stratification, and ultimately improving the response rate of tumor immunotherapy. This work provides a robust framework of T cell-mediated immunity and immunotherapy for researchers and clinicians, outlining a clear path toward more effective and durable immunotherapies for cancer patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A comprehensive study, led by researchers from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden has analyzed the potential effects of a food tax shift – where VAT is removed from healthy foods and levies are introduced on foods that have a negative impact on the climate. The study shows that a shift in taxes could have both environmental and human health benefits, and means that 700 fewer people in Sweden would die prematurely each year. Today, diet in many high-income countries is a leading risk factor for certain diseases and premature death. In Western Europe, unhealthy diets cause many times more deaths annually than high levels of alcohol consumption, and about as many deaths as smoking. Furthermore, what we eat also has a very negative impacts on the climate. Current policy initiatives mainly rely on providing dietary guidelines. The European Commission's own advisory body "Science Advice for Policy by European Academies" (SAPEA) has recommended the use of economic incentives to encourage healthier diets. This new study analyzed how such incentives could be implemented in practice using a food tax shift, and what effects a reform of this kind might have. The study was carried out by researchers from Chalmers University of Technology, Karolinska Institutet, and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. "Today's diets are making us sick and negatively impacting the climate. If we want to do something about this collectively, taxes and subsidies are a good way forward. Our research also shows that this can be done without the average trip to the supermarket for groceries becoming more expensive when selective taxes on certain food groups are compensated by removing VAT on other food groups," says Jörgen Larsson, researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, who led the recently published study. With a food tax shift, VAT would be removed from some foods that we should eat more of according to e.g. the recently released EAT Lancet report. The study shows that the changes in diet that a food tax shift is anticipated to lead to can prevent about 700 deaths annually among people under 70 in Sweden. This can be compared with the figure of around 200 road traffic deaths in Sweden annually. This high figure surprised us, and yet it is a conservative estimate. There is also a lot of suffering associated with unhealthy diets that is not apparent in this figure, such as living with obesity or type 2 diabetes." The food tax shift would also reduce the climate footprint of Swedes' food consumption by about 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. This is equivalent to an 8 per cent reduction in emissions from all passenger cars – or nearly one in ten cars disappearing from Sweden's roads. The researchers focused on foods with robust scientific evidence for their effects on health or the climate, where reduced consumption of beef and lamb would benefit the climate, while other measures would mainly have health-promoting effects. The study's calculations were based on current VAT levels in Sweden, and confirm that price changes have a big impact on what consumers put in their shopping trolleys. The removal of VAT would reduce the price level of these products by almost 11 per cent, leading to an increase in consumption of, for example, 10 per cent for whole grain bread and 4 per cent for fruit and vegetables. This is estimated to reduce meat consumption by 19 per cent. "While it might seem to be a big price increase, it would also lead to a decrease in meat consumption in Sweden by one-fifth – thus returning meat consumption to the same level as in the 1990s. Not everyone needs to become vegetarian for the sake of the climate, but with more moderate consumption, a lot stands to be gained," he says. Increases in the price of food usually hit low-income earners harder because this group spends a larger proportion of their income on food. In the long term, a food tax shift would benefit central government economically through better public health, reduced sick leave, and lower costs for health care," he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association (the Association), a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, have published updated guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care for newborn and pediatric populations. Experts from each organization co-led the three chapters - Pediatric Advanced Life Support, Pediatric Basic Life Support and Neonatal Resuscitation, with writing groups evenly balanced between members of the American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics. The guidelines were jointly published online Oct. 22 in Circulation and Pediatrics as part of a comprehensive update of CPR and ECC recommendations for lifesaving resuscitation. Every year, more than 7,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and approximately 20,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in infants and children in the United States. Javier Lasa, M.D., FAHA, FAAP, associate professor in critical care and cardiology at Children's Health in Dallas and volunteer co-chair of the 2025 Pediatric Advanced Life Support Writing Group It is essential that every newborn infant has a health care professional dedicated to facilitating that transition who is trained and equipped for the role using these recommendations." While an updated unified chain of survival has been developed for adults and children, a separate new newborn chain of care was created that provides a framework for considering essential elements of the health care system relating to neonatal health. The updated guidelines and CPR training materials are available in U.S. and international English-with many additional translated languages planned -so first responders, clinicians and other learners can begin using the most current, science-backed resources immediately.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health care, including cancer screening and diagnosis, especially for medically underserved populations, leading to substantial underdiagnosis of early-stage cancers in 2020. In a new study led by the American Cancer Society (ACS), scientists found that Medicaid expansion was associated with smaller declines in early-stage cancer detection among adults during the pandemic. This data suggests a protective effect of Medicaid expansion on cancer early diagnosis during the public health emergency." Scientists analyzed data among 1,844,515 individuals aged 18-64 years newly diagnosed with cancer in 2018-2022 from the National Cancer Database using a difference-in-differences (DD) approach. The results showed that the uninsured percentage among patients aged 18-64 years newly diagnosed with cancer remained stable at around 2% in Medicaid expansion states and an estimated 8% in non-expansion states. The proportion of early-stage diagnoses declined following the COVID-19 pandemic, but the decline was considerably smaller in Medicaid expansion states than in non-expansion states, particularly pronounced among patients aged 18-44 years, patients who are male with high comorbidity burden, and treated in academic facilities; the populations who were most likely to obtain insurance coverage through Medicaid expansion. "The findings also provide critical information for policymakers and the public in all states about the public health implications of upcoming large federal cuts to Medicaid programs and expected loss of insurance coverage for more than 10 million adults." "ACS CAN has long advocated for Medicaid expansion, and our work continues as states begin to contemplate how to implement the drastic changes from this summer's budget reconciliation law. These recent changes made by Congress to cut Medicaid will undo decades of progress in the fight against cancer. Increasing and protecting existing access to this critical program must be a priority nationwide if we are to end cancer as we know it, for everyone." Other ACS researchers contributing to the study include Nova Yang, MSPH, Dr. Qinjin Fan, Dr. Leticia Nogueira, Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, and senior author Dr. Robin Yabroff.

Animal studies have long shown that disrupted CSF flow hampers the clearance of toxic proteins such as amyloid beta and tau, which are central to Alzheimer's disease pathology. What makes this study significant is that it provides large-scale, human-based evidence from over 45,000 participants in the UK Biobank, confirming that MRI markers of CSF dysfunction […] are associated with higher dementia risk.” — Dr Steve Allder, consultant neurologist at Re:Cognition Health, who was not involved in the study. These algorithms can assess glymphatic functions from multiple MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans. They identified 3 biomarkers, linked to impaired glymphatic function, that predicted dementia risk over the following decade. The three biomarkers, all of which provide insights into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, were: They found that higher DTI-ALPS was associated with a lower dementia risk, whereas lower BOLD-CSF coupling and higher choroid plexus volume were associated with increased dementia risk. “When this system becomes inefficient, due to reduced CSF flow, vascular stiffness, or choroid plexus dysfunction, waste products accumulate, promoting neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage. Over time, these processes accelerate cognitive decline and increase dementia risk,” he explained. While you are sleeping, the system clears waste products, including potentially neurotoxic products, such as β-amyloid which forms plaques that interfere with nerve transmission in Alzheimer's disease, from the brain. Avoiding excessive alcohol, staying hydrated and possibly using interventions that improve arterial elasticity (e.g., aerobic fitness, dietary omega-3s) may further help preserve waste clearance efficiency.” So getting a good night's sleep could be one way to help improve your brain clearance. Experts advise several ways to improve sleep, including exercising daily, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding large meals, beverages and alcohol near bedtime, and taking time to wind down before bed in the evening. Allder said that with further validation, the findings could help lead to earlier diagnosis and preventive measures for dementia: If validated across diverse populations, these measures could be integrated into routine brain imaging protocols for at-risk individuals, especially those with cardiovascular or metabolic conditions.” Additionally, these imaging markers could serve as biomarkers in clinical trials, helping to evaluate whether therapies aimed at improving glymphatic flow (such as sleep optimization or vascular therapies) reduce dementia risk or progression,” he told MNT. In this way, it may help us identify future targets for treatment and risk reduction.” Among other questions, we ask whether sleep deprivation truly can be fatal. In this Special Feature, we question some common misconceptions about sleep, including the role of alcohol, remembering dreams, and late-night cheese. In this edition of Medical Myths, we challenge some common misconceptions that surround hypertension.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These insights could shape future modalities for tooth regeneration, replacement, and repair. Processes such as the bud-to-cap transition are mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Scientists have long known that a single tooth develops as a small bud of outer "epithelial" cells into the deeper "mesenchymal" cells. It then curves to form a cap shape and then folds in further to form the bell shape of a mature tooth, with surrounding bone and gums. Dr. Han-Sung Jung and his team at the Yonsei University College of Dentistry, Korea, extended these findings by examining how the position of young epithelial and mesenchymal dental cells would influence what they grow into and have published their findings in International Journal of Oral Science.Lead author Dr. Jung said that his team "performed this study to identify how positional identity along the lingual-buccal axis determines distinct developmental fates of dental mesenchyme. This research has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of tooth development," he says.The investigators separated the mesenchymal cells on the lingual and buccal sides at both cap and bell stages of a developing mouse embryo and -compared their gene expression profiles through RNA-seq followed by Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to understand the differences with position and time. They then transplanted the cap-stage lingual and buccal cells separately under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice to see what each grew into. Analysis showed that cells on the lingual side were mainly geared toward making the tooth itself and shaping its structure, while cells on the buccal side were more focused on stem cell activity, forming surrounding tissues, and supporting tooth growth and repair. Not surprisingly, only the lingual cells in the mouse kidney grew into tooth enamel.The researchers also reported haphazardly mixing up cap-stage, tagged buccal and lingual cells of genetically engineered mice. "We were curious to know if they could find their original place and reorganize when the fluorescently labled lingual and buccal mesenchymal cells were mixed randomly, which they not only did, but the lingual cells grew into dentin to form the tooth as before. This phenomenon is called cellular self-organization," says first author Eun-Jung Kim.Furthermore, they have extensively studied the signalling molecules in each group and found that WNT signalling and R-spondins (Rspo1/2/4) are enriched in lingual cells, along with high proliferation, low cell death, and higher migration rate, aiding tooth formation. On the other hand, buccal cells show increased expression of BMP inhibitors, lower proliferation, higher apoptosis, and slower migration, favoring bone and surrounding tissue formation.In conclusion, the authors proposed a model of dental cell positioning based on the lingual-buccal axis for tooth and surrounding tissue formation. Deeper knowledge of the molecular nuances of tooth development will inspire further research in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, which may ultimately lead to advancements in stem cell-based tooth regeneration and more effective therapeutic applications for dental restoration and repair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea that Affordable Care Act marketplaces are riddled with fraud has become a major talking point among Republicans, as lawmakers in Congress argue about whether to extend the enhanced tax credits that are helping offset the cost of health care marketplace coverage for low- and middle-income people. "The tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry," said Vice President JD Vance during a recent interview on CBS News. Key to the Republican argument of widespread fraud is a report published in August by the Paragon Health Institute, a Republican-aligned think tank. Paragon president Brian Blase said these "phantom enrollees," who don't use any medical care in a year, exceed the percentages of "what you would expect in a normal, functioning health insurance market." Blase and his team say they have quantified the percentage of zero-claim enrollees in the ACA marketplace by analyzing Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data released in August. Per that data, in 2021, the percentage of enrollments without any medical claims was 19%. To Blase and Paragon, this increase in zero-claim enrollments is evidence of fraud. It indicates, they say, that rogue insurance brokers are signing up people who don't exist, don't qualify, or have other insurance and don't need ACA coverage. "Basically, what happened is you had insurers benefit, brokers benefit financially, and just massive numbers of people got put on the program," Blase said. In 2021, former President Joe Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, which included enhanced ACA subsidies that made plans available at low or no cost to certain low-income individuals and expanded eligibility for subsidies to some middle-income people. Those credits were extended through 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed in 2022. News stories show how simple it could be for insurance brokers in certain states to sign people up for zero-cost ACA insurance plans, unbeknownst to the consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services has tried to crack down on those fraudulent practices. But health policy experts and analysts have cautioned against reading too deeply into the numbers of zero-claim enrollees. "It's not that he's wrong, but I think he's overinterpreting," said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, of Blase's analysis. Cox said there's evidence that plan-switching has increased, due in part to extended open enrollment periods. Some enrollees also may have been on an ACA plan for only part of the year, which would make them less likely to make a claim. "We're not trying to argue there is no fraud. Plenty of people don't use health care." It's not uncommon for healthy people in an insurance marketplace not to use their insurance in a given year, according to health policy experts. And with the enhanced ACA subsidies, more people signed up for marketplace coverage. Enrollment data shows that it made the marketplace population younger, and younger enrollees may be less likely to use their insurance. A recent report found that each year from 2018 to 2022, an average of 23% of enrollees in employer-sponsored plans didn't use their health insurance. "Somehow the idea that people not using health insurance is some sort of a problem — it might be. But in principle it isn't," said Joseph Antos, a health policy expert and senior fellow emeritus at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. "The point is that for insurance to work, you need some people who are not making claims on the insurance." The main trade associations for insurers and hospitals, AHIP and the American Hospital Association, have also disputed Paragon's characterization of the federal data and even published blog posts breaking down their arguments. Alumni of the organization are staffers in the Trump administration and in House Speaker Mike Johnson's office, so it follows that the group's takeaways would become Republican talking points. It's also not new for the GOP to say that government programs are full of fraud. And fraud, again, is a centerpiece of the argument for Republicans. It's a subsidy for insurance companies," Speaker Johnson said of the ACA subsidies at a shutdown press conference last week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian researchers have identified two nervous system components that drive tumor growth in gastrointestinal cancers, creating promising new avenues for treatment with existing approved therapies. Our gut contains its very own nervous system and is commonly regarded as the second brain. These factors relay messages throughout our nervous system by connecting to receptors on the outside of cells, influencing a variety of processes. This is a significant breakthrough because drugs targeting CGRP and RAMP1 are already available to treat migraine. These therapies could potentially be repurposed to treat cancer, fast-tracking the path for clinical use. Lead author of the paper published in BMJ Oncology today, Dr Pavitha Parathan, says: "We were surprised to see not only nerve fibers containing CGRP inside the tumors and potently promoting their growth, but also the tumor cells themselves producing CGRP. The good news is that there may already be drugs available to block this and halt tumor growth. "This is a druggable nerve–tumour pathway with existing therapies that are already well tolerated in other diseases, supporting ONJCRI's goal of making cancer treatments not just effective, but kinder and easier on the patient." Dr Lisa Mielke, paper senior author and Laboratory Head at ONJCRI (the La Trobe School of Cancer Medicine), says: "The role of the nervous system in cancer is an exciting new area of research, with high potential for novel treatment approaches." The next phase of our research will involve testing existing migraine therapies that inhibit CGRP to repurpose these drugs as cancer treatments."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study by University of California, Riverside, scientists has found that two toxic chemicals can form when the main ingredient in most e-cigarette fluids is heated, and that these compounds can harm human lung cells. While these chemicals are already recognized as harmful in other settings, their impact during vaping has not been well understood until now. Using lab-grown human airway tissue, the team exposed cells to realistic levels of each compound and monitored how the cells responded. Both chemicals disrupted essential cell functions, but methylglyoxal caused greater damage at much lower concentrations. It interfered with mitochondria, the structures that generate energy for cells, and weakened the actin cytoskeleton, which helps cells maintain their shape and strength. "These changes are signs of stress and injury that could contribute to long-term health problems if repeated during vaping," said Prue Talbot, a professor of the graduate division and lead author of the study published in Frontiers in Toxicology. "However, our results suggest that methylglyoxal may be even more toxic to airway cells, despite appearing in smaller quantities," she said. Man Wong, a graduate student and first author of the paper, said one particularly concerning finding is that lower-powered e-cigarette devices, often assumed to be safer, might produce higher levels of methylglyoxal. "Because nearly all e-cigarettes use propylene glycol, understanding how these byproducts form and how they affect cells is critical to evaluating the long-term health risks of vaping," Wong said. The study also showed that even short-term exposure to these chemicals can alter cellular pathways linked to energy production, DNA repair, and structural integrity. Our work helps explain how vaping-related chemicals may contribute to lung injury. We hope it guides future studies and safety evaluations of e-cigarette products."
