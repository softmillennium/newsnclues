                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defender Heather Mitts played the ball forward from her position at right back. While forward Abby Wambach chased the ball down, Morgan anticipated how the play was unfolding, as a proficient forward often does. She made an overlapping run toward goal so when Wambach flicked a header into Morgan's path, the budding star stayed composed to give herself the opportunity to score. “It was a great first goal, and I'm excited to be back at that stadium and be honored in this way so many years later.” Two Women's World Cups and an Olympic gold medal later, Morgan will have the chance to revisit that epic beginning when the U.S. Women's National Team returns to Pennsylvania for a friendly on Oct. 23. Prior to kickoff against Portugal at Subaru Park, Morgan will be honored for her illustrious career, and the first 2,000 fans through the gate will receive a limited-edition bobblehead. Wambach will be there at the stadium on Thursday to help celebrate her former forward line running mate. “To have the first assist ever be from Abby was very fitting because I had so many great years up top with her,” Morgan said. 1 goal scorer in Women's National Team history, Morgan elevated to become the team's primary target up top for the next several years. The pair scored a total of 307 goals combined during their international careers and individually finished top-5 in program history in scoring. Last fall, Morgan announced her retirement from club and country, finishing her international career with 176 combined goals and assists, the fifth most all-time. The 36-year-old is one of several notable names from a star-studded class of U.S. Women's National Team icons who have retired in the last few years including Megan Rapinoe, Julie Ertz, Becky Sauerbrunn, Meghan Klingenberg, Tobin Heath and most recently Christen Press. That run includes titles at the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, where Morgan recorded a total of seven goals across those two tournaments. For Morgan, retirement means a plethora of new opportunities that she's primed to tackle with the same fearless tenacity she displayed on the pitch. As one of the most iconic female athletes in the world, Morgan takes pride in using her position to raise awareness for female athletes and champion women's causes. “There are a lot of things that I'm doing now on the business side that I'm really proud of,” she said. “Having the background in sports has given me so much to be able to feel like I can accomplish a lot now in the business world.” Her venture fund, Trybe Ventures, which she runs with her husband Servando Carrasco, invests in early-stage companies focused on sports and health technology. Morgan's advocacy for highlighting the women's game reflects the narrative driven by fellow industry leaders such as U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes and Washington Spirit majority owner Michele Kang. These thought leaders in the sport support viewing soccer through a female lens. “The biggest thing is conversations about it,” Morgan said. “Brands having the awareness to do that and in the studies that are being looked at, in regard to them being female-specific, it is incredibly important.” With two children of her own, Morgan is also a fierce, vocal advocate for working mothers. “Parental leave is a huge thing, and as we look at support for parents in the game, the things that mothers have to go through when growing a baby is different than men,” she said. “There's a lot of things that can be looked at differently, but we're in a really good place where people now acknowledge that. We're evolving when it comes to women's sports and looking at that from a different lens.” She also wants to see European-style academies develop at women's clubs in the United States so kids have a better steppingstone to enter the game. But after more than 15 years of rigorous training and constant competition, both internationally and on the club level, Morgan is also allowing herself to take a well-earned breath. “Before retiring, I never had a weekend free – it just didn't exist as an athlete,” Morgan explained.</p>

GOAL US writers discuss the biggest USMNT developments as Mauricio Pochettino continues the build up to 2026 World Cup

It's time for a U.S. soccer check in. With the World Cup now less than eight months away, the national team is always simmering. There are stars playing for big sides in Europe, and plenty of action in domestic soccer, too.

Tim Weah has enjoyed a solid start to life at Marseille. Tanner Tessmann has gone from hipster pick to irrelevant to suddenly a key figure for Mauricio Pochettino's side. For those USMNT players in MLS, a few names that didn't figure to have a shot a few months ago might yet be in the national team picture next summer

GOAL US writers break down the biggest storylines in the national team in the latest edition of... The Rondo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHESTER, Pa. – In the words of U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes, there's nothing that Alex Morgan didn't achieve. Two FIFA Women's World Cup titles, an Olympic gold medal, fifth all-time in USWNT scoring, a distinguished legacy to her name, Morgan will go down in history as one of the all-time greats for the U.S. Women's National Team. Morgan, who retired from soccer last fall, will be celebrated for her remarkable accomplishments and illustrious career prior to the upcoming U.S. Women's National Team match against Portugal on Thursday, Oct. 23. The pre-match celebration has garnered excitement from U.S. players present and past, including Abby Wambach. The program's all-time leading scorer assisted Morgan's first-ever USWNT goal, which also came in Chester, Pennsylvania, and will be in attendance Thursday to show her support. The 14-year international, who finished with 224 caps for the U.S., has left an indelible legacy on soccer fans everywhere, which includes some of her former teammates: “Stepping into this National Team and seeing what she's done prior on the field and off the field, and the role model that she's become and what she stands for with U.S. Soccer, she's taken on the job of being the face of our National Team for so long but fought for so many things for us and made our lives easier growing up on this team. She's been such a crucial person in the team itself. “Individually, I had the pleasure of being co-captains with her in the 2023 World Cup, and I think I got to see more ins and outs of what it takes to be that kind of player for this team. She's earned 38 caps with the U.S. Women's National Team entering October, though sometimes it feels like Sam Coffey has been around for much longer. For a while, Coffey was simply an admirer of Morgan and had a poster of the USWNT legend hanging up inside her childhood bedroom. Every young girl growing up and playing is like, ‘I love Alex Morgan.' I had a poster of her on my wall. I've learned so much from her, both on and off the field.” “She's like a hero for all of us and is someone that epitomizes what it means to leave something better than you found it.” Like Heaps, Rose Lavelle was part of a championship roster with Morgan in 2019. “Alex has influenced my career so much, on and off the field. What she's done and continues to do for women's sports in general has been huge. She's taught me so much, and now being in a position where I'm now a veteran leader, having her to look up to and learn from leading up to this moment has really been huge and has put all of us in a better position to be the best versions of ourselves.” Although their time together was brief – Morgan played just once under Hayes, a match against Korea Republic on June 4, 2024, in Hayes' second official match in charge – Hayes has been entrenched in the sport for decades. She was a player that epitomized everything this program is about. You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan, and I think the sport should show a lot of gratitude to that because it's important for our players to be recognizable and she is, without question in recent times, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport. “I love this tradition when we honor our players in retirement. I know the fans will be coming out, not just to support us, but absolutely to acknowledge what a wonderful career she had. She had so many telling moments that were difference-making moments in her career and the impact she's had on this team is immeasurable.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premiership Women's Rugby has one overriding target for the new season – more eyeballs than ever. Be it on television, via social media, or of course, in the stadium, the world's top women's club competition is eager to attract new supporters. Off the back of a record-breaking Rugby World Cup, won by the Red Roses in front of a sold-out crowd at Allianz Stadium, women's rugby is surfing a wave of momentum, and PWR executive chair Genevieve Shore knows it is crucial to capitalise on that success as the league prepares to get back underway this weekend. Harlequins, who count England superstar Ellie Kildunne among their number, will get the ball rolling at home to Loughborough Lightning on Friday night, while the opening weekend will draw to a close with a repeat of last year's final as champions Gloucester Hartpury host Saracens. That makes Shore, a World Cup winner in her own right back in 1994, a very busy woman this week - but she would not have it any other way. If the feedback we are getting from them is good, then I'll be happy. Just a month on from that final success at Twickenham, PWR is hoping to maintain the interest that was evident over the course of a tournament which set attendance records from start to finish. As well as the Red Roses, who all played their club rugby in PWR, there was a huge contingent from the league featured in other countries, including finalists Canada. “65% of our players are England qualified and can play for the Red Roses. That is a lot of players and at any one time, there are only 23 people who can play for the Red Roses, they have plenty to choose from. “We want to make sure those Red Roses are playing competitive rugby every single week. It's important to make sure the international competitions keep growing. Shore and PWR have some examples to follow close to home, with the Lionesses having enjoyed European Championship success in 2022 and again this summer. Shore said: “We've had a good period of time to think it through. “We've really carefully looked at what works well for them and what works for other major sporting tournaments across Europe and in this country. As well as the hope for increased attendances, there are also plans in place to increase female representation on coaching staffs, after a summer that saw the league's only two female head coaches move on from their positions. In conjunction with the RFU, PWR have commissioned a research project to look at some of the obstacles currently faced by female coaches and what can be done to remove them, with the results due to be published in February. Likewise, current referee Holly Wood has been empowered to work on a fast-track project for female match officials. Now come and see those same brilliant women play in the PWR.” Keep up with all the news from Premiership Women's Rugby at thepwr.com</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifteen years ago, Alex Morgan introduced herself to U.S. football fans with her first goal in Chester, Pennsylvania. The arc of her phenomenal career, in which she bloomed into a global icon, had come full circle—ending where it began. “It was a great first goal and I'm excited to be back at the stadium to be honoured this way so many years later.” Few could have predicted just how much of a global powerhouse the then 21-year-old would go on to become. Achievements on the pitch speak volumes – multiple World Cup titles, Olympic medals, and 123 goals in 224 appearances. Morgan's activism is another aspect that sets her apart. Her fight for better conditions domestically and on the national team has ensured that the California native retires from a sport in much better condition than when she came into it.

She is, without question, one of the most recognisable faces in our sport.” “Just know that I fought for my team on the pitch and I fought for myself and my team off it.” “I am part of the ownership group and intend to have an active role,” she told FIFA. “I am continuing to stay active in other ways like with my media company, which focuses on women's sports and highlights female athletes in general. “There are always threads that keep me busy and connected to the sport—I also have a foundation which is a vehicle for girls to gain self-esteem and confidence, with girls' empowerment camps.” Morgan helped redefine the sport, leaving a legacy that lives on in others who dare to dream because she showed them what was possible.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kasey Keller making a save at the 2006 World Cup (Photo by Christof Koepsel/Bongarts/Getty Images) Kasey Keller is a true U.S. Men's National Team legend. A four-time World Cup veteran, he was the starting goalkeeper in two of the four tournaments he played — in 1998 and 2006 — and delivered countless memorable performances across his 102 appearances for the United States. Among his international highlights are four Concacaf Gold Cup titles and a semi-final run at the 1995 Copa América in Uruguay, where the USMNT famously upset Argentina 3–0. He made ten saves that day, prompting Brazilian striker Romário to call it “the greatest goalkeeping performance” he had ever seen. Keller ranks second all-time among USMNT goalkeepers with 53 wins and recorded 47 clean sheets. His club career was equally distinguished, featuring successful spells in England, Germany, and Spain before finishing his playing days in MLS with the Seattle Sounders. In a sit-down interview with RG, Keller reflects on his transition from player to pundit and tackles some of the tougher questions surrounding U.S. Soccer — from the challenges faced by the so-called “Golden Generation,” to defining what success should look like at the 2026 World Cup, to why former stars of his caliber remain largely absent from the national team's leadership structure. How important was it for you to find something meaningful to do after retiring, and how did that path into media and ownership come about — was it something that happened naturally, or did it take some time to figure out? But the reality is most players retire in their mid-30s. I was lucky — I almost played until my 42nd birthday, just a few weeks shy — but most are done much earlier. And when you think about it, how much money would you have to make in a short career to maintain the same lifestyle for the rest of your life if you retire at 34 or 35? So even from a financial standpoint, most players realize they'll need to do something after they retire. When you've spent your entire life waking up with a purpose — training, preparing for a match, studying opponents — suddenly having nothing to prepare for can leave a big void. People say, “Oh, it must be great to retire and do whatever you want,” but after a while, that lack of focus can be tough. If you want to stay in the game, there are really three main paths: coaching, front office, or media. For me, media made the most sense because of my family. When we moved back to the U.S., my kids started sixth grade — their fifth school in their fourth country. I didn't want to uproot them again. I started with the Seattle Sounders' local broadcasts, which also included an ambassador role with the club. Then I signed a full-time contract with ESPN. What I loved about broadcasting after 20 years as a player was having some control over my schedule. Of course, if there was a match on the weekend, I couldn't just skip it, but during the week, I had flexibility — something I never had as a player. In my entire career, I'd only missed training for things like my kids' births or a medical emergency. And his response was, “Yeah, of course, just call me later and we'll go over what was said.” I was shocked — that kind of flexibility doesn't exist when you're playing. – Looking at U.S. Soccer now from a bit of distance, how do you see the program's overall progress since your playing days? Would you say it has continued to move forward, or has it stagnated — maybe even taken a step back in some areas? – I think it's a bit of both. There have been periods, especially after the U.S. qualified for the 1990 World Cup, where we probably overachieved in some of our results. And I think that early success created a false sense of expectation — that our progress would be steady and linear. Some of that overachievement made people believe we'd reached that same level, when in reality, we were still developing the structure and depth needed to sustain it. I remember being part of a panel at the MIT Sloan Analytics Conference, and one of the questions was, “Why hasn't the U.S., with 350 million people, produced a Messi or a Ronaldo?” Not long before that, my wife and I were on vacation in Costa Rica. The sport is a national obsession there. But during that same trip, not a single American tourist stopped me to talk about football. And that, to me, sums it up. In most countries, football is the dream — every kid grows up wanting to play for their national team. In the U.S., there are a hundred different dreams. There's nothing wrong with that diversity, but it means our focus as a sporting culture is spread across so many directions. In places like Argentina or Brazil, it's simple — if you're not going to be a footballer, then you figure out what else to do. – When Mauricio Pochettino came in, he talked a lot about building a new culture within the national team. But it raises the question — what culture are we talking about changing? Because your generation had already built something strong. You guys competed well in Copa Américas, won Gold Cups, and were consistently successful. So do you think this idea of “changing the culture” overlooks some of what was already working before, or is it based on what he saw with this current squad? I remember when I was at Leicester, one of my assistant coaches — a former Scottish international — used to give me a hard time whenever I missed a few club games for World Cup qualifiers. He'd say, “Why are you worried about that? You'll beat those teams easily.” And I told him, “Really? How many World Cup group stages has Scotland ever made it out of?” What I really liked in these last few matches was that we finally started talking about football again — tactics, movement, missed chances — instead of questioning effort and mentality. I actually talked about this once with Thierry Henry. Maybe they weren't the best team technically, but if you didn't bring the same fight, you'd be embarrassed.” And he said recently he's noticed a bit of that slipping away. And he's right — we're not at a stage yet where pure talent alone can win games against top teams. Back when I was playing for Leicester against Manchester United or Arsenal, we couldn't just go out and play our football and hope for the best. – We're now seeing more U.S. players competing at top clubs and doing well, which is great. But when we talk about culture, I sometimes wonder about the difference between American players and, say, Uruguayans. In Uruguay, each new generation grows up trying to meet the standard set by those before them — like Godín following players such as Paolo Montero. Do you think that lack of an established tradition or benchmark could be part of the challenge when it comes to building a lasting football culture? – That's an interesting point, because while some of our players are now at big clubs, those clubs aren't what they used to be. To be fair, many of these players have had very good individual seasons. That's what's happening now: talented players doing well individually, but not necessarily leading top teams to success. They've reached those big stages, but not necessarily during the club's strongest period, so they aren't yet establishing themselves as true stars competing for major titles. In earlier years, American players often didn't even get the chance to join top teams, simply because they were American. Now that they do, it's progress — but we're still waiting for someone to take that next step and really become a defining figure at the highest level. What's interesting is that while people call this a “golden generation,” there are also areas where we've gone backwards. There was a time when several American goalkeepers were starting regularly in the Premier League at the same time. And yet, we keep hearing that we're producing more great players — but the results don't quite show that in some positions. And finally, just because a player performs well abroad doesn't automatically mean it translates to the national team. I always say, if someone has multiple nationalities, the key question isn't about talent — it's about identity. Because when it's 90 degrees, in tough conditions, playing in a difficult away qualifier, I need players who are 100% committed. If you're only choosing the U.S. because it's your best chance to play in a World Cup, that's not enough. Two knockout round games at the World Cup? – I always look at the World Cup draw and ask myself: should the U.S. get out of that group? That group had Germany, Portugal, and Ghana — all very strong teams. In that case, it's hard to argue the U.S. should have advanced. – Then, given how the federation has danced around and many pundits have said that it's only about what happens at the World Cup, maybe doing well at the World Cup would only validate the immediate result and may make winning Gold Cups, Nations Leagues, or Copa Americas even less of a priority? Even historically strong countries face struggles, and it's about understanding the bigger picture. I also believe in putting a team on the field that can win every game. You can't rotate players just for the sake of giving everyone a chance in friendlies — those matches often don't reflect the true strength of the team. World Cup qualifying is different because it forces you to play the players who matter. The challenge in recent years has been too many meaningless matches, constant rotation, and coaching changes. Every time a new coach comes in, they expand the net to see everyone, which makes the process feel disjointed and false. It's hard to build momentum or culture in that environment. – Why haven't players like you or an Eddie Pope or other past USMNT stars transferred into coaching youth national teams, like say former players do with Argentina or Uruguay? Jürgen Klinsmann wanted to bring in some new talent and called me to ask if I could step in as the goalkeeping coach for a Gold Cup. At the time, I was broadcasting, and my contract had a clause that if I missed matches, my pay could be affected. I told him, “Jürgen, I can't commit without checking with the club.” The Sounders and Seahawks thought it was a great idea — having their local broadcast analyst on the national team was excellent exposure. So I called Jürgen back and said, “The club's fine with it, but here's what I'll be giving up to make it work. I'll bring it up with U.S. Soccer.” A short time later, he came back and said, “U.S. I called him and told him, “I will never do that again.” If U.S. Soccer doesn't value me enough to make up the difference after what I've given to the program, people hesitate to get involved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kasey Keller making a save at the 2006 World Cup (Photo by Christof Koepsel/Bongarts/Getty Images) Kasey Keller is a true U.S. Men's National Team legend. A four-time World Cup veteran, he was the starting goalkeeper in two of the four tournaments he played — in 1998 and 2006 — and delivered countless memorable performances across his 102 appearances for the United States. Among his international highlights are four Concacaf Gold Cup titles and a semi-final run at the 1995 Copa América in Uruguay, where the USMNT famously upset Argentina 3–0. He made ten saves that day, prompting Brazilian striker Romário to call it “the greatest goalkeeping performance” he had ever seen. Keller ranks second all-time among USMNT goalkeepers with 53 wins and recorded 47 clean sheets. His club career was equally distinguished, featuring successful spells in England, Germany, and Spain before finishing his playing days in MLS with the Seattle Sounders. In a sit-down interview with RG, Keller reflects on his transition from player to pundit and tackles some of the tougher questions surrounding U.S. Soccer — from the challenges faced by the so-called “Golden Generation,” to defining what success should look like at the 2026 World Cup, to why former stars of his caliber remain largely absent from the national team's leadership structure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Hayes was far from happy with how her team played. Standing on the sideline of a mostly silent Subaru Park as her U.S. women's national team lost to Portugal on Thursday, Emma Hayes felt stuck in “a game of Whac-A-Mole.” For the first time in her 17 months in charge, she watched her players try to solve problems as individuals rather than as the collective that rolled through her first 17 games unbeaten, including a gold medal run at the 2024 Olympics. “I don't think anybody came out with flying colors,” Hayes said when asked about a few specific players. “I think as a team, we were poor, to be honest with you.” She told the players exactly that and more in an animated, minutes-long speech on the field after the game, with starters, substitutes and staff all huddled in a circle around her. “I think everyone was trying to maybe fix it on their own,” said midfielder Rose Lavelle, who scored the USWNT's only goal 33 seconds into the game. “Defensively,” Hayes said, “from front to back, we just mistimed everything.” “We could have solved things a bit earlier on,” Heaps said. “A lot of things did not go our way, in terms of playing together, playing as a team, doing things together,” Heaps said. “Sometimes it felt a little bit like we were on islands.” Not the team that grinded to Olympic gold; nor the one that won five straight matches, by an aggregate score of 18-0, this summer; not even the team that lost to Japan or split a back-to-back with Brazil earlier this year. Those losses, to international powers, were understandable; the performances were creditable and the team, as Hayes said, was “still working on our principles.” They were outscored 8-2 at the 2025 Women's European Championship, with five of those goals coming from Spain, failing to make it out of the group stage. Hayes added: “Sometimes, when the panic gets in the head, or you try to do something, instead of starting to do the things we want you to do, it just felt like we didn't get a rhythm the whole night.” Their lack of rhythm, which Hayes referenced in yells from the touchline mid-game, seemed to spiral. She later continued: “I wanted to calm the game down. But once we miss that next pass, it's like, ‘S***. That time, under the leadership of former head coach Vlatko Andonovski, the U.S. settled for its first draw against Portugal, a scoreless affair capping a poor group stage performance. The U.S. lost the following knockout round game to Sweden in penalty kicks, making its earliest World Cup exit in program history. But it was the entire 90 minutes that frustrated her. On multiple occasions, she, her staff and the players tried to tweak their tactical approach, but “I still don't think we got a grip of the game,” she said. Her attitude afterwards, however, was not so gloomy. “Sometimes you need a kick up the backside like that,” Hayes said. And this, of course, was a kick up the backside in an October 2025 friendly, not a June 2027 World Cup game in Brazil. Players arrived Monday, some after Sunday games; they trained Tuesday and Wednesday, and even then, “I actually felt it,” Hayes said. Just taking a bit of time for us to get on the same page.” Then, on Thursday, they played together for the first time in more than 100 days. “We've had two days of training; you gotta remember that. They were, after all, without center back Naomi Girma and forward Trinity Rodman, due to injury, as well as several other key players. The back four — Avery Patterson, Tara McKeown, Emily Sonnett and Emily Fox — were starting together for the first time. And more importantly, all of them, players and coaches, are still at an experimental phase of their build toward 2027. When asked how she would assess Thursday's game in that context, Hayes began: “As Ben Northey, the Sydney Philharmonic conductor, would say, ‘let it go. They will travel to Connecticut on Friday to play Portugal again on Sunday, this time at Rentschler Field in East Hartford. “And I promise you, we will be better.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a sport where communication it critical, the U.S. men's deaf soccer team finds its own ways to stay connected. “It's a mixture of eye contact, recognition of the game, IQ and ASL, sign language,” says forward Michael Schmidt, 36, one of the oldest and most accomplished players on the U.S. team. “In a way, deaf players are smarter, because we have to use our eyes more. Coaches are telling us to use your eyes all time, and this is the perfect way; you can't use your voice, you have to use your eyes more. U.S. women's soccer team will have star Trinity Rodman back for its match at Rentschler Field The U.S. team won bronze at the Pan American Games last year in Brazil, clinching with a 4-0 win over Mexico to qualify. “It's very different from what I expected,” says Tate Lancaster, who has been with the team since 2020. “I grew up with only one other classmate in school who had hearing aids as well, but we didn't really converse well with each other. But coming onto this team, I really learned how to communicate with sign language, and get back into this whole other community that I didn't really know much about.” Many have played high school or college soccer despite their hearing impairment, but there they were allowed to wear their hearing aids. In international competitions, players are told to “take your ears out” before the games begin. To be eligible, players have hearing loss of at least 55 decibels, the borderline between moderate and moderately severe, in their better ear. “You can't communicate quickly enough by signing while passing the ball,” Schmidt says, “so it's visual, you have to be prepared, two or three plays ahead. Every camp, we make sure we have about 20 important signals, get in line, come closer, check two, turn, common language that soccer players know, but it's visual.” Interpreters use sign language, or tablets with written instructions to convey the messaging of coaches and trainers as players huddle up. “The vibe is great energy and a community feel,” coach Everett Palache says. That was the biggest thing I stepped into, like ‘holy crap, these guys really like hanging out with each other.' Since 2022, the program has been a fully-funded part of the U.S. Soccer Federation, along with other extended teams including the women's deaf team, Cerebral Palsy (CP) team, power team, which uses wheelchairs, beach soccer and futsol, or five-on-five soccer. There are specially-designed spaces for the extended teams at U.S. Soccer's Atlanta headquarters. It's a significant moment to reach out to all players out there and say ‘hey, you can achieve your dreams.' Dom Amore: Dan Hurley, Rick Pitino bring old-school fire to a new era of the Big East Originally from Cleveland, Schmidt joined the team in 2014 after a local college coach forwarded him an e-mail about tryouts. In a fifth-place game against England, Schmidt scored the winning goal as the fourth kicker in an OT shootout. “I just remember doing the celebration my family and friends told me to do,” Schmidt says. Lancaster, from Overland Park, Kansas, graduated from Baker University, but found himself idle and bored during the pandemic when he saw a notice for a tryout in Louisville on social media. He traveled on his own expense, made the team and is now back into soccer, coaching at the youth level back home in Kansas City, as well as playing. We come up with key words, condense a lot of our phrases, quick signs, we kind of come up with our own language within the team. The chance to play on television Sunday will give two young players he has been coaching in Kansas City the chance to watch Lancaster on a big stage. “I hope kids see that they can do the same thing,” Lancaster says. “A couple of kids back home, they're hard of hearing and kind of going through a hard time, playing with other kids who are hearing and they're struggling to fit in. This game gives them that outlet, so I hope when they see us on TV, see me playing back home, they have the realization that I can do whatever I set their mind to.” Playing for the U.S. team has changed his life in multiple ways. He met his fiancé, Gracie Fitzgerald, who plays on the U.S women's deaf team. “I have this team to thank for it,” he says. The team prides itself on its speed and quickness. Palache, who was brought 20 years of coaching experience to the job in 2024, realized during a trip to Washington and a game against Alexandria (Va.) Soccer Association that he was in the right place. “That really showed us our grit and our desire and I knew that they had another level to them,” Palache says. The profile that we're looking for is resiliency, athleticism, adaptability. … We do something called a legacy letter, get them to think about what is their purpose, and everyone said they want to leave a legacy they can live up to, and inspire the next generation that it's possible.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brighton forward is playing the best football of his career at 34 and Thomas Tuchel could have a vacancy next summer An 18-month contract as a one-shot deal – North America or bust – little need to plan for the future. Though Harry Kane is immovable, undroppable, there may yet be a vacancy for an athletic, intelligent, hard-working forward, capable of linking play and leading the press, should Ollie Watkins or Dominic Solanke falter. Anyone meeting the demands of modern forward play: apply within. The top-scoring Englishmen in this season's Premier League on four each are Burnley's uncapped Jaidon Anthony, also eligible for Jamaica, and Danny Welbeck, whose last game for his country was at the 2018 World Cup. His finishing, as shown by predatory strikes for Brighton against Newcastle, gets better with age. Calmness in the midst of a pell-mell match secured three points. He is 35 next month, and at Brighton, the club he joined as a free agent in 2020, after a season at Watford, is playing the best football of his career, his goal average per game – 0.36 – higher than in his 20s or as a teenage forward for Manchester United. No non-celebration celebration to follow scoring against his former club; the smile is broad. It is 11 years since Welbeck left United, recent arrival Louis van Gaal finding no place for him in a forward line that had Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney. That summer of 2014, United imported Radamel Falcao and Ángel Di María, where Welbeck had been the fruit of the club's admired, cherished youth system. Welbeck was early collateral for attempts to modernise after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure, a process still far from completion. He began – and continues – the trend of former United players flourishing away from Old Trafford's sapping turf. From the same Fletcher Moss nursery club that provided United with Wes Brown and Marcus Rashford, Welbeck was one of Ferguson's final fledglings. In Ferguson's final Champions League match, a last-16 encounter in March 2013, he started Welbeck instead of Rooney, Welbeck's energy causing huge problems for Real Madrid, only for a scoring touch to desert him. At Arsenal, an inability to finish chances his movement had created was labelled a weakness. Still, Arsène Wenger, having snatched him from Tottenham's grasp in 2014, remained a confirmed admirer. Welbeck had the faith of two managerial greats but also experienced sore luck with injuries, missing Euro 2016 with a knee injury. He signed for Watford after a broken ankle had concluded his Arsenal career. At Brighton, Welbeck has made use of hi-tech facilities and the staff's expertise in recovery to enjoy an Indian summer, an experienced hand in one of world football's prime talent factories, his dependability an asset as potential – and coaching regimes – comes in and out. Brought in when Graham Potter was manager, before enjoying a close working relationship with Roberto De Zerbi, he has partnered a number of forwards, of varying skill sets, from Glenn Murray and Neal Maupay to Evan Ferguson and João Pedro. Georginio Rutter, who supplied the first against Newcastle, is his latest regular accomplice. Often on the flanks at United and Arsenal, he has played centrally almost exclusively. After the Newcastle win, Brighton's head coach, Fabian Hürzeler, close to three years younger than Welbeck, set aside the goals, instead hailing the overall package: “When we look at his performance, how many times did he help us defend the goal, how many recovery runs? … It's about how he is as a leader.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Women's National Soccer Team played a friendly match against Portugal at Subaru Park in Chester and fans were thrilled to see their soccer heroes, including Alex Morgan. CHESTER, Pa. - Soccer fans had a night to remember as the US Women's National Team faced off against Portugal at Subaru Park. The atmosphere was electric, with many young girls excited to see their heroes up close. "Look around there are so many young girls here right now who are so excited to go in and see their heroes," said a spectator. Becky Pierce, who traveled from Bloomsburg, Pa., with her family, shared, "We got Harper involved in soccer at a really young age and she loves it. This is her first US Women's soccer game and I hope she continues to love the sport as much as I did growing up." I have 2 daughters so having the ability to show them women's soccer here in Philly is really cool." There is growing momentum for Philadelphia to secure a National Women's Soccer League expansion team. Jen Leary from Watch Party PHL hosted a pre-game tailgate and emphasized the importance of support, saying, "Especially with FIFA coming I think now is the time to really show there is support for a team here and there is excitement." Lucy Fillipelli, a young soccer player, said, "It's fun and inspirational because I have been watching these people play for a while and it's kind of unrealistic to actually see them in person." It was Portugal's first every victory against the USWNT. The US Men's National Team is also scheduled to play a friendly match against Paraguay at Subaru Park on November 15th.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. women's national team lost 2-1 to Portugal at Subaru Park in Chester, Pa., on Thursday, opening the October international window with a flat performance as they begin preparations for the 2027 World Cup in Brazil. Portugal capitalized on a defensive lapse in the 41st minute, with Diana Gomez scoring an equalizer off a corner, punishing the U.S. backline. Portugal's second goal came in the 73rd minute from Fatima Pinto on a similar set piece. Thursday night's performance served as a reminder that, for all the talk of progress, head coach Emma Hayes still has plenty of work to do to build her roster for next year's World Cup qualifiers. For the first time in as long as anybody on-site could remember, the USWNT conceded not once but twice from corner kicks. Midfielder Sam Coffey let Portugal's Diana Gomes drift away from her. Defender Avery Patterson was backing away from it, leaving Gomes free to head home an equalizer in the 41st minute. The second Portugal score seemed to be more unfortunate than lackluster. Lavelle challenged Fátima Pinto for the initial ball. A couple of U.S. defenders were then slow to the second ball, allowing Pinto to beat goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce with a clean shot from the penalty spot. “I have to put my hand up on the second one,” Lavelle said. “That was my mark, so I have to be better and just like boot it out and get a better clearance.” Portugal score off another corner to take a 2-1 lead over USA 😲 pic.twitter.com/H2onl5AYoE Perhaps the Americans missed their defensive mainstay, Naomi Girma. But Emily Sonnett, Tara McKeown and others have defended hundreds, if not thousands, of corners in their national team and NWSL careers. She settled the ball and, with a quick turn, shot it through two defenders. The tally stood despite Lavelle appearing to play from an offside position. Four days ago, we saw some “Rose Lavelle magic” when the 30-year-old scored off a free kick, helping Gotham clinch their place in the upcoming NWSL playoffs. Lavelle has the second-most caps on this roster, second only to captain Lindsey Heaps and with only three more caps than defender Sonnett. It is fitting that Lavelle scored one of the fastest goals in U.S. women's soccer history on the same night as U.S. Soccer honored Alex Morgan. She is, after all, believed to hold the record for fastest goal ever scored, with her 12-second goal against Costa Rica in 2016. Before Thursday, the USWNT had not conceded a goal since April 8. Even without several stars, including the most recent scratch of Trinity Rodman, it rolled through friendlies against China, Jamaica, Ireland and Canada — four very respectable opponents. After Lavelle's goal, Portugal controlled much of the first half, with more shots and 59 percent possession through 45 minutes. “I think we gotta find a way to get control of the ball,” an apparently frustrated Lavelle told the TNT broadcast at halftime. Portugal's Catarina Amado snuck behind fullback Avery Patterson on the first set piece. Center back McKeown whiffed on a clearance in the box, and goalkeeper Tullis-Joyce had to bail her out with an impressive save. The USWNT's October roster is full of youth. But at her pre-match news conference Wednesday, Hayes spoke glowingly about her three most experienced players, Lavelle, Heaps and Sonnett. “It makes me smile thinking about them,” Hayes said. And then she made a serious point: “You can't compete to win without experience.” Several exciting youngsters, such as Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton and Ally Sentnor, had to settle for places on the bench. In the very first minute, Lavelle validated that choice with her goal (albeit as offside as it looked), and Sonnett made a few key interventions. But Sonnett also got outjumped on the first Portuguese goal. Portugal was able to break 3-v-3 on multiple occasions, through or around the U.S. midfield. Some of those subs, and others, should get a chance to start against Portugal on Sunday or against New Zealand next week. Sunday, Oct. 26 vs. Portugal, in East Hartford, Conn.
