In 1967, Charles Chaplin directed his final film, “The Countess From Hong Kong.” An ill-fated project doomed by the differences in working methods of director Chaplin and star Marlon Brando, “Countess” broke Chaplin's spirit — and his ankle when he tripped in the studio during production. By then, he no longer bore any resemblance to the inspired artist behind masterpieces like “The Great Dictator,” “Monsieur Verdoux,” and “Limelight.” Yet not long after the artistic and commercial failure of “Countess,” Chaplin's imagination got fired up again when he conceived of “The Freak,” an allegorical fantasy about a young woman born with wings whose condition attracts both the best and worst of humanity. At the age of 80, Chaplin not only wrote a complete script for the film but had wings built, designed sets, oversaw a shooting schedule and budget, and had an artist storyboard many of the shots. Related Stories ‘A House of Dynamite' Review: We're All F**ked in Kathryn Bigelow's Horrifically Gripping and Hopeless Nuclear Missile Thriller ‘The Eyes of Ghana' Review: An African Nation's Most Important Camera Operator Finally Gets the Hollywood Treatment Another was Chaplin's deteriorating health; though he felt invigorated by the prospect of a new project, his wife Oona feared that the movie's logistical challenges would kill him and secretly worked to keep the film from ever moving forward. The volume is a treasure trove for Chaplin enthusiasts, containing everything from the auteur's handwritten script notes and wing designs to production documents and miscellania like a list of film prints Chaplin reserved for personal viewing (among them “Barbarella” and “The Absent-Minded Professor”). The archival material is organized and annotated by Chaplin biographer David Robinson and editor Cecilia Cenciarelli, who have done essential work here detailing Chaplin's biggest final burst of creativity. Robinson uses the documentation to provide signposts for a narrative in which he takes the reader step-by-step through Chaplin's creative process, a valuable endeavor even when related to a never-completed film — maybe even especially for a film that was never completed, as this is the closest we'll ever come to sharing Chaplin's final dream along with him. Anyone who has consumed the Criterion Collection's indispensable editions of Chaplin masterworks knows he was a unique director with a time-consuming approach that yielded great films only after many false starts and turns down blind alleys. The deep dive into Chaplin's working methods is compelling and illuminating, and the shooting script itself shows that the always politically and philosophically probing Chaplin hadn't lost any of his fire or originality in his old age.

Depending on who you ask, Kwame Nkrumah is either a hero tragically robbed of the opportunity to see his visions materialize or a narcissistic would-be dictator. The first prime minister and president of Ghana, Nkrumah oversaw the African country's peaceful separation from Great Britain and became a passionate advocate for Pan-Africanism. He called for African nations to unite as a body that he dreamed of calling the United States of Africa, believing that unifying to control the continent's natural resources would allow Africa to free itself from colonial influences and become a major player on the world stage. But he also embraced authoritarian tactics like declaring Ghana a one-party state with himself as president for life, eventually leading to a coup that toppled statues of him and forced him out of power for life. Related Stories ‘Bugonia' Review: Jesse Plemons Tries to Save the World from Emma Stone in Yorgos Lanthimos' Blunt Big-Pharma Hostage Thriller Scott Cooper Is Realizing His ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere' Might Not Be What Most Audiences Are Expecting Like so many great figures of history, Nkrumah is a complicated person, one who preached lofty ideas that his own human nature prevented him from consistently living up to. But if anyone can claim to truly know him, it would be Chris Hesse. The 90-year-old reverend served as Nkrumah's personal filmmaker throughout his tenure leading Ghana, following him around the world with a camera as he met with leaders like John F. Kennedy and tried to rally the heads of other African states to join his cause. Hesse's films were all burned during the 1966 coup that ousted Nkrumah, but the filmmaker secretly maintained an archive of his negatives in London. Even as a nonagenarian, he continues to make the trip from Ghana to London each year to ensure that his life's work is being kept safe, holding onto the hope that the archive will be digitized and his side of the Nkrumah story will finally be told. Hesse is starting to lose his vision — a reality that a man who spent his life looking through a camera is unwilling to accept just yet — but his passion for filmmaking hasn't dulled in the slightest. As he tells it, Nkrumah saw how Hollywood movies helped forge a coherent cultural identity and thought Ghana could achieve something similar with a strong government-backed film industry (yet another choice that toes the line between liberal support of the arts and authoritarian tendencies). He built an entire studio ecosystem, and the nation was filled with cinema palaces showing both American and Ghanaian films to crowds of eager moviegoers. Hesse is infectiously charismatic, and seeing 15 minutes of his film footage digitized for the first time is a treat for history buffs. The question of Nkrumah is more complicated: Hesse clearly reveres his late boss and believes he got an unfair shake from Western media, who were threatened by his anti-capitalist, pro-Africa views. Hesse insists that he's not trying to sway anyone's opinion one way or another; he just wants his films to be seen so that his country's history can be documented and people can form their own ideas about Nkrumah's legacy. That comes across as a half-truth — it's apparent that he believes that his films will cause the world to see his friend in a more positive light — but it's hard to argue with the notion that our understanding of history would be better off if we had access to more primary sources about a complicated but highly influential figure. A skilled documentarian who has won two of the previous three Oscars for Best Documentary Short, Proudfoot clearly understands the goldmine that his subject provides. Proudfoot and his team, including Kris Bowers, pull all the right (if predictable) emotional strings, underscoring Hesse's memories with majestic orchestral music fit for an Old Hollywood epic. The camera team finds angles that capture the twinkle in Hesse's eye as he pores through old negatives and gazes up at shimmering projectors. Clichéd as these tropes might be, they work for a reason, and it's hard to walk away from “The Eyes of Ghana” without a spring in your step caused by the 90-minute love fest for this incredible medium. The arc of time is long, but it bends toward justice, “The Eyes of Ghana” argues, and movies can help bend it a little further.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Magnolia Pictures will be opening its Toronto Film Festival acquisition Normal on April 17, 2026 in 2,000 theaters, the distributor's widest release in its 24-year history. Normal, which we first told you about selling to Magnolia at TIFF, is directed by Ben Wheatley and written by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad. The pic reps a reteam between Kolstad, producer Marc Provissiero and Bob Odenkirk, who previously worked on the Nobody franchise; those movies propelled the two-time Emmy-winning Better Call Saul star to action leading man status. Normal will share the marquee on its spring weekend with Lee Cronin's The Mummy from New Line and Blumhouse, and Amazon MGM Studios' Liam Neeson action movie 4 Kids Walk Into a Bank. In Normal, Odenkirk plays an unassuming substitute sheriff with a troubled past who, after moving to a small, sleepy town, responds to a bank robbery and unknowingly uncovers something far more explosive. Henry Winkler and Lena Headey also star. Magnolia picked up Normal soon after TIFF wrapped. It's becoming more of an anomaly for an acquisition title to be sold so quickly around its premiere at a fest. Kolstad told Deadline that a sequel to Normal is already in the works. Previously the June Squibb caper Thelma was Magnolia Pictures' widest release with an opening of 1,290 theaters in June 2024. Magnolia acquired Thelma out of the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Deadline broke the news that Michael B. Jordan was in line for the Ricardo Tubbs role in Universal‘s Miami Vice movie being directed by Joseph Kosinksi, the studio now looks to have zeroed in on his partner. Deadline is hearing Austin Butler is in early talks to star as iconic TV detective James “Sonny” Crockett, the character made famous by Don Johnson in Michael Mann's 1980s TV series. Sources say it is still early days and no deals are done, but after scheduling was worked out for the  film to shoot later in 2026, Butler is engaging and interested. As for Jordan, his deal to play Tubbs is also early days. Eric Warren Singer and Dan Gilroy are penning the script. Miami Vice is based on characters created by Anthony Yerkovich from the series executive produced by Yerkovich and Mann. The show rocketed Johnson to pin-up-star status in the role of white-suit-wearing Sonny Crockett, while Philip Michael Thomas played his partner Tubbs. If a deal is able to close, add the part to another high-profile role for Butler following his Oscar-nominated work in Elvis, followed by films like Dune: Part Two and most recently Caught Stealing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As previous biopics have proven, films have the capacity to bring new audiences to a star's music — and help justify the cost of a pricey catalog acquisition. Bruce Springsteen and Sony Music had different reasons for signing on to Deliver Me From Nowhere, the new biopic starring Jeremy Allen White as the Boss. “As you get older, you feel a lot freer.” And while Sony was willing to do whatever Springsteen wanted to do, the label had other considerations, too: Its publishing company paid $500 million for Springsteen's catalog in 2021, and one of the most powerful weapons it can deploy to boost streaming and revenue is a star-studded film. Cornia, senior vp of marketing and partnerships for Sony's Commercial Music Group, adds that the late-2024 Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown and the 2022 Elvis Presley biopic Elvis “created a new baseline for streaming” both artists' catalogs. They had “double-digit growth post-release and have sustained elevated streaming levels to date,” adds a Sony rep. Deliver Me From Nowhere focuses on 1982's Nebraska — not the most commercial of Springsteen's albums. But the star power from The Bear‘s Jeremy Allen White as Springsteen and Succession‘s Jeremy Strong as his manager, Jon Landau, will “create a huge cultural moment,” says Cornia, which Sony can use as “the initial exciting point for us to start to lean in.” Over the past five years, the music business' most successful songwriters have sold their catalogs (and sometimes other assets) for astronomical sums. “Everybody who's acquiring a catalog is looking for opportunities to find new audiences and tap into a fanbase that's already engaged,” says Sophia Dilley, executive vp of Concord Originals, the indie-label division that co-produced last year's HBO doc Stax: Soulsville, U.S.A., about the storied Memphis recording home of Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others. “A natural place to do that is within the documentary or biopic space.” After its November 2018 premiere, Queen‘s Bohemian Rhapsody biopic hit more than $1 billion worldwide in box-office sales over just five months, increasing the value of the band's publishing and recording catalogs. Two months before the release of Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen's catalog streamed 15 million times per week. In Springsteen's case on Friday (Oct. 24), the heavily advertised Deliver Me From Nowhere arrives with a new release geared to superfans, the five-disc box set Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition, which includes Springsteen's long-awaited electric version of the album and a performance film. Concord, like many labels and publishers, plans similarly broad marketing campaigns for its upcoming biopics on Mississippi Delta bluesman Robert Johnson (release date unknown) and R&B keyboardist and Beatles collaborator Billy Preston (sometime in 2026). “The risk is it doesn't have the longevity you want it to,” Dilley says, “But in the immediate, it definitely has an impact, because you're spending money on a campaign, which helps audience awareness.” The timing of Deliver Me from Nowhere and A Complete Unknown, after the Springsteen and Dylan catalog sales, is probably not coincidental, according to Alaister Moughan, founder of Moghan Music, a London-based company that specializes in valuations of publishing catalogs. Major artists who sell catalogs, and top companies that spend big money to buy them, are highly aware that a well-timed biopic can improve the songs' future value. “The past five years in particular, when an artist is looking to sell their catalog, they've been quite strategic,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Ace Frehley played what would be his final concert last month, he took the stage with a rhythm guitar player who had been by his side longer than any other in his solo bands: Nashville shredder Jeremy Asbrock. Together, they tore through Kiss classics like “Deuce” and “Cold Gin,” Frehley solo staples like “New York Groove,” and Frehley's Comet's enduring battle cry “Rock Soldiers.” Asbrock, who played in bands like the Shazam and with John Corabi before joining up with Kiss' Spaceman guitarist in 2018, was the ultimate rock soldier. I've never wanted to do anything else, and he was the guy that brought it all to me,” Asbrock tells Rolling Stone. “Some nights onstage, it was extremely surreal, especially when he was having a really great show, and he'd get in that stance and start doing his thing. A post shared by Rolling Stone Nashville Now (@rollingstonecountry) Ironically, perhaps, the group was born out of Gene Simmons' band. Asbrock says they were playing with the Kiss bassist on a tour of Australia that Frehley was booked to open when Frehley asked Simmons if he could borrow his players. “Later on, Gene pulled me into his dressing room, and the Kiss cruise was coming up, and he told us that Ace was going to ask us to do the cruise. Nashville's Philip Shouse also performed in Frehley's solo band, playing bass from 2018 to 2022 until he took a full-time gig in German metal band Accept. He, Asbrock, and Cook are longtime friends and are essential to Nashville's vibrant rock scene: For years they hosted a weekly hard-rock showcase called Thee Rock N Roll Residency that featured surprise guests like Alice Cooper, Halestorm's Lzzy Hale, Cheap Trick's Robin Zander, and more of the local rock community. Shouse says that touring with Frehley was a chance to see the guitarist's keen sense of humor up close. “He just had this way about him that was unlike anybody I've ever met.” I was taking guitar lessons and learning the scales, but nothing sounded like music to me. It never made sense until I heard Ace, and that was in 10th grade,” Shouse says. ‘Deliver Me From Nowhere': Fact-Checking the Bruce Springsteen Biopic Kiss' Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley Mourn Ace Frehley at Funeral Service TikTok Can't Get Enough of This Chaotic 4 Non Blondes-Nicki Minaj Remix Paul Rodgers Says Bad Company Will Likely Perform at Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Asbrock and Shouse, who also lost his father a few months ago, are still struggling to make sense of a world without the Space Ace. “Gene was not going to call me up and talk about real-life things.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rebel Wilson's directorial debut may be stuck in purgatory, but her next feature is pushing ahead. The actor, writer, and director shared a post on Instagram this morning confirming that Nicole Scherzinger and Jennifer Coolidge had joined her upcoming film Girl Group, though it's not clear that the actors will be part of the titular girl group. Per The Hollywood Reporter, Melanie Chisolm of the Spice Girls, Shaznay Lewis of All Saints, and Scherzinger's fellow erstwhile Pussycat Doll Ashely Roberts have already filled those parts. Scherzinger and Coolidge, meanwhile, have both recently hit new career peaks. Coolidge won two Emmys and a Golden Globe for her two-season role on The White Lotus and also appeared in the money-printing endeavor that was A Minecraft Movie.

Mass MoCA Records will operate in tandem with the museum's curatorial ethos, a press release notes, and is running as a three-year pilot. Museum director Kristy Edmunds said, “By joining forces with Hen House Studios and being able to tap into the remarkable number of music studios and intimate venues in the local area—the ingredients for a hand-made record label were all around us. I see this label as an extension of how we innovate to support the mobility of artists' ideas and connect audiences the world over.” Harlan Steinberger, the producer and engineer behind Hen House, added, “Though technology today can work wonders, the digital world has de-humanized us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Check goes both ways, but right now, she's going forward into a sequel. Original writer Diablo Cody is “working on it right now,” director Karyn Kusama said in a recent interview with Deadline. “I'm very excited to hear what comes of it,” she added. “I know some of the bones of it, so I'm not going to give anything away, but it sounds fun and crazy like the first film. And I have no doubt that Diablo will do something absolutely incredible with it.” “I'm just so satisfied by that.” It's continued to speak to both Fox and co-star Amanda Seyfried as well, as both have mentioned their interest in a sequel in various interviews throughout the years. “I think we're making another one,” Seyfried said this past March. Cody herself was “nervous to get back into that,” as she previously told Deadline of her feelings regarding the film she admitted was a “commercial and critical disaster” at the time. Like Kusama, however, the film's new cult status healed some of that hurt. Why do Return Of The King adaptations flinch away from its most crucial chapter?

At the stroke of midnight, Bruce Springsteen shared Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition (via Sony Music), a treasure chest stuffed with previously unseen and unheard cuts. Dance Rookie of the Month: Inji Was Going to Be a Banker -- Now She's Probably Going to Be a Dance-Pop Star Scott Eastwood Says When Taylor Swift Called Him About Starring In 'Wildest Dreams' Video He Was Like, 'Taylor Who?' Released both digitally and as a five-disc box set, Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition gathers solo outtakes from back in the day, and the fabled “Electric Nebraska” sessions; a newly-shot performance film of Nebraska in its entirety; a recently-released version of “Born in the U.S.A.”, recorded back in April 1982 with Springsteen backed by Max Weinberg and Garry Tallent; plus a 2025 remaster of the original album. We were trying to bring ‘Nebraska' into the electric world.” In a separate promo video accompanying the release, Springsteen admits he's often asked about “Electric Nebraska,” which features Tallent, Weinberg, Danny Federici, Roy Bittan and Stevie Van Zandt. It doesn't exist,” he says, thinking out loud. Springsteen was on hand for a brief performance inside the TCL Chinese Theater after the screening, according to The Hollywood Reporter, where he thanked guests for “supporting our movie” and quipped “this is my last night in the movie business, I'm sticking to music.” The Rock And Roll Hall of Fame-inducted artist used the opportunity speak out once more against Donald Trump, offering up a “prayer” for “no kings” in his speech. “I've spent 50 years traveling as kind of a musical ambassador for America and I've seen firsthand all the love and admiration that folks around the world have had for the America of our highest ideals. Despite how terribly damaging America has been recently, that country and those ideals remain worth fighting for.

Airbnb says that it is creating three Airbnb Originals experiences based on the romantic comedy, including one based on a scene from the upcoming season two, which returns to Netflix today. The show follows sex and dating podcaster Joanne Williams (Kristen Bell), who falls in love with a handsome and unconventional rabbi, Noah Roklov (Adam Brody). Netflix Lands 'Black Hole' Series From 'I Saw the TV Glow' Filmmaker Jane Schoenbrun One experience will include a romantic pasta-making class for two at Los Angeles' Osteria Mozza, a class that will be featured in the new season of the show. Airbnb has been leaning on Hollywood stars and partnerships as it seeks to build out its experiences business. Brian Chesky, its CEO, told THR earlier this year that flagship experiences based on famous people, institutions or IP can help bring new people to the platform and help it accomplish its goals. “We did a few homes where there was a celebrity at the home, and then at some point, we said wait, maybe we can just do celebrities without the home,” Chesky said, noting that as part of its new Airbnb Originals program, users will be able to book things like music lessons from up-and-coming musicians, or beach volleyball lessons with Olympic stars. “We had this basic idea that from an upcoming musician to Sabrina Carpenter and everything in between, that there was no gaps. She does it to create a one ime experience for fans and really allow them to connect, and other fans can live vicariously through them,” Chesky added.

Erbert added, “As we share this, know that there's a rainbow not far behind. Hough and Erbert's fans flooded the comments section with emotional messages. I felt the emotion then, and feeling it all over again with a new perspective!” one fan shared. “Your marriage has endured so much in such a short time … your family will thank you some day for the strength you have brought to your relationship and a bond that others will not understand,” one of their fans noted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Cindy and Peg being total opposites, Siebers shared her take on who she truly believes will win over Owens' heart in the very end. Unfortunately, Debbie Siebers was not given a rose by Mel Owens after hometowns' week. Still, in a recent interview with Parade, she shared the woman she strongly believes will capture his heart at the finale. “They're so different,” Siebers said of Cindy Cullers and Peg Munson. As for Cullers, she is a lot more reserved, with Siebers stating that she “is just so calming to be around. But who does Siebers really think will ultimately get a proposal out of Owens? And I think he's looking for that lightheartedness and fun, nothing too heavy but just somebody who's going to make him come out of himself a little bit more. Munson quickly became a fan-favorite on “The Golden Bachelor” thanks to her full-of-life personality and spontaneity. She left a lasting impression on Owens right from the very start after stepping out of the limo in a bombsuit. Munson used to work as a firefighter and bomb technician in Las Vegas, Nevada. Munson earned her first one-on-one date with Owens in episode 4, and the two went to the Orange County Fair, where Owens shared that he admired Munson's “high level of energy.” It was clear that Munson had a way of getting the playful side out of Owens and made him feel young again. Although she hit him with a few tough questions, he admired Dakota's strong bond with her mother and wanted to protect her heart. With Munson and Culler being polar opposites, it's hard to predict who Owens will ultimately choose on “The Golden Bachelor.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>
