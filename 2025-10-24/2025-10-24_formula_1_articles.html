                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norris regrets paucity of 'perfect weekends' but feels he's 'where I need to be' Marking 10 years since its return, the Mexico City Grand Prix has evolved into one of Formula 1's most playful weekends. When F1 returned to the Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez in 2015, it reignited a love affair between Mexico and motorsport that had been waiting a generation to burst back into life. What began as a revival quickly grew into one of the most anticipated events on the schedule for both drivers and fans. The event has taken on a character all its own. Once the home of baseball and still host to blockbuster concerts, Foro Sol now bears witness to some of the most climactic moments in F1, turning the stadium into something entirely its own. Peace and quiet have never really been in Foro Sol's nature! It was entirely fitting then, when F1 returned in 2015 after more than two decades away, that organisers and circuit designers recognised the potential of the stadium. Now the Foro Sol grandstands hold thousands of spectators each race weekend. When F1 arrives in Mexico City, the entire capital shifts gears. Fans in team shirts spill out of metro stations, singing, waving flags, buying tacos from street vendors who have doubled their grills for the weekend. The city feels alive in every sense, and everyone wants to be part of it. F1 has long been a source of pride in Mexico, a country whose passion for speed and spirit helped shape the sport's early story. The then-named Mexican Grand Prix debuted in 1963 at the Magdalena Mixhuca Circuit, before the venue was later renamed Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in honour of local motorsport heroes Ricardo and Pedro Rodriguez. In 1961, at just 19 years old, Ricardo stunned the motorsport world when he became the youngest driver to race for Ferrari. His record stood for more than six decades before it was broken by Ollie Bearman, who stepped in as a replacement driver for Ferrari last year when Carlos Sainz suffered with appendicitis. Ricardo passed away in a fatal crash a year later on home soil, and the torch was passed to his brother, Pedro. The older brother went on to claim Mexico's first F1 Grand Prix win at the 1967 South African Grand Prix. Together they redefined what levels of success were possible for home-grown Mexican drivers, inspiring generations who still feel their influence today. At just 19, Ricardo Rodríguez made history as Ferrari's youngest driver,  a record that stood for more than six decades. For today's fans, that same pride lives on through Sergio 'Checo' Perez. The Guadalajara-born driver has become a national icon, carrying the hopes of a country every time he races at home. From karting in Jalisco to six Grand Prix victories and 39 podiums in F1, his success is a story of perseverance and talent. Next year, his return to Mexico City with the new Cadillac F1 Team will mark the beginning of a new chapter – one that promises to etch his name even deeper into F1 history. In Mexico, the fans are a key part of the spectacle, and few destinations do it as thoroughly as they do here. Street vendors outside the circuit sell marigold garlands, masks and handmade accessories that soon fill the stands, creating a vibrant patchwork of colour. Every year, supporters weave their culture into the weekend – from sombreros and embroidered shirts to flag capes and painted faces inspired by Día de los Muertos. They wear their identity like a badge of honour, their passion and pride shining through as the grandstands erupt in colour, culture and unmistakable Mexican spirit. Charles Leclerc drew headlines last year when he arrived dressed in a traditional mariachi-style outfit, while Daniel Ricciardo has often joined the festivities sporting a sombrero and Day of the Dead-inspired face paint. Sergio Perez also pays tribute to his roots through custom helmet designs, traditional embroidery and, more recently, a Mexican wrestling mask on race day – we can't wait to see what he will bring in 2026. Few circuits test both man and machine quite like Mexico City. The thin air strains engines, alters aerodynamics and challenges drivers' endurance, so every lap demands precision, rhythm and nerve. During his stint with Sauber Zhou Guanyu summed it up, saying: “The fans at the track make Mexico so special. You really feel the atmosphere – they are very passionate about racing.” No one understands that connection more deeply than Perez. “Being on the podium in your home Grand Prix is something very, very special,” he said after finishing P3 at the 2021 edition. “I gave my full heart for these people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norris regrets paucity of 'perfect weekends' but feels he's 'where I need to be' Ferrari stopped development earlier than its rivals, but has managed to keep pace and return to the podium through Charles Leclerc last time out in Austin. Charles Leclerc took his first podium since Belgium at last week's United States Grand Prix, but has moved to limit expectations of further successes this season. Leclerc's top-three finish in Austin was his and Ferrari's sixth of the season, with five of this number coming for third-place finishes, and the other for a second place in Monaco. Whether from now on we can consistently fight for a podium, I think it is a long shot, but I will try to make this happen again this weekend.” Having stopped development at an early stage, Ferrari have sought to make gains through improved procedures and set-up, with Leclerc adding of the Austin podium: “It has been a long time, and it's good for everybody in the team to finally see a little bit of improvement.” Although still searching for his first podium in Ferrari colours, Lewis Hamilton equalled his best result for the season with a fourth-place finish at the Circuit of The Americas, a result he had last achieved at Silverstone. Arriving in Mexico, the seven-time World Champion was still riding high, saying: “Coming from a positive weekend... I'm confident that this weekend, we can try to do the same again. He added: “I feel like we're going in the right direction, and I think – Rome wasn't built in a day, so it takes time to build.</p>
