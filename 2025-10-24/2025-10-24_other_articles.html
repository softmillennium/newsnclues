                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural is returning to its roots, with a new comic story set during Season 1 of the longrunning horror-action series. Sam and Dean are young again, and just starting out on their demon-hunting journey, in an arc that can shed more light on how they came to be the iconic duo fans love today. At its core, Supernatural is about the relationship between Sam and Dean Winchester. Or at least, when they're starting to get an idea. The similar spontaneous combustion of a seemingly unrelated character just beforehand suggests that the Supernatural comic's story is going to tie into the early seasons' Azazel storyline in some way. Or, alternatively, it's possible that it, at least, it will tease the antagonist's presence, considering where Dynamite Entertainment's new Supernatural comics are situated in the series' overall timeline. By going back to Season 1, Supernatural is giving fans more of what they want, first and foremost: Sam and Dean's dynamic. As much as the preview for Supernatural #1 makes it clear the series isn't going to shy away from the franchise's trademark horror imagery, its true highlight is the brothers' banter, which feels straight out of Season 1. Author Greg Pak is a pro, and this teaser for Supernatural #1 confirms that he already has a firm grasp on the main characters' voices. This suggests that Supernatural's return to its earliest era is going to be a gratifying experience for fans who have missed the OG versions of Sam and Dean. Supernatural #1 will be available October 29, 2025 from Dynamite Entertainment. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicholas Sparks has long been known for crafting deeply emotional stories of love, loss and the ties that bind us. The result is a novel that challenges expectations, combining romance, grief and eerie tension in a way that feels both intimate and unsettling. The story follows Tate Donovan, a New York architect struggling with depression and the lingering pain of personal loss. There he meets Wren, a mysterious woman whose presence is both comforting and disquieting. Memories, emotions and the unknown intertwine, leading him to confront questions about love, mortality and the traces we leave behind. All while he strives to uncover the truth behind Wren's past. While the novel contains eerie and suspenseful elements, it is far from traditional horror. The tension is psychological, not visceral, and the scares emerge from emotional uncertainty and haunting presences rather than gore or shock. It is here that M. Night Shyamalan's influence and expertise become most apparent. Sparks leverages Shyamalan's mastery of layered suspense to craft a narrative in which unease builds gradually. Readers sense that something is not quite right, even as the emotional core of the story remains grounded in human connection and heartbreak. The supernatural elements are carefully balanced with romance and reflection, making the story eerie without overshadowing its emotional weight. Sparks's intimate character work provides the emotional anchor, giving readers a reason to care deeply about Tate and Wren. Fans of both authors will recognize their strengths: Sparks's ability to evoke empathy and Shyamalan's skill in creating unease that lingers long after the page is turned. Thematically, Remain is as much about what we hold onto as it is about what we must release. It explores grief and love in tandem, showing how the past continues to shape us and how human connections can endure beyond conventional understanding. Tate and Wren's story becomes a meditation on loss, forgiveness and the fragile, haunting beauty of love that remains even when the world feels uncertain. Sparks's prose retains the clarity and accessibility his readers expect, yet it is elevated here by a deliberate sense of suspense. Ultimately, Remain is a novel that defies easy categorization. It is romantic and reflective, eerie and thrilling, grounded in human emotion yet touched by the supernatural. Sparks and Shyamalan have crafted a collaboration that invites readers to feel deeply while questioning the boundaries between life and what lies beyond. Nicholas Sparks is the author of 25 books, including Counting Miracles and Dreamland, all of which have been New York Times bestsellers. His books have been published across more than 50 languages with over 150 million copies sold worldwide, and eleven have been adapted into films. He is also the founder of the Nicholas Sparks Foundation, a nonprofit committed to improving cultural and international understanding through global education experiences. His movies have grossed over $3.3 billion globally, and he's best known for creating psychological thrillers with supernatural themes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While some users insist it's 'proof of alien activity,' experts and officials caution that the footage likely depicts drones, aircraft, or optical illusions rather than extraterrestrial visitors. The clip, posted earlier this week on social media platforms including X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube, shows multiple bright objects racing in apparent formation before disappearing into the distance. Eyewitnesses described the lights as 'faster than any jet' and 'blinking in unison.' As of Friday, no official confirmation has been issued by the Japanese government or Self-Defence Forces. However, analysts say the incident fits a broader regional surge in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) reports across East Asia. The sighting comes as Japan intensifies its efforts to investigate unexplained aerial phenomena. Former Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada warned that 'leaving something unknown is a problem for national security,' adding that some objects could represent foreign surveillance drones, not alien craft, as cited by Popular Mechanics. Video analysts and atmospheric scientists have urged caution before jumping to conclusions. 'The combination of consumer-grade cameras, long exposure, and motion blur can easily make normal lights look like high-speed anomalies,' one aerospace researcher explained to Popular Mechanics. Science communicator Mick West added that Japan's reputation as a 'UFO hotspot' partly stems from heavy webcam coverage in areas such as Fukushima, where countless cameras constantly monitor the skies. While no evidence suggests deliberate fakery, several possibilities are being considered: Japan is now one of the world's most active centres for UAP and UFO research. A Popular Mechanics report found the country records hundreds of aerial anomalies each year, driven by both public fascination and official acknowledgement of unknown phenomena. As of this week, no independent evidence supports claims that the Japan footage shows non-terrestrial craft. For now, experts agree: the footage should be analysed objectively, not sensationalised.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is not often that experts in the extraterrestrial visit Colgate University's campus, but Marie-Helene Bertino laid out what it means to be an alien — and to be human — on Thursday, Oct. 16 in Persson Auditorium. Associate Professor of English CJ Hauser introduced Bertino to the room as a true master in the craft of writing. “She is one of our great sentence writers,” Hauser said. “Line by line, refrain by refrain, Bertino's work is put together with a watchmaker's flair for mechanics and a vaudevillian sense of timing, panache and showmanship.” “Marie has been in the deep trenches of this hard and beautiful thing we call being alive, and still she believes in magic, and still she works to reveal the world's magic to her readers,” Hauser said. “You will meet her spirit in the pages of ‘Beautyland. As Bertino began speaking, she outlined the essence of her novel. “Beautyland” is the coming-of-age story of a girl named Adina who is an alien on Earth reporting the lives of humans. “Adina documents what I would call the profound mundane,” Bertino said. “Beautyland” got its start when Bertino wrote a short story about an alien reporting about life on this planet back to its superiors. After that story, she began to write one-off vignettes in this style. Bertino's talk was unique from this year's previous Living Writers events. She gave the background of the “Beautyland” writing process, complete with a presentation that included pictures and lots of jokes. Bertino discussed everything from her own family life, to Cher in “Moonstruck,” to Voyager 1's Golden Record containing images and recordings that were sent out into the universe. Senior Lara Blanton reflected on how humanity wound its way through every aspect of Bertino's talk. “Marie-Helene Bertino's talk was fresh and funny, and she managed to talk about heavy topics like death in a way that brought lightness to it,” Blanton said. “While she didn't do a lot of reading from the book itself, she did go in depth into her inspirations, which I personally found very interesting as an aspiring writer.” Bertino brought her novel to life in this talk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theorists are claiming that the audacious £76million Louvre heist may have been faked - with wild speculation that the world's most famous museum was never actually burgled. A gang posing as construction workers stormed the Louvre's Galerie d'Apollon last Friday, escaping in under eight minutes with eight pieces of the French crown Jewels. The thieves used a hoist to access a side window before smashing reinforced glass cases and vanishing into the Paris streets. Tourists were ushered out as alarms echoed through the marble halls in what officials have described as one of the boldest art thefts in recent memory. The daylight raid stunned museum staff and triggered an international investigation. But now a series of wild claims are sweeping Reddit, TikTok and X suggesting the heist was not a crime at all. One of the far-fetched theories proposes it was in fact a carefully staged stunt for the upcoming film Now You See Me 3. The theory exploded after Lionsgate's official TikTok account posted a cryptic video days after the break-in, with fans insisting it contained hidden references to Paris and stage magic. Another viral clip, uploaded by user @phooxo, splices the supposed heist footage with scenes from earlier Now You See Me films, highlighting near-identical camera angles and the thieves' precision timing. Together, the clips have racked up millions of views and fuelled speculation that the burglary was an elaborate movie marketing trick. Footage captured the brazen thieves escaping down a ladder before fleeing on scooters Conspiracy theorists are claiming that the audacious £76million Louvre heist may have been faked - with growing speculation that the world's most famous museum was never actually burgled. One of the far-fetched theories proposes it was in fact a carefully staged stunt for the upcoming film Now You See Me 3. Pictured: An image from the trailer of Now You See Me 3 One X user wrote: 'A conspiracy theory i can get behind is that the louvre staged the heist themselves as an elaborate marketing stunt because honestly how does this even happen anymore.' Some claim that posters showing illusionist imagery appeared near the Louvre in the days before the raid, while archived social-media posts from Lionsgate hinting at a 'big reveal in Paris' have since been re-examined as possible clues. However, the studio has since weighed in, denying any involvement. In a follow-up TikTok posted from its official account, Lionsgate wrote: 'We love the theory - but the Louvre heist isn't one of ours.' The brief statement has done little to calm speculation, with many online commentators dismissing it as part of the marketing ploy itself. Not everyone, however, believes Hollywood is to blame. On TikTok and Reddit, amateur investigators have filled comments sections with theories ranging from from secret societies to government cover-ups, each claiming to have cracked the mystery. A series of wild claims are sweeping Reddit , TikTok and X suggesting the heist was not a crime at all Investigators have been casing the crime scene for DNA Footage captured the brazen thieves escaping down a ladder before fleeing on scooters. One was wearing a hi-vis jacket, the other appeared to be in an all-black get-up. The men are not threatened by anybody as security guards express their intense frustration. 'The individuals are on scooters – they are about to leave,' says one, as police sirens can be heard in the background. They've gone!,' can also be heard, along with swear words. Inside, they threatened unarmed guards and visitors before breaking into two display cabinets and looting nine prized items, estimated to be worth up to £76million. It came after the museum's director admitted that security cameras did not cover the window thieves used to break-in and steal uninsured jewellery. We did not detect the thieves' arrival early enough.' Ms Des Cars was grilled by senators on Wednesday, and they particularly wanted to know how a flatbed truck with an extendable ladder had been able to park in the wrong direction on the pavement directly outside the Louvre. They spent just seven minutes carrying out the raid, which included breaking open two cabinets containing eight pieces of Napoleonic jewellery described as 'France's crown jewels'. This helped save valuable evidence, included a gloves and a helmet, as well as the vehicle itself, but the men disappeared on two Yamaha motorbikes. Ms De Cars said she had handed her resignation in to Rachida Dati, the Culture Minister, but it was refused. She said 'security plans' had included 'video surveillance covering all facades' and 'the installation of fixed thermal cameras' but these plans had not been implemented in time. This was because they required extensive work on the electricity supply, including 40 miles worth of new cables. Ms Des Cars said she had repeatedly warned that the centuries-old building's security was in a dire state, saying: 'The warnings I had been sounding came horribly true last Sunday.' Today it emerged that  a second French museum was raided just hours after the heist. Roughly 2,000 gold and silver coins – some dating back 235 years – have been stolen from the Maison des Lumières museum in Langres. Staff discovered the theft on Tuesday morning when they arrived at work to find a display case smashed. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

The Moon, pictured without a mysterious flash of light. While these claims go back over a thousand years, it took a long time for them to be taken seriously by scientists, and we still lack an agreed-upon explanation. "Literature and received reports of lunar transient phenomena (LTP) in lunar programs of observations provided a collection of 2,254 total observations, from 557-1994 [CE] with sufficient information for auxiliary data analysis," a paper collating these observations explains. In study of these reports 448 were found that could not be explained by terrestrial atmospheric or instrumental effects, so are probably intrinsically lunar and are designated * and + for those confirmed or permanently recorded *+." “Now there was a bright new Moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tilted toward the east; and suddenly the upper horn split in two. This phenomenon was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal." This is a pretty dramatic description of the phenomenon, but it has been observed in the centuries since, and is a real phenomenon. In 1939, amateur astronomer turned legendary science communicator Patrick Moore witnessed one for himself, and went on to coin the term "transient lunar phenomena" to describe it. "There has been a great deal of recent discussion about t.l.p. My only qualification for discussing them is that I have been watching for them over a period of almost forty years, and have recorded several, but it was only in recent years that they have been accepted as real," he explained in a 1977 paper. The classic observation was made by Kozyrev in 1958, who recorded a red t.l.p. His interpretations have been disputed, but there can be little doubt that an event of some sort took place." The nature of them, often being caught by amateur astronomers who may be unable to distinguish them from other spurious effects, meant that their abundance was hard to judge. But from 2017 to 2023, the European Space Agency's Near-Earth object Lunar Impacts and Optical TrAnsients (NELIOTA) monitored the Moon during parts of the month when most of it is not illuminated, in order to record any of these events. The team found that during 90 hours of observations, 55 events occurred. "Extrapolating from this data, scientists estimate that there are, on average, almost 8 flashes per hour across the entire surface of the Moon," ESA explains. One explanation, which gained a little popularity, was that radon is outgassed from beneath the lunar surface. “People over the years have attributed TLPs to all sorts of effects: turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, visual physiological effects, atmospheric smearing of light like a prism, and even psychological effects like hysteria or planted suggestion” Columbia astronomy professor Arlin Crotts explained, suggesting this mechanism in 2007, “but TLPs correlate strongly with radon gas leaking from the moon. This seems like the best explanation, but it still is not perfect. For example, NASA's Clementine mission to the moon in 1994 recorded and photographed four events as they occurred, but looking at the surface later they found no apparent changes from a meteorite impact. More work is needed, though meteorite impacts and potentially a little geological activity remain the leading explanations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have found signs that the small icy world Chiron, orbiting between Saturn and Uranus, may be forming a new ring system in near-real time. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A team of Brazil-based astronomers found that the bands of material orbiting around (2060) Chiron, a 125-mile-wide (200 kilometers wide) object that circles the sun between Saturn and Uranus, are new and still taking shape. "It was an exciting surprise," Chrystian Pereira, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Observatory in Brazil who led the study, told Live Science. "In a way, it reminds us that the solar system is alive and continuously evolving, even on human timescales." Chiron joins the asteroid Chariklo and dwarf planets Haumea and Quaoar as one of only four small worlds in our solar system known to host rings, but it may be the most dynamic of them all. Chiron's changing environment, detailed in a paper published Oct. 14 in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, could help scientists understand how both small icy objects as well as giant planets like Saturn and Uranus built their iconic rings billions of years ago. Since its discovery in 1977, astronomers have seen it occasionally brighten and even sprout a faint tail, evidence that it sometimes vents gas and dust into space. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. When the researchers compared this data to similar events cataloged in 2011, 2018 and 2022, they found that the three distinct, dense rings — orbiting at a distance of about 170 to 270 miles (270 to 430 km) from Chiron's center — had stayed in place for more than a decade. In the 2023 data, the team also spotted a new disk-like structure stretching from about 120 miles up to 500 miles (200-800 km) around Chiron that hadn't appeared in previous data. The broader, diffuse disk likely formed only within the past decade, possibly from a collision or outburst that released fresh material into orbit, said Pereira. "This is the first time we've detected any signature of material in that region," Pereira told Live Science, adding that higher-resolution observations are needed to confirm it. "Beyond that limit, particles forming a ring should naturally begin to coalesce into a satellite — yet something seems to be preventing that from happening." The researchers aren't certain what caused Chiron's strange setup. One possibility is that volatile ices beneath its surface erupted in a comet-like outburst, ejecting dust and ice that later settled into orbit. The latter theory could also explain Chiron's steady brightening over the past decade, which is hard to account for through cometary activity alone, Pereira said. Other experts say the findings raise new questions about how rings around small bodies can survive for long periods. "It may be that something is adding energy to these particles and allowing them to persist outside the limit without coalescing," Keighley Rockcliffe, a postdoctoral researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland who was not involved in the new paper, told Live Science via email. It could also be that the ring is very diffuse or that it simply hasn't existed long enough to coalesce, Rockcliffe said. To confirm whether Chiron's rings are truly evolving, and not just appearing different from our changing vantage point, astronomers hope to capture more events in which Chiron passes in front of distant stars. Such events, when recorded with high-speed cameras at observatories across multiple continents, are the only direct way to see if the disk's material is changing in opacity, width, or position — signs that, according to Pereira, would reveal the dust and ice are being actively redistributed, offering direct evidence of ongoing evolution.
