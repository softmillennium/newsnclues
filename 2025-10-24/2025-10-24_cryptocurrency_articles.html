The entire East Wing of the White House was surprisingly demolished this week to make room for Trump's $300 million, 90,000-square foot ballroom. Trump has said the ballroom, which will accommodate about 1,000 guests, is needed so the White House can host large gatherings. Critics, meanwhile, have accused Trump of destroying a historic structure, ignoring a widely held belief that the founders intended for the White House to be a relatively modest building and skirting legally required public review processes for the project. The White House has responded by noting that previous presidents have also overseen construction projects on White House grounds. The list of about three dozen donors released Thursday by the White House includes Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta Platforms, Micron Technology and Microsoft as well as cryptocurrency companies Coinbase, Ripple and Tether America. Other big name donors include Comcast Corp., which owns NBCUniversal; defense and aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin; and Stephen A. Schwarzman, CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street's newest steps reach directly into crypto's core collateral, and that shift could decide where bitcoin's DeFi experiments actually take root once markets turn volatile and balance sheets matter more than slogans. JPMorgan is preparing a program that lets institutions pledge Bitcoin and Ethereum for loans, while Fidelity's product page now offers Solana trading to eligible U.S. clients. Together, these channels route funding and access through familiar rails that large investors already use. As collateral and spot activity settle inside incumbent systems, Bitcoin native DeFi will need clear utility, steady settlement, and transparent rules to attract deposits during busy periods, not just during calm sessions when risk feels distant. JPMorgan plans to let institutional clients pledge Bitcoin and Ethereum for loans, which would place crypto inside a familiar collateral workflow rather than at the edge of bespoke arrangements. Bloomberg frames the work as an end-of-year goal and aligns with earlier Financial Times coverage that described internal exploration of crypto-secured lending. If that corridor opens, desks will still price every decision against live markets. Collateral mobility can compress haircuts during calm periods and widen them more predictably during stress, which tends to smooth forced selling rather than amplify it, although the effect ultimately depends on the specific limits that a dealer sets. Fidelity's product page now lists Solana alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin inside Fidelity Crypto, which places a large-cap token directly inside a mainstream brokerage workflow for eligible U.S. clients. Because Solana venues already show deep order books at peak hours, an integrated path through a large broker can change where retail flows land during macro headlines, which in turn shapes how quickly spreads stabilize. The stated goal is to allow lending, swaps, and other smart contract activity that references native Bitcoin rather than wrapped substitutes, which would let BTC and ETH liquidity meet in programmable venues without surrendering entirely to centralized rails. If collateral acceptance by large dealers keeps coin balances on institutional books, on-chain programs will need to offer yields or functionality that justifies moving funds into noncustodial systems. Either outcome will be easier to track by pairing protocol disclosures with the aggregate reads, which together show where volume concentrates when policy and product access change at the same time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price saw a sharp upside to $111,500 levels, extending its daily gains to 2.5% on softer-than-expected US CPI numbers for the month of September. With inflation on a clear decline in the US, the chances of Fed rate cuts next week has surged to 99% as per data from CME Fed Watch tools. The US Labor Department released a “rare exception” Consumer Price Index (CPI) report amid the ongoing government shutdown, showing inflation cooled more than expected in September. Headline CPI rose 3.0% year-over-year, slightly below the 3.1% forecast, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, also came in at 3.0%, under expectations of 3.1%. Both the monthly headline and core CPI readings were weaker than projected, signaling softer inflationary pressures. The data from CME Fed watch tool shows a 99% chance of another 25 bps rate cut coming next week on October 29. However, it remains to be seen whether the bulls could pull this off for a sustained altseason. On-chain data shows that the Trump insider whale reportedly opened $150 million in long positions ahead of former President Trump's speech today. The trader, who claims a 10/10 success rate, is said to have accurately predicted every major pump and dump in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ALEC Communications and Technology Senior Task Force Director Jake Morabito and Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development Task Force Director Alan Jernigan were recently invited to testify before the Kansas State Legislature Special Committee on Commerce regarding state cryptocurrency considerations. You can read both of their testimonies below and watch the recording here. Chairman Tarwater, Vice Chair Alley, and Members of the Special Committee: ALEC is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization headquartered in Virginia, made up of state legislators from across the country. In support of your state's efforts, I'll be highlighting two key ALEC model policies developed by ALEC's Commerce, Insurance and Economic Development (CIED) Task Force. These models can help Kansas build a forward-looking and resilient foundation for its digital economy. The ALEC CIED Task Force is comprised of state legislators and policy experts that believe that overregulation of financial tools harms consumers and businesses alike. They believe these financial tools can open the doors of economic opportunity and should prioritize protecting consumer privacy. Bitcoin now has a market cap exceeding $2 trillion, higher than companies such as Meta and Tesla. You can use the currency in a similar manner to other purchasing options at retailers such as Home Depot and Whole Foods. It allows anyone in the world with internet connection to store and exchange value. With any emerging technology, there are always concerns about individuals that look to capitalize on these developing landscapes for their own nefarious intentions. There are currently many enforcement measures and laws that provide sound protection, but it is key for states to lead on the constantly changing landscape without stifling innovation. This gives states like Kansas, an opportunity to become a national example of principled policy solutions that promotes limited government and free market solutions. A CBDC, or a central bank digital currency, is not the same as other cryptocurrency which are decentralized forms of currency that are not issued by the government. It would be a direct liability of the Federal Reserve. In 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order which called for the federal government to explore and research the potential use of a central bank digital currency. President Trump has since signed an executive order directing federal agencies to terminate CBDC initiatives. There is no guarantee that future administrations will hold the same stance. At least nine states have followed Congress' lead and passed reforms that prohibit CBDCs. There is an opportunity for additional states like Kansas to further protect their citizens financial privacy. Currently, private banks are regulated by market competition and government regulation. The next model policy that I would like to discuss was a reform passed in Kansas earlier this year. ALEC named Representative Patrick Penn and Senator Stephen Owens as ALEC Policy Champions for their success in leading legislation that reduces barriers to innovation by bringing a universal regulatory sandbox program to Kansas. The ALEC Policy Champion award recognizes state legislators that advance policy solutions built on the pillars of free markets, limited government, and federalism in their states. This reform makes it easier for innovators and entrepreneurs to test products faster than current regulations allow, while protecting public health and safety. Arizona and Hawaii, for example, have successfully implemented regulatory sandboxes in the fintech space. In 2020, Hawaii created a regulatory sandbox known as the Digital Currency Innovation Lab. Following the conclusion of the sandbox in 2024, several recommendations ensured that focus on deregulation that help make Hawaii a more attractive destination for businesses. Just recently, the Federal Government has looked to follow states like Kansas lead, as Sen. Ted Cruz introduced the SANDBOX Act, which would create a federal regulatory sandbox program. Currently, only Bitcoin meets this threshold, but it opens the door to other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, which is not far behind. Chairman Tarwater, Vice Chair Alley, and Members of the Special Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to speak before your committee today to share more about ALEC's nonpartisan research and analysis, as well as the efforts of our members across all 50 states on digital assets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency policy. In recent years, inaction at the federal level in Congress, combined with a ping-pong of federal rulemaking depending on the Administration, has made it difficult for innovators and businesses to confidently adopt these tools. While President Trump and the current leadership at agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission may have a more optimistic stance about the role of Bitcoin and digital assets in our nation's financial ecosystem, there is no guarantee that a subsequent Administration will not upend the table once again and enact a regime of burdensome regulation. Therefore, states like Kansas are in a unique position to provide that regulatory clarity within your jurisdiction on the pressing tech policy and regulatory questions of our time, whether it's navigating policy questions surrounding artificial intelligence and its use across the economy and government, to digital assets and whether they should be used in state investment funds or for everyday consumer transactions. My colleague mentioned several examples of market-oriented, light-touch policy solutions to make Kansas a leader in the burgeoning digital assets ecosystem. Some states like New York are pursuing a different path by heavily regulating the technology, proposing new and discriminatory taxes, or even banning crypto mining operations in certain situations. As the digital landscape evolves and the barrier to entry for digital assets and cryptocurrency continues to fall, states should balance the need to protect consumers from emerging threats, primarily by modernizing and updating existing laws, not creating more regulatory burdens. Instead of jumping the gun with punitive regulations like New York has done, a better approach is to provide some measure of certainty to the digital asset industry and promote responsible adoption. And that can be accomplished with ALEC's model Smart Cryptocurrency Rules Act, which lays the groundwork to foster digital asset innovation at the state level. First, our model policy establishes key definitions in state code for terms such as “digital assets,” “cryptocurrency,” “virtual currency,” and “mining.” Harmonizing these definitions across state law early will provide much-needed regulatory clarity for individuals and businesses, while some of these questions remain unresolved at the federal level. The model policy makes clear that for the purposes of state law and regulation, virtual currencies and digital assets are considered to be personal digital property and should therefore follow the rules established by your state's Property Code. Next, to streamline the regulatory process and ease the burden on innovators in the digital assets space, our model policy provides for mutual recognition of money transmitter licenses across states for virtual currency exchanges, brokers, and other digital asset-related companies. Instead of mandating that emerging crypto and digital asset businesses submit to a duplicative licensure regime before they can even open their doors, our model offers a more permissive approach that allows businesses who already have an active money transmitter license from any state to begin services in this state, provided that sufficient proof is provided and accepted as a reciprocal license within 30 days. Finally, the ALEC model expressly preempts all municipal or county-level regulations and restrictions relating to digital assets, and declares that public utilities should not penalize, discriminate, or differentiate between crypto mining and other commercial or industrial zoned uses of electricity. Turning to another example of how states can encourage innovation in emerging technology, states are increasingly considering legislation that recognizes an inherent “Right to Compute” either in statute or by constitutional amendment. First signed into law in Montana earlier this year, and as the subject of ongoing debate in New Hampshire, ALEC's model Right to Compute recognizes the fundamental right of your state's citizens to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes. Whether it is novel artificial intelligence tools, digital assets, or a future technological innovation we haven't even dreamed of yet, the Right to Compute puts the onus on government to prove why new regulations limiting otherwise lawful use of technology are necessary. Some states, like Arkansas, Montana, and Oklahoma, have taken this concept a step further by also considering distinct “Right to Mine” legislation, which would establish key protections in state law for Bitcoin and digital asset holders. ALEC does not yet have model legislation on Right to Mine, but many liberty-minded policymakers and stakeholders are recognizing the need to restrain government overreach at home as nations like China pioneer the use central bank digital currencies for invasive citizen surveillance and as a tool to tightly control access to the financial system. I, too, am concerned at the prospect of bad actors leveraging cryptocurrency to scam Americans, perpetuate fraud, commit financial crimes, or otherwise engage in illegal conduct. Especially in the context of artificial intelligence legislation, I have observed that many states are pursuing new regulations on technology with the goal of preventing bias and discrimination in outcomes. State lawmakers may be operating in good faith when proposing such legislation, but these frameworks would often create an immense regulatory burden for your state's businesses, schools, hospitals, and more by increasing compliance costs and requiring frequent “risk assessments” to prove technology is not being used to discriminate. In many cases, the robust body of federal and state consumer protection, anti-discrimination, and civil rights laws already have the enforcement mechanisms and regulatory framework to deal with emerging challenges—it is simply a matter of adapting the existing framework. If there are any genuine gaps or loopholes in the law that could be exploited, it could be appropriate to pursue targeted legislation to address those concerns, similar to how nearly three-quarters of the states at this point have adopted legislation to crack down on the risk of AI CSAM and the distribution of non-consensual intimate images. With this in mind, ALEC recently approved new model legislation that could help Kansas and other states tackle consumer protection and anti-discrimination concerns head-on without limiting innovation or ballooning the role of government. This model legislation, which we call the Technology-Neutral Anti-Discrimination Clarification Act, would make a surgical edit clarifying in your state's existing civil rights statutes that illegal conduct is still illegal, no matter which technology is used—including digital assets and cryptocurrency. ALEC's model policy has gained traction in Colorado, where it is being considered by the State Senate and the Governor as a solution to fix its problematic AI law before it is scheduled to take effect in 2026. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak this morning, and I welcome any questions. In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson said that “the sum of good government” was one “which shall restrain men from injuring one another” and “shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry.” Sadly, governments – both federal and state – have ignored this axiom and…</p>

Positive investor sentiment appears to be strongly aligned with bitcoin, with CoinMarketCap's "altcoin season" indicator hitting its lowest level in more than 90 days, as bitcoin dominance continues to rise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of ZKsync, the answer lies in zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. In a recent conversation with CCN, Gluchowski discussed ZKsync's collaboration with over 30 major global institutions, including Citi, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, and two central banks, to explore how enterprises can operate private yet connected blockchains within Europe's new regulatory environment. For years, banks and major financial institutions have faced a dilemma. He discussed ZKsync's new whitepaper, the Prividium Initiative, developed in collaboration with more than 30 global institutions, including Citi, Deutsche Bank, Mastercard, and two central banks. The initiative outlines how enterprises can use zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to operate private, permissioned blockchains that remain connected and interoperable with others without compromising compliance. Institutional hesitation toward blockchain adoption has long centered on one issue: how to balance privacy with regulatory transparency. ZKsync's Prividium model addresses that tension head-on through a combination of granular access controls and zero-knowledge proofs. “Regulators or compliance partners can have view-only access to specific elements of the system, and receive cryptographic proofs confirming rules were followed, without exposing user data.” Enterprises can integrate familiar tools like Google Workspace or Okta for authentication, giving them fine-tuned control over visibility rights. Regulators can then verify that AML, KYC, and sanctions compliance were observed, while only receiving the minimum necessary data. Large corporations often manage funds across multiple jurisdictions, moving capital between subsidiaries and banks — a process that can still take two to five business days. Prividium's model enables instant settlement by allowing banks to issue tokenized representations of deposits that can circulate within and across enterprise networks. “And it works directly with banks, not through third-party stablecoin providers.” This model aligns with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which encourages tokenized payment systems while demanding compliance and consumer protection, two areas where ZK-based systems naturally excel. When asked whether this signals a move toward an “institutional Ethereum,” Gluchowski disagrees. “Each institution will have its own permissioned chain, hosting tokenized deposits and other assets, but they'll all settle on Ethereum,” he says. Citizens file taxes privately on a permissioned chain, while regulators can selectively verify data when needed — all anchored to Ethereum for integrity. “Ethereum is the only truly decentralized and resilient settlement layer, a neutral ground where everyone can meet,” Gluchowski stresses. He envisions a network of networks: each organization running its own chain, connected through ZK proofs and synchronized by Ethereum's trustless infrastructure. Zero-knowledge cryptography is often portrayed as complex, but Gluchowski compares its security model to that of aviation or healthcare, multiple fail-safe layers designed to protect critical systems. “ZK is a new cryptographic layer that sits on top of traditional enterprise security,” he explains. “Even if a system is compromised, the proof layer ensures that no invalid transactions can be confirmed.” ZKsync calls this “incorruptible financial infrastructure,” an architecture where human errors or security breaches cannot alter the truth recorded on-chain. Private deployments simply use a different configuration, keeping data within enterprise systems rather than publishing it to Ethereum. In September 2025, ZKsync announced Atlas , its most advanced upgrade yet, reaching over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and sub-cent transaction costs. Atlas isn't just another update, it's @zksync  growing into its final form. Before Atlas, building a ZK chain felt like wiring your own console from… pic.twitter.com/wK3wGELCTi “We've seen real-world tests hitting 15,000,20,000 TPS, at around $0.001 per stablecoin transfer. Still, private stablecoins are likely to remain more agile and competitive. “They're just more efficient and innovation happens faster in the private sector.” He points out that the U.S. has publicly distanced itself from direct CBDC issuance. It preferred to let private entities develop regulated digital currencies instead. At its core, Gluchowski believes ZKsync's mission and Prividium's architecture  represent a new kind of financial trust: one verified by mathematics, not intermediaries. “The future isn't about choosing between privacy and compliance,” he says. As MiCA comes into full effect, ZKsync's approach may offer a blueprint for how Europe's institutional blockchain ecosystem evolves. By merging zero-knowledge cryptography with enterprise-grade infrastructure, ZKsync is proving that privacy and regulation no longer need to exist on opposite ends of innovation. As Europe's MiCA framework reshapes how financial institutions interact with digital assets, projects like Prividium offer a realistic path forward. Banks, regulators, and developers can participate in the same network without sacrificing control, transparency, or scalability. The Prividium is a research and development project led by ZKsync in collaboration with over 30 global institutions, including major banks, payment providers, and central banks. It explores how enterprises can use zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to run private blockchains that are still interoperable and compliant with public networks like Ethereum. Until now, banks and corporations faced a trade-off: build private blockchains that are secure but isolated, or use public blockchains that are open but harder to regulate. Prividium bridges this gap by allowing institutions to maintain privacy, meet compliance standards, and still connect with the broader blockchain ecosystem. How does ZKsync's technology enable privacy and compliance at the same time? Ethereum acts as the neutral settlement layer, synchronizing data and ensuring transparency without compromising institutional privacy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The game's producer, Valve, has changed the trade-up system so that players can now convert five low-rarity (covert level) skins into a knife or a pair of gloves, which were previously exceedingly rare. He explained that he used to play World of Warcraft from 2007 until 2010, until the company behind the game “removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell.” “I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring. I soon decided to quit,“ Buterin said at the time. While blockchain and non-fungible tokens see widespread opposition from the gaming community, they may offer potential solutions to issues such as this one. By implementing a smart contract-based digital item using NFTs, it is possible to provide assurances about what the issuer can and cannot do. Smart contracts can set a limit on the number of NFTs in a series that can be issued, or set permanent rules for converting NFTs across different series. Still, Martin Kupka, a general partner at the crypto gaming advisory firm Win Win, told Cointelegraph that using NFTs alone is not enough. “That's the premise of “fully on-chain” games: core game rules are encoded immutably on a blockchain, preventing unilateral, sudden changes,” he said. Kori Leon, the co-founder of crypto gaming infrastructure Pixelverse, agreed, saying that “smart contracts could have defined clear rules from the start, making any change predictable and transparent.” Catie Romero-Finger, CEO of crypto services agency Babs, told Cointelegraph that the Counter-Strike 2 skin crash “is a harsh reminder that even billion-dollar economies can be built solely on borrowed trust.” “What I see is centralization at play, changing the rules mid-flow. Blockchain doesn't make markets less volatile; instead, it replaces unilateral control with transparent code,“ she said. Nokkvi Dan Ellidason, CEO at crypto gaming infrastructure company Gaimin, told Cointelegraph that the crash “exposed the fundamental flaw of centralized digital economies.” “It's not a true economy; it's a company store,“ he said. Joana Barros, chief marketing officer at crypto game My Neighbor Alice, told Cointelegraph that transparency and immutability will be key as gaming economies continue to scale. “As gaming economies grow to rival real-world markets, transparency and immutability are not just ‘Web3 buzzwords', they're basic consumer rights,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nick Anthony cautions that CBDCs such as the digital euro could erode privacy, enable financial surveillance, and endanger economic freedom. During Plan ₿ Lugano, Nick Anthony, policy analyst at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives and fellow at the Human Rights Foundation, sat down with CCN's Dr. Lorena Nessi (a journalist and a researcher) to discuss the power, control, and politics behind digital money. Anthony, who has emerged as one of the most prominent critics of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), describes them not as financial innovation but as an existential shift in the relationship between citizens and the state. “At the core, financial activity reveals who we are,” he says. And I don't think people realize the gravity of governments having all that information in one place,” Anthony emphasized.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit “Yes,” he says without hesitation when asked whether CBDCs could eventually be linked to personal identity. Governments want records of certain transactions, or reports on specific activities, and it just increases over time. “Linking CBDCs to your digital identification, your digital persona, really is the natural conclusion of this,” Anthony noted. Anthony traces his views back to fundamental rights. And if law enforcement has a legitimate reason, they can go to a judge and ask for permission. But today, we've moved into an era of sweeping collection by default. Introducing a CBDC would take that to the next level. It wouldn't just be some transactions reported, it would be everything, stored in one central database.” The distinction between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies, he argues, is not technical but structural. “At the broadest level, there's a buffer between governments and individuals and that's the private sector,” Anthony says. “With your bank account or a crypto exchange, the government has to go through that intermediary to get your data. That's where decentralized money, in his view, matters most. And ultimately, you have the highest interest in protecting your own information,” Anthony said. While most citizens remain unaware of these implications, Anthony believes the crypto community has already connected the dots. “One of my favorite things to come out of this space is that more people than ever are asking, ‘What is money? “What worries me might be less obvious,” he explains. “If you go to China and try to use their CBDC, the digital yuan, you really can't. “The Communist Party derives much of its authority from being unquestioned. If the Party sees that as an embarrassment, I worry they'll clamp down harshly.” But the deeper issue, he argues, isn't technical, it's political. That's why I think it's better to oppose their creation entirely,” Anthony stressed. CBDCs are often marketed as solutions for remittances, cross-border payments, or financial inclusion. “Most CBDCs launched so far are geo-fenced, limited to citizens of that country,” he explains. “And when you ask remittance companies why transfers are slow or expensive, they don't say it's a technical issue. “Governments created that problem, and now they're saying, ‘We'll fix it with a CBDC.' But they could just fix the regulations,” Anthony said. On a global level, he foresees tension rather than cooperation. “We might see governments banning each other's CBDCs or taxing their use. But I don't see CBDCs changing the global order. People use the dollar or the euro because those economies are stable and uphold property rights, not because their money is digital.” As for whether cryptocurrencies can outcompete state digital currencies, Anthony is cautiously optimistic. “As long as crypto remains the opposite of CBDCs, including open, censorship-resistant, borderless, it can win hearts and minds,” he says. That's why Bitcoin's resistance to censorship is its greatest strength.” “I used to think CBDCs were inevitable,” he says. The United States has taken a strong stance against launching one, and others are taking note. Some, like the European Central Bank, seem determined, but it's not unstoppable. In the U.S., people called their representatives, posted online, and spoke out. Once a CBDC is launched, it's almost impossible to undo. Looking ahead, Anthony's outlook for Europe is grim if the digital euro becomes reality. “I don't think the future is bright,” he says bluntly. “The ECB has said it wants to push out foreign financial services, but Europeans use and like those services. From a civil liberties standpoint, it's also worrying. “All it takes is one tragic event for policymakers to realize they have this surveillance system ready and they'll flip the switch. If that happens, people will move away from the digital euro, not toward it.” He adds a final thought, part warning, part plea: “I hope members of the European Parliament are thinking hard about this before moving forward.” Crypto Digital Euro's Hidden Risks Revealed–Patrick Schueffel on Privacy and Control Concerns Crypto Tokenized Deposits vs. CBDCs: Key Differences To Be Aware Of</p>

On 20 October 2025, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued a statement outlining recent progress in its ongoing work to improve data protection standards across the UK public sector. Information Commissioner John Edwards noted that “further progress was a key action my office undertook” in response to the incident. Recognising that monetary penalties often take resource away from vital front-line services and risk re-victimising people who have been impacted by a breach, the ICO have sought to adopt a different approach to regulating the public sector. As part of the ICO's ‘public sector approach,' the ICO and government have committed together to raise standards and ensure that lessons are learnt from incidents to prevent future breaches. According to the ICO, the government has now committed to a series of measures aimed at enhancing information security and accountability. Establishing a central, coordinated approach to managing data protection accountability and compliance across government; The Government Digital Service (within DSIT) will be responsible for co-ordinating cross-government data protection risks and compliance. For example, as part of the ICO update, Commissioner Edwards highlighted the rolling out of new information management training for all civil servants. As the Information Commissioner puts it, this latest update represents “a single step forward, but it is a crucial one.” It signals a more structured and proactive approach to public sector data governance and while the commitments outlined are promising, their effectiveness will ultimately depend on sustained implementation and oversight. “Government must now carry through on these commitments, to ensure the public can trust and be confident when sharing their personal information with government, knowing that it will be handled responsibly and safely.” For advice on data protection compliance in the public sector, please contact Hamish Corner, Madelin Sinclair McAusland, Amanda Leiu, Justin Barrow or a member of Burges Salmon's Commercial & Technology team.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite growing expectations of an imminent altcoin season, industry insiders are pointing to capital flowing back into Bitcoin and corporate cryptocurrency treasuries, raising doubts about the traditional crypto market cycle. Corporate digital assets treasuries (DATs) have drained about $800 billion worth of retail investor capital from the altcoin market, according to crypto market intelligence company 10x Research. “Liquidity, momentum, and conviction have all migrated elsewhere, leaving the altcoin market eerily quiet,” 10x Research wrote in a Friday blog post. “Our models show a decisive rotation back into Bitcoin, even as Korean retail traders, once the heart of altcoin speculation, shift their focus to U.S. crypto stocks.” “Altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin by roughly $800 billion this cycle — a shortfall that would have largely benefited retail investors,” 10x said, adding that this is leading retail to seek “alternative avenues for quick returns.” Technical indicators signal crypto capital rotation back into Bitcoin Despite continued calls for an altcoin season, a key altcoin indicator suggests that investors may be seeking more Bitcoin exposure rather than smaller cryptocurrencies. Despite rising hopes for an altcoin season, most indicators are signaling the opposite. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana (SOL) is trading around $185, hovering just above a key support band between $178–$182, even as DeFi protocols and NFT markets powered by the network pick up steam. With volume surging and institutional interest growing, analysts are increasingly eyeing SOL's next move. Meanwhile, rising demand for practical crypto infrastructure has sparked attention on projects such as Remittix, which offers a crypto-to-fiat payment bridge and is priced at $0.1166, hinting at a new layer of utility-first crypto. Buyers have stepped in at every minor dip since early October. A confirmed daily close over $195 would then open the next leg up to $210-$220 and analysts have already charted longer-term targets at $350. This listing allows trading in HKD, CNY, and USD, making Solana the first non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum token to achieve ETF status in Asia. Market observers say this could pave the way for U.S. equivalents once SEC backlogs clear, potentially flooding billions in fresh liquidity into the asset. Stablecoin inflows on Solana grew by over 37 % in Q3, and DEX trading volumes rose 7 %. Momentum indicators like RSI and MACD hint at bullish divergence on the daily chart. This suggests that buyers are quietly regaining control. Failure to reclaim $195 could invite a retest of $178, while a decisive breakout above that ceiling might catalyze the much-anticipated move toward $250–$300 in Q4. Traders continue to monitor volume surges as the likely trigger for confirmation. While Solana fuels DeFi and NFT momentum, Remittix (RTX) is tackling another trillion-dollar opportunity: global remittances. Priced at $0.1166, Remittix offers users the ability to convert over 100 cryptocurrencies into fiat instantly, depositing funds directly into bank accounts worldwide. Through its PayFi off-ramp system, transactions settle in under 30 minutes. Businesses can integrate the Remittix Pay API to accept crypto payments and receive fiat settlements seamlessly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Update Oct. 24, 4:56 pm UTC: This article has been updated to include comments from an Ocean Protocol Foundation spokesperson. The feud between Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol Foundation may be drawing to a close as the two sides look to reach a middle ground without escalating into a full-blown legal battle. On Thursday, Fetch.ai said it would cancel all pending legal claims against the Ocean Protocol Foundation if the latter returned the 286 million Fetch.ai (FET) tokens that were allegedly sold during their merger. “They are expecting a legal proposal from us for the return of the tokens,” said Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh, during a Thursday X Spaces show, adding: However, the Ocean Protocol Foundation was still awaiting an official written proposal from Fetch.ai at the time of writing. “We have asked time and again for a written proposal to our attorneys which can then be properly vetted, digested and have received none. Until then, we cannot take any verbal offers seriously or at face value,” a spokesperson for the Ocean Protocol Foundation told Cointelegraph.
