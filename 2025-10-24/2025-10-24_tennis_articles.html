                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Austrian is set to crack the Top 90 after winning a maiden main-draw match at his home ATP 500 event.ByFlorian HeerPublished Oct 24, 2025 copy_link Filip Misolic experienced a week of highs and lows at the Erste Bank Open in Vienna.The 24-year-old Austrian celebrated his first-ever main-draw victory at his home ATP 500 tournament, defeating Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli, 7‚Äì5, 7‚Äì6 (6), in a hard-fought opening match. The 24-year-old Austrian celebrated his first-ever main-draw victory at his home ATP 500 tournament, defeating Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli, 7‚Äì5, 7‚Äì6 (6), in a hard-fought opening match. Against Carabelli, Misolic made a dream start, racing to a 4‚Äì0 lead with two early breaks before the Argentine battled back to level the score. The Austrian held firm under pressure, saving break points at 4‚Äì4 and 5‚Äì5, and clinched the first set with his first opportunity at 6‚Äì5. The second set remained on serve throughout, leading to a dramatic tie-break filled with spectacular rallies. After two hours and 16 minutes of play, Misolic converted his second match point to seal a milestone victory‚Äîhis first-ever appearance in the round of 16 at the Erste Bank Open.‚ÄúThis win means a lot to me,‚Äù Misolic said afterwards. ‚ÄúIt's a beautiful feeling to experience this at home. Then it got more complicated, but with the energy from the crowd, I managed to push through. ‚ÄúThis win means a lot to me,‚Äù Misolic said afterwards. ‚ÄúIt's a beautiful feeling to experience this at home. Misolec is 9-9 in tour-level contests this season.¬© 2025 Newhouse Media/MB Media His second-round opponent, however, proved to be a much tougher challenge. Misolic had three break points at 2‚Äì3 but was unable to convert, and de Minaur closed out the match efficiently.‚ÄúEven though I lost, there are many positive moments I'll take from this match,‚Äù Misolic reflected. ‚ÄúPlaying against a Top 10 player in front of the Vienna crowd is an honor. I had three break chances in one game, but at this level, it's the small details that make the difference.‚ÄùDespite the defeat, Misolic's performance in Vienna marked another important career step. ‚ÄúPlaying against a Top 10 player in front of the Vienna crowd is an honor.

A post shared by Advantage Cars Prague Open 2025 (@pragueopen2025) Before representing Austria in the Davis Cup quarterfinals against Italy on November 19 in Bologna, Misolic plans to compete at the ATP Challenger Tour event in Bratislava and the ATP 250 tournament in Athens, aiming to finish the season on a high note. The Graz native captured two of his four career Challenger titles this season by lifting the trophies in Prague, Czech Republic and Poznan, Poland.</p>

Since late 2022, it feels as if we've been moving in permanent fast forward.The shift began that September. Later the same month, Roger Federer, then 41, bid a tearful good-bye to tennis at Laver Cup in London.The other shoe‚Äîin the form of Jannik Sinner‚Äîdropped 12 months after that. First, the 22-year-old Italian beat 36-year-old Novak Djokovic in a series of important matches to close out 2023. Then he ended his long run of dominance at the Australian Open to start 2024.We had been waiting for a changing of the ATP guard for so long, some of us wondered if it would ever happen. By the end of 2024, in stunningly swift fashion, we had our answer.

By the end of 2024, in stunningly swift fashion, we had our answer. Jim Courier christened them the ‚ÄúNew 2,‚Äù but that phrase has quickly reached its expiration date. Neither of them is 25, but at this point there's nothing novel about their rivalry.So maybe it makes sense that Sinner and Alcaraz‚Äîbefore marriage, before kids, before steady girlfriends, maybe even before their brains are fully formed‚Äîhave already been given the book treatment. This summer saw the release of Being Carlos Alcaraz, by British tennis writer Mark Hodgkinson, and *Changeover*,\ by Giri Nathan of the sports site Defector. Anyone who has written a sports-related book will be jealous of their timing. There was no guarantee when they started writing that, at the moment their volumes arrived, Sinner and Alcaraz wouldn't be injured or slumping or just mediocre. Instead, to the delight of their publishers, the two were about to play their third straight Slam final at the Open.The measure of a good sports biography in my case is whether it (a) makes me want to watch its subject more, and (b) helps me see them with new and possibly more sympathetic eyes.

If you want to fill in any gaps in your knowledge of early Carlitos, the book has you covered.But nuts-and-bolts doesn't mean dry. Hodgkinson is good at evoking Alcaraz's hometown of El Palmar in southeast Spain, a laid-back village of 20,000 with year-round sun that's referred to as ‚ÄúEurope's orchard,‚Äù and where a giant mural of an 11-year-old Alcaraz is now plastered across a wall at his old elementary school.For me, the early Alcaraz‚Äîwho was nicknamed Tarzan by a coach‚Äîcan be summed up in one image from this book. Alcaraz's father, a teaching pro at the same club, said his son resembled a mini ground-stroke machine when he went up against the wall‚Äîone who hid his dad's keys so he wouldn't have to leave, and cried when he finally did. Tennis was life for Alcaraz's father, Carlos, Sr., and it would be for Carlos, Jr., as well.From there, Hodgkinson takes us to the next stop on Alcaraz's turbo-journey to the top: Juan Carlos Ferrero's academy in nearby Alicante. 1 would set up shop within driving distance of the Alcaraz family's tiny hometown feels providential.

There's not much dirt or gossip to report on Alcaraz yet. The worst thing he seems to have done so far is sing ‚ÄúWe Are the Champions‚Äù off-key at a karaoke bar with friends in Ibiza after winning Roland Garros. It's good to know Alcaraz ignored him, and then won Wimbledon a few weeks later anyway.Maybe most revealing to me is the fact that Alcaraz has seen two different psychologists, starting when he was eight. The first, Josefina Cutillas, may be as responsible as anyone for the fun-first, process-over-results attitude that has worked so well for him.‚ÄúWhen they spoke on Mondays, Alcaraz wasn't allowed to tell Cutillas whether he had won or lost his latest match, only how he thought he had played,‚Äù Hodgkinson writes. ‚ÄúGiving attention to the result would have reduced Alcaraz's tennis to winning or losing, to being a success or a failure, and Cutillas didn't want that for him.‚Äù‚ÄúCutillas was hoping that as a boy, and maybe deeper into his tennis life, he would be less interested in his results than in whether he was improving and meeting the standards he was setting for himself.‚Äù Maybe most revealing to me is the fact that Alcaraz has seen two different psychologists, starting when he was eight.

It's an attitude that millions of tennis players over the decades have tried to maintain as they compete; Alcaraz may go down as the first ever to make it work.Where Hodgkinson gets us up to speed on Alcaraz's formation, Nathan, in *Changeover*, takes the reins and tells the story of the most recent development in his career, his rivalry and relationship with Sinner.The book is an extended celebration of tennis genius, 2020s-style, and a more writerly affair than Hodgkinson's. Nathan leads it with a Phillip Larkin poem about rebirth in nature. He says Alcaraz's game ‚Äúcombined so many traits that didn't belong together into a single psychedelic point.‚Äù He explains Daniil Medvedev's mock-villainous reputation by detailing his appearance this way: ‚Äúthe expansive plane of his forehead, those cunning beady eyes, the physiognomy of a supervillain plotting to take down the power grid.‚ÄùNathan admits that his work could be seen as one more cog in the tennis media's ‚ÄúRivalry Industrial Complex,‚Äù which is always itching to spring into overdrive when two players rise to the top at the same time.

Each of them has also shown an ability to live with and enjoy success. 1 in 2024, and Alcaraz has been smilier than ever during his successful 2025.This week in Paris, provided both of their bodies remain willing, they'll play in the same event for the first time since the US Open. They gave us an epic Slam final in Paris, and two decent but fairly one-sided follow-ups at Wimbledon and in New York. It won't be easy for them to keep manufacturing classics. Over the following eight years, they would only meet in one major final.What might be next for Sinner and Alcaraz, and what might put an extra edge into their rivalry in 2026? That was a major element of every Big 3 match: You knew, whenever they met, that it was life or death for millions of fans who loved their guy, and detested the guy across the net.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz touched down at La D√©fense Arena on Friday morning, gearing up for his first tour-level appearance since triumphing in Tokyo last month. First practice in the new venue for Carlos Alcaraz and 2018 champion Karen Khachanov ü¶æ#RolexParisMasters pic.twitter.com/tXSGE0soMb During his Tokyo title run, Alcaraz sustained a left-ankle injury and subsequently missed the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai. Earlier this week, he was back in his home town of El Palmar, Spain, training with his team in preparation for a return to Tour. Now, with a 5-4 record in Paris, including his best showing in 2022 when he reached the quarter-finals, the World No. Could the move to Europe's largest indoor sports venue ignite his first French crown? The centre court at La D√©fense Arena can accommodate 17,500 spectators, which makes it the second-biggest tennis court for year-round events, behind only Arthur Ashe Stadium at the US Open. Over the coming week, he will look to cross it off and tighten his grip on a potential second ATP Year-End No. Already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, Alcaraz holds a lead of more than 2,000 points over rival Jannik Sinner atop the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Alcaraz boasts a Tour-leading 67 wins and eight titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. In Paris, he is returning to indoor action for the first time since February, when he won his first trophy in these conditions at the ATP 500 in Rotterdam.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion Alexander Zverev on Friday became the fourth singles player to qualify for the season finale when he advanced to the Vienna semi-finals with Tallon Griekspoor's withdrawal. Zverev, who has now qualified for the year-end championships eight times, joined Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic in the field at Inalpi Arena. The Nitto ATP Finals will take place from 9-16 November. Zverev put himself in good position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin early in the year by making the Australian Open final, his third championship match at a Grand Slam tournament. The Hamburg native triumphed on home soil in Munich for the 24th ATP Tour title of his career, and he has now claimed at least one tour-level trophy in nine of the past 10 seasons. Zverev also made the final in Stuttgart and advanced to ATP Masters 1000 semi-finals in Toronto and Cincinnati. He is 9-3 since the event relocated to Turin in 2021 and two of those defeats have come in final-set tie-breaks. When Zverev claimed glory at the Nitto ATP Finals for the second time, in 2021, he became one of just two active singles players who has won the Nitto ATP Finals more than once, joining Djokovic. Four singles places remain at the Nitto ATP Finals, with fifth-placed Fritz currently next in line to qualify.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Who better to ask than an eight-time WTA Finals champion Martina Navratilova, who knows exactly what it takes to win this event. It took nearly 10 months and the last week in Tokyo to sort out the final qualifying spot, but the lineup is now official: Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Jessica Pegula, Elena Rybakina, Madison Keys and Jasmine Paolini. This order reflects the Race standings that will be finalized and published on Monday. It's a mix of heavy hitters and fresh storylines -- major winners, first-timers and players who arrived here on very different paths. Some powered through all year, some surged late, and some had to solve real problems along the way just to make it back to this stage. To break down the field, we turned to someone who knows this tournament better than anyone: Martina Navratilova. She won the WTA Finals eight times -- nearly twice as many as any other player -- and understands what separates qualifying from actually winning the title. Here's her read on the eight players heading to Riyadh: One major win, two finals and a semifinal. She was only three or four matches from winning the Grand Slam. Her consistency is not to be underestimated. There are so many players you can lose to these days, you have to be on your game at all times, and she was. ‚ÄúShe peaked well for all the majors. She's still rueing the French Open more than anything. She could have won that match against Coco Gauff. But she bounced back and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon, where she was beaten by Amanda Anisimova rather than beating herself. Then she won the US Open pretty decisively. ‚ÄúShe's the heavy favorite on any surface, but particularly on a medium-pace hard court where you get a solid bounce and good footing. Her shots pay off on any surface and she has enough time to get into position. ‚ÄúI feel like she's a bit of an enigma this year based on the standards she set in recent seasons. She didn't win the one everyone thought she would at Roland Garros, then she turned around and won the one no one expected her to win. Maybe the pressure was off and she said, ‚ÄòI'm just going to go for it.' ‚ÄúShe's been a bit up and down, but she won Wimbledon in an amazing way. ‚ÄúShe's played nine hard-court finals and won them all. One of those was last year in Riyadh, so look out if she gets rolling again. Her backhand is like Djokovic's -- maybe with even more power. ‚ÄúWhen the serve is happening, it's a real weapon, and I'm glad she's figuring that out. Her movement is better than anybody else. It's the one thing fully under her control. When she comes forward, she has a very good volley and it's hard to get the ball past her. She has been through so much -- losing her father and dealing with everything else that came with that. The expectations were big, almost on par with Mirra Andreeva and Coco Gauff now. Big things were expected of her and she tried to grow into that. ‚ÄúNow everything just came together for her this year and it's great to see because she's such a nice person. That Wimbledon loss had to be sitting in the back of her mind, but she beat Iga in the US Open semifinal and played well in the final. That's a hard one to bounce back from, but she did it. She's accurate on both sides and takes time away. She's adapted her game to be more aggressive, going for her shots, coming forward more, using the drop shot. She hits a nice ball, not too much topspin or slice when she's in rhythm. Now she's mixing it up much better -- the drop shot, coming in, the low-bouncing slice. She wants the ball coming onto her racquet so she can redirect, kind of like Radwanska. When the court is slow, she can really whale away.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen she won Wimbledon in 2022, the future looked bright. ‚ÄúIf I were her, I'd work on the slice more, just to change things up. Mix in more drop shots off both wings so she can knife the ball and keep opponents guessing. It's hard to tell sometimes what she's thinking on court -- she has a serious game face -- but with the way she's been playing in Asia, you can't count her out. I cried when she won the Australian Open. I thought she'd be a massive force after that because so much of her challenge was emotional. ‚ÄúShe changed her racquet and strings, but she also changed her attitude, and that was the biggest shift. She was much more consistent in Australia. It's been two months since she's played a match and there's nothing wrong with that. She decided it was a good time to take a break, train for this tournament and be physically ready for Australia. ‚ÄúShe gave herself permission not to play. ‚ÄúShe has a really fun game to watch. That could be 10 matches in eight days if you go all the way. Who better to ask than an eight-time WTA Finals champion Martina Navratilova, who knows exactly what it takes to win this event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elena Rybakina qualifies for WTA Finals Riyadh after a quarterfinal win in Tokyo over Victoria Mboko. Rybakina, from Kazakhstan, joins PIF WTA World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka along with Iga Swiatek, defending champion Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys and Jasmine Paolini in the draw in Riyadh to compete for the WTA Finals Billie Jean King Trophy. The 26-year-old secured her qualification in dramatic fashion at this year's last possible tournament, having needed to reach at least the semifinals this week at the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo which she duly did earlier today, defeating Victoria Mboko in her quarterfinal match. "The world-class singles field for the WTA Finals is now set, and I can't wait to welcome this inspiring group of athletes to Riyadh," said WTA Finals Tournament Director Garbi√±e Muguruza. Rybkakina will be appearing at the WTA Finals for the third year in a row. She made history in 2023 as Kazakhstan's first singles qualifier. She won her career ninth and 10th WTA titles this season to earn her place in Riyadh, triumphing at two WTA 500 events at the AUX ¬∑ Ningbo Open and Internationaux de Strasbourg. The former Grand Slam champion also reached a string of semifinals in addition to Tokyo, including three at WTA 1000 level at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, Cincinnati Open and National Bank Open presented by Rogers (Montreal).
