Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. President Donald Trump claimed without citing legal authority on Thursday that he doesn't need the approval of Congress to conduct his boat strike campaign in the Caribbean, simply saying his administration is “just gonna kill people.” When asked why he wouldn't seek congressional approval for the attacks if Congress would be likely to grant him war powers, Trump dismissed the idea. “Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, okay? Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. A wide variety of experts and lawmakers have pointed out that the campaign is illegal under both international and domestic law, as the Constitution declares that only Congress has the power to declare war. “To be clear, this is Trump not only admitting to using military force without Congress' constitutionally required authorization, but to committing extrajudicial killings — or in other words, murder,” said Dylan Williams, vice president for government affairs for the Center for International Policy. Notably, members of Congress have said that the Trump administration has not shared any evidence to back its claims that it is targeting “narco-terrorists” in the drug trade who are carrying drugs to the U.S. This week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. had struck two boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean — after acknowledging on Sunday that the military had targeted Colombian nationals in a strike. “I told them, the land is going to be next,” he said. Senate Democrats have launched a bid to pass a resolution to bar Trump from carrying out further boat strikes, despite the fact that they already are unconstitutional. However, Republican senators united against the resolution earlier this month, shooting it down in a 51-48 vote largely along party lines. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aerial view of the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery, Ploiești, Romania in an undated photo. Editor's note: This article was published as part of the Fighting Against Conspiracy and Trolls (FACT) project, an independent, non-partisan hub launched in mid-2025 under the umbrella of the EU Digital Media Observatory (EDMO). Click here to follow the latest stories from our hub on disinformation. After explosions at Russian-linked refineries in Romania and Hungary, reports on Oct. 22 claimed another blaze at a Druzhba-connected refinery in Slovakia. The incidents at Romania's Lukoil refinery in Ploiesti and Hungary's Szazhalombatta plant were real. Declaring that "oil refineries across Europe are burning one after another," pro-Kremlin propaganda outlets have been actively pointing a finger at Ukraine, alleging arson or a drone strike. Reports often cited a story by an obscure English- and Russian-language website CZNews Info, which made no mention of Ukraine and added a note that the incident had not been officially confirmed. Hungary and Slovakia are the only EU countries still receiving oil via the Russian pipeline, which Kyiv says helps fund Moscow's war efforts. Some Russian propagandists pointed out that the same week, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski — in a public spat with his Hungarian counterpart — voiced hope that Ukrainian drone forces would knock out the Druzhba pipeline. Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's top envoy dealing with the U.S., instead linked the incident to a now-canceled summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. "Hungary under attack for working on a peace summit?" While the incident at the Danube facility fire is still under investigation, its owner, Mol, said there was no evidence of foul play. This is not the first time Moscow has hinted at deliberate attempts to disrupt U.S.-Russia relations. Russian propaganda networks became similarly active ahead of the first summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska in August, accusing Ukraine of planning "provocations" to disrupt the talks. While flying its own drones and aircraft into NATO airspace, Moscow has been accusing Ukraine of plotting subversive activities and false flag operations on European soil. Kyiv has dismissed such accusations, warning against Russia's attempt to sow distrust between Ukraine and EU countries, and weaken its international support. "The main goal is to test NATO's reaction, sow fear in European societies, and reduce support for Ukraine," Alina Alieksieieva, deputy head of Ukraine's government-led Center for Countering Disinformation, told the Kyiv Independent in September. Our team is committed to countering disinformation with accurate, fact-based reporting. We believe that access to truth should be available to all — that's why we don't use a paywall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They are, once again, embracing gasoline engines at the expense of batteries. Porsche this week became the latest car maker to roll back its EV strategy. The company is killing plans for a new electric SUV and booked an impairment charge of €1.8-billion related to development costs. Porsche competitor Ferrari also has come to the conclusion that EVs are not ready for prime time. Editorial Board: Canada's costly EV scheme stalls out again Luxury cars such as Porsche and Ferrari are special cases. The Porsche Cayman EV starts at US$101,000 and tops out at US$232,000 for the fanciest versions, according to Car and Driver magazine. Various reports say the sticker prices of EVs are US$6,000 to US$10,000 more than a comparable gas car in the United States. The cost of buying an EV will no doubt rise since Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” has killed the federal US$7,500 EV tax credit. The bigger problem is residual values, since most EVs are leased, generally over three years, not bought. EVs lose value fast because their batteries decay, albeit fairly slowly, and are hideously expensive to replace, and because EV technology improves every year, making old models unattractive. The Tesla, an EV, lost 42 per cent of its value over two years; the Ford, with a gas engine, lost only 20 per cent (and was much cheaper to buy). With the glaring exception of China, and a few smaller countries that can afford purchase incentives, notably EV-mad Norway, the sales of battery cars are growing more slowly than expected, flat-lining or going into reverse, as they are in Canada, France and Germany. AlixPartners, a New York management consulting firm, recently halved its EV forecast, calling for the cars to make up only seven per cent of U.S. sales in 2026. EV woes: Charging isn't so simple on a busy weekend In 2024, Justin Trudeau, who was prime minister at the time, bragged that since 2020, Canada, mostly Ontario, had attracted some C$46-billion of investments across the EV supply chain, including battery-component plants. Some EV and battery plant investments are being postponed or vanishing as EV sales head south and Mr. Trump's trade war against Canada goes from unpleasant to nasty. On Thursday, he announced that U.S. had ended all trade talks with Canada, meaning that the existing 35 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods outside the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will stay put, along with duties of up to 50 per cent on steel and aluminum. Honda is postponing a $15-billion EV investment in Alliston, Ont., by at least two years. Construction of Umicore's $2.7-billion battery plant near Kingston has stopped. Northvolt of Sweden, which had been Europe's great hope to make a splash in the global battery market, went bankrupt this year, killing its plans to build a Quebec plant. Stellantis is delaying the overhaul of its Brampton, Ont., plant that would make EVs. In this case, the customer has spoken and they don't much want EVs – at least not yet. Canada, especially Ontario, may have bet wrong on battery cars. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New poll reveals president's youngest son in with fighting chance, but race is still JD Vance's to lose He has the surname, has just embarked on a nationwide tour to promote his memoir about life in the political spotlight, and won't rule anything out. So is Eric Trump, the US president's second son and a recently (if briefly) minted billionaire, planning to step into the spotlight with a 2028 run for president? For the first time, we have an idea of how it might go. Donald Trump Jr, his rabble-rousing, podcasting elder brother, has a head start in taking over the family politics business. In the second, his name was taken out and replaced with his brother, Don Jr, who ranked second, with 14 per cent, even though he says he has “zero interest” in running. In contrast, Don Jr entered the political arena. He built a huge following with his punchy social media presence and Triggered podcast, touring the country in support of Trump-endorsed candidates. He has made a series of high-profile appearances centred around cryptocurrency that saw him briefly crowned a billionaire by Forbes when his cryptomining venture went public. At the same time, his memoir, Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation, is at number one in the New York Times bestseller list. The result is a corresponding surge in questions about whether he planned to succeed his father as president in 2029 when Donald Trump's two terms are up. It is part of a pattern that leaves the door open to a run, even as he continues to build his profile. “Never say never, but hopefully I can avoid the nightmare... of politics for a little while longer,” he said this week at a book event in South Carolina, according to the Greenville News. Some have even floated the idea of a Trump-Trump ticket, with the two brothers joining forces with their complementary styles. She is frequently linked with vacant Senate seats and has floated a return to politics — if family life will allow it. James Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners, said the race is Mr Vance's to lose. He's seen a small dip, but this is close to being within the margin of error – no other candidate makes double digits, with Marco Rubio in a distant second place,” he said. Mr Vance has dropped six points since the question was last polled in July. Other big contenders from 2024, such as Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur who briefly worked alongside Elon Musk at the Department of Government Efficiency, are barely registering with Republican voters. “As always, though, Trump reigns supreme: His intervention in this race is going to be the thing that makes all the difference,” said Mr Johnson.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The East Wing of the White House has now been completely destroyed to pave way for Donald Trump's $300m planned gilded ballroom, just days after the administration announced it would happen and contradicting Trump's earlier promise that the existing building would not be touched. Satellite images on Friday showed the historic building's eastern section reduced to rubble, to the outrage of historians, former White House officials and much of the public. The demolition marked a reversal of Trump's earlier promise in July that none of the White House's existing infrastructure would be torn down during construction of the ballroom. Trump went ahead despite not first sending plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency that oversees construction and renovations to government buildings across the region. On Thursday, a White House official told Reuters that construction plans “will be soon” submitted. A White House official also told the Guardian that “The National [Capital] Planning Commission does not require permits for demolition, only for vertical construction. Earlier this week, however, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a non-profit established by Congress, sent a letter to the White House stating that the demolition plans are “legally required” to undergo public review. In their motion, Charles and Judith Voorhees said that the construction was taking place “without legally required approvals or reviews”.

Taki Allen was sitting with friends on Monday night outside Kenwood high school in Baltimore and eating a snack when police officers with guns approached him. “At first, I didn't know where they were going until they started walking toward me with guns, talking about, ‘Get on the ground,' and I was like, ‘What? '” Allen told the WBAL-TV 11 News television station. “I was just holding a Doritos bag – it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun,” Allen said. Baltimore county high schools last year began using a gun detection system using school cameras and AI to detect potential weapons. In a letter to school families obtained by WBAL TV 11 News, the school wrote: “We understand how upsetting this was for the individual that was searched as well as the other students who witnessed the incident. Our counselors will provide direct support to the students who were involved in this incident and are also available to speak with any student who may need support.” Lamont Davis, Allen's grandfather, told the television station: “Nobody wants this to happen to their child.</p>

The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday warned local authorities in California against arresting federal immigration agents for charges related to their duties after high-ranking Democrats raised such a prospect.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche addressed statements from California officials, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, who he said “called for state and local law enforcement officials to ‘arrest' federal agents and officers for enforcing federal laws enacted by the U.S. Congress, including federal immigration laws.”</p>

Dave Regan, the president of SEIU-UHW, said during a press call Thursday that “it is a 100% certainty that we have the ability to put this on the ballot in 2026, and we intend to do so.” “We know what's going to happen if we don't do this,” Regan added, alluding to the hospital closures, healthcare job cuts, and other havoc the Trump-GOP Medicaid cuts are already causing across the nation. Supporters of the new initiative warn that if Medicaid funding cuts aren't offset with new revenue, California could lose around 145,000 healthcare jobs and see hospital closures across the state, a disaster for vulnerable families. “We are already short-staffed, and every week more patients walk through our doors with fewer places to go,” said Mayra Castanada, an ultrasound technologist in Lynwood, California. Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a leading expert on wealth inequality, voiced support for the initiative, saying that “the wealth of California billionaires has exploded in recent years while health and education in California are getting defunded by the Trump administration.” “The tax is small relative to the massive gains billionaires have made, yet large enough to preserve programs that are crucial for California's economy and its continued success,” said Saez. “These federal cuts didn't happen by accident — they were designed to shield billionaires from contributing while pushing the consequences onto patients and workers,” said Reich. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ottawa's move to impose tariffs on some vehicles imported by General Motors GM-N and Stellantis NV STLA-N will harm Canada's manufacturing sector and drive off investments, the Detroit Three automakers say. Brian Kingston, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents GM, Stellantis and Ford Motor Company F-N in Canada, called Canada's retaliation “an unforced error at the worst possible time.” “We share the government's goal of protecting Canada's auto industry and its workers,” Mr. Kingston said. Tariffs on automakers in Canada when they are already under enormous pressure from U.S. trade policies only makes a difficult situation worse, he said. In response to U.S. President Donald Trump's 25-per-cent tariffs on imported vehicles, Canada launched a tariff remissions plan for the automakers that assemble cars domestically. Opinion: Canada needs to start thinking about an auto sector without U.S. automakers Ottawa determined Stellantis and GM violated the agreements with recent moves: GM ended production of the Chevrolet BrightDrop electric parcel van in Ingersoll, Ont., costing 1,150 jobs; and Stellantis moved planned production of the Jeep Compass to Illinois from Brampton, Ont., where about 3,000 are laid off. In a letter to GM Canada president Kristian Aquilina, Mr. Champagne also highlighted declining production of the Chevrolet Silverado at GM's Oshawa plant. Industry Minister Mélanie Joly threatened to sue Stellantis over the Jeep move, which the automaker made as part of a plan to boost U.S. output by 50 per cent over the next four years, adding more than 5,000 jobs in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Mr. Kingston said manufacturers facing remissions rules would rather export cars to Canada than build them here and risk being hit with tariffs for making decisions based on changing consumer demands or business requirements. “This is completely eroding our competitiveness right now for manufacturing,” Mr. Kingston said by phone. Ontario is home to plants owned by Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Honda and Toyota. Ford's Oakville plant is idle but being retooled to make pickup trucks, the company says.

Katsumi Sasazaki was attacked by the bear while cleaning an open-air bath at a hot spring ryokan inn in Kitakami, Iwate Prefecture, on Oct. 16. “Nobody had a bad word to say about him,” said Okki Okita, a ring announcer who knew Sasazaki for more than 30 years and had worked with him at the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling. Okita, whose real name is Yoshitada Okita, said Sasazaki was known for making impartial calls, and popular wrestlers such as Aja Kong affectionately called him “Sasayan.” However, Sasazaki was fatally attacked by a bear while working at the Semi Onsen inn, and his body was found in a nearby mountain forest the following day. Meiko Satomura, a former pro wrestler and representative of Sendai-based Sendai Girls' Pro-Wrestling, said of Sasazaki, “He worked to help other people, not for himself.” After the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Satomura was unable to hold wrestling events in her local area, but Sasazaki invited her to compete in bouts organized by a wrestling organization he belonged to. “From now on I'll have to work even harder for my family,” Sasazaki had said gently, while holding a photo of his daughter as a newborn. “It's so sad how things turned out,” Satomura said, choking up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the scandal surrounding Britain's Prince Andrew continues to make headlines across the world, many are asking whether the disgraced royal will be able to continue living in Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion that has been his home since 2003. But how much do we know about the sprawling property in Windsor Great Park that is home to Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and where their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, spent much of their teenage years? According to the lease, signed on August 8, 2003, rent “if demanded” was only required to be “one peppercorn” per annum. The property sits in an estate of 40 hectares (99 acres) and features a swimming pool, an aviary, six lodge cottages, a gardener's cottage and accommodation for police protecting the royals to stay in. It is situated within Windsor Great Park, close to Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage (where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex previously lived) and Forest Lodge, the Windsor residence of the Prince and Princess of Wales. There has been intense media speculation in recent days over Prince Andrew's continued occupancy of Royal Lodge. Buckingham Palace and the Crown Estate both declined to comment over reports that he is in talks to leave the residence. A house has stood on the site since at least the 1660s, although it has undergone considerable updates and renovations since then. By the mid-1820s it had become known as Royal Lodge. After George died in 1830, much of the structure was pulled down by William IV and it was used as a “grace and favor” residence for most of the rest of the century. The property was rebuilt during the 1930s around a room remaining from George IV's original cottage. Prince Andrew's late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, lived in the lodge as a child, moving there with her parents — then the Duke and Duchess of York — in 1932. Prince Andrew gives up royal titles after string of scandals Earlier planning applications show that the local authorities granted permission to build a single-story property to accommodate police officers protecting the site in 1990, and permission was given for the construction of a conservatory in 2001. Also in the grounds is Y Bwthyn Bach, which translates from Welsh as “little cottage.” The miniature thatched cottage was given by the people of Wales to the late Queen Elizabeth II on her sixth birthday and was where she and her sister, Princess Margaret, played as children — as did their children and grandchildren. In a 2012 BBC documentary called “The Diamond Queen,” Princess Beatrice said she and her sister had been “lucky enough” to play there together with their cousins as children. She described it as the “most glamorous Wendy house ever” and said that she spent about a year overseeing its renovation. This, she said, involved new wiring, new curtains and completely rethatching the cottage to give it a “bit of a spruce-up.” Viewers got to see the princess take host Andrew Marr inside the miniature property, which was fully furnished and complete with furniture, crockery and glassware and a fridge from the 1930s. In 2018, Prince Andrew and his former wife hosted the wedding celebrations for their younger daughter, Eugenie, and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, at the lodge following the official ceremony at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin vows a overwhelming response to the latest US sanctions, while there is still a window of opportunity for Russia-US dialogue on New START. Even though the new US sanctions on Russian oil majors will not affect the country's economy, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, this is an unfriendly step that will not help normalize relations between Moscow and Washington. However, Washington did not cross the red lines, deciding not to send Tomahawk missiles to Kiev, so the potential for continued Russia-US dialogue remains, experts say. While the United States is thus attempting to put pressure on Russia, not a single self-respecting country acts under pressure, the Russian leader said as he called for engaging in a serious dialogue for the longer term instead. Slutsky criticized the additional anti-Russian sanctions as a totally counterproductive step that he said will not force Russia to change its course. Russia could impose sanctions on US businesses, including in rare earths, among potential measures in response, Ivan Loshkarev, associate professor at the Department of Political Theory of MGIMO University of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Izvestia. Or else cooperation in civil space exploration could be frozen, he added. And Russia could also expand restrictions on US individuals, including high-profile officials, the expert specified. <…> Washington still refrained from arms supplies, including missile systems," the expert said. Suslov believes that a diplomatic breakthrough will come with further advancement of Russian troops. After ramping up sanctions on Russia, Trump supported Putin's proposal to maintain the limits outlined in New START. Meanwhile, the issue of nuclear arms reduction faces serious disagreements between Democrats and Republicans. However, there are no plans to revive the bilateral commission on the New START Treaty, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told Izvestia. "The Republican Party is in general more skeptical of New START, as it argues that the treaty directly increases Russia's standing and indirectly – China's posture. For their part, Democrats respect the agreement as they insist that there be no vacuum in this sphere," research fellow at the Center for International Security of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Vasily Klimov told Izvestia. However, Beijing has repeatedly stressed that it has not yet reached the limits set out in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed demands to join US-Russian talks on nuclear disarmament as senseless and unrealistic. "Even as China may join the dialogue, it refuses to take part in unjust trilateral talks on disarmament. "If or when China decides to join the dialogue – and that will hardly happen before the 2030s, – it would be based on a bilateral Russian-American agreement that should serve as a basis for a multilateral pact, involving China as well as Britain and France, too," Klimov argues. The US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added Russia's two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft, as well as their 34 subsidiaries, to its SDN list. The two companies account for more than half of Russian oil production and crude exports. Rosneft is currently implementing several international projects that were hit. Konstantin Simonov, general director of the National Energy Security Fund, described them as more of a political signal rather than a serious hit to the Russian economy. The companies will certainly face higher costs, and they will have to create new trading subsidiaries without the presence of Lukoil or Rosneft or with their share below 50%. There may also be challenges with oil supplies under long-term contracts - for example, Rosneft has signed such deals with Indian companies, the expert told Rossiyskaya Gazeta. While the expert does not expect a decline in Russia's oil production volumes or exports, he warns that costs will rise and that buyers will bargain for an additional discount on Russian oil. He believes that Trump attempted to ban what has already been restricted and that he is actually ‘going small' as regards the scope of the sanctions. The US leader demanded that India and China stop purchasing Russian oil, and he even imposed higher import tariffs on New Delhi for its energy cooperation with Russia. However, as long as India does not cut Russian oil imports amid higher tariffs, why should it do so now that two Russian oil companies have been targeted, Andrianov asked rhetorically. The European Union is negotiating a `reparations loan' for Ukraine to be financed with Russia's frozen assets, something that Moscow would view as a theft. Belgium, which hosts Euroclear holding Russian assets, may be hit most. Belgian businesses have already expressed concern that they may lose access to assets and revenues in Russia because of any retaliatory measures from the country. "The European Union is facing major reputational risks that may affect institutional investors who closely watch the situation and worry about their large portfolios and international reserves in Europe," Alexey Rodin, financial adviser and founder of Rodin.Capital, told Izvestia. "Belgium, which physically hosts Euroclear with Russian assets, understands these risks only too well, hence it opposes the plan," he added. The EU also agreed to prohibit Russian LNG imports from January 1, 2027. "This looks impressive at first glance, but, in fact, the Russian economy has already developed mechanisms for adjusting to similar situations. Workarounds will certainly be found, as was the case with previous packages," Igor Rastorguyev, a leading analyst at AMarkets, explained. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim on October 23 that he will address the upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur online, without explaining why. Therefore, Modi will skip a personal meeting with Trump to discuss a trade deal around import tariffs imposed by the United States in August as sanctions for Russian oil purchases. India is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil after China. In January-August, oil imports stood at 1.8 mln barrels per day on average, in September its oil purchases shrank to 1.6 mln bpd, or a 5% decline from August, according to data from Kpler. While several Indian companies have already ceased buying Russian oil, the country's leadership has not yet formulated decisions," he said. However, Volkhonsky continued, India realizes that a complete rejection of Russian oil is fraught with economic risks. He doubts a new trade agreement between the US and India will now be reached soon. India is still interested in Russian oil purchases, Gleb Makarevich, researcher at the Center for Indo-Pacific Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, believes. According to Indian political analyst Nandan Unnikrisnan, Modi may have cancelled his trip to Malaysia ahead of elections in Bihar, and India will gradually reduce the volume of Russian oil purchases, he argues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French President Emmanuel Macron on Oct. 24 announced that his country would provide Ukraine with "additional Aster missiles, new training programs, and new Mirage" fighter jets in the coming days, without providing further details. France and the U.K. have previously provided Ukraine with SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles, most recently used to strike a Russian chemical plant in Bryansk on Oct. 21. The Ukrainian president's visit follows a tense Oct. 17 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, during which Kyiv failed to secure a deal for the acquisition of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said on Oct. 24 that it had destroyed three Russian air defense systems worth hundreds of millions of dollars. HUR said in a Telegram post that video from a special forces operation shows the destruction via drones of two Russian Nebo radars (valued at about $100 million each) and a firing unit from a Buk SAM system (the system as a whole is worth at least $10 million and possibly more, depending on the model). The Nebo-U system was reportedly capable of monitoring the sky up to 700 kilometers into Ukraine, which helped Russian troops detect Ukrainian weapons and supported fighter jets dropping guided aerial bombs. The Soviet-era Buk-M1 surface-to-air missile systems have been used by both Ukrainians and Russians in this war. Last year, Ukraine announced it had converted the systems to shoot U.S.-made missiles Kherson on Oct. 24 came under intense Russian artillery bombardment, with what appeared to be the random targeting of residential areas killing at least two people. Videos posted to social media — some reportedly by Russian forces themselves — showed multiple explosions across a vast area of the city. The Ukrainian military on Oct. 23 released footage of what it says is a Russian first-person-view (FPV) drone "hunting Ukrainian farmers" in Donetsk Oblast. "The interception from an enemy FPV drone shows how Russian operators staged a 'safari' of civilian farmers," the post reads. An overnight drone attack hit a residential building in the city of Krasnogorsk in Moscow Oblast, injuring five people, including a child, regional governor Andrey Vorobyov claimed on Oct. 24. A drone flew into an apartment on the 14th floor of the building at around 4 a.m. local time, Vorobyov said in his Telegram post. Four victims were hospitalized, including the child who suffered a dislocated knee and minor shin injuries, he added. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed in his Telegram post that the Russian air defense had shot down three drones flying toward the capital. It only reported one drone being shot down over Moscow Oblast, contrary to the mayor's claim. In Rostov Oblast, about 1,500 people are left without electricity after the drone attack, regional governor Yuriy Slyusar claimed in his Telegram post at 6 a.m. local time. At least three people have been killed and 69 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Oct. 23. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 72 out of the 128 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones launched by Russia overnight, according to the Air Force. In Kherson Oblast, two people were killed and nine others injured due to Russian strikes, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed two people and injured seven others, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. The two killed were Freedom TV journalist Olena Hramova and cameraman Yevhen Karmazin. Their colleague, Special Correspondent Oleksandr Kolychev, was injured in the attack and has been hospitalized. Hramova, Karmazin, and Kolychev had reportedly been on assignment in the region when a Russian Lancet kamikaze drone struck the vehicle they were traveling in. “Russia continues to target journalists who are documenting its war against Ukraine — killing them and wounding them,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said, condemning the attack. Russia has lost around 1,134,170 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Oct. 24. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,283 tanks, 23,458 armored fighting vehicles, 65,356 vehicles and fuel tanks, 33,972 artillery systems, 1,526 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,230 air defense systems, 427 airplanes, 346 helicopters, 73,826 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The North Korean leader noted that the relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang has reached its pinnacle. On October 23, a ceremony was held to mark the start of construction of a museum in honor of the KPA soldiers who participated in the Kursk Region operation. According to Kim Jong Un, the museum will symbolize the blood-sealed alliance between Russia and North Korea. The North Korean leader noted that relations between the two countries grow stronger every day. "I convey words of support to the brotherly Russian people and army, and I warmly welcome our dear Russian friends who are present here," Kim Jong Un said to the Russian embassy staff who attended the ceremony. He also conveyed his greetings to those who participated in the operation to liberate the Kursk Region. Our people are very proud of the victory they achieved together with the Russian people in the struggle for independence and justice, and they place the heroes of the sacred war on a glorious pedestal," Kim Jong Un concluded. Russia and North Korea have had a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in place since 2024, which includes mutual defense. North Korean servicemen, loyal to their duty as allies, took part in the liberation of parts of the Kursk Region from Ukrainian invaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Armed Forces' General Staff Chief Army General Valery Gerasimov praised the courage and important role of the North Korean military in defending the region.</p>

TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday challenged U.S. President Donald Trump to make a friendly wager on the outcome of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers. But Carney said Trump hasn't returned his call yet on the potential bet. “I think he's afraid, I think he's afraid to make a bet,” Carney joked to The Associated Press while taking in batting practice at Toronto's Rogers Centre a day before Game 1 of the World Series in Toronto. He hasn't returned my call yet on the bet so I'm ready. We're ready to make a bet with the U.S.” I think the world is so pumped for this series,” Carney said, noting the interest in Japan because of Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani. Trump has been threatening Canada's economy and sovereignty with tariffs, most offensively by claiming Canada could be “the 51st state.” Tensions between the neighbors and longtime allies have eased slightly in recent months as Carney tries to get a trade deal with Trump.
