                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Blockx moved to within one win of a debut title at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, thanks to another big-time performance on Saturday evening. As well as deploying the explosive game that has defined his run in Jeddah, the 20-year-old Belgian showcased supreme physicality to fend off close friend Nicolai Budkov Kjaer 4-3(4), 4-3(8), 4-2. Blockx, who attended the inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals in 2017 as a fan, now awaits top seed Learner Tien or Nishesh Basavareddy in Sunday's final. "I think it may have been straight sets but it was my most difficult match this week by far," Blockx said. "I think the level we both played was really high. "We have been speaking about the Next Gen for a long time. He is one of my best friends on Tour so it was a really nice Saturday for me." In a first Lexus ATP Head2Head contest between the two big hitters, Blockx was dragged into a physical battle after winning the opening set. Budkov Kjaer extended the rallies and displayed shot tolerance of his own to signal there was still life left in the 19-year-old Norwegian. The power of Blockx, however, proved too much. "It sounds exciting," Blockx said on Sunday's final. I think physically I am feeling good, even though these are tough matches and you have shorter time between the points.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no easing your way into a match at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. It's tennis stripped of its safety nets, and as we have seen so far, this format rewards sharp starts, brave decisions and an unwavering focus from first ball to last. Top seed Learner Tien, who let slip four match points in a bitter opening defeat to Rafael Jodar, has felt just how quickly control can slip away. “I'm not sure if it's the format and it might just be me, but I feel like this week I've been struggling to focus in some of these matches,” Tien told ATPTour.com after notching his first win over Martin Landaluce. “My mind just kind of goes in and out, especially when I get up in the score, and with this format, momentum can change really quick. “I get up and then I take a few points off and suddenly we're in a no-Ad point and momentum just shifts so quickly that suddenly you can lose a set off of one game.” Live in-arena statistics are available to players, coaches and fans. For Belgium's Alexander Blockx, those moments have been opportunities rather than obstacles. “Knowing a loss of serve could be costly for a set or having more break opportunities with the sudden-death Deuce comes into my head, but this week I feel I have played those big points well,” said Blockx, who saved 86 per cent (19/22) of break points across the group stage, according to Infosys ATP Stats. By crushing 76 winners across his first three group matches, Blockx offers a perfect example of how to expertly utilise aggression in this fast-paced format. That attacking mindset is reinforced in real time, with in-arena analytics giving players, coaches and fans insights into who is dictating points, how shots are performing across every stroke, and which player is winning the battle when on the front foot — or scrambling in defence. Fast starts have been another recurring theme throughout the week. With sets to four, falling behind early can be costly. Croatia's Dino Prizmic experienced that the hard way in his opening defeat to Nishesh Basavareddy, but struck back with a sharp opening against Justin Engel. “For the first set, it is very important to have a fast start but matches are long, needing to win three sets,” Prizmic said after his four-set win over Engel. Instead, you have to be locked in and ready for battle from the get-go. “For me it is better not to change every first game. “Here it's good because we can play three games in a row to start and you get warm straight away.” Layered on top of the on-court intensity is a round-robin format that offers both pressure and opportunity. Tien, for example, rebounded from his opening heartbreak to top his group, while Jodar was eliminated despite also finishing with a positive 2-1 record. “It is a very tough but good experience,” Prizmic said of the format. Everyone is also inside the Top 200, so you are straight into it.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>
