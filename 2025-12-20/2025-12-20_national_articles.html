Day 20 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar

Day 20 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar: The Cosmic Cliffs. The James Webb Space Telescope peered inside a region at the edge of a gigantic gaseous cavity within the star cluster NGC 3324. The cluster, about 9,100 light-years away, near the Carina Nebula, is believed to be fairly young, only about 12 million years old.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When his chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair in an interview published this week that he had an “alcoholic's personality,” President Donald Trump didn't blink but agreed that he pushes the boundaries often. Pollster Brent Buchanan told us that Trump's no apologies style was what helped him beat former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. His ability to reach non-partisan voters who felt left behind and ignored with his “alcoholic's personality” did her in. “Trump's victory came from his ability to connect emotionally with these low-partisan voters — speaking to their frustrations, their sense of being left behind, their distrust of institutions,” said Buchanan, the founder of Cygnal polling. Our weekly White House Report Card graders echoed what America felt about the president's week. This was a pretty wild week for President Donald Trump and his crew, with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in a revealing Vanity Fair interview, blocking oil tankers to Venezuela, raiding an Iran-bound freighter, and vague security guarantees for Ukraine. Wiles should have expected a display of Trump Derangement Syndrome from VF, and that's what she got. Her quotes that Trump has an “alcoholic's personality,” Vice President JD Vance is a “conspiracy theorist,” and Elon Musk is a drug abuser were startling and newsworthy. She should never have agreed to the series of 11 interviews. Trump's quarantine — not a blockade — of sanctioned oil tankers going to Venezuela may be a good thing. It might force out Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro eventually but so far he hasn't budged. It'll take more to get him out. Trump is thinking about an invasion, but risking U.S. lives in such a venture isn't worthwhile. It was very strange that Trump made no mention of Venezuela in his prime-time speech on Wednesday night. Three Americans — two soldiers from the Iowa National Guard and a translator — were killed in Syria by a member of the Syrian security forces. Why do we still have troops in Syria anyhow? The raid on an Iran-bound ship from China (probably by Navy SEALs) seized military equipment, according to several news sources. The U.S. guarantees of Ukrainian security are entirely vague and may not amount to much. Russian President Vladimir Putin won't buy them anyway, and peace for Ukraine seems very far off. Peace in the Gaza Strip seems equally distant, with Hamas refusing to disarm. For all of Trump's peace-making successes, these two conflicts seem beyond him. And other peace ventures seem to be very fragile. Just too much going this week, so let's start with the obvious. President Donald Trump's grade is an “F.” It doesn't affect his grade at all. But perhaps the strangest thing that happened this week was the Vanity Fair interview with chief of staff Susie Wiles. It is not entirely what she said — as in referring to the president's “alcoholic's personality,” the vice president as a conspiracist, and Deputy Chief Stephen Miller as a zealot — or how she said it, but why she said it. Wiles is no naive country girl easily manipulated by a reporter. Was she looking for a big book deal? Is she preparing an imminent departure for either herself or Trump? Or was she merely asserting earlier than most that his whole thing is not her fault. I am not usually prone to conspiracy theories (though at times watching this administration, I find myself in a prone position), but, wow, this is all just so weird. But this week, it was all about Rob Reiner and his family and a Trump response that was just wrong.

This image provided by Blue Origin shows Blue Origin rocket lifts off on Saturday, Dec. 20, 2025 in West Texas. This photo provided by Blue Origin shows Michaela Benthaus, a German engineer aiming to become the first wheelchair user in space, talking to crewmate Hans Koenigsmann, a retired SpaceX executive who helped organize and sponsor her flight, on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025, at Blue Origin's rocket launch site in Van Horn, Texas. This image provided by Blue Origin, parachutes deploy to carry the Blue Origin's capsule to the ground after liftoff on Saturday, Dec. 20, 2025 in West Texas. A paraplegic engineer from Germany blasted off on a dream-come-true rocket ride with five other passengers Saturday, leaving her wheelchair behind to float in space while beholding Earth from on high. Severely injured in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, Michaela Benthaus became the first wheelchair user in space, launching from West Texas with Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin. She was accompanied by a retired SpaceX executive also born in Germany, Hans Koenigsmann, who helped organize and, along with Blue Origin, sponsored her trip. An ecstatic Benthaus said she laughed all the way up — the capsule soared more than 65 miles (105 kilometers) — and tried to turn upside down once in space. “It was the coolest experience,” she said shortly after landing. That's because the autonomous New Shepard capsule was designed with accessibility in mind, “making it more accessible to a wider range of people than traditional spaceflight,” said Blue Origin's Jake Mills, an engineer who trained the crew and assisted them on launch day. Among Blue Origin's previous space tourists: those with limited mobility and impaired sight or hearing, and a pair of 90-year-olds. For Benthaus, Blue Origin added a patient transfer board so she could scoot between the capsule's hatch and her seat. The recovery team also unrolled a carpet on the desert floor following touchdown, providing immediate access to her wheelchair, which she left behind at liftoff. “I never really thought that going on a spaceflight would be a real option for me because even as like a super healthy person, it's like so competitive, right?” she told The Associated Press ahead of the flight. Her accident dashed whatever hope she had. “There is like no history of people with disabilities flying to space,” she said. When Koenigsmann approached her last year about the possibility of flying on Blue Origin and experiencing more than three minutes of weightlessness on a space hop, Benthaus thought there might be a misunderstanding. But there wasn't, and she immediately signed on. It's a private mission for Benthaus with no involvement by ESA, which this year cleared reserve astronaut John McFall, an amputee, for a future flight to the International Space Station. An injured spinal cord means Benthaus can't walk at all, unlike McFall who uses a prosthetic leg and could evacuate a space capsule in an emergency at touchdown by himself. Koenigsmann was designated before flight as her emergency helper; he and Mills lifted her out of the capsule and down the short flight of steps at flight's end. “You should never give up on your dreams, right?” Benthaus urged following touchdown. While getting lots of positive feedback within “my space bubble,” she said outsiders aren't always as inclusive. They raised Blue Origin's list of space travelers to 86. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, created Blue Origin in 2000 and launched on its first passenger spaceflight in 2021. The company has since delivered spacecraft to orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida, using the bigger and more powerful New Glenn rocket, and is working to send landers to the moon.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'Fox News Sunday' to promote his new book 'The Miracles Among Us,' which details real-life medical miracles and discusses how faith can play a role in healing. One of the main premises of my new book, "The Miracles Among Us," is that we all experience miracles — we just have to look hard enough to find them, and that they come to us in many different forms, from direct divine intervention to great doctoring to advanced  technology wrapped in a compilation of coincidences. Sadly, despite praying directly to a personal God, there are countless tragedies in which not amount of prayer appears to impact the outcome. As New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan told me, God brings us the miracles He wants us to have, not necessarily the ones we ask for. My book has resonated with people who have experienced some kind of miracle and want to talk about it. This past week I was standing outside Fox News headquarters in a cold wind with a sign that said, "Bring me your miracle." Many people stopped to share their stories, including Kathleen, an elderly woman from Long Island. "I had a problem with my sinuses," she told me. "I saw two top sinus specialists, both of whom looked at my CT scans and said I needed surgery. The night before the procedure, I went to the healing center I go to and prayed with my priest for a successful healthy outcome. But as I was praying, a voice came to me and said, ‘Go see Scully. I hadn't gone to him in the first place because I thought this kind of problem needed a specialist to solve. But when I heard the voice, I knew God was telling me to see Dr. Scully, so I went to the urgent care center the next day. He talked with me, tapped my sinuses with his fingers -- which the sinus specialists hadn't done -- and told me I just needed a Benadryl at night and nothing else. Sounds like you avoided an unnecessary surgery. Split of Dr. Marc Siegel and The Miracles Among Us book cover. Indeed, not all miracles are strictly medical. Some are due to direct divine intervention and others are based on a combined mixture of belief and science. We continue to pray for National Guard Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, who, more than three weeks after being shot in the head, is now breathing on his own and can even stand with assistance, according to Medstar Washington Hospital Center where he is being treated. He faces a long road of rehabilitation, but his progress so far is already a medical miracle. This week we also continue to pray for the victims of the shooting at my alma mater, Brown University — a true ivory tower where centuries of dedicated peaceful study and discourse was suddenly shattered by a gunman, leaving profound fear, anxiety and two tragic student deaths. According to Dr. Craig Spencer, a renowned emergency room physician who was working at Rhode Island Hospital — the Level 1 trauma center where the victims were taken — the initial efforts at triage and stabilization last Saturday were successful. This means the medical team was able to stop the bleeding and stabilize their vital signs right away. We hope and pray that God will bring a full recovery to these victims and restore peace and tranquility to the university shaken to its core. As of late last night, six were in stable condition, and three had been discharged from the hospital." Brown badly needs this miracle of recovery – and soon, as Christmas approaches. is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at NYU Langone Medical Center.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But there's one that DOJ officials really can clear up — if they want to. The Trump administration was legally required to release all documents related to federal investigations of Jeffrey Epstein by Friday, with only limited grounds for withholding documents and full explanations required for any redactions. The Justice Department released several thousand documents Friday, but top officials acknowledged that they had hundreds of thousands more that weren't released yet, purportedly because they weren't reviewed or ready. Of the investigative documents released, many were entirely redacted, covered in black boxes. And while some of those swirling questions amount to conspiracy theories that will never be definitively cleared up by any document release, there is one big question that could be answered to some extent by documents in the government's possession. Namely, did investigators believe there were other men involved in Epstein's sex crimes, and if so, why didn't they charge any of them? Officials at the Justice Department have been very clear that they believe Epstein sexually abused at least hundreds of women or underage girls in the 1990s and 2000s. But officials have been much less clear on a related question: whether Epstein trafficked certain of these women or girls to any of his prominent and influential friends. Certain Epstein accusers — most notably, the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre — claimed that this is indeed what happened to them. Giuffre said publicly that Epstein groomed her to have sex with him and his influential friends in exchange for money, which she did for a few years. One of the documents in the new release describes some of officials' conversations with Giuffre that year, in which she “indicated Epstein had instructed her to have sex with numerous associates in both the United States and overseas.” Yet no other men were ever charged with Epstein-related crimes. There are many possible explanations, ranging from the prosaic (evidentiary problems, statutes of limitation) to the nefarious (cover-up) to somewhere in between (questions about witness credibility). More broadly, investigators had to at some point grapple with whether they themselves thought the evidence suggested Epstein was supplying girls or young women to his friends. Typically, such internal assessments would never see the light of day if they didn't result in charges. But they should be somewhere in the Justice Department's Epstein files. Focus on the big picture questions — not dubious tidbits that go viral. DOJ has strong norms against releasing information outside of a criminal trial, and for good reasons. New HHS rules would go after gender-affirming care for minors. What happens when you kill the country's climate science “mothership”?</p>

Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the final CFP bracket, Indiana wining its first Big Ten title since 1967 and whether they're the best team in College Football, and Notre Dame rejecting Bowl eligibility after not making the CFP. Despite dropping their regular-season finale to in-state rival Texas, the Texas A&M Aggies qualified for the College Football Playoff and earned the right to host a first-round game at Kyle Field. Nick Saban, who won seven national championships during his storied coaching career, experienced his fair share of hostile environments on road trips. But the former Alabama coach and current ESPN college football analyst floated a surprising theory about how Texas A&M turns up the volume to try to keep opposing teams off balance. While Saban did describe Kyle Field as one of the sport's "noisiest" atmospheres, he also claimed the stadium's operators have leaned on artificial crowd noise to pump up the volume during games. "I did more complaining to the SEC office—it was more than complaining that I don't really want to say on this show—about this is the noisiest place. Plus, they pipe in noise… You can't hear yourself think when you're playing out there," he told Pat McAfee on Thursday afternoon. Adding crowd noise during games does not explicitly violate NCAA rules. However, the policy does mandate a certain level of consistency. Kyle Field before the start of the game between Texas A&M Aggies and the Alabama Crimson Tide at Kyle Field on Oct. 12, 2019 in College Station, Texas. According to the governing body's rulebook: "Artificial crowd noise, by conference policy or mutual consent of the institutions, is allowed. However, all current rules remain in effect dealing with bands, music and other sounds. As with all administrative rules, the referee may stop the game and direct game management to adjust." Regardless of the possible presence of artificial noise, the Miami Hurricanes will likely face a raucous crowd when Saturday's first-round CFP game kicks off at 12 p.m. Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

The all-important ability to see the world through another person's eyes is now being recast as something corrosive. The argument goes like this: if you're empathetic, you're being manipulated into accepting all manner of ideas, behaviors or policies that you would otherwise reject. Empathy, in this view, is a Trojan horse for weakness. But that's a dangerous distortion. It recognizes that the people we disagree with have reasons for their choices. And people are intrinsically valuable, even if we're on opposite sides. Far from weakening conviction, empathy actually strengthens it by grounding our beliefs in humanity, not hatred. A story from World War II illustrates this. It reminds us that even in our darkest moments, empathy must triumph. On Dec. 20, 1943, in the frenzied skies above war-torn Europe, two bitter enemies met in what remains one of World War II's most remarkable encounters. An American B-17 bomber, piloted by 21-year-old West Virginian Charles Brown, was shredded by enemy fire. Bullets had torn through the fuselage. Several crew members were bleeding out. Flying nearby was the enemy: Franz Stigler, 28, a veteran German fighter ace. Stigler had every incentive to pull the trigger. Of the 40,000 German fighter pilots in WWII, only 2,000 lived to see the war's end. But when Stigler flew up alongside Brown's limping bomber, something extraordinary happened, according to historian Adam Makos, who chronicled the incredible encounter in his book "A Higher Call." Stigler didn't turn his machine guns on the Americans. Instead, Stigler risked his own reputation, career and even life, to fly for miles in close proximity to the bomber's wingtip, providing a shield for the damaged enemy plane from other fighters. Instead of killing his enemy, the German fighter pilot escorted the sputtering American bomber to safety. Even more remarkable, Stigler was one bomber kill away from the Knight's Cross, Germany's highest award for valor. He gave that up by sparing Brown. Stigler was ordered never to speak of the act again, at risk of facing a firing squad. German fighter ace Franz Stigler, 28, showed his humanity by sparing an American bomber. Some explain the incident as chivalry, a relic of an older code of honor. Others dismiss it as an anomaly, a glitch in the machinery of war. But to me, it was something deeper. We live in a culture that rewards outrage. We're told that empathy is naïve and that to understand another person's pain is to surrender our convictions. Empathy is the courage to rise above a tribal reflex and act by a higher call. Stigler risked his own reputation, career and even life, to fly for miles in close proximity to the bomber's wingtip, providing a shield for the damaged enemy plane from other fighters. Do we reduce them to caricatures, or do we remember their humanity? Marcus Brotherton writes extensively about veterans and World War II.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police lights flashed for hours as law enforcement officers surrounded a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, Thursday night, finally closing in on a suspect who unleashed deadly attacks on two communities and had managed to evade them for six days. Outside was an abandoned car linked to both the Brown University mass shooting on Saturday and the killing of an MIT professor at his home on Monday. Inside a rented storage unit, the 48-year-old suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, was dead, leaving behind a satchel, two 9 mm firearms and high-capacity magazines matching ballistics at both crime scenes, along with even more questions about a motive as investigators begin peeling back the layers of his life to fill the gaps in his known past. Authorities have said the suspect's intent was to cause harm in targeting the Ivy League university and esteemed MIT professor Nuno Loureiro. It became clear because his actions showed signs of premeditation, for example, obtaining access to firearms and a bulletproof vest, said CNN law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow. He also took strategic steps to avoid detection like swapping the license plates on a rental car linked to both shootings, concealing his identity and avoiding Brown University's expansive network of 1,200 security cameras by opening fire in a building equipped with only two exterior cameras, and with multiple exits and entrances. Investigators have mapped some of the suspect's movements in the years before his attacks, but much of his past remains a mystery. The Portuguese national attended the same academic program as Loureiro in Portugal from 1995 to 2000, after which he studied at Brown University on an F1 visa, a nonimmigrant visa for international students to study full-time. He then took a leave of absence and formally withdrew from the university effective July 31, 2003. There has been no formal explanation from the university on the basis for the leave, but according to CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, it could also point to a potential motive. Miller says investigators will likely ask questions like: Did he blame a life event for derailing his success as a former student who was described by his then-classmates as “brilliant” but also exceptionally difficult? What issue caused him not to return? Details on the suspect's whereabouts between 2001 and 2017, however, have proved elusive at this stage. But the suspect's strategies do suggest he may have been planning for an encounter with police or an escape, Wackrow said. One scenario, he says, could be the suspect was alerted authorities were on his trail. He rented a hotel room in Boston from November 26 to 30 before renting a gray Nissan Sentra with Florida plates in the same city and then driving in the car to Brown University on December 1. On December 13, the suspect opened fire at students in the on-campus auditorium of the Barus and Holley building, killing Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and injuring nine others. On December 15, the suspect fatally shot Loureiro at the professor's home in Brookline before immediately driving back to a storage facility in Salem where he had rented a unit. It appears the suspect then swiped into his storage unit in Salem the same day and did not swipe out, Neronha told CNN on Friday. Some leads developed in the investigation turned out not to be valid, according to Neronha, which he said is not unusual. When asked by CNN's Erin Burnett whether the Thursday call wasn't actually from the suspect, Neronha said, “That's correct.” Beyond the discrepancy, authorities on Thursday spent frantic hours on Thursday trying to track the suspect and the car they believed he was driving, and had information he would be returning his rented car in Boston boarding a flight out of Logan International Airport, according to a law enforcement official. His storage unit served as a “logical base of operations,” said Miller, and his arrival in the Brown University area nearly two weeks before the shooting indicates he had been planning for the attack. Investigators were only able to identify a potential link between the Brown University shooting and the MIT professor killing in the past two days after officials initially said there was no connection between the crimes. After authorities confirmed the suspect and Loureiro were students at the same university in Portugal between 1995 and 2000, it left more uncertainty as there's no information the two had any relationship beyond briefly overlapping as physics students and a shared time on campus. Still, authorities say he targeted the professor. Some of the questions investigators will be asking, according to Miller, are: Did Loureiro and the suspect know each other? The suspect had to research the home address of Loureiro, and it was a highly targeted killing, which points to premeditation, said Miller. A former classmate of the suspect told CNN's Burnett he recognized Loureiro when the news of his death came out. Scott Watson, a professor at Syracuse University, said the MIT professor would sometimes come to Brown, but added he was unsure if Loureiro and the suspect were friends. At Thursday's news conference when officials announced the suspect was found dead, they repeatedly praised an unidentified tipster and graduate of Brown University who broke the case open, saying “everybody in Providence owes this individual a debt of gratitude.” John said he remained outside as the man kept circling back to the area before quickly changing directions every time he saw John, the document said. CNN's Holmes Lybrand, Evan Perez, John Miller, Taylor Romine and Alaa Elassar contributed to this report.</p>

Season three of HBO's “The White Lotus” was filmed at several hotels in Thailand, including the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket. CNN Travel's Karla Cripps visited earlier this year and took us on a quick tour. “We are introducing people to cruising that would never have considered it,” Tina Edmundson, president of luxury for Marriott International, tells CNN of the boutique-style offerings that are at the other end of the scale from the boom in super-sized cruise ships. In 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed at Washington National Airport, exposing the dangers of ice accumulation when flying in winter. It was a tragic event that changed how US airlines deal with freezing conditions. CNN's Alexandra Skores went behind the scenes and under the planes at Chicago O'Hare to see how specialized deicer crews keep passengers safe. It was the first US airport to be built for the jet age and its iconic mobile lounges, or people-movers, are what has made Dulles unique. After 60 years of operation, however, Dulles International regularly makes it onto “worst airport” lists, with President Trump recently describing it as “terrible.” Here's the story of how the innovation that made it so original would also make it so unpopular.

This undated photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows former President Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein. This undated, redacted photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows Ghislaine Maxwell and former President Bill Clinton swimming with an unknown person. Another photo shows him in a pool with Epstein's longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted. After the photos were released, several White House officials, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt and top aide Steven Cheung, made social media posts highlighting them. Trump didn't talk about the issue as he left the White House late Friday on his way to deliver a speech in North Carolina. Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone's name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise. In a statement, Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said the White House was “shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever.” Long before Friday's photos, Republicans had zeroed in on the former president and his association with Epstein. Republicans on the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed both Bill and Hillary Clinton for depositions earlier this year, but received a response that the Clintons wanted to provide a written statement of what “little information” they had on Epstein. The Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer, has demanded they appear for in-person testimonies and threatened to initiate contempt of Congress proceedings if they don't. Multiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before Congress, but none has been compelled to do so. When Clinton was president, Epstein visited the White House multiple times, visitor logs show. After he left office, Epstein assisted with some of the former president's philanthropy. Clinton flew multiple times on Epstein's private jet, including on a humanitarian trip to Africa with actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker in 2002. Clinton first ran for president in 1992 as a new type of Democrat, hailing from the South with an appeal that united his party's base along with moderate voters. He had a prime-time speaking slot during last summer's Democratic National Convention in which he made a forceful case for Kamala Harris' candidacy. But Clinton's ties to the Epstein case are a reminder of how his political promise has always been tempered by personal indiscretions. His 1992 campaign was dogged by rumors of an affair with Gennifer Flowers, which he denied at the time. His presidency was rocked when he was impeached in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice when he denied engaging in a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Trump, whose 2016 campaign was nearly derailed when a tape emerged of him bragging about grabbing women by the genitals, has often deflected allegations of sexual misconduct by pointing to Clinton's behavior. In an interview published by Vanity Fair this week, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said Trump “was wrong” in frequently suggesting the Epstein files included incriminating information about Clinton.

This undated photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows Jeffrey Epstein and Michael Jackson. This undated, redacted photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows Ghislaine Maxwell and former President Bill Clinton swimming with an unknown person. But there was almost no material related to another old Epstein friend, President Donald Trump, aside from a few well-known images, sparing the White House from having to confront fresh questions about a relationship the administration has tried in vain to minimize. The records, consisting largely of pictures but also including call logs, grand jury testimony, interview transcripts and other documents, arrived amid extraordinary anticipation that they might offer the most detailed look yet at nearly two decades worth of government scrutiny of Epstein's sexual abuse of young women and underage girls. Yet the release, replete with redactions, seemed unlikely to satisfy the clamor for information given how many records had yet to be released and because some of the materials had already been made public. In a letter to Congress, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote that the Justice Department was continuing to review files in its possession, was withholding some documents under exemptions meant to protect victims and expected additional disclosures by the end of the year. Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. But bowing to political pressure from fellow Republicans, Trump last month signed a bill giving the Justice Department 30 days to release most of its files and communications related to Epstein, including information about the investigation into his death in a federal jail. A team of AP reporters is working to confirm information released by the Justice Department regarding Jeffrey Epstein. ▶ Read our statement of news values and principles Those include two in which Trump and Epstein are posing with now-first lady Melania Trump in February 2000 at an event at his Mar-a-Lago resort. He has said he cut off ties with Epstein after the financier hired young female employees from Mar-a-Lago and has repeatedly denied knowledge of his crimes. The FBI and Justice Department abruptly announced in July that they would not be releasing any additional records, a decision that was supported by Trump. But the president reversed course once it became clear that congressional action was inevitable. Among other prominent Epstein contacts is the former Prince Andrew, who appears in a photograph released Friday wearing a tuxedo and lying on the laps of what appear to be several women who are seated, dressed in formalwear. Pop star Michael Jackson also appears in multiple photos, including one showing him standing next to a smiling Epstein. Another shows him in a pool with Epstein's longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted. This undated, redacted photo released by the U.S. Department of Justice shows former President Bill Clinton with an unknown person. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote “Oh my!” and added a shocked face emoji in response to a photo of Clinton in the hot tub. “They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton,” Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said in a statement. “There are two types of people here,” he said. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.” After nearly two decades of court action, a voluminous number of Epstein records had already been public before Friday, including flight logs, address books, email correspondence, police reports, grand jury records, courtroom testimony and deposition transcripts. Besides public curiosity about whether any of Epstein's associates knew about or participated in the abuse, Epstein's accusers have also sought answers about why federal authorities shut down their initial investigation into the allegations in 2008. “Just put out the files,” said Marina Lacerda, who says she survived sexual assault by Epstein. “And stop redacting names that don't need to be redacted.” One of the few revelations in the documents was a copy of the earliest known concern about Epstein's behavior -- a report taken by the FBI of a woman in 1996 who believed photos and negatives she had taken of her 12-year-old and 16-year-old sisters for a personal art project had been stolen by Epstein. Police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein in 2005 after the family of a 14-year-old girl reported being molested at his mansion. Authorities gathered testimony from multiple underage girls who said they'd been hired to give Epstein sexual massages. Ultimately, prosecutors gave Epstein a deal that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution. Epstein's accusers spent years in civil litigation trying to get that plea deal set aside. One of those women, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters, starting at age 17, with other men, including billionaires, famous academics, politicians and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, then known as Britain's Prince Andrew. Mountbatten-Windsor denied ever having sex with Giuffre, but King Charles III stripped him of his royal titles this year. Prosecutors never brought charges in connection with Giuffre's claims, but her account fueled conspiracy theories about supposed government plots to protect the powerful. Prosecutors then charged Maxwell, his longtime confidant, with recruiting underage girls for Epstein to abuse. She was convicted in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
