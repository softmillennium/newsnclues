Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor took Ghislaine Maxwell to the inner sanctum of the Royal family's Sandringham retreat, the Epstein files have revealed.

A photograph of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor shows him sprawled across the laps of five women as Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend Maxwell looks on.

Taken in the saloon room of the King and Queen's country retreat in Norfolk, it is one of a series of images exposing the unparalleled access to British high society and power that the former prince granted the paedophile.

The Royal family traditionally meet in Sandringham's saloon room for afternoon tea on Christmas Eve, before gathering there again the next day to watch the monarch's pre-recorded Christmas message.

The photograph shows Maxwell smiling at Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, who is wearing a black suit and bow tie and smiling with his face close to the bare legs of one of the women, whose identities have all been obscured.

Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed on Saturday morning riding at Royal Lodge at Windsor. He is set to move to Sandringham permanently next year after being forced out by the King over his friendship with Epstein.

Sandringham was the scene of what Mr Mountbatten-Windsor described as a “straightforward shooting weekend” during his catastrophic Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis in 2019.

A friend of the former prince tried to play down the reaction to the photograph, saying: “We don't see what the problem is. It's just hi-jinks at a party. He's fully clothed.”

Another photograph from the Epstein files shows Maxwell, who is now serving 20 years in prison for sex trafficking, standing outside 10 Downing Street.

One picture captures the pair with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor in the Royal Box at Ascot, probably on a well-documented visit to Ladies' Day in June 2000, when both Elizabeth II and the late Queen Mother were in attendance.

Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has since described Epstein as his “plus one”, and in no way a guest of the Royal family.

The released files also include a photograph of Andrew with Epstein and Maxwell shooting on the heathlands of Balmoral.

Maxwell and actor Kevin Spacey were previously photographed sitting on the thrones in Buckingham Palace during a separate visit organised by Mr Mountbatten Windsor.

Andrew Lownie, the Royal historian, said Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had allowed Epstein and Maxwell to treat royal residences as “their private playground, mixing public and private with no sense of decorum”.

He said: “These photographs

 will not look at all good in the eyes of the public. Epstein and Maxwell were given the opportunity to go anywhere and Andrew appears to have been too stupid to notice he was being taken advantage of in this way.”

The latest release of photographs suggests Maxwell and Epstein enjoyed numerous visits to the UK to meet the late Queen's son.

Other photos released from the Epstein files also show Sarah Ferguson, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, sitting with a woman on a sofa and standing with another in the street. Both women's identities have been redacted.

In September 2025, it emerged Ms Ferguson “humbly” apologised to Epstein in April 2011, calling him her “dear friend”, after publicly disowning him in March 2011.

She said she had never called him a paedophile after he reacted furiously to comments she had made about him in an interview, according to emails obtained by the Mail on Sunday.

Fresh revelations over the extent of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein's friendship could prove a further embarrassment for the Royal family.

Details of the former duke's friendship with the paedophile, which continued after Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a child for prostitution, had threatened to plunge the monarchy into crisis earlier in 2025, prompting the King to strip him of his remaining titles.

The scandal effectively made Mr Mountbatten-Windsor a palace outcast. Earlier this week, he was pictured riding alone in the rain on the Sandringham estate.

The former duke was ordered in October to leave Royal Lodge, his residence in Windsor, following weeks of scrutiny over his links to Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, his accuser.

In a posthumous memoir published earlier that month, Giuffre repeated allegations that she was made to have sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions. He has always denied the claims and any other wrongdoing.

In an unprecedented statement stripping his brother of the Duke of York title in November, the King said that his “utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse”.

The move followed revelations in a drip-feed of documents, the latest tranche of which was published on Friday, that proved Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had lied to the public over claims that he had cut ties with Epstein.

The former prince claimed in the 2019 Newsnight interview that he ended his friendship with the financier in 2010 following Epstein's conviction for procuring a child for prostitution.

A recently surfaced email showed the former duke continued to pursue their friendship beyond this, writing to Epstein in 2011: “We are in this together.”

Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail in Manhattan, New York, as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. He had previously pleaded guilty to child sex offences in 2008. Maxwell was convicted of child sex trafficking and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2021.

The first account of how he met Maxwell has resurfaced in the documents released by the US department of justice.

A biography of the financier contained within the disclosures claims that he saved Maxwell from falling into a “deep depression” after her father's death.

The British socialite had moved to New York in 1991, months before Robert Maxwell fell to his death from his yacht, Lady Ghislaine, in an apparent suicide aged 68. She met Epstein shortly after her father's death.

The typed account (below), which is written in the third person, describes how Epstein and Maxwell met through “mutual friends”, and claims she found the friendship “immediately rewarding”.

The account, which is recorded as being Epstein's “personal history”, appears to have been drafted as part of his defence after he was charged in Florida in 2006 with solicitation of a minor.

The profile claims that Epstein knew there were “few bright spots for [Maxwell] during that period” and that he took her regularly to comedy clubs, which she “found enormously palliative in relieving her depression”.

It is claimed that he sought to lift her spirits by giving her “books to read – good novels, scientific studies – containing issues to challenge her mind”.

The account states that Epstein arranged for Maxwell “to secure a loan that would help her get a foothold in the business world” , and that, “[o]ver time, their relationship became intimate”.

According to the account, Epstein and Maxwell's relationship ended “amicably” in 2000 as “the nature of the demands of his work, i.e, the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world, precluded a good married life with children”. Maxwell was reported to have wanted to start a family with Epstein.

The text also excerpts passages of what appear to be a character witness of Epstein written by Maxwell (above). In it she said: “My experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man, with a keen sense of humor and a ready smile – a man of principles and values and a man of his word.

“If he made a promise, he would always follow through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is disciplined in business and conscientious. A man always quick to help someone who is down, or to offer an opportunity to someone to pursue a dream or a goal.”

Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

When news broke of the Bondi Beach shooting, those of us in the global Palestine solidarity movement knew immediately what was coming. We've seen this pattern: when liberation movements challenge state power and when genocide is named and resisted, states seize on any incident, any tragedy, to justify criminalizing that resistance. Since October 2023, as Israel has carried out genocide in Gaza, Australia has built an apparatus to suppress Palestine solidarity: envoys, task forces, and “safety” initiatives that treat anti-genocide organizing as a threat.

We knew the Bondi shooting would be weaponized against us because Zionism — through Israeli state institutions, lobby groups, and complicit governments — has made Jewish safety inseparable from Israeli state interests. It is not because of any connection to Palestine, but because the victims were Jewish. Zionism has constructed a system where any harm to Jews, regardless of context or motive, becomes justification to criminalize Palestine solidarity and crush demands for liberation.

Within hours, despite minimal details and no established motive, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu blamed Australia's recognition of Palestinian statehood, claiming it “pours fuel on the antisemitic fire.” After the shooting, he declared Australia had “let the disease spread and the result is the horrific attacks on Jews we saw today.” Israeli officials claimed “the blood of the victims is on the hands of the Australian government” for not standing “unequivocally” with Israel. The New York Times published Bret Stephens' op-ed: “Bondi Beach Is What ‘Globalize the Intifada' Looks Like.” The Atlantic ran “The Intifada Comes to Bondi Beach.” 

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spoke of those who seek to “extinguish light and promote darkness” — echoing Netanyahu's framing of a “war between children of light and the children of darkness” to justify extermination in Gaza. By deploying the rhetoric of light versus darkness, it lays the foundations for a moral and legal framework where anything deemed threatening to the existing order — which, as we've established, includes Palestine solidarity — becomes a legitimate target for state repression.

Jillian Segal — Australia's Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism and an executive member of Australia's peak Zionist lobby group, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry — drew an explicit line between a march across Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of Palestine to mass murder. 

“We saw the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge and now Bondi Beach, each a progression,” she said, linking the October 2023 Opera House protest and the August 2025 March for Humanity — where 300,000 people peacefully marched over Sydney Harbour Bridge — directly to the Bondi shooting. 

Politicians and media amplified the connection without challenge. No evidence connected the attack to Palestinian movement work, but that didn't matter. Suddenly, a shooting with no connection to Palestine had become proof that Palestine solidarity leads to mass murder, justifying repression that was already planned.

Within days, the government moved. Prime Minister Albanese adopted Segal's entire proposed antisemitism plan — recommendations she had released in July 2025.

Her plan proposes defunding schools, universities, media outlets, and cultural institutions that “fail to act against antisemitism,” while monitoring the ABC and SBS, Australia's public broadcasters, for “fair” reporting. The IHRA definition — which treats criticism of Israel's policies, comparisons between Israel and apartheid South Africa, or claims that Israel is a racist endeavor as “antisemitic” — is now set to become the framework for cutting funding and terminating employment in Australia's media.

Albanese announced sweeping new powers targeting “preachers and leaders who promote violence,” as well as organizations engaging in “hate speech promoting violence or racial hatred.” The Home Affairs Minister gained power to cancel visas for those who “spread hate and division,” allowing the government to deny entry to solidarity activists and deport organizers. Federal parliament may yet be recalled to rush through legislation. Under the guise of combating hate speech and violence, these are the tools to defund, deplatform and fire anyone organizing against genocide.

The government announced financial assistance payments for Bondi victims, mirroring the scheme established after October 7 for Australians impacted by Hamas attacks under the Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment — a scheme never extended to Australian-Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israeli forces.

The Education Minister announced a 12-month antisemitism education taskforce led by the former Chancellor of the University of New South Wales David Gonski, working with the Special Envoy, to reshape curriculums “from early education right through to universities” to address students making Jewish peers “feel unwelcome” — campus organizing for Palestine will be embedded as antisemitism in educational policy from childhood.

NSW Premier Chris Minns recalled parliament to pass laws allowing police to reject protest applications under a “terrorism designation.” He claimed mass demonstrations could “light a flame impossible to extinguish,” effectively designating Palestine protests — which have sustained nearly weekly demonstrations for over two years, making them among the most enduring solidarity movements in Australian history — as potential terrorism, giving police the power to ban them. 

Minns also indicated that he is open to arming the Community Security Group — a private organization with documented ties to Israeli intelligence — to operate at public events, with Victoria already allocating $900,000 to the group in the wake of the Bondi attack. (An Australian Defence Force officer recently lost his security clearance for “divided loyalty” after CSG training in Israel). Essentially, a foreign-aligned militia could be deputized to police Australian streets and surveil organizers.

At the memorial for Bondi victims, an Israeli flag flies alongside Australian flags. The conflation is complete: Jewish safety becomes inseparable from Israeli state interests, and therefore solidarity with Palestinians becomes a threat, and criminalizing that solidarity becomes justified as protection. When a Jewish woman wearing a keffiyeh attempted to attend the vigil — wearing it, she said, because of the Israeli flag on display — police escorted her out. She knew people who died. This was her community. But “Jewish safety,” it turns out, means safety only for those who align with Israel, not Jews who stand with Palestine.

Meanwhile, Australia continues manufacturing and shipping weapons components to enable mass death in Gaza — a reality the government continues to deny. A shooting at an iconic national beach becomes terrorism and justifies sweeping powers. But Israel's systematic destruction of Gaza — mass killing of civilians, deliberate starvation, and erasure of entire families — is deemed self-defense. Palestinian liberation is an existential threat, while Israel's genocidal violence is a supported policy.

The response to Bondi lays bare what the state has been building since October 2023: infrastructure to protect Australia's stake in Israeli genocide from challenge. This serves Zionist lobby groups like the Executive Council of Australian Jewry that weaponize Jewish safety to justify Israel's exterminationist policies. It serves a settler-colonial state defending another settler-colonial project. What's being defended here is Australia's complicity. 

Ultimately, the response to this shooting accelerates what was already brewing: heightened powers, intensified surveillance, and violence against organizing, now legitimized. State repression doesn't require a connection between incident and response. It requires opportunity.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

We've set an ambitious target for our year-end campaign — a goal of $205,000 to keep up our fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout before December 31. If you have the means, please dig deep.

Donald Trump has claimed that he could pay himself $1 billion in US government money as damages for a raid carried out at his Mar-a-Lago estate by the FBI.

Federal agents searched Trump's property in Palm Beach, Florida in August 2022 as part of an investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified documents during his first term in office. Last year, the case was dismissed by a judge, who ruled that Special Counsel Jack Smith did not have the authority to prosecute the president.

Trump addressed the issue during his rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on Friday, calling the search “illegal” and claiming that the FBI had been “forced” to conduct the operarion by the then President Joe Biden's Department of Justice (DOJ).

“These thugs are disgusting and we cannot let them get away with this stuff,” he insisted.

The president told the crowd that he had filed a lawsuit over the raid and assured that he will be “winning” it.

“There is only one problem… I am suing and I am the one that is supposed to settle. So maybe I will give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity. Does that make sense?” he asked.

Trump claimed that “there has never been a case like this. Donald Trump sues the US. Donald Trump becomes president. And now Donald Trump has to settle the suit… Isn't that a strange position to be in? I have got to make a deal – I negotiate with myself.”

“'I hereby give myself $1 billion.' Actually, maybe I shouldn't give it to charity. Maybe I should keep the money... No, I don't want to do it. But whatever happens, it is all going to good charities,” he promised.

Trump's lawyers filed two separate administrative claims in 2023 and 2024 over DOJ's investigations into him. The claims are technically not lawsuits and are first reviewed by the US Department of Justice to determine if they can be resolved out of court.

The New York Times reported in October that the president has been pushing for the DOJ to pay him a $230 million settlement.

BUDAPEST, December 20. /TASS/. Financing Ukraine and sending military aid there to continue the conflict with Russia only weakens the European Union, instead of making it stronger, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.

He recalled that the European Union's summit on December 18 and 19 in Brussels decided to grant a military loan to Ukraine in 2026-2027 at the expense of a common European loan worth 90 billion euro. In the past four years, the EU allocated a sum of 180 billion euro to Kiev and thus, Europe's overall assistance to Ukraine has reached 270 billion euro.

"Today, the problem is that with each new decision we are weakening ourselves instead of making us stronger. Ukraine adds no strength to Europe but only takes it away. We should not finance the Ukrainian army, we should not strengthen Ukraine but we should strengthen the armies of countries located west of Ukraine. We need to reinforce the armies of the countries of Europe for Europe," he said at a meeting with activists of the ruling Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Alliance party in the city of Szeged.

            If you've been diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, you're in good company. The condition affects millions of Americans and is the leading cause of heel pain in adults. As common as this foot pain is, its causes vary. It could be the cheap sandals you're wearing with no arch support, a sudden change in your health or fitness routine or even a lack of foot strength exercises throughout your physical therapy.
    


            Whatever the culprit, the podiatrists I spoke with emphasized the importance of proper footwear — and no, your Adidas Sambas don't count. So,–– give up the cheap sneakers (for now) and try a pair of the following kicks, which experts say are some of the best shoes for plantar fasciitis on the market.

The Hoka Clifton 10 are Dr. Priya Parthasarathy's top pick for runners with plantar fasciitis. The board-certified podiatrist said the shoes have “generous heel cushioning to reduce stress” on your feet and added that they're also suitable for a multitude of foot types. Our health and fitness editor Summer Cartwright said these shoes have similar support to orthopedic shoes but are "less clunky and easier to wear, and [they] look a whole lot better.”

Our associate editor Jillian Tracy is also praises the Clifton model, calling the American Podiatric Medical Association-approved pair her favorite running shoes. In her review, she said that they offer a “bouncy, soft feel” and robust support, which kept her naturally high arches happy on longer runs.



Board-certified podiatric surgeon Dr. Miguel Cunha points runners with plantar fasciitis to the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24, which use the brand's proprietary GuideRails technology to help prevent pronation and shin rotation and ensure proper alignment on the road. Cunha said this is “critical for reducing strain on the plantar fascia.”

The Adrenaline also earned plaudits in our guide to walking shoes for flat feet, with podiatrist Dr. Danny Phan praising their high toe drop (the height distance between where your heels and toes sit), which reduces stress on the calves and Achilles tendon. You can also invest in the pair's successor, the even cushier Adrenaline GTS 25.



When our testing and updates writer Michelle Rae Uy got her hands on New Balance's Fresh Foam line, she was impressed by the shoes' stability, breathability and bouncy insoles, writing that they'll “be very kind to your knees, lower back and, naturally, feet and legs.” She also tried the 1080v14, which are a great option if you need shoes for standing all day or cushioned running shoes.

Cunha said the cushy midsoles provides “responsive support” while the stiffer EVA stability planes reduce overpronation, which can worsen plantar fasciitis. Cartwright said she relies on these shoes all throughout her marathon training, because even when she's going on 20-mile runs, they remain comfortable and supportive. Like other shoes on this list, these come with the APMA Seal of Acceptance.

Parthasarathy said these are “casual, cute walking shoes that provide support.” Though they look like an everyday pair of casual shoes, they boast bouncy, breathable footbeds that offer plenty of support. Unfortunately, they're only available in women's sizes.



“This is one of the best walking shoes for plantar fasciitis because of its ultra-plush cushioning,” Cunha said, adding that they provide “soft, shock‑absorbing heel strike” that keeps stress at a minimum. If you prefer soft cushioning that absorbs shock like a Tempur-Pedic bed, these are an ideal option for you. 

The GEL-Nimbus 27 also make great everyday gym shoes, according to CNN Underscored contributor Marissa Miller, who is also a certified personal trainer. According to her, the “heavily cushioned footbeds” reduce impact and fatigue, whether you're wearing them while running or pumping iron.



With their shock-absorbing midsoles, deep heel cups and contoured arch support, Cunha said the Vionic 23 Walk 2.0 effectively alleviate plantar fascia stress. Unlike more technical running or walking shoes, they also look like laid-back sneakers you can wear for casual outings.

These sneakers also topped our best walking shoes list, with podiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Daughtry highlighting their removable arch supports and firm heel counters, which make them perfect for short-distance strolls.

In our guide of the best walking shoes, experts said sneakers should be supportive and cushioned to allow for shock absorption. The Echelon Walker 3 checks those boxes with its PWRRUN midsoles, which Cunha said “cushions every step to absorb impact.” While the shoes have been discontinued, you can still find them in men's sizes at Amazon.

Want to feel like you're walking on clouds? Consider the Bondi 9, which Cunha said make great max-cushion running shoes for plantar fasciitis patients. He especially recommends them for people with wide feet, as they're available in wide and extra‑wide widths, which “allow your foot to splay naturally without feeling jammed,” he said. This is a crucial design feature because when your feet sit naturally, less pressure is placed on your joints and tendons, allowing for a (hopefully) pain-free experience.

Cartwright is a Bondi 9 enthusiast too. In her glowing review, the four-time marathoner said they offer tons of support. “Wearing these shoes feels like wearing a swaddle on my feet,” she wrote. “Every part of my foot, from my toes to my heels, is secure.” That's exactly what you want when you're dealing with damaged, stressed fascia. 





For plantar fasciitis patients with wide feet, Parthasarathy recommends the Glycerin 22, given their wide toe boxes and availability in wide and extra-wide widths. With plush midsoles, they're tuned for long runs and walks on pavement.

I can confirm the Glycerin 22 are great for wide feet, as they've been my go-to men's running shoes for the past year. The beauty of the Glycerin 22, Parthasarathy said, is that they come in multiple versions. “The GTS model adds stability for patients with overpronation, while the Max version provides enhanced shock absorption for those needing additional cushioning,” she said.



Cunha said the Cloudrunner 2 are supportive stability shoes with plenty of cushioning, making them another top pick for plantar fasciitis patients with wide feet. That's in large part thanks to the Helion midsoles, which he said “[provide] plush, energy returning cushioning to reduce strain of the plantar fascia.”

The shoes also feature a stiff TPU heel counters, which provide extra support when paired with the reinforced uppers. The Cloudmonster, which our associate testing writer Gareen Puglia tried when testing the best beginner running shoes, are an even cushier option from On.

“Home shoe gear is just as important as outdoor shoe gear when battling plantar fasciitis,” Parthasarathy said. The podiatrist recommends the Ora Recovery 3 and their supportive footbeds and plush cushions for at-home use. CNN Underscored contributing writer Dana Zepeda also loves these recovery sandals, calling them a “revelation” for sore feet in her review.

Vionic's Relax 2 slippers are proof that you don't have to sacrifice coziness for comfort, even if you have plantar fasciitis. The APMA-approved slippers, which come recommended by Parthasarathy, combine peak-cozy, faux-shearling uppers with shock-absorbing, supportive midsoles.



Chelsea Stone, CNN Underscored's editorial director, has flat feet prone to plantar fasciitis, but she's found relief with the Ooahh sandals, which she calls the most comfortable shoes she's ever worn. “While I can't say the Oofos have cured all my foot ailments — my flat feet, after all, are a structural issue — I can report that pain associated with my plantar fasciitis has never been triggered by the Ooahh slides,” she said in her review.

The Ooahh sandals, another Parthasarathy pick, are also helpful for plantar fasciitis on account of their shock-absorbent soles. Not to mention, their specialty footbeds are designed to reduce knee pain.

            Parthasarathy tells her patients that the three ingredients for recovery are stretching the plantar fascia, reducing inflammation and supporting the feet. Finding supportive shoes is, therefore, paramount to treating plantar fasciitis, especially since Parthasarathy said flexible, nonsupportive shoes “increase load on your plantar fascia.”
    


            To find the right shoes, it's always recommended to see a health care provider for their insights, as well as visiting a specialty shoe store like Fleet Feet for an in-depth foot analysis. Parthasarathy and Cunha recommend looking for the following criteria:

            The following FAQs have been answered by podiatrists Dr. Miguel Cunha, Dr. Priya Parthasarathy and Dr. Naomi Shields.
    


            “Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of the band of fibrous connective tissue (fascia) running along the bottom (plantar surface) of the foot, from the heel to the ball of the foot,” Parthasarathy said.
    


            Anything that irritates or damages this tissue can cause plantar fasciitis, she added, including changes in weight, pregnancy, the shoes you wear or your activity level.
    


            “The most common sign of plantar fasciitis is stabbing pain in the bottom of your foot when you get out of bed in the morning, after standing for prolonged periods of time or when you stand up after sitting for a while,” Cunha said. That said, you should always consult a podiatrist for a proper diagnosis.
    


            Shields said shoe inserts can help especially if you have flat feet, which tend to put more stress on the plantar fascia.
    


            That said, Parthasarathy stressed that inserts need to match your foot type or else they could worsen your condition. “I recommend starting with a supportive shoe and seeing a podiatrist for guidance,” she said.
    


            Proper support is crucial to increasing stability, reducing arch collapse and preventing foot fatigue, Cunha said. Consequently, you should avoid shoes with the following qualities:
    


            All three podiatrists said that you should generally avoid barefoot shoes while dealing with plantar fasciitis because they don't offer enough support. If you want to try them when your feet have recovered, Parthasarathy advises consulting a podiatrist for recommendations and only wearing them for short periods of time during low-impact activities.
    


            Like barefoot shoes, Cunha said that “walking barefoot, especially on hard floors, can result in overstretching of the plantar fascia, leading to tiny tears, inflammation and an increased risk of developing plantar fasciitis.” Instead, opt for shoes with proper arch support.

FCI Dublin was shut down in 2024 after revelations of abuse against prisoners. Residents want it to stay closed.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

On December 16, 2025, the Dublin City Council in California unanimously passed a resolution formally opposing reopening or reusing the notorious FCI Dublin prison for detention of any kind, including as an immigration jail. The resolution also urged the relevant federal agencies to “engage in open and transparent communication with the City regarding any decisions affecting the site.”

The resolution comes after months of organizing by local and regional residents and a coalition of faith-based organizations, advocacy groups, and those who were imprisoned in FCI Dublin.

That includes Darlene Baker, who was incarcerated at the Dublin federal prison camp from 2022 to 2023. There, she was sexually assaulted by then-medical officer Jeffrey Wilson.

“I suffered severe retaliation by Dublin officers and staff” for reporting the assault, she recounted in a letter to the Dublin City Council. Still, she continued to speak out. “During this time, I served as a whistleblower, forwarding details of abuse and neglect to former Congresswoman Jackie Speier who was actively investigating the ‘toxic culture' of Dublin,” she continued.

In August 2025, Wilson and another officer pled guilty. They were the ninth and tenth staff members to be convicted of sexually abusing women imprisoned in Dublin.

As reported earlier by Truthout, FCI Dublin was abruptly shuttered in April 2024 following widespread coverage of rampant sexual abuse and the arrests of staff, from the warden and chaplain to more than half a dozen officers. In December 2024, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) agreed to a $116 million settlement for 103 survivors, including Baker. It is the largest settlement for sexual assault survivors in U.S. prison history. 

In August 2024, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) put out a request for information for available detention facilities within a two-hour commute of four urban areas in California, including San Francisco. The nearest ICE prisons are four to five hours away in Bakersfield.

In February 2025, ICE officials toured the closed prison. Since Donald Trump's second inauguration, ICE has opened 59 new facilities and reopened 77 previously-closed sites to jail migrants.

When Baker learned that the prison, dubbed “the Rape Club” for the pervasive sexual abuse of prisoners, might be reopened as an immigrant prison, she was shocked.

“I learned the hard way while I was inside FCI Dublin Camp that the feds are not subject to the rules that the rest of us have to follow,” she wrote in an email to Truthout. “I was especially concerned about the vulnerable population of immigrants — with language difficulties, no due process, and limited access to legal assistance.”

Residents Spring Into Action

The city council resolution notes the ongoing opposition from longtime residents, county officials, medical professionals, and those whose family members have been taken by ICE. 

“The frequent, ongoing protests in the Tri-Valley area have demonstrated the deep resistance felt by the public for ICE presence in Dublin and in the surrounding communities.”

“The frequent, ongoing protests in the Tri-Valley area have demonstrated the deep resistance felt by the public for ICE presence in Dublin and in the surrounding communities,” it noted.

In November, 150 people — including city residents, regional medical professionals, and advocates — rallied outside the monthly city council meeting. Nearly three dozen then filed in to voice their opposition to councilmembers. The next month, nearly 40 community members spoke in favor of the resolution before the council vote.

Dublin is located 23 miles from Oakland in the East Bay area of Alameda County, one of three counties that make up the Tri-Valley. Eighty-one percent of Dublin's 70,500 residents are citizens although 40 percent are foreign-born. 

In 2022, Detention Watch Network found that immigrants in counties with more detention beds are significantly more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE.

When news of FCI Dublin's potential conversion spread, residents sprang into action. With ICE raids in many other cities, including Los Angeles, many fear that a migrant jail in Dublin would increase ICE presence and raids in the area, terrorizing their neighbors and community.

During the first Trump administration, area residents had formed Indivisible Tri-Valley, a regional chapter of a larger network aimed at electing progressive Democrats and defeating the MAGA agenda. After hearing about the potential conversion, the group joined ICE Out of Dublin, a coalition encompassing residents, faith-based organizations, advocacy groups, and those who were imprisoned in Dublin.

Every Saturday afternoon, Indivisible Tri-Valley members hold a vigil on Dublin Boulevard, the city's main street. Dubbed the Dublin Peace Corner, 20 to 100 people rally with signs, flags, whistles, and horns.

They demonstrate their opposition in other ways as well. At another community gathering, members screen-printed signs that read “No ICE prison in Dublin” and “Immigrants are welcome here.” Members took those signs, along with red cards notifying people of their rights and yellow cards with hotline numbers to report ICE sightings, to local businesses, including restaurants, corner stores, and taquerias.

Indivisible Tri-Valley member Dan Morley told Truthout that more than one restaurant proprietor thanked them for their actions. “We have people back here in the kitchen who are living in fear,” they told him. 

Lawmakers, too, have voiced their opposition. Representatives Mark DeSaulnier and Zoe Lofgren sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, the BOP, and ICE opposing any planned conversion. They highlighted the site's insufficient infrastructure, hazardous conditions, and history of abuse of incarcerated immigrants. In April and again in November, Dublin City Manager Colleen Tribby sent a letter to BOP Director William K. Marshall III voicing the city's opposition to repurposing the site for ICE detention and citing the well-documented health and safety hazards, including asbestos and mold.

“You Have the Power to Stop History From Repeating Itself”

The closed prison sits on federal land, exempting it from local and state zoning and permitting processes. The Dublin City Council has no power to prevent the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) from transferring the site to ICE. But it does possess the power to pass a resolution opposing the conversion, which residents have urged them to do.

“Legally they can't do anything more because it's federal — not city — property,” local activist Liz Schmitt explained. Still, she continued, a resolution “would let everyone know that a detention center is not wanted here.”

At the city council's November meeting, more than two-thirds of the 35 people who spoke were Dublin residents, ranging from high school students to grandparents. Some were the children or grandchildren of immigrants. Others had family members detained by ICE and some feared similar detentions. One resident, afraid to appear at the meeting, sent a statement with a friend. Their fear is not unfounded: three weeks earlier, ICE had taken their father. “My three-year-old sister always asks, ‘Where's Dad?' My mother has no answer because he was kidnapped,” they wrote.

Kendra Drysdale, who was also sexually abused while incarcerated at Dublin, also testified. “I'm here tonight on behalf of all of the survivors to urge you to oppose the reopening of FCI Dublin — not by the Bureau of Prisons and not by ICE.” she said. “For hundreds of us, it was a place of abuse, retaliation and silence. Reopening it would reopen trauma that many of us are still fighting our way through.” She noted that ICE jails are rife with the same abuses, silencing, and retaliation.

Medical professionals also voiced their opposition. Jeff Wilson (a longtime Dublin resident and not the former FCI Dublin medical officer) works at Kaiser Permanente, a cancer hospital in Dublin. He showed a flyer from the hospital's union instructing members on protecting their patients' constitutional rights from ICE. He had supported the closing of FCI Dublin. “It's shameful that people associate Dublin with ‘Club Rape,'” he said before adding, “I hope that Dublin doesn't move on to become known as the City Against Human Rights.”

Douglas Yoshida is an emergency physician at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley medical center, the nearest medical facility to the Dublin prison. His parents were teenagers when they were detained under then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which led to the imprisonment of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans.

“My parents survived these prison camps — but their experience was not a relic of history; it's an injustice that feels all too familiar today,” he wrote in a June op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle, comparing the ICE raids and detentions to his parents' experiences.

Standing before the city council five months later, he added that an ICE jail “will threaten the health care of our community. We will have to admit many patients that could be treated as outpatients in the community. Furthermore, will our large immigrant community feel safe seeking care if there are armed, masked men patrolling the hospital?”

At the end of his three minutes, he told the city council, “You have the power to stop history from repeating itself.”

In late November, the Bureau of Prisons sent a brief response to the city manager's letter: “At this time, BOP has no indication that the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement will utilize the facility and BOP has no plans to reopen the facility.” In December, the BOP told the City that it was planning to permanently deactivate, close, and dispose of the prison, transferring the site to the GSA. The GSA can transfer the site to ICE, allowing a migrant jail to open. 

“I have a vivid memory of what it felt like to be detained, watching and experiencing the atrocities and inhumane conditions, and not really having a voice to help … I pray no other humans will have to experience this despair.”

Still, said Morley, the resolution was necessary to voice the city's objections to an ICE prison. “It offers community members more of a sense of safety, that the city is standing up for them and supporting them. Then, the goal is to get surrounding cities to do similar resolutions because this affects the entire Bay Area and other northern California cities.”

Dublin is not the only city fighting to stop ICE from opening a migrant jail. In Leavenworth, Kansas, city leaders filed two lawsuits to prevent private prison contractor CoreCivic from opening an immigrant prison. A state court issued an injunction doing just that. And in Newport, Oregon, local residents launched a campaign against a prospective migrant jail ahead of rumors that ICE was looking into opening one in their city.

“I have a vivid memory of what it felt like to be detained, watching and experiencing the atrocities and inhumane conditions, and not really having a voice to help,” Baker wrote. “I pray no other humans will have to experience this despair.”

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

We've set an ambitious target for our year-end campaign — a goal of $205,000 to keep up our fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout before December 31. If you have the means, please dig deep.

            Luigi Mangione's lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi's decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer's parent company.
    


            Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department's charge to turn Mangione's federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a “profound conflict of interest” that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.
    


            By involving herself in the death penalty decision and making public statements suggesting that Mangione deserves execution, Bondi broke a vow she made before taking office in February that she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year, Mangione's lawyers said.
    


            They argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard — and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group — through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.
    


Fake name, unrecorded minutes and a backpack search. What we've learned at Luigi Mangione's pre-trial hearing



            The “very person” empowered to seek Mangione's death “has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,” his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest “should have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,” they added.
    


            Messages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.
    


            Bondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”
    


            Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group's annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.
    


            Mangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.
    


Luigi Mangione was arrested one year ago today. Inside how it went down



            Friday's filing put the focus back on Mangione's federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.
    


            Mangione's defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi's past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.
    


            In a September court filing, Mangione's lawyers argued that Bondi's announcement that she was ordering prosecutors to seek the death penalty — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.
    


            Bondi's statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration's flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione's constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said.
    


Evidence photos from Luigi Mangione's arrest



            In a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that “pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.”
    


            Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense's concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione's rights are respected at trial.
    


            “What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments” rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. “None warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.”
    


            Mangione's lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi's ties to Ballard and the firm's relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi's compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from “all individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.”

Ukrainian long-range drones have struck two Russian Su-27 fighter jets at the Belbek military airfield in Russian-occupied Crimea, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Dec. 20.

The drones are operated by the SBU's Special Operations Center "A" (Alpha), according to the agency. 

Belbek is a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea located near Sevastopol. It has been used by Russian forces as a key hub for deploying fighter aircraft and positioning air defense assets on the peninsula.

"Long-range drones of the SBU's Alpha Special Operations Center hit two Su-27 aircraft at the Russian military airfield in Belbek, temporarily occupied Crimea. One of the planes was on a taxiway with a full combat load and ready for a combat sortie — it was destroyed," the SBU wrote on Telegram.

The SBU said the combined cost of the two aircraft is estimated at around $70 million. It also said that the airfield's control tower was struck, which "may complicate the organization and control of flights at the airfield."

"This is already the second successful SBU attack on the Belbek airfield in recent days. On Dec. 18, our drones struck Russian equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars — including two Nebo-SVU radars, a 92N6 radar of the S-400 Triumph system, a Pantsir-S2 air defense system, and a MiG-31 aircraft with a full combat load," the agency added. 

Strikes on key Russian airfields and the destruction of aircraft and air defense systems in occupied Crimea "significantly reduce the enemy's military potential in the region," the agency said.

"This systematic work will continue," the SBU said.

 Liberated in 2022, Kherson is still under daily attack from Russian forces across the Dnipro River. The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell and Olena Zashko report from a city living under anti-drone nets and constant surveillance, showing how everyday life, from hospitals and schools to aid deliveries and cultural events, continues under threat, and why residents refuse to leave.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry is working on establishing a mechanism for providing Ukrainian citizen living abroad the ability to vote in the country's next election, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 20.

Sea drones have become a crucial component of Ukraine's defense toolkit, and co-production with a NATO ally could enhance long-term output and deepen European defense-industrial cooperation at sea.

According. Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Russia had mobilized 18,092 foreigners from 128 countries as of October. 

The drones are operated by the SBU's Special Operations Center "A" (Alpha), according to the agency. 

The planned Miami meetings follow Witkoff and Kushner's talks in Berlin earlier this week with Ukrainian and European officials on revisions to a U.S.-backed peace plan.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia targeted Ukraine overnight with three Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from occupied Crimea and 51 attack drones. 

SSO drones also hit a Russian oil platform located at the Filanovsky oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea. The platform is owned by Russian oil company Lukoil and is used for oil and gas extraction.



"Yesterday evening, Russia carried out a missile strike on a port infrastructure facility in Odesa Oblast. Some of the victims were on a bus that was at the epicenter of the strike," the State Emergency Service reported.

"This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance," U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X.

"We agreed with our American partners on further steps and the continuation of our joint work in the near future," delegation leader Rustem Umerov said after the meeting. 

"We're not concerned about an escalation with Russia, with regards to Venezuela ... I think they have their hands full in Ukraine," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Dec. 19.

The SBU's Alpha Special Operations Center's drones hit a gas turbine unit at the Rakushechnoe deposit at the platform run by Russian oil giant Lukoil, the source said.

MOSCOW, December 20. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a greeting read by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, stated that Russia prioritizes developing "friendly, fully equal, and mutually beneficial relations with African partners."

"It is symbolic that this event is taking place in Egypt," the greeting at the second ministerial conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum stated. Putin noted that African states "possess enormous economic and human potential and are playing an increasingly significant role in global politics," establishing the continent as a key center of the "multipolar world order."

He highlighted intensified cooperation, with Russia supporting African nations in security, food security, counterterrorism, disaster relief and disease control and stressed that the conference is tasked with reviewing the progress of the current Action Plan and outlining new joint work in trade, economics and investment. Putin expressed confidence that discussions would prepare for the next Russia-Africa Summit with concrete proposals.

Companies seeking government funding or fast-tracking must make their case to the blunt former investment banker, who has little interest in partisanship or policy debates

For companies that arrive cap-in-hand to pitch energy or mining projects that might meet Canada's moment of economic reckoning, a sit-down with the most influential member of Prime Minister Mark Carney's cabinet can be a novel and jarring experience. 

Tim Hodgson isn't much for the pleasantries that usually kick off such meetings, sometimes at length, with other ministers. Nor is he one to make make broadly enthusiastic if non-committal noises about whatever is on the table, be gentle in discussing qualms or potential roadblocks, or spend much time talking about where the project might fit into the wider policy landscape. 

Instead, Mr. Hodgson – who this year went straight from a long career as an investment banker to being the country's Energy and Natural Resources Minister – tends to almost immediately go deeply and unsparingly into the proposal's financial fundamentals.

If he thinks proponents are wasting their time, he doesn't hold back letting them know. If he thinks there's strong potential, he'll ask tough questions and poke holes if there are any. He can sometimes lecture, even if his visitors might have more experience than he does with the type of project being discussed.

Enough people found Mr. Hodgson's bedside manner off-putting, in his first months on the job, that his staff encouraged him to soften it a bit.

But to others, including some who have endured his bluntness, it's a major virtue – forcing companies to up their games when seeking federal support, giving them a clearer sense than previously of how to get across the finish line, and helping the government figure out which projects really deserve to be fast tracked for permitting or public financing.

And in the eyes of admirers – including, by all accounts, a Prime Minister who counts him as his closest friend and confidant in cabinet – it's one of the ways that Mr. Hodgson is necessarily reorienting Ottawa's relationship with resource-based industries on which it's largely pinning Canada's hopes for greater economic sovereignty in the face of U.S. aggression.

To get a sense of what that involves, The Globe and Mail interviewed more than 20 people who have interacted with Mr. Hodgson during his seven months in office – including industry leaders, lobbyists and government officials – as well as Mr. Hodgson himself.

What emerged, through descriptions of his dealings with industry and within government, is a picture of a minister who is highly unusual in ways that perfectly align with Mr. Carney's economic ambitions, yet could pose some risk to them.

Veteran executives who enter government tend to talk about running it more like the private sector, but Mr. Hodgson is proving better positioned and more determined to do so than most. 

Less interested than colleagues in Liberal orthodoxy or policy debates, he's squarely focused on reaching investment deals – including for critical-mineral extraction, oil-and-gas infrastructure and carbon-capture technology that is billed as making it sustainable, and to strengthen electricity grids – at a pace to which Ottawa is unaccustomed. 

He's more accessible than his predecessors to industry and spends less time on the minutiae of his department. He remains so inclined toward Bay Street language that ministry officials half-joke they need to send him term sheets, not briefing notes.

Yet despite his private-sector track record – highlighted by a Goldman Sachs tenure in which he became chief executive officer of its Canadian operations, a stint as managing partner of private investment firm Alignvest Management Corp. and an array of recent board memberships that included chairing Ontario's Hydro One Ltd. – he has entered Ottawa with limited knowledge of its workings. 

His public-sector experience was limited to less than two years as an adviser to Mr. Carney at the Bank of Canada, which is not closely connected to the rest of government. His political experience was virtually non-existent, and he had no known history with the party he is now serving. He's known among friends to be deeply patriotic, informed by continuing his family's history of military service before entering business and by charitable work for veterans, but few previously imagined him seeking office.

“I was shocked,” said Jim Leech, the former Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan CEO who is close to Mr. Hodgson. Mr. Leech thought it likelier that Mr. Hodgson, whom he considers a somewhat fiscally conservative political centrist like himself, would ease into retirement, before a sense of duty and the chance to serve with his friend Mr. Carney beckoned. 

Already, Mr. Hodgson has encountered potential pitfalls. Among them: running afoul of other Liberals as he steers a de-prioritization of climate goals in favour of re-embracing the oil-and-gas sector, and misaligning the need for speed with getting First Nations support that could make or break projects he's pursuing. 

So, authoritative though he is poring over capital stacks with would-be investors, Mr. Hodgson has been on a steep learning curve when it comes to the demands of public life, and what being a chief dealmaker on the government's side of the table really entails.

Mr. Hodgson is not especially inclined toward reflecting on that personal journey thus far, at least for public consumption.

Asked at the start of an interview in his office what lessons he's taken from his first months in Ottawa, he replied with more of an explanation of a governing philosophy that he (like Mr. Carney) has seemingly adopted from the get-go.

“I think what I've learned is actually not that different than business: You need to be pragmatic,” he said. “When you come in and you sort of have rigid thinking or ideological rigidness, you miss opportunities to get things done.”

Behind the scenes, however, he has indeed been attempting to improve as he goes along.

That applies, most obviously, to public performance – making the case for the government's agenda and answering critical questions.

Despite a commanding boardroom presence, he's not a natural behind a microphone. Delivering introductory speeches to business audiences shortly after entering cabinet, he read from prepared texts in a monotone, occasionally stumbling over words.

He also does not particularly care for performing political theatre. He surprised himself by enjoying knocking on doors in his Greater Toronto Area riding during this year's election campaign, he said, where largely first-generation Canadians “fully understand this is the greatest country in the world” and counterbalanced the “everything's broken” grumbling he was hearing in elite circles. But he is sourer on Ottawa's daily cut-and-thrust.

“Look, I have colleagues who relish the sport of Question Period,” he said. “I find it somewhat disingenuous, and I guess a necessary part of democracy.”

He can also get frustrated by media coverage. Discussing Indigenous relations, he recalled going to a First Nations summit where he felt that the vast majority of chiefs were supportive of his pitch about shared economic prosperity, or open-minded, only for journalists to seek out the small minority who were hostile to it.

Nevertheless, he appeared to recognize from the outset that this was an area of vulnerability and, according to staff, proved more willing than some rookie ministers to undertake media training.

The results have been imperfect. One of the worst moments of his fledgling political career came weeks ago, when he was asked by a TV interviewer about ensuring Indigenous consultation around a potential oil pipeline and replied that “It's called Zoom.” (He apologized the next day.)

But such flashes of impatience have been less common than might be expected of someone known for them in private. And he has started to make speaking publicly look a little less like a chore.

In the interview for this story, he discussed aspects of his job in some detail without talking himself into trouble. And he managed a dash of folksiness when he brought up how childhood experiences in an Armed Forces family across Canada – in logging and mill towns, in Nova Scotia with kids who'd miss school to work on lobster boats, at a vocational high school where friends went on to oil rigs – help make his current job feel visceral.

A common hope, among allies, is that he's landing in a sweet spot where he can speak political language well enough to get by while maintaining some plain-spoken outsider appeal.

Corey Hogan, a Liberal MP from Calgary who is a parliamentary secretary to Mr. Hodgson, pointed to a recent parliamentary committee appearance where Mr. Hodgson responded to Conservative badgering with the air of someone accustomed to doing business in the real world, and bemused by his inquisitors' disinterest in hearing actual answers to their questions.

“His power is he acts like a normal executive in these situations,” Mr. Hogan said.

 – Tim Hodgson

The rookie minister's executive instincts were on display, in a different way, as he began his new job.

Government officials who interacted with him immediately following his swearing-in last May were struck by his negativity toward Ottawa's bureaucratic and political culture – a mindset, common on Bay Street, that the capital was beset by laziness and incompetence. 

The impression they got, not entirely different from one conveyed by Mr. Carney, was that Mr. Hodgson viewed himself as an adult who had arrived to cut the nonsense. 

At the same time, he also understandably had limited knowledge of government processes or his departmental responsibilities. Before long, he had to lean on some of the same civil servants and political staff to show him the ropes, and learn the levers at his disposal and the complexities of balancing different interests.

There have been some tells, as to recognizing the starting point wasn't quite as bad as he thought. 

One of them has been in how he's sought to reduce federal-provincial overlap in approving energy and resource investments, and deliver on Mr. Carney's “one project, one review” campaign promise.

As he boasted in the interview, Ottawa has recently moved in that direction by reaching co-operation agreements with provinces through provisions in the existing Impact Assessment Act – an effort that began under his predecessor, Jonathan Wilkinson. Meanwhile, controversial powers to override normal permitting processes under the Building Canada Act, which the government hurriedly pushed through shortly after Mr. Carney and Mr. Hodgson took over, have yet to be used.

But if his views have softened, he hasn't abandoned them entirely. Asked whether government is as broken as he thought coming in, Mr. Hodgson homed in on what he sees as an abundance of caution mismatched with the hinge moment that Mr. Carney frequently invokes.

“My observation of government is that the default modality is that not making a decision is less risky than making a decision,” he said, suggesting it's easier to buy time while waiting for more information. 

“We don't have that luxury. We need to make decisions. We need to retool our economy … And that requires a level of boldness and ambition in government that hasn't really been there.”

Toward that end, he has (more than many incoming ministers) jettisoned most of the policy staff he inherited from Mr. Wilkinson, who was known as a policy wonk committed to carefully finding the right balance between economic and environmental goals. To replace them, he's largely sought out young staff who, like him, have more financial than political experience.

Among bureaucrats, meanwhile, word has spread that Mr. Hodgson expects advice sent to him to be quick and to the point, with as many numbers and as little word salad as possible. 

That is, if those bureaucrats are engaging with him at all. There are corners of his ministry, including those dedicated primarily to reckoning with aspects the long-term transition to low-carbon energy, that have yet to have much contact with him.

That lack of access, which has prompted some grumbling internally, has not been a complaint from industry – at least sectors such as oil and gas, nuclear, mining and forestry, in which Mr. Carney's government sees opportunity to leverage existing strengths.

Their members have found Mr. Hodgson as accessible, if brisk, as any minister they can recall. 

“He's clear, he's blunt and he's up-front – which is refreshing,” said Explorers and Producers Association of Canada president Tristan Goodman, whose organization represents fossil-fuel extractors outside the oil sands.

How Mr. Hodgson chooses to spend his time points toward his emphasis on the nitty-gritty of reaching specific deals rather than obsessing over broader policy frameworks. Though leveraging his position to nail down investments is also likely a more complex undertaking than when he was in the private sector.

It's not as though Mr. Hodgson can make snap permitting decisions, many of which don't even rest with his ministry, when at the table across from project proponents. 

And while his meetings tend to focus heavily on the financials, he's limited in what he can directly do there, too.

The government's largest vehicles for loans, equity stakes, offtake agreements and other forms of concessional financing to get projects off the ground – including the Canada Growth Fund, Canada Infrastructure Bank and new Indigenous Loan Guarantee Corp. – are all supposed to function with high degrees of independence.

Now in the mix, too, is the Major Projects Office established by Mr. Carney and run out of Calgary by former energy executive Dawn Farrell, which is meant to provide some regulatory and financial co-ordination.

Mr. Hodgson does have some dollars at his disposal, including a $2-billion critical minerals fund in last month's budget. And there are plenty of projects, particularly in that sector, that are too small to go to the MPO but could collectively add up.

But there are other ways he wields his influence, some formal and some less so.

Among his responsibilities is chairing the Build Canada committee, which Mr. Carney established and which Mr. Hodgson described as cabinet's main economic committee, responsible for trying to spur $500-billion of investment across sectors. Among its focuses, he said, is “de-pancaking” regulations (reducing overlap across departments), plus being “a fulcrum for all the different financing tools and a convening forum.”

Build Canada oversees the MPO, and Mr. Hodgson sits on the MPO's investment committee, so he has some sway over what gets referred there and how the office gets rolling.

His job is partly to serve as the government's eyes and ears for what potential investments, big and small, are out there. And then there is how he puts his business acumen to use in determining which possibilities are credible – particularly important in mining, as a wide range of companies seek to capitalize on the frenzy to counter China's critical-minerals dominance.

As for how he tries to make those assessments, and work with proponents to get pitches ready for prime time, Mr. Hodgson invoked the five factors in the Building Canada Act for designating large projects to be in the national interest, which may be instructive of how hard the government tries to advance smaller projects as well. 

Boiled down, those criteria include strengthening Canada's sovereignty, providing economic benefit, having a high likelihood of success, and advancing Indigenous interests and climate-change objectives. 

He gave the example of a pair of projects. If “a great proponent” had a projected internal rate of return of 20 per cent, it would seem a slam dunk. If another pencilled out to only an 8 per cent IRR, it might not totally align with the likelihood of success metric. But if it were in something such as rare earths, it could be enough of a strategic priority to try to advance anyway. 

In that case, he might try to help figure out which financial tools at the government's disposal – low-interest lending, equity stakes, money for surrounding infrastructure – might get the rate of return to a more attractive level.

Those conversations would happen with the proponent and within Mr. Hodgson's department. “I'm kind of like: Hey, how have you thought about it? How have you priced this out? Have you thought through the five criteria and what are the tools to help us get there? And do we think if we've referred this to the MPO, they'd be supportive?”

What Mr. Hodgson didn't say, but others in government observed, is that he will sometimes then try to wield soft power around Ottawa, signalling to other departments and agencies that he thinks targeted dollars could get a desirable project over the line. The same can go for the permitting side. The idea is to get everything moving quickly in lockstep, not slowly in piecemeal fashion.

Such efforts are taken seriously by other ministers and officials, both because of Mr. Hodgson's expertise and because they know how much Mr. Carney has entrusted him. 

But his perceived influence on the government's agenda could also prove a double-edged sword – including with members of the governing party to which he is a newcomer.

Initially, Mr. Hodgson did not seem terribly concerned about endearing himself to fellow Liberal caucus members, whom he made little secret of considering fortunate to have gotten or kept their jobs by virtue of Mr. Carney's leadership. He has since worked harder to build bridges, making himself accessible and proving willing to delegate to his parliamentary secretaries, Mr. Hogan and Quebec MP Claude Guay.

There is nevertheless a large fault line running between him and the many Liberal MPs for whom an ambitious agenda to combat climate change is an article of faith.

Mr. Hodgson was not primarily responsible for last month's memorandum of understanding with Alberta, in which Ottawa agreed to drop or soften several environmental policies put in place under former prime minister Justin Trudeau in return for strengthening industrial carbon pricing, and opened the door to a new oil pipeline. Although he was involved, the negotiations were led by top officials from the Prime Minister's Office and Privy Council Office.

But while he is the point person for the government's pursuit of investments in conventional energy, he has not shown quite the same level of enthusiasm for renewable power, and even his admirers in government concede he's at the least-green end of the Liberal spectrum.

One of the corporate boards he sat on was that of oil-sands producer MEG Energy Corp. And asked how he sees Canada's place in the global energy transition, he spoke almost entirely about fossil fuels, including through advancing (still notional) carbon-capture projects in the oil sands and exporting natural gas as a transition fuel.

As for his message to climate-concerned colleagues, he invoked broader benefits. “If we produce the cleanest, best version of those products, our allies want them,” he said. 

“It's a point of national security, and we can use that revenue to pay for our $10-a-day daycare, our new dental care program and our school lunch programs ... or provincially pay for universal health care or subsidized postsecondary education. I think Canadians say, ‘Hey, we should do that.'”

On another point of concern for many members of the government, relations with Indigenous leaders and communities, Mr. Hodgson went further out of his way in the interview to signal it as a shared priority. Invoking success during his time chairing Hydro One in partnering with First Nations to build transmission lines, he emphasized the importance of Indigenous participation in all projects while acknowledging he's still learning countrywide dynamics.

Still, his move-fast approach has already at times seemed an awkward fit with Indigenous leadership's desire for extensive consultation.

On these and other potential tension points, Mr. Hodgson seemingly has Mr. Carney's blessing and is doing his bidding. But a possibility flagged by veterans of Liberal politics is that he could become a lightning rod for caucus members reluctant to challenge their leader and wanting someone else to blame for a rightward shift.

It's unlikely that danger is keeping Mr. Hodgson up at night. Based on all available accounts, he holds no great political ambitions, is in Ottawa because Mr. Carney asked him, and will judge himself primarily by how many deals he gets done in whatever time he has there.

It's too early for him or anyone else to pass that judgment. 

There have been initial signs of success, mostly around minerals, highlighted by investments in six mining and processing projects in Ontario and Quebec announced on the margins of a G7 summit this fall. But most of the other, larger projects referred to the MPO thus far were in the works before Mr. Carney and Mr. Hodgson took office. 

By the standards they've set for themselves, the real test will be how much, and how quickly, the deal flow picks up in 2026 and beyond. And if the chief dealmaker offends some sensibilities along the way, so be it.

“What the Prime Minister has said, which I've taken to heart,” Mr. Hodgson said, “is that we need to focus on outcomes, not how we get there.”

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) carried out kamikaze drone strikes on a Russian patrol ship and an oil platform in the Caspian Sea on Dec. 19, the SSO reported on Dec. 20.

The patrol ship is designated Project 22460 Hunter, part of the Rubin class of Russian Coast Guard vessels designed to combat surface and airborne threats.

"They are equipped with weapons and systems to perform a wide range of missions in coastal waters. Several SSO drones successfully hit the target," the SSO said on Facebook.

In the same operation, SSO drones also hit a Russian oil platform located at the Filanovsky oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea. The platform is owned by Russian oil company Lukoil and is used for oil and gas extraction.

"The platform ensures oil and gas production, the export of which fills the Russian budget and funds the war. The initial reserves of the field are estimated at approximately 129 million tons of oil and 30 billion cubic meters of gas," the SSO said.

The extent of the damage and the platform's operational status are being clarified.

Ukrainian forces have previously carried out successful strikes on Russian patrol vessels and other naval assets. In September 2025, Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said it hit and damaged a multifunctional Russian Project MPSV07 ship patrolling the Black Sea. 

On the same day the SSO announced the strike on the Hunter vessel, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) reported an hit on a Russian "shadow fleet" oil tanker in the Mediterranean sea — the first such attack of its kind. 

Ukraine has allegedly destroyed or disabled one-third of the Russian Black Sea Fleet during the full-scale war, including the Caesar Kunikov landing ship, the Sergei Kotov patrol ship, the Ivanovets missile corvette, and multiple high-speed landing crafts.

The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell and Olena Zashko report from a city living under anti-drone nets and constant surveillance, showing how everyday life, from hospitals and schools to aid deliveries and cultural events, continues under threat, and why residents refuse to leave.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry is working on establishing a mechanism for providing Ukrainian citizen living abroad the ability to vote in the country's next election, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 20.

Sea drones have become a crucial component of Ukraine's defense toolkit, and co-production with a NATO ally could enhance long-term output and deepen European defense-industrial cooperation at sea.

According. Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Russia had mobilized 18,092 foreigners from 128 countries as of October. 

The drones are operated by the SBU's Special Operations Center "A" (Alpha), according to the agency. 

The planned Miami meetings follow Witkoff and Kushner's talks in Berlin earlier this week with Ukrainian and European officials on revisions to a U.S.-backed peace plan.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia targeted Ukraine overnight with three Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from occupied Crimea and 51 attack drones. 

SSO drones also hit a Russian oil platform located at the Filanovsky oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea. The platform is owned by Russian oil company Lukoil and is used for oil and gas extraction.



"Yesterday evening, Russia carried out a missile strike on a port infrastructure facility in Odesa Oblast. Some of the victims were on a bus that was at the epicenter of the strike," the State Emergency Service reported.

"This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance," U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X.

"We agreed with our American partners on further steps and the continuation of our joint work in the near future," delegation leader Rustem Umerov said after the meeting. 

"We're not concerned about an escalation with Russia, with regards to Venezuela ... I think they have their hands full in Ukraine," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Dec. 19.

The SBU's Alpha Special Operations Center's drones hit a gas turbine unit at the Rakushechnoe deposit at the platform run by Russian oil giant Lukoil, the source said.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story.

Russia attacked the port infrastructure of Odesa Oblast in southern Ukraine the night of Dec. 19, killing at least eight people and injuring 27 others, the State Emergency Service reported.

"Yesterday evening, Russia carried out a missile strike on a port infrastructure facility in Odesa Oblast. Some of the victims were on a bus that was at the epicenter of the strike," Ukraine's State Emergency Service said in a Telegram post.

The strike also caused a fire to break out among the cargo trucks in a parking lot on-site, Odesa Oblast Governor Oleh Kiper said earlier, adding that Russian ballistic missiles "massively attacked" the port facility.

Nearby cars were also damaged in the Russian attack, and all fires have been extinguished, the State Emergency Service added.

Ukraine's Air Force warned of a Russian ballistic missile threat at 9 p.m. local time on Dec. 19. Minutes later, explosions were reported in Odesa Oblast. 

Odesa Oblast's port infrastructure is a regular target of Russian assaults. Recent strikes against the region have caused days-long blackouts and left residents without water. 

The night before the attack on the port facility, a Russian drone attack targeted transportation infrastructure in the region: a bridge on the M15 (Odesa-Reni) highway was damaged, leading neighboring Moldova to close nearby border checkpoints.

"The enemy continues to bombard our region nonstop, but we are doing everything to ensure people's safety and keep transport and logistics running," Kiper said of the bridge strike.

Another recent attack on Dec. 13 was described by Kiper as "one of the largest" overnight attacks since the start of Russia's full-scale war.

Russia has targeted civilian energy and utility systems across Ukraine as part of its broader campaign against critical infrastructure.

WASHINGTON, December 20. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump told reporters that he would visit Florida soon, making the announcement in the run-up to the next round of talks on Ukraine in Miami.

"We're going to Florida for a short while, mostly work. We have a lot of meetings scheduled," the US leader said.

"We're going to talk to the insurance companies and see if we can cut them way, way down. And if we can't, we just pay directly to the people. They buy their own health care," he added.

Earlier, Axios reported, citing a source in the US administration, that a new round of talks between the US and Ukraine could take place this weekend at the level of military and working group representatives. The portal's correspondent Barak Ravid said the national security advisers of Germany, France, and the UK will be in Miami for talks with White House Envoy Steve Witkoff and Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov. They will be joined by the Turkish foreign minister and the Qatari prime minister.

Besides, Axios reported that Trump's representatives Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are set to meet in Miami with Special representative of the Russian president for economic cooperation with foreign countries, Chief Executive Officer of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev.

Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin expects the US side to inform it about its past contacts with the EU and Ukrainian delegations.

Donald Trump fought the release of the Epstein files for as long as he could before eventually bowing to pressure from his own supporters to reveal all.

What embarrassments could he be hiding?

When the documents finally dropped on Friday evening, they included a photograph of a president in a hot tub wearing nothing but a tight pair of swimming trunks.

But it wasn't the man currently in the White House.

“Oh my!” posted Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, as she shared the photograph of Bill Clinton.

Although early analysis reveals that Mr Trump, once a close friend of the late paedophile, gets a handful of mentions in the files, it is Mr Clinton who emerges as one of Epstein's closest associates.

There he is in a swimming pool with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. There is a second woman with them, but her face is blacked out.

In other photographs, he poses in a red hoodie with a clenched fist beside another woman with her face obscured.

He visits Winston Churchill's War Rooms with Maxwell and actor Kevin Spacey.

He sits at dinner with Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stone, and poses with Epstein, both men dressed in loud silk shirts.

And there he is, one arm around Michael Jackson, the king of pop, and Diana Ross on his other side.

White House aides revived an old nickname, originally coined for Mr Clinton's polished but slippery style.

“Slick Willy!” posted Steven Cheung, director of communications, alongside the hot tub picture. “@BillClinton just chillin, without a care in the world. Little did he know…”

In contrast, Mr Trump is notable almost for his absence. He appears tangentially: a name on a giant cheque and an image of one of his books (Trump: The Art of the Comeback) on a bookshelf.

Mr Trump was once a neighbour of Epstein's in Palm Beach, and they moved in the same moneyed circles in New York before falling out 20 years ago. The president has never been accused of any wrongdoing in the cases against Epstein and maintains that he never knew about Epstein's crimes.

Yet the Epstein files and their secrets have loomed over the president all year. During the campaign he promised to release all the documents as conspiracy-minded allies claimed that they hid details of a powerful circle of abusers who had been protected by the authorities.

But once in office he tried to brush off the whole affair.

He has flashed irritation at reporters' questions about his relationship with Epstein. And on Friday, hours before publication of the files, he ended a White House event on drug prices by saying “this is such a big announcement ... I really don't want to soil it up” by taking questions, “even questions that are very fair questions that I'd love to answer”.

Mr Trump rarely misses a chance to joust with reporters, suggesting rare presidential nerves on what might come out of the files.

He need not have worried.

It was his department of justice after all that was in charge of the release, and it quickly emerged that only a fraction of the files were being published. Officials will continue to scrutinise documents in order to redact details of victims, and the releases are likely to continue for weeks more.

It means the delivery can be carefully managed.

On Friday, the strategy was clear. The White House “flooded the zone” with news.

Mr Trump announced plans to slash drug prices for the government's Medicaid programme and for cash payers.

A sign went up at the Kennedy Center, Washington's premier arts venue, renaming it The Donald J Trump and The John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, infuriating liberal opponents of the president.

And an hour-and-a-half after the Epstein dump, Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, announced strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria after three Americans were killed last week.

Meanwhile, it was Mr Clinton who appeared in all the headlines.

Even the White House chief of staff gave the game away with indiscreet comments in an interview with Vanity Fair.

Although the president has for years claimed that Mr Clinton visited Epstein's private island, Susie Wiles said “there is no evidence” of that.

Is there any incriminating evidence against Mr Clinton in the files? No.

“The president was wrong about that,” she said.

Incriminating? No.

Embarrassing? Yes.

Day 20 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar

Day 20 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar: The Cosmic Cliffs. The James Webb Space Telescope peered inside a region at the edge of a gigantic gaseous cavity within the star cluster NGC 3324. The cluster, about 9,100 light-years away, near the Carina Nebula, is believed to be fairly young, only about 12 million years old.

See the full advent calendar here, where a new image will be revealed each day until December 25.

When his chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair in an interview published this week that he had an “alcoholic's personality,” President Donald Trump didn't blink but agreed that he pushes the boundaries often.

This week proved that right. From his crude reaction to the murders of Rob Reiner and his wife, to the sensational announcement of drug price cuts, to Friday's retaliatory hit on the Islamic State, to the narcissistic renaming of the Kennedy Center, America got the full Trump.

It's what many voted for last year — and what many others warned about.

Pollster Brent Buchanan told us that Trump's no apologies style was what helped him beat former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. His ability to reach non-partisan voters who felt left behind and ignored with his “alcoholic's personality” did her in.

“Trump's victory came from his ability to connect emotionally with these low-partisan voters — speaking to their frustrations, their sense of being left behind, their distrust of institutions,” said Buchanan, the founder of Cygnal polling.

Our weekly White House Report Card graders echoed what America felt about the president's week.

Conservative analyst Jed Babbin graded the week a “B,” and concluded, “All in all, a very good week punctuated by some miserable events.” Democratic pollster John Zogby joked about being in the prone position and dished an “F,” pointing to the president's statement on Truth Social about the Reiner slaying and the new Kennedy Center name of “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”

TRUMP WARNS OF JANUARY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OVER OBAMACARE DURING NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH

Jed Babbin

Grade: B

This was a pretty wild week for President Donald Trump and his crew, with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in a revealing Vanity Fair interview, blocking oil tankers to Venezuela, raiding an Iran-bound freighter, and vague security guarantees for Ukraine. And a lot more.

Wiles should have expected a display of Trump Derangement Syndrome from VF, and that's what she got. Her quotes that Trump has an “alcoholic's personality,” Vice President JD Vance is a “conspiracy theorist,” and Elon Musk is a drug abuser were startling and newsworthy. She should never have agreed to the series of 11 interviews. It was a rookie error.

Trump's quarantine — not a blockade — of sanctioned oil tankers going to Venezuela may be a good thing. It might force out Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro eventually but so far he hasn't budged. It'll take more to get him out. Trump is thinking about an invasion, but risking U.S. lives in such a venture isn't worthwhile. It was very strange that Trump made no mention of Venezuela in his prime-time speech on Wednesday night.

Three Americans — two soldiers from the Iowa National Guard and a translator — were killed in Syria by a member of the Syrian security forces. The U.S. struck back Friday with a massive hit on the Islamic State. Why do we still have troops in Syria anyhow?

The raid on an Iran-bound ship from China (probably by Navy SEALs) seized military equipment, according to several news sources. The Iranians squawked but the Chinese didn't. It was a good op.

The U.S. guarantees of Ukrainian security are entirely vague and may not amount to much. Russian President Vladimir Putin won't buy them anyway, and peace for Ukraine seems very far off. Peace in the Gaza Strip seems equally distant, with Hamas refusing to disarm. For all of Trump's peace-making successes, these two conflicts seem beyond him. And other peace ventures seem to be very fragile.

Inflation was down to 2.7%. Unemployment was up a bit, but it wasn't significant. All in all, a very good week punctuated by some miserable events. 

TRUMP PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS: NOTABLE ACTS OF CLEMENCY IN HIS SECOND TERM

John Zogby

Grade: F

Just too much going this week, so let's start with the obvious. President Donald Trump's grade is an “F.”

We begin with his reprehensible, inhuman, narcissistic whine in his comments about the horrible tragedy that befell Rob Reiner, his wife, and his family.

Second, Trump shifted his narcissism all the way over to the other end of the spectrum by welcoming his hand-picked board at the Kennedy Center to rename it the “Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” These honors are normally bestowed after someone leaves office or passes from the scene. By allowing this to happen, it is clear that Trump is collecting his honors upfront. Maybe he doesn't think he will be in office much longer? Pure speculation on my part. It doesn't affect his grade at all.

But perhaps the strangest thing that happened this week was the Vanity Fair interview with chief of staff Susie Wiles. It is not entirely what she said — as in referring to the president's “alcoholic's personality,” the vice president as a conspiracist, and Deputy Chief Stephen Miller as a zealot — or how she said it, but why she said it. Wiles is no naive country girl easily manipulated by a reporter. Was she looking for a big book deal? Is she preparing an imminent departure for either herself or Trump? Or was she merely asserting earlier than most that his whole thing is not her fault. I am not usually prone to conspiracy theories (though at times watching this administration, I find myself in a prone position), but, wow, this is all just so weird.

Inflation is either going down or going up. The public chooses up. Unemployment is going up, although the entire process of collecting data is simply a mess.

But this week, it was all about Rob Reiner and his family and a Trump response that was just wrong.

This photo provided by Blue Origin shows Michaela Benthaus, a German engineer aiming to become the first wheelchair user in space, talking to crewmate Hans Koenigsmann, a retired SpaceX executive who helped organize and sponsor her flight, on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025, at Blue Origin's rocket launch site in Van Horn, Texas.

A paraplegic engineer from Germany blasted off on a dream-come-true rocket ride with five other passengers Saturday, leaving her wheelchair behind to float in space while beholding Earth from on high.

Severely injured in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, Michaela Benthaus became the first wheelchair user in space, launching from West Texas with Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin. She was accompanied by a retired SpaceX executive also born in Germany, Hans Koenigsmann, who helped organize and, along with Blue Origin, sponsored her trip. Their ticket prices were not divulged.

An ecstatic Benthaus said she laughed all the way up — the capsule soared more than 65 miles (105 kilometers) — and tried to turn upside down once in space.

“It was the coolest experience,” she said shortly after landing.

The 10-minute space-skimming flight required only minor adjustments to accommodate Benthaus, according to the company. That's because the autonomous New Shepard capsule was designed with accessibility in mind, “making it more accessible to a wider range of people than traditional spaceflight,” said Blue Origin's Jake Mills, an engineer who trained the crew and assisted them on launch day. 

Among Blue Origin's previous space tourists: those with limited mobility and impaired sight or hearing, and a pair of 90-year-olds.

For Benthaus, Blue Origin added a patient transfer board so she could scoot between the capsule's hatch and her seat. The recovery team also unrolled a carpet on the desert floor following touchdown, providing immediate access to her wheelchair, which she left behind at liftoff. She practiced in advance, with Koenigsmann taking part with the design and testing. An elevator was already in place at the launch pad to ascend the seven stories to the capsule perched atop the rocket.




Benthaus, 33, part of the European Space Agency's graduate trainee program in the Netherlands, experienced snippets of weightlessness during a parabolic airplane flight out of Houston in 2022. Less than two years later, she took part in a two-week simulated space mission in Poland.

“I never really thought that going on a spaceflight would be a real option for me because even as like a super healthy person, it's like so competitive, right?” she told The Associated Press ahead of the flight. 

Her accident dashed whatever hope she had. “There is like no history of people with disabilities flying to space,” she said.

When Koenigsmann approached her last year about the possibility of flying on Blue Origin and experiencing more than three minutes of weightlessness on a space hop, Benthaus thought there might be a misunderstanding. But there wasn't, and she immediately signed on.

It's a private mission for Benthaus with no involvement by ESA, which this year cleared reserve astronaut John McFall, an amputee, for a future flight to the International Space Station. The former British Paralympian lost his right leg in a motorcycle accident when he was a teenager.

An injured spinal cord means Benthaus can't walk at all, unlike McFall who uses a prosthetic leg and could evacuate a space capsule in an emergency at touchdown by himself. Koenigsmann was designated before flight as her emergency helper; he and Mills lifted her out of the capsule and down the short flight of steps at flight's end.

“You should never give up on your dreams, right?” Benthaus urged following touchdown.

Benthaus was adamant about doing as much as she could by herself. Her goal is to make not only space accessible to the disabled, but to improve accessibility on Earth too. 

While getting lots of positive feedback within “my space bubble,” she said outsiders aren't always as inclusive. 

“I really hope it's opening up for people like me, like I hope I'm only the start,” she said. 

Besides Koenigsmann, Benthaus shared the ride with business executives and investors, and a computer scientist. They raised Blue Origin's list of space travelers to 86.

Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, created Blue Origin in 2000 and launched on its first passenger spaceflight in 2021. The company has since delivered spacecraft to orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida, using the bigger and more powerful New Glenn rocket, and is working to send landers to the moon.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'Fox News Sunday' to promote his new book 'The Miracles Among Us,' which details real-life medical miracles and discusses how faith can play a role in healing.

One of the main premises of my new book, "The Miracles Among Us," is that we all experience miracles — we just have to look hard enough to find them, and that they come to us in many different forms, from direct divine intervention to great doctoring to advanced  technology wrapped in a compilation of coincidences. 

Sadly, despite praying directly to a personal God, there are countless tragedies in which not amount of prayer appears to impact the outcome. As New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan told me, God brings us the miracles He wants us to have, not necessarily the ones we ask for.

My book has resonated with people who have experienced some kind of miracle and want to talk about it. This past week I was standing outside Fox News headquarters in a cold wind with a sign that said, "Bring me your miracle." Many people stopped to share their stories, including Kathleen, an elderly woman from Long Island.         

DR MARC SIEGEL: WE ALL NEED THE LIGHT AND MIRACLE OF HANUKKAH RIGHT NOW

"I had a problem with my sinuses," she told me. "I saw two top sinus specialists, both of whom looked at my CT scans and said I needed surgery. The night before the procedure, I went to the healing center I go to and prayed with my priest for a successful healthy outcome. But as I was praying, a voice came to me and said, ‘Go see Scully. Go see Scully.' I looked, but there was no one there." 

"Scully?  

"He is my general doctor and he works in an urgent care center. I hadn't gone to him in the first place because I thought this kind of problem needed a specialist to solve. But when I heard the voice, I knew God was telling me to see Dr. Scully, so I went to the urgent care center the next day. He talked with me, tapped my sinuses with his fingers -- which the sinus specialists hadn't done -- and told me I just needed a Benadryl at night and nothing else. So, I cancelled the surgery, and I have been feeling completely fine ever since."      

 "Allergic sinusitis. Sounds like you avoided an unnecessary surgery. And the voice?"     

"An angel from God, of course."

Indeed, not all miracles are strictly medical. Some are based on intuition, on a moment of faith, or on a doctor working with their patient and refusing to give up. Some are due to direct divine intervention and others are based on a combined mixture of belief and science.

We continue to pray for National Guard Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, who, more than three weeks after being shot in the head, is now breathing on his own and can even stand with assistance, according to Medstar Washington Hospital Center where he is being treated. He faces a long road of rehabilitation, but his progress so far is already a medical miracle.

This week we also continue to pray for the victims of the shooting at my alma mater, Brown University — a true ivory tower where centuries of dedicated peaceful study and discourse was suddenly shattered by a gunman, leaving profound fear, anxiety and two tragic student deaths. 

According to Dr. Craig Spencer, a renowned emergency room physician who was working at Rhode Island Hospital — the Level 1 trauma center where the victims were taken — the initial efforts at triage and stabilization last Saturday were successful. This means the medical team was able to stop the bleeding and stabilize their vital signs right away. Successful surgeries followed. 

We hope and pray that God will bring a full recovery to these victims and restore peace and tranquility to the university shaken to its core.

Brown University President Christina Paxson reported to the campus community on Friday that "the condition of the other shooting victims continues to improve. As of late last night, six were in stable condition, and three had been discharged from the hospital."  

Brown badly needs this miracle of recovery – and soon, as Christmas approaches.

Some questions will never be answered. But there's one that DOJ officials really can clear up — if they want to.

The Trump administration was legally required to release all documents related to federal investigations of Jeffrey Epstein by Friday, with only limited grounds for withholding documents and full explanations required for any redactions.

It did not do this. Or anything close to it.

The Justice Department released several thousand documents Friday, but top officials acknowledged that they had hundreds of thousands more that weren't released yet, purportedly because they weren't reviewed or ready. Most of the documents they did release were photos — either photos the FBI took of Epstein's properties, or photos Epstein himself possessed. Of the investigative documents released, many were entirely redacted, covered in black boxes.

Some of the leading Republicans who'd pushed the administration for disclosure expressed disappointment in their compliance, with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) saying the release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.”

Unsurprisingly, these limited releases do nothing to clear up the swirling questions people had about the Epstein scandal.

And while some of those swirling questions amount to conspiracy theories that will never be definitively cleared up by any document release, there is one big question that could be answered to some extent by documents in the government's possession.

Namely, did investigators believe there were other men involved in Epstein's sex crimes, and if so, why didn't they charge any of them?

Officials at the Justice Department have been very clear that they believe Epstein sexually abused at least hundreds of women or underage girls in the 1990s and 2000s.

But officials have been much less clear on a related question: whether Epstein trafficked certain of these women or girls to any of his prominent and influential friends.

Certain Epstein accusers — most notably, the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre — claimed that this is indeed what happened to them. Giuffre said publicly that Epstein groomed her to have sex with him and his influential friends in exchange for money, which she did for a few years. And Giuffre specifically named some of the men who she said participated, including the UK's now-former Prince Andrew.

The FBI has been aware of Giuffre's allegations since 2011. One of the documents in the new release describes some of officials' conversations with Giuffre that year, in which she “indicated Epstein had instructed her to have sex with numerous associates in both the United States and overseas.”

It is primarily Giuffre's claims that convinced many people that Epstein was not only abusing victims himself, but that he was also providing young women and underage girls to other men.

Yet no other men were ever charged with Epstein-related crimes. And the big question is: why not?

There are many possible explanations, ranging from the prosaic (evidentiary problems, statutes of limitation) to the nefarious (cover-up) to somewhere in between (questions about witness credibility). But surely, at some point, someone involved in the investigation wrote something down about this, assessing whether Giuffre's claims appeared credible, whether other women made similar claims, and whether such claims merited further investigation — or not.

More broadly, investigators had to at some point grapple with whether they themselves thought the evidence suggested Epstein was supplying girls or young women to his friends.

Typically, such internal assessments would never see the light of day if they didn't result in charges. But they should be somewhere in the Justice Department's Epstein files. So will we ever see them, or not?

Urban Meyer joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the final CFP bracket, Indiana wining its first Big Ten title since 1967 and whether they're the best team in College Football, and Notre Dame rejecting Bowl eligibility after not making the CFP.

Despite dropping their regular-season finale to in-state rival Texas, the Texas A&M Aggies qualified for the College Football Playoff and earned the right to host a first-round game at Kyle Field.

Nick Saban, who won seven national championships during his storied coaching career, experienced his fair share of hostile environments on road trips. 

But the former Alabama coach and current ESPN college football analyst floated a surprising theory about how Texas A&M turns up the volume to try to keep opposing teams off balance.

While Saban did describe Kyle Field as one of the sport's "noisiest" atmospheres, he also claimed the stadium's operators have leaned on artificial crowd noise to pump up the volume during games.

CFP INTRIGUE RANKINGS: WHICH FIRST-ROUND GAMES HAVE THE BEST STORYLINES?

"I did more complaining to the SEC office—it was more than complaining that I don't really want to say on this show—about this is the noisiest place. Plus, they pipe in noise… You can't hear yourself think when you're playing out there," he told Pat McAfee on Thursday afternoon.

Adding crowd noise during games does not explicitly violate NCAA rules. However, the policy does mandate a certain level of consistency.

According to the governing body's rulebook: "Artificial crowd noise, by conference policy or mutual consent of the institutions, is allowed. The noise level must be consistent throughout the game for both teams. However, all current rules remain in effect dealing with bands, music and other sounds. When the snap is imminent, the band/music must stop playing. As with all administrative rules, the referee may stop the game and direct game management to adjust."

Regardless of the possible presence of artificial noise, the Miami Hurricanes will likely face a raucous crowd when Saturday's first-round CFP game kicks off at 12 p.m. ET.

Empathy is under attack lately. 

The all-important ability to see the world through another person's eyes is now being recast as something corrosive.  

The argument goes like this: if you're empathetic, you're being manipulated into accepting all manner of ideas, behaviors or policies that you would otherwise reject. Empathy, in this view, is a Trojan horse for weakness. 

But that's a dangerous distortion. 

WWII VET BECOMES PUBLISHED SONGWRITER AT 101 WITH 'IF FREEDOM WAS FREE'

True empathy is not agreement. And it's definitely not surrender.  

It's the refusal to reduce another person to a caricature. It recognizes that the people we disagree with have reasons for their choices. And people are intrinsically valuable, even if we're on opposite sides.  

Far from weakening conviction, empathy actually strengthens it by grounding our beliefs in humanity, not hatred. 

A story from World War II illustrates this. It reminds us that even in our darkest moments, empathy must triumph. 

On Dec. 20, 1943, in the frenzied skies above war-torn Europe, two bitter enemies met in what remains one of World War II's most remarkable encounters. 

An American B-17 bomber, piloted by 21-year-old West Virginian Charles Brown, was shredded by enemy fire. Bullets had torn through the fuselage. Several crew members were bleeding out. The plane was barely holding together, yet still in the air.  

Flying nearby was the enemy: Franz Stigler, 28, a veteran German fighter ace. His job was simple: blow the Americans out of the sky.  

Stigler had every incentive to pull the trigger.

In the kill-or-be-killed quest to reach air superiority, the odds against the German's survival were much worse than the Americans'. Of the 40,000 German fighter pilots in WWII, only 2,000 lived to see the war's end.  

For Stigler, every kill mattered.  

But when Stigler flew up alongside Brown's limping bomber, something extraordinary happened, according to historian Adam Makos, who chronicled the incredible encounter in his book "A Higher Call."

Stigler didn't turn his machine guns on the Americans.

Instead, Stigler risked his own reputation, career and even life, to fly for miles in close proximity to the bomber's wingtip, providing a shield for the damaged enemy plane from other fighters.  

Instead of killing his enemy, the German fighter pilot escorted the sputtering American bomber to safety. 

Even more remarkable, Stigler was one bomber kill away from the Knight's Cross, Germany's highest award for valor. He gave that up by sparing Brown. 

For decades, the American 8th Air Force classified the incident as top secret. The German military sealed the record as well. Stigler was ordered never to speak of the act again, at risk of facing a firing squad.

Some explain the incident as chivalry, a relic of an older code of honor. Others dismiss it as an anomaly, a glitch in the machinery of war.  

But to me, it was something deeper.  

True empathy.  

Stigler remembered his humanity. He chose to see his enemies not as targets, but as people.  

And that choice reverberates today. 

We live in a culture that rewards outrage. We're told that empathy is naïve and that to understand another person's pain is to surrender our convictions.  

But Stigler's decision shows otherwise. Empathy is the courage to rise above a tribal reflex and act by a higher call.

Empathy is strength.  

Stigler risked his own reputation, career and even life, to fly for miles in close proximity to the bomber's wingtip, providing a shield for the damaged enemy plane from other fighters.  

When we're in the presence of people we dislike or disagree with, even those we consider enemies, we face the same choice Stigler faced.

            Police lights flashed for hours as law enforcement officers surrounded a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, Thursday night, finally closing in on a suspect who unleashed deadly attacks on two communities and had managed to evade them for six days.
    


            Outside was an abandoned car linked to both the Brown University mass shooting on Saturday and the killing of an MIT professor at his home on Monday.
    


            Inside a rented storage unit, the 48-year-old suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, was dead, leaving behind a satchel, two 9 mm firearms and high-capacity magazines matching ballistics at both crime scenes, along with even more questions about a motive as investigators begin peeling back the layers of his life to fill the gaps in his known past.
    


            Here are the major questions remaining about the cases:
    


            Authorities have said the suspect's intent was to cause harm in targeting the Ivy League university and esteemed MIT professor Nuno Loureiro.
    


            It became clear because his actions showed signs of premeditation, for example, obtaining access to firearms and a bulletproof vest, said CNN law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow.
    


            He also took strategic steps to avoid detection like swapping the license plates on a rental car linked to both shootings, concealing his identity and avoiding Brown University's expansive network of 1,200 security cameras by opening fire in a building equipped with only two exterior cameras, and with multiple exits and entrances.
    


            Without the ability to interview or prosecute the suspect, the motive remains the hardest question, Wackrow said, and there's a chance investigators will not find the answers even after doing exhaustive searches of digital history and physical evidence.
    


            Investigators have mapped some of the suspect's movements in the years before his attacks, but much of his past remains a mystery.
    


            The Portuguese national attended the same academic program as Loureiro in Portugal from 1995 to 2000, after which he studied at Brown University on an F1 visa, a nonimmigrant visa for international students to study full-time.
    


            He then took a leave of absence and formally withdrew from the university effective July 31, 2003. There has been no formal explanation from the university on the basis for the leave, but according to CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, it could also point to a potential motive.
    


            Miller says investigators will likely ask questions like: Did he blame a life event for derailing his success as a former student who was described by his then-classmates as “brilliant” but also exceptionally difficult? What issue caused him not to return?
    


            Details on the suspect's whereabouts between 2001 and 2017, however, have proved elusive at this stage.
    


            But the suspect's strategies do suggest he may have been planning for an encounter with police or an escape, Wackrow said.
    


            And it begs the question, according to Miller: What happened to make the suspect change course and decide to take his own life? One scenario, he says, could be the suspect was alerted authorities were on his trail.
    


            The suspect's last known address was in Miami this year, and he rented a storage unit in Salem starting from an unspecified date in November.
    


            He rented a hotel room in Boston from November 26 to 30 before renting a gray Nissan Sentra with Florida plates in the same city and then driving in the car to Brown University on December 1.
    


            The car was seen several times by witnesses in the area of the school over the course of the next 12 days.
    


            On December 13, the suspect opened fire at students in the on-campus auditorium of the Barus and Holley building, killing Ella Cook and MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, and injuring nine others.
    


            Over the next day, the suspect returned to Massachusetts and switched the license plates of the rental car during his time there to an unregistered plate from Maine.
    


            On December 15, the suspect fatally shot Loureiro at the professor's home in Brookline before immediately driving back to a storage facility in Salem where he had rented a unit.
    


            It appears the suspect then swiped into his storage unit in Salem the same day and did not swipe out, Neronha told CNN on Friday.
    


            When details of an autopsy were released Friday, it estimated the suspect died December 16, the development called into question a line in the affidavit filed by prosecutors which said Neves Valente called the car rental agency at the airport in Hartford, Connecticut, Thursday.
    


            A federal agent testified a man identifying himself by the name of the suspect called into the branch and asked to return the rented Nissan Sentra there.
    


            Some leads developed in the investigation turned out not to be valid, according to Neronha, which he said is not unusual. When asked by CNN's Erin Burnett whether the Thursday call wasn't actually from the suspect, Neronha said, “That's correct.”
    


            Beyond the discrepancy, authorities on Thursday spent frantic hours on Thursday trying to track the suspect and the car they believed he was driving, and had information he would be returning his rented car in Boston boarding a flight out of Logan International Airport, according to a law enforcement official.
    


            His storage unit served as a “logical base of operations,” said Miller, and his arrival in the Brown University area nearly two weeks before the shooting indicates he had been planning for the attack.



            Investigators were only able to identify a potential link between the Brown University shooting and the MIT professor killing in the past two days after officials initially said there was no connection between the crimes.
    


            After authorities confirmed the suspect and Loureiro were students at the same university in Portugal between 1995 and 2000, it left more uncertainty as there's no information the two had any relationship beyond briefly overlapping as physics students and a shared time on campus.
    


            Still, authorities say he targeted the professor.
    


            Nuno Morais, one of his former classmates, told the Portuguese website Público the suspect and Loureiro were among the top students at the school, but their personalities were starkly different.
    


            Some of the questions investigators will be asking, according to Miller, are: Did Loureiro and the suspect know each other?  Were they competitors or rivals? Did the suspect see Loureiro as an enemy he felt he needed to kill or someone he blamed for any failures?
    


            The suspect had to research the home address of Loureiro, and it was a highly targeted killing, which points to premeditation, said Miller.
    


            A former classmate of the suspect told CNN's Burnett he recognized Loureiro when the news of his death came out. Scott Watson, a professor at Syracuse University, said the MIT professor would sometimes come to Brown, but added he was unsure if Loureiro and the suspect were friends.
    


            At Thursday's news conference when officials announced the suspect was found dead, they repeatedly praised an unidentified tipster and graduate of Brown University who broke the case open, saying “everybody in Providence owes this individual a debt of gratitude.”
    


            Investigators in their affidavit specifically pointed to a post on Reddit, in which a user described seeing a “grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental” near the shooting scene.
    


            The author of the post is the same individual seen in the photo released by Providence Police as they sought to talk to the man they believed to have been “in proximity” to the suspect, according to Providence Mayor Brett Smiley.
    


            Police later interviewed him, and he told them he recognized the person seen in surveillance images released by police as the man he saw near the car shortly before the shooting.
    


            The Reddit poster, identified in the affidavit only as John, said he first encountered the man inside a bathroom in the Barus and Holley building and noticed his clothing seemed inadequate for the cold weather.
    


            Once the man left the building, John saw him approach the Nissan and appear to unlock it with a key fob before suddenly turning from the vehicle and walking in a different direction, the affidavit said. John said he remained outside as the man kept circling back to the area before quickly changing directions every time he saw John, the document said.
    


            At one point, John confronted the man, asking him why he kept circling the block, he told investigators, according to the affidavit, to which the suspect responded: “Why are you harassing me.” John then kept walking down the street as the man walked toward the car and the two didn't have any further encounters, the affidavit said.
    


            The rental car was just one piece of data investigators used to link the Brown shooting suspect to the fatal shooting of the MIT professor, along with a financial probe, the storage unit and extensive security footage.

At his year-end press conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke about the threats that transnational terrorist criminal groups pose to the U.S.

FIRST ON FOX: From a distance, Margarita Island looks like a Caribbean escape. Palm-lined beaches, duty-free shops, and resort towns sell the image of a tropical playground just off Venezuela's northeastern coast. But U.S. officials say the Venezuelan outpost has become something else entirely: Hezbollah's most important base of operations in the Western Hemisphere, strengthened by Iran's growing footprint and the Maduro regime's protection.

That threat, U.S. officials warn, reflects a broader security challenge emerging from the region. "The single most serious threat to the United States from the Western Hemisphere is from transnational terrorist criminal groups primarily focused on narcotrafficking," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at an end-of-year press conference at the State Department on Friday.

"Margarita Island might be of significance to the U.S. because of its location and the security dynamics around it," Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital. "It is close to Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada, in an oil-rich part of the Caribbean along key maritime routes, and it has long had a reputation for being a major drug-trafficking hub, possibly because it's off the mainland, and there's not a lot of law enforcement there."

The island's isolation, she said, has made it attractive to "irregular armed groups, foreign intelligence actors and criminal networks that use it as a departure point for boats carrying illicit shipments out of Venezuela."

CARTEL CONNECTION: HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN EXPLOIT MADURO'S VENEZUELA FOR COCAINE CASH

Marshall Billingslea, the former assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes in the U.S. Treasury Department, said Margarita Island now serves as Hezbollah's key foothold in the Western Hemisphere.

"From what I have seen and what I have been told, there is a wide range of activities that Hezbollah and to some extent Hamas are engaged in," Billingslea told Fox News Digital. "Margarita Island is really the center of gravity for their activities."

In written testimony submitted to the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control for an Oct. 21 hearing, Billingslea traced the island's transformation back more than two decades. Under Hugo Chávez, he wrote, Venezuela "opened its doors to Hezbollah, allowing the group to establish a major footprint, including a paramilitary training site, on Margarita Island."

"When Nicolás Maduro seized power," Billingslea added, "the breadth and depth of Hezbollah's presence in Venezuela dramatically expanded, as did their ties to the narco-terrorist regime and the Cartel de los Soles."

"The relationship is very close with the Cartel de los Soles, and it has been so for many, many years," Billingslea said, referring to the network of senior Venezuelan officials accused by the United States of drug trafficking.

Billingslea said Hezbollah has embedded itself into Margarita Island's economy, exploiting the island's duty-free status and cross-border access to Colombia to generate revenue through smuggling and drug importation. He said the group operates a wide range of companies on the island and also maintains several training camps there.

His testimony also detailed how Venezuela's state apparatus helped embed Hezbollah inside the country. He wrote that former senior official Tareck El Aissami, while overseeing Venezuela's passport and naturalization agency, "was instrumental in furnishing passports and citizenship documents to Hezbollah operatives as well as a large number of people from Lebanon, Syria, and Iran." Between 2010 and 2019, Venezuelan authorities issued more than 10,400 passports to individuals from those countries, according to the testimony.

A May 27, 2020, Justice Department announcement alleged that Diosdado Cabello directed Venezuelan lawmaker Adel El Zabayar to travel to the Middle East to obtain weapons and recruit members of Hezbollah and Hamas for training at clandestine camps inside Venezuela. The filing also describes a subsequent weapons delivery at a hangar controlled by Maduro at the country's main international airport.

Recent developments in the Middle East have only increased Margarita Island's importance, Billingslea said. Israel's campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon has damaged the group's military leadership and financial infrastructure, forcing it to rely more heavily on overseas networks.

"Israeli successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon in particular, including their strikes on the financial infrastructure Al-Qard al-Hassan that operates in Lebanon, are going to have two effects," he said. "The first is that it is making the fundraising and the revenue generation that comes out of Latin America even more important to the terrorist group. Secondly, we have seen indications that Hezbollah actually has been relocating fighters from Lebanon, several hundred from Lebanon to Venezuela in particular."

Asked whether that shift moves the threat closer to the United States, Billingslea said Hezbollah is now operating "close to the U.S. and further away from the Israelis."

He said Iran's role in Venezuela has deepened alongside Hezbollah's. "There is a substantial Iranian footprint in Venezuela related to the trade of weapons and drones, in particular, for gold," he said. After suffering losses in the Middle East, he added, "the Iranians find themselves even more dependent on that supply of gold in exchange for drones and weapons."

He said Washington faces a strategic choice. "I think the United States has positioned sufficient forces in the Caribbean at this time to take care of the Hezbollah threat," he said. "But obviously, when you have a terrorist group that has merged into the local population, highly precise intelligence is needed. I believe the Venezuelan opposition possesses a great deal of that intelligence, though it is not clear to me that the United States government is making the best use of that access."

For Billingslea, the conclusion is cleaner — eliminating Venezuela's narco-terrorist regime would significantly strengthen U.S. national security.

            In travel news this week: a behind-the-scenes look at a “White Lotus” resort, the best places to retire in 2026, plus tips on avoiding vacation stress.
    


            Greece was recently named the world's best place to retire for 2026, according to an annual index by International Living. Panama and Costa Rica ranked second and third on the list and are particularly popular with North Americans.
    


            However, the grass isn't necessarily greener abroad. Navigating foreign tax systems and bank accounts can be particularly confusing. CNN spoke to a few experts who have done it and learned a few hard lessons along the way. Watch their tips in the video above.
    


            Finally, here are a couple of real-life stories of people who made the leap, one to Europe and one to Asia.
    


            New Jersey native Barbara Olpinski moved from Chicago to Poland in 2020, but struggled to adapt to her husband's home country. “I cried copious tears,” she tells CNN, and she was worried she'd never fit in. However, she took up a new hobby which helped with the transition.
    


            Victoria Kjos, in her 70s, moved to Bali in 2022 after becoming disillusioned with her life in the US. She tells CNN that she immediately felt “very comfortable” there and loved the province's “calm energy.” However, she says she made a lot of “missteps” when it came to finding somewhere to live: Here's what she learned.
    


            If you're seeking a less permanent life change, perhaps a brief trip into the giddy heights of luxury might tempt you.
    


            Season three of HBO's “The White Lotus” was filmed at several hotels in Thailand, including the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket. CNN Travel's Karla Cripps visited earlier this year and took us on a quick tour.
    


            Magnificently grand yachts are the latest big thing in the luxury hotel space, with the  Ritz-Carlton, the Four Seasons, Orient Express and Aman all competing with launches on the high seas.
    


            “We are introducing people to cruising that would never have considered it,” Tina Edmundson, president of luxury for Marriott International, tells CNN of the boutique-style offerings that are at the other end of the scale from the boom in super-sized cruise ships.
    


            In 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed at Washington National Airport, exposing the dangers of ice accumulation when flying in winter. It was a tragic event that changed how US airlines deal with freezing conditions.
    


            CNN's Alexandra Skores went behind the scenes and under the planes at Chicago O'Hare to see how specialized deicer crews keep passengers safe.
    


            Dulles International, outside Washington DC, was supposed to be the airport of the future when it opened in the 1960s. It was the first US airport to be built for the jet age and its iconic mobile lounges, or people-movers, are what has made Dulles unique. After 60 years of operation, however, Dulles International regularly makes it onto “worst airport” lists, with President Trump recently describing it as “terrible.” Here's the story of how the innovation that made it so original would also make it so unpopular.
    


            Running through a packed travel itinerary only increases stress and leaves you exhausted, says travel expert Jake Haupert. Instead, he suggests embracing “slow travel,” a practice that can deepen your connection to your destination. Watch the above video to learn how it works.
    


            The “Unlocking the World” newsletter is taking a break next week on December 27, so we'll see you on January 3, 2026, with more travel news.

            Ty Simpson passed for 232 yards and two touchdowns, and No. 9 seed Alabama rallied from a 17-point deficit to beat No. 8 Oklahoma 34-24 on Friday night in the first round of the College Football Playoff.
    


            Alabama freshman Lotzeir Brooks, who did not score a touchdown in the regular season, scored two and had season highs of five catches and 79 yards.
    


            It was the third meeting between the schools in 13 months. Oklahoma defeated Alabama 24-3 last November at home, then beat the Crimson Tide 23-21 last month on the road.
    


            It was the first playoff for the Crimson Tide since coach Kalen DeBoer arrived from Washington two years ago. Alabama (11-3) advanced to play No. 1 seed Indiana and Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza in a quarterfinal game at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1.
    


            Oklahoma's John Mateer passed for 307 yards and two touchdowns, but he threw a costly interception that Alabama's Zabien Brown returned 50 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter. Deion Burks had seven catches for 107 yards and a score for the Sooners (10-3).
    


            Oklahoma's Tate Sandell, the Lou Groza Award winner for the nation's best kicker, tied an FBS single-season record for most made field goals of 50 or more yards. He drilled a 51-yarder into a stiff wind to give the Sooners a 10-0 lead late in the first quarter, his 24th consecutive made field goal. The Sooners outgained the Crimson Tide 118 yards to 12 in the opening period.
    


            Mateer's 6-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Sategna early in the second quarter pushed Oklahoma's lead to 17-0.
    


            Alabama, which went three-and-out on its first three possessions, finally got its offense going midway through the second quarter when Simpson hit Brooks for a 10-yard score to trim Oklahoma's lead to 17-7. Later in the quarter, Brown's interception return tied the score at 17.
    


            Brooks caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Simpson early in the third quarter to give Alabama its first lead. The Crimson Tide took a 27-17 advantage on a 40-yard field goal by Conor Talty.
    


            Burks caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from Mateer two plays into the fourth quarter to cut Alabama's lead to 27-24. Oklahoma had chances to stay in the game, but Sandell missed from 36 yards with just under three minutes remaining to end his streak. He missed again from 51 yards out with 1:18 to play.
    


Alabama: The Crimson Tide played mistake-free ball and stayed focused after struggling early. They scored the next 27 points after falling behind 17-0.
    


Oklahoma: Mateer has been mistake prone this season. He played a relatively clean game, but the second-quarter interception was a backbreaker and turned the momentum.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of files released Friday by the Justice Department stemming from its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as the White House seized the chance to shift the focus of the highly anticipated documents from President Donald Trump.

There were several photos of Clinton among the thousands of documents made public. Some showed him on a private plane, including one with a woman, whose face is redacted, seated alongside him with her arm around him. Another photo shows him in a pool with Epstein's longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted.

Another photo shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face was redacted. The files do not say when or where the photos were taken and there was little context surrounding them.

The 79-year-old Clinton's political career has been marred by personal scandals in the past and his impeachment in 1998. His association with Epstein and Maxwell in the late 1990s and early 2000s is well documented and the images released Friday are just a slice of the “several hundred thousand” documents Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has said are tied to the investigation.

But the photos depict a web of unsavory relationships and associations that complicate both Democratic efforts to keep the focus on Trump and the incumbent president's desire to move on from the issue entirely.




After the photos were released, several White House officials, including press secretary Karoline Leavitt and top aide Steven Cheung, made social media posts highlighting them. Trump didn't talk about the issue as he left the White House late Friday on his way to deliver a speech in North Carolina.

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone's name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise. In a statement, Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said the White House was “shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever.”

“They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton,” Ureña said. “Never has been, never will be.” 

Long before Friday's photos, Republicans had zeroed in on the former president and his association with Epstein.

Republicans on the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed both Bill and Hillary Clinton for depositions earlier this year, but received a response that the Clintons wanted to provide a written statement of what “little information” they had on Epstein.

The Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer, has demanded they appear for in-person testimonies and threatened to initiate contempt of Congress proceedings if they don't.

Multiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before Congress, but none has been compelled to do so. 

When Clinton was president, Epstein visited the White House multiple times, visitor logs show. After he left office, Epstein assisted with some of the former president's philanthropy. Clinton flew multiple times on Epstein's private jet, including on a humanitarian trip to Africa with actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker in 2002.

Clinton first ran for president in 1992 as a new type of Democrat, hailing from the South with an appeal that united his party's base along with moderate voters. He became the first Democrat in 16 years to win the White House and remains one of his party's most prominent figures. He had a prime-time speaking slot during last summer's Democratic National Convention in which he made a forceful case for Kamala Harris' candidacy. 

But Clinton's ties to the Epstein case are a reminder of how his political promise has always been tempered by personal indiscretions.

His 1992 campaign was dogged by rumors of an affair with Gennifer Flowers, which he denied at the time. His presidency was rocked when he was impeached in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice when he denied engaging in a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He ultimately acknowledged a relationship with Lewinsky that was “not appropriate” while insisting that “even presidents have private lives.”

Trump, whose 2016 campaign was nearly derailed when a tape emerged of him bragging about grabbing women by the genitals, has often deflected allegations of sexual misconduct by pointing to Clinton's behavior. But even Trump's top allies have questioned those claims. In an interview published by Vanity Fair this week, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said Trump “was wrong” in frequently suggesting the Epstein files included incriminating information about Clinton.

Anderson Silva showed off his swift hands Friday night as he delivered an uppercut and a few right hooks to knock out Tyron Woodley in the second round.

Woodley fell down face first as the referee counted to eight. The former UFC fighter was able to get back to his corner, and as he touched gloves with Silva to get back into the fight, the referee called for the bell.

Silva was credited with the technical knockout for the fourth boxing win of his career. The UFC legend is 4-2 in his boxing career with losses coming to Jake Paul and Osmar Luiz Teixeira.

Woodley is now 0-3 in professional boxing. He lost to Paul twice in his career.

It's unclear what's next for the two fighters. Silva is 50 years old, and Woodley is 43. Silva called out Chris Weidman after his win.

This fight between Silva and Woodley took place on Paul's card against Anthony Joshua at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida. The YouTuber-turned-boxer put together one of the biggest tests of his career in taking on the former two-time heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist.

The Justice Department has started releasing its files on Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender known for his connections to powerful figures, including Donald Trump

Members of Congress are responding to the Justice Department's releasing of some of its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The Justice Department acknowledged that its documents disclosure Friday about the wealthy financier was incomplete.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department released thousands of files Friday about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the incomplete document dump did not break significant ground about the long-running criminal investigations of the financier or his ties to wealthy and powerful individuals.

The files included photographs of famous people who spent time with Epstein in the years before he came under suspicion, including some candid snapshots of Bill Clinton, who flew on Epstein's jet and invited him to the White House in the years before the financier was accused of wrongdoing. But there was almost no material related to another old Epstein friend, President Donald Trump, aside from a few well-known images, sparing the White House from having to confront fresh questions about a relationship the administration has tried in vain to minimize.

The records, consisting largely of pictures but also including call logs, grand jury testimony, interview transcripts and other documents, arrived amid extraordinary anticipation that they might offer the most detailed look yet at nearly two decades worth of government scrutiny of Epstein's sexual abuse of young women and underage girls. Yet the release, replete with redactions, seemed unlikely to satisfy the clamor for information given how many records had yet to be released and because some of the materials had already been made public.

Democrats and some Republicans seized on the limited release to accuse the Justice Department of failing to meet a congressionally set deadline to produce the files, while White House officials on social media gleefully promoted a photo of Clinton in a hot tub with a woman with a blacked-out face. The Trump administration touted the release as proof of its commitment to transparency, ignoring that the Justice Department just months ago said no more files would be released. Congress then passed a law mandating it.




In a letter to Congress, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote that the Justice Department was continuing to review files in its possession, was withholding some documents under exemptions meant to protect victims and expected additional disclosures by the end of the year. 

Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed.

But bowing to political pressure from fellow Republicans, Trump last month signed a bill giving the Justice Department 30 days to release most of its files and communications related to Epstein, including information about the investigation into his death in a federal jail. The law set a deadline for Friday.

Compiling accurate and thorough information takes time. A team of AP reporters is working to confirm information released by the Justice Department regarding Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump is hardly glimpsed in the files, with the small number of photos of him appearing to have been in the public domain for decades. Those include two in which Trump and Epstein are posing with now-first lady Melania Trump in February 2000 at an event at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

Trump's connection to Epstein is well-documented, but he has sought to distance himself from his former friend. He has said he cut off ties with Epstein after the financier hired young female employees from Mar-a-Lago and has repeatedly denied knowledge of his crimes.

The FBI and Justice Department abruptly announced in July that they would not be releasing any additional records, a decision that was supported by Trump. But the president reversed course once it became clear that congressional action was inevitable. He insisted the Epstein matter had become a distraction to the Republican agenda and releasing the records was the best way to move on. 

The White House, meanwhile, has moved to shift focus away from Trump's ties to Epstein, with Attorney General Pam Bondi last month saying that she had ordered a federal prosecutor to investigate Epstein's connections to Trump's political foes, including Clinton. 

Neither Trump nor Clinton has ever been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone's name in the files from the investigation does not imply otherwise. 

Among other prominent Epstein contacts is the former Prince Andrew, who appears in a photograph released Friday wearing a tuxedo and lying on the laps of what appear to be several women who are seated, dressed in formalwear. Pop star Michael Jackson also appears in multiple photos, including one showing him standing next to a smiling Epstein. 

Unlike Trump, Clinton is featured prominently in the files, though the records included no explanation of how the photographs of the former president related to any investigation or the context surrounding them.

Some photos showed him on a private plane, including one with a woman, whose face is redacted, seated alongside him with her arm around him. Another shows him in a pool with Epstein's longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted. He is also seen in a hot tub with a woman whose face was redacted.

Senior Trump White House aides took to X to promote the Clinton photos.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote “Oh my!” and added a shocked face emoji in response to a photo of Clinton in the hot tub.

“They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton,” Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said in a statement.

“There are two types of people here,” he said. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships after that. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”

After nearly two decades of court action, a voluminous number of Epstein records had already been public before Friday, including flight logs, address books, email correspondence, police reports, grand jury records, courtroom testimony and deposition transcripts.

Besides public curiosity about whether any of Epstein's associates knew about or participated in the abuse, Epstein's accusers have also sought answers about why federal authorities shut down their initial investigation into the allegations in 2008.

“Just put out the files,” said Marina Lacerda, who says she survived sexual assault by Epstein. “And stop redacting names that don't need to be redacted.” 

One of the few revelations in the documents was a copy of the earliest known concern about Epstein's behavior -- a report taken by the FBI of a woman in 1996 who believed photos and negatives she had taken of her 12-year-old and 16-year-old sisters for a personal art project had been stolen by Epstein. The documents don't show what, if anything, the agency did with that complaint.

Police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein in 2005 after the family of a 14-year-old girl reported being molested at his mansion. The FBI joined the investigation. Authorities gathered testimony from multiple underage girls who said they'd been hired to give Epstein sexual massages.

Ultimately, prosecutors gave Epstein a deal that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution. He pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges involving someone under age 18 and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.

Epstein's accusers spent years in civil litigation trying to get that plea deal set aside. One of those women, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters, starting at age 17, with other men, including billionaires, famous academics, politicians and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, then known as Britain's Prince Andrew. 

Mountbatten-Windsor denied ever having sex with Giuffre, but King Charles III stripped him of his royal titles this year.

Prosecutors never brought charges in connection with Giuffre's claims, but her account fueled conspiracy theories about supposed government plots to protect the powerful. Giuffre died by suicide in April.

Federal prosecutors in New York brought new sex trafficking charges against Epstein in 2019, but he killed himself in jail after his arrest. Prosecutors then charged Maxwell, his longtime confidant, with recruiting underage girls for Epstein to abuse. She was convicted in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

The indiscriminate attack took place at a subway station near Taiwan's capital's main train station - Taipei's mayor said the suspect appeared to have jumped from a building to avoid arrest. Police said the suspect was certified dead after being sent to the hospital, Taiwan's Central News Agency reported.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A man with at least one knife and smoke grenades attacked crowds indiscriminately in Taiwan's capital on Friday evening, killing at least three people and injuring 11 others, according to the national news agency and the city government. The suspect later fell to his death from a department store building. 

Police said that the suspect was declared dead at a hospital after jumping from the building's sixth floor, the Central News Agency reported.

The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old man named Chang Wen, threw smoke grenades near an underground exit of the Taipei Main metro station, close to the city's main train station, and randomly attacked people with a “sharp object,” sending pedestrians running, according to media reports.

He then headed north to a popular shopping district, where he threw smoke grenades and stabbed multiple people on the first and fourth floors of the Eslite Spectrum Nanxi department store, primarily in the neck, the news agency said, citing police.

Police later revealed that the suspect, between the two scenes, took an underground path to a hotel, where he fetched some “lethal weapon” — or some kind of edged weapon — before showing up at a road outside the Zhongshan metro station, near the department store, according to the news agency.

Police said they were yet to find any accomplice and were investigating possible motives. Police said they recovered some “lethal weapons” in both the suspect's rental home in Taipei and the hotel room where he had stayed for three nights near Zhongshan.

Video footage aired on local television networks showed the suspect, who was wearing a gas mask and clad in black, dropping at least two smoke grenades at the Taipei Main metro station. He was later seen near Eslite and entering the department store while attacking passersby. 




Local hospitals reported three deaths from the attacks. CNA reported on Saturday that 11 others were initially hospitalized. Six of them remained in hospitals, with two in the intensive care unit, it said.

Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an told local media that a 57-year-old man immediately tried to stop the suspect at the metro station's exit, but was fatally wounded. National Taiwan University Hospital told the news agency that the fatal wound was “a penetrating injury about five centimeters in length caused by a sharp object that reached from the right lung to the left atrium.”

Taipei Metro said that a staffer was hospitalized after he inhaled excessive smoke while responding to the attack.

Another man died after he was attacked near the department store, according to EBC News. 

A female victim told EBC that she was hit by the suspect outside the department store when she was waiting for her daughter for a dinner appointment.

“It did not feel like a slash — it felt more like being hit,” she said. “Then it really hurt.” 

When she turned around, she said she saw “people lying on the ground and needing first aid because they were bleeding.”

Chang failed to report for reserve military training in November 2024, and he was wanted for violating the law on mandatory military service, the news agency reported. He apparently didn't report a change in household registration, resulting in nondelivery of his reserve military service summons, the news agency reported, citing a district prosecutors' office.

STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Federal investigators are trying to figure out why a business jet carrying retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and six others tried to return to a North Carolina airport just after takeoff but plowed into light poles and a tree line short of the runway, killing everyone on board.

The Cessna C550 erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground Thursday morning, about a third of a mile (550 meters) from the airport's runway. They also don't know who the was the lead pilot. Biffle was one of three people on board with a pilot's license.

The jet had departed Statesville Regional Airport, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Charlotte, 10 minutes earlier, but crashed while trying to return and land, authorities said.

Flight records indicate the plane was registered to a company run by Biffle. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board began examining the wreckage on Friday to help determine the cause of the crash and why the plane had returned to the airport in drizzle and cloudy conditions.

Investigators recovered the cockpit voice recorder, which could provide important clues about what happened. They were not aware of any emergency calls from the jet, NTSB member Michael Graham said at a Friday news conference.

There were three pilots on board. Federal Aviation Administration records show Biffle was rated to fly helicopters, and single- and multi-engine planes. Also on board was pilot Dennis Dutton, Dutton's son, Jack — who had a private pilot's license for single-engine planes — and Biffle's friend Craig Wadsworth.

Biffle's wife, Cristina, and children Ryder, 5, and Emma, 14, were also killed in the crash, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.




Cristina Biffle's mother told People magazine that her daughter sent her a text message saying, “We're in trouble,” before she didn't hear from her again.

Federal investigators on Friday didn't have answers yet about the crew.

Dennis Dutton was licensed and rated to fly this model of plane, but even then, he was supposed to fly with a co-pilot. Even though Biffle was rated to fly a multi-engine plane, he wasn't listed as qualified to fly this particular jet or be a second officer. Dutton's son, Jack, also had a pilot's license but was only rated for single-engine planes.

“There is nobody else that has a second-in-command type rating in the airplane. So there's a question on the crew,” aviation safety expert John Cox said.

The plane's speed and altitude fluctuated significantly during the brief flight, and its path was consistent with a flight crew that experienced an issue and needed to return quickly, said former NTSB and FAA crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti.

At one point, the plane quickly soared from 1,800 feet (550 meters) up to 4,000 feet (1,220 meters) before descending again. Just before the crash, it was only a couple of hundred feet off the ground.

“One thing is certain: They were low. They were too low to make a safe landing on that runway,” Guzzetti said.

It's unclear why the pilots didn't make an emergency call, but their top priorities are flying the plane and figuring out where to land — not radioing for help. It's possible they were too busy trying to control the plane and dealing with the problem. But Cox said it's also possible that the problem they encountered wasn't considered an emergency. And the pilots may not have made it a priority to make a radio call with no tower or firefighters at the airport.

Biffle, 55, won more than 50 races across NASCAR's three circuits, including 19 at the Cup Series level. He also won the Trucks Series championship in 2000 and the Xfinity Series title in 2002.

In 2024, Biffle was honored for his humanitarian efforts after Hurricane Helene struck the U.S., even using his personal helicopter to deliver aid to flooded, remote western North Carolina.

A memorial with flowers sprouted up Friday by Biffle's marble star in his hometown of Mooresville, honoring him as a member of the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame. 

Steve Miller dropped by to pay his respects. He met Biffle at a huge party after he was inducted in October. He told Biffle he hoped the racecar driver could help knock an item off his bucket list — taking a flight in a helicopter.

“Come knock on my door, I'll take you up,” Miller recalled Biffle telling him. “Never happened.”

Cessna Citations like the one that crashed Thursday are known as reliable, easy-to-fly jets. While the plane is in flight, one pilot is at the controls while the other pilot is the monitoring pilot, Cox said.

Roughly 1,000 of these 550 series jets have been made, and they have a very good safety record. “What accidents have occurred in this type were mostly due to very poor pilot decisions,” Guzzetti said.

The Statesville airport will remain closed at least through Saturday as the NTSB performs its investigation, officials said.

Los Angeles resident Ruth Horne, 76, enticed by a bargain, bought what she thought was a Roomba to vacuum her house, but the experience ended in frustration."It kept getting stuck somewhere and would then just go around in circles," Horne said. She realized it was a cheaper knock-off. Meanwhile, Marcy Lewis, 75, of Madeira, Ohio, had been wanting a robot vacuum cleaner and deliberately chose a knock-off. "I'm pretty low tech, but it just seemed like a good idea — cleaner house, less work," Lewis said. 

She was watching Prime Day sales and got a good deal on a Eufy robot vacuum cleaner.  "I really liked it and it did a good job, but didn't last long," Lewis said. Product quality was one of the advantages for the Roomba in a flood of less expensive knock-offs, but that didn't save it from the corporate bankruptcy its maker iRobot announced earlier this week. And cheap Chinese competition was not the only factor in its failure. An attempted 2022 acquisition of iRobot by Amazon, thwarted by regulators, and the changing dynamics around mergers and acquisitions, represent an ongoing concern for struggling tech companies that in the past have turned to M&A as not just an exit ramp, but savior. 

The company, which Amazon agreed to pay $1.7 billion to acquire in August 2022, reported in a court filing last Sunday that it had between $100 million-$500 million in assets and liabilities, and owed roughly $100 million to its largest creditor, Shenzhen Picea Robotics Co., the contract manufacturer, located in China and Vietnam, which now owns it. In all, Reuters reported the company has $190 million in debt.

"Today's outcome is profoundly disappointing — and it was avoidable," Colin Angle, co-founder and CEO of iRobot, told CNBC in a statement earlier this week. "This is nothing short of a tragedy for consumers, the robotics industry and America's innovation economy."

In early 2024, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC that regulators' efforts to block the deal were a "sad story" and said it would've given iRobot a competitive boost against rivals.

Some M&A experts agree with the view of both the would-be acquirer and bankrupt company.

"The iRobot case demonstrates that when regulators prioritize hypothetical future harms over present-day financial realities, they don't protect competition; they destroy the target company," said Kristina Minnick is a professor of finance at Bentley University. "The bankruptcy of iRobot serves as a definitive cautionary tale for the current M&A environment, underscoring fears that regulators are dismantling the traditional safety net for struggling companies," she said.

Acquisitions are an integral part of recycling assets and growing the economy, but regulators in the U.S. and in Europe have taken a stance in recent years which Minnick says "distorts this natural cycle."

She added that by blocking Amazon's white knight acquisition of iRobot, regulators removed the only viable exit ramp for a struggling American robotics pioneer. "The tragic irony is that instead of remaining an independent competitor, iRobot was forced into bankruptcy and is now being sold to one of its Chinese manufacturing partners. In their zeal to prevent Big Tech expansion, regulators effectively handed valuable IP and market share to the very foreign competitors that were crushing the company in the first place," Minnick said. 

After Amazon abandoned the deal in early 2024 citing the likelihood that European regulators would block it, newer issues emerged for the already vulnerable company.

"Roomba didn't just run out of battery, it got shoved into Chapter 11 after European regulators kicked out Amazon's $1.4 billion escape hatch and left it bleeding cash on the living-room floor," said Eric Schiffer, chairman at Reputation Management Consultants. "Amazon walked, tariffs hit, cheap rivals swarmed, and suddenly the king of robo-vacs is begging its own manufacturer to save its plastic rear end," Schiffer said. "This is a cautionary tale that if your business model is to get bought by Big Tech, one hostile regulator in Europe can turn your dream exit into a Caligula-level catastrophic implosion."

Jay Jung, managing partner at Embarc Advisors, a San Francisco-based corporate finance advisory firm, says that iRobot's bankruptcy is ominous for future similar deals if regulators don't learn the lessons of the past few years. "European regulators are within their rights to block these deals," he said. But he added that "their stance is too tilted towards anti-big tech. When a Chinese company like this takes over, they will preserve the brand but everything moves to China — lost jobs, and any other economic benefit other than the brand is gone." 

At least publicly, the Trump administration's Federal Trade Commission seems to be taking a more hands-off approach to M&A than its Biden era predecessors led by FTC Chair Lina Khan, who had a hawkish antitrust stance. It has vowed to take a dual approach on mergers: vigorously pursue ones deemed anti-competitive and stand out of the way one of ones that don't meet that criteria. "If we've got a merger or conduct that violates the antitrust laws, and I think I can prove it in court, I'm going to take you to court. And if we don't, I'm going to get the hell out of the way," FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson told CNBC's Squawk Box earlier this year.

But in Europe, the view towards tech M&A remains tilted to scrutiny. EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera telegraphed that there could be more to come in comments earlier this month when announcing an anti-trust probe against Meta's plans to block AI rivals from Whatsapp, which it owns. The action she said was to prevent dominant tech players from "abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors"

That is cold comfort for a struggling tech company, and Minnick said big tech is already finding workarounds to avoid antitrust scrutiny. As a direct result of these blocked exit ramps, the tech giants are now attempting to circumvent regulators through asset purchases rather than full company acquisitions. 

"In deals like Microsoft's arrangement with Inflection AI or Amazon's deal with Adept, the acquirer hires the target's founders and key engineering talent while licensing their intellectual property, leaving the corporate shell behind," Minnick said, adding that this "reverse acqui-hire" structure is designed specifically as a loophole to bypass antitrust review. 

The FTC did in fact issue a report on these types of deals in the final days of Lina Khan's tenure, after it had targeted the Amazon-Adept deal for scrutiny.Minnick says even if the deal tweaks are successful, they remain imperfect solutions for a broader M&A problem. "While this allows the technology to survive, it is a sub-optimal outcome that often leaves regular shareholders and non-essential employees stranded in a hollowed-out zombie company, proving that regulatory friction is forcing the market into increasingly complex and inefficient contortions to survive," she said. 

Minnick believes that if things don't change, we are likely to see more of these zombie scenarios, where struggling tech and media companies find their exit ramps blocked by regulators overseas or at home.  "The refusal to allow organic consolidation means that instead of orderly acquisitions that preserve jobs and innovation, we may see more disorderly bankruptcies," Minnick said. "If potential acquirers are genuinely concerned about overpaying or regulatory hurdles, they will choose not to engage. But when regulators preemptively block these lifelines to make a philosophical point, they are not saving the market; instead, they are breaking the machinery that allows the economy to heal and grow," she added. 

Roomba did face more than just M&A headwinds, including financial problems accelerated by the Trump administration's trade policy. 

Ragini Bhalla, head of brand at Creditsafe, has been watching iRobot's deteriorating finances for a while. The company began paying vendors three to four weeks late beginning in May, Bhalla said, and that volatility in paying vendors and suppliers is usually an early warning sign of emerging liquidity pressure. She also said that iRobot's credit score steadily dropped over a period of five months until it was rated "Very High Risk" in June 2025, where it stayed until the bankruptcy filing. 

Bhalla also noted that revenue declined amid intensifying competition from lower-priced Chinese rivals and that tariffs emerged as a direct and material accelerant. Trade policy was the final blow. "Most Roombas are manufactured in Vietnam, exposing iRobot to new U.S. import levies that added millions in costs and disrupted forward planning," Bhalla said. 

Ultimately, the combination of elevated debt, eroding demand, and tariff-driven cost pressure pushed iRobot into a manufacturer-led buyout through bankruptcy. "This illustrates how trade policy shocks can quickly turn underlying operational stress into a solvency event for hardware-dependent businesses," Bhalla said. 

There is no going back from an antitrust regime that has gone global, according to Schiffer, and Roomba may merely be the most high-profile casualty of 2025."Your suitor can live in Seattle, your stock on Nasdaq, and some wacky commission in Brussels holds the shotgun to your wedding," Schiffer said, adding that for founders, "Roomba is the billboard warning that if you rely on one mega-deal to save you, you're not running a strategy, you're rehearsing for disaster."Meanwhile, Lewis in Ohio just wants a working Roomba. "I am surprised about the bankruptcy, but I don't feel that it affects me. I'm also disappointed that a Chinese company is buying Roomba — sadly that seems to be the way things go now. It's nice to buy American, but it gets harder and harder."

Activist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.

On Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.

LKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers. 

The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers. 

Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint. 

Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.

LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount. 

The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000. However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock. 

In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.

Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business. 

LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment. 

Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries. 

Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.

The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA. 

The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA. 

The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price. 

While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Genuine Parts, may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that. 

Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.

In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time. 

If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders. 

Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.

U.S. negotiators are set to meet Russian officials in Florida on Saturday for the latest talks aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine, as President Donald Trump's administration tries to coax an agreement out of both Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict.

The meeting follows U.S. talks on Friday with Ukrainian and European officials, the latest discussions of a peace plan that has sparked some hope of a resolution to the conflict that began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

President Vladimir Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, is leading the Russian delegation that will meet with property tycoon-turned-diplomat Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Marco Rubio, Trump's top diplomat and national security advisor, said he may also join the talks.

Previous meetings have taken place at Witkoff's golf club in Miami's Hallandale Beach.

U.S., Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week reported progress on security guarantees for Kyiv as part of the talks to end the war, but it remains unclear if those terms will be acceptable to Moscow.

A Russian source told Reuters that any meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian negotiators had been ruled out.

U.S. intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to capture all of Ukraine, sources familiar with the intelligence said, contradicting some U.S. officials' assertions that Moscow is ready for peace.

Putin offered no compromise during his annual press conference in Moscow, insisting that Russia's terms for ending the war had not changed since June 2024, when he demanded Ukraine abandon its ambition to join NATO and withdraw entirely from four Ukrainian regions Russia claims as its own territory.

Kyiv says it will not cede land that Moscow's forces have failed to capture in nearly four years of war.

Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov said U.S. and European teams on Friday held talks and agreed to pursue their joint efforts.

"We agreed with our American partners on further steps and on continuing our joint work in the near future," Umerov wrote on Telegram of the discussions in the United States, adding that he had informed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of the outcome of the talks. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rubio told reporters earlier on Friday that progress has been made in discussions to end the war but there is still a way to go.

"In the end, it's up to them to make a deal. We can't force Ukraine to make a deal. We can't force Russia to make a deal. They have to want to make a deal," Rubio said.

"The role we're trying to play is a role of figuring out whether there's any overlap here that they can agree to, and that's what we've invested a lot of time and energy and continue to do so. That may not be possible. I hope it is. I hope it can get done this month before the end of the year."The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria on Friday in retaliation for an attack on American personnel, U.S. officials said.

A U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Syria targeting Islamic State suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria's security forces.

President Donald Trump had vowed to retaliate after a suspected ISIS attack killed U.S. personnel last weekend in Syria.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted "ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites" and that the operation was "OPERATION HAWKEYE STRIKE."

"This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance," Hegseth said. "Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue," he added.

Trump said on social media that the Syrian government fully supported the strikes and that the U.S. was inflicting "very serious retaliation."

At a speech in North Carolina on Friday night, Trump called it a "massive" blow against the ISIS members that the U.S. blames for the Dec. 13 attack on coalition forces.

"We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria. … It was very successful," Trump said at a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

U.S. Central Command said the strikes hit more than 70 targets across central Syria, adding that Jordanian fighter jets supported the operation.

One U.S. official said the strikes were carried out by U.S. F-15 and A-10 jets, along with Apache helicopters and HIMARS rocket systems.

Syria reiterated its steadfast commitment to fighting Islamic State and ensuring that it has "no safe havens on Syrian territory," according to a statement by the foreign ministry.

Two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed on Saturday in the central Syrian town of Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the U.S. military. Three other U.S. soldiers were also wounded in the attack.

About 1,000 U.S. troops remain in Syria.

The Syrian Interior Ministry has described the attacker as a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathizing with Islamic State.

Syria's government is led by former rebels who toppled leader Bashar al-Assad last year after a 13-year civil war, and includes members of Syria's former Al Qaeda branch who broke with the group and clashed with Islamic State.

Syria has been cooperating with a U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, reaching an agreement last month when President Ahmed al-Sharaa visited the White House.

Workers who moved out of London for remote work are under pressure to come back to the office in the city, and some are choosing to stay in Japanese-inspired sleeping pods for just £30 ($40). 

I travelled to Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London to spend a night in a newly opened capsule hotel, after two of my colleagues who live outside the city recommended staying there. 

Zedwell Capsule Hotel, a brand owned by Criterion Capital, opened in September and offers nearly 1,000 capsules measuring 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth — likely the smallest hotel rooms in London. 

It has a rather unassuming exterior despite being located inside the historic London Pavilion building — originally built as a music hall in 1885. The entrance is around the corner of the busy station, through some black doors.

The cost of staying in a hotel in Central London is staggering, sitting at an average of £265 per night in the third quarter of 2025, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. In comparison, the average daily rate of hotels across Europe was 125 euros in the summer, according to an analysis of over 600,000 reservations from 2,000 independent hotels by RoomRaccoon. 

Criterion's Head of Hotels Halima Aziz told me that the capsule hotel addresses a gap in the market between budget hostels and affordable accommodation. 

"We've formed this sweet spot between the two. We're not a budget hostel. We're not coming in at a £15 rate, giving you a bunk bed in a steel room," she said. 

"When we decided to get into capsules, we really took inspiration from Asia, and the capsule concept was really born out of Japan as a response to very similar pressures we're facing in London." 

In Japan, the first capsule hotel was built in the city of Osaka in 1979, primarily to serve as an inexpensive overnight option for salarymen who worked late and preferred to stay out drinking and socializing rather than spending more money commuting home. 

It's given rise to some capsule-style hotels in New York, from sleeping pods by Kama Central Park, to Nap York, a sleeping station with private pods for short naps or overnight stays. 

Now that the concept has come to London, I was keen to see for myself what the British version has to offer.

It's a Monday evening, and instead of my usual work-from-home routine, which involves preparing to go into the office the next day, I'm crawling into a brightly lit sleeping pod.

I roll down the garage-like shutters and lock it from the inside as I prepare to sleep. My head is just inches beneath the ceiling of my pod, which has a light dimmer, two clothing hooks, an air purifier, a wide mirror stretching along the head of the capsule, and charger sockets. 

Although I can feel my luggage — a backpack and tote bag — at the end of my bed, and the bottom of my coat hung on the hooks, I'm surprised by how comfortable and cozy the bedding is. 

I switch off the lights and noisy air purifier and find myself enveloped by pitch black and silence. It feels eerie, but with nothing to distract me, I fall asleep quickly.

Earlier in the day, I checked myself into the hotel using one of four kiosks, and as I roamed around the hotel, I noticed that the walls were painted black to match the exterior — and there isn't a single window in sight. 

I rode up to the first floor and used a key card to access my female-only dormitory. My capsule was one of seven stacked side by side or on top of each other, and some were only accessible via steps. 

I learned that despite the low initial cost, there was a series of additional amenities guests can pay for, from an extra £10 to be in a female-only dormitory, to £8 for a padlock, and £15 to store luggage securely. 

The hotel had an unfinished feel. The entrance was covered in scaffolding and the faint sound of drilling could be heard from inside the building. 

That's because it is "still under construction," Zedwell's General Manager Greg Walsh told me. The drilling sounds were coming from underground where a larger reception was being built, with direct links to Piccadilly Circus Station. 

CEO Aziz confirmed that the building is not complete, adding that the additional cost for the female dorms was largely due to upgraded amenities, including a towel inside the pod and a female-only beauty room complete with hairdryers  — although this is still under construction and not currently accessible. 

"Ultimately, if you're not just targeting the traditional hostel market, and you want to widen access, you need to respond to people's needs, and people have needs for laundry, for beauty, that wouldn't typically be considered," she added. 

While exploring the building, I found shared toilets and showers with classical music playing inside, as well as vending machines in the reception with snacks, drinks, slippers and eye masks amongst other items. 

I wandered out for dinner and with Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden within walking distance, it wasn't hard to entertain myself. 

During my time in the hotel, I discovered I was one of many working professionals in the building. I spotted several guests arriving in suits and ties and carrying briefcases. One chef from Newcastle even told me he paid a total of £284 to stay in the hotel for a fortnight to work in London. 

During the Covid-19 pandemic, many office workers in London moved out of the city, where it was cheaper to rent or own a home, due to remote and flexible working options becoming a normality. 

A 2021 report from City Hall said it was likely that London's population fell during the pandemic. The number of payrolled London employees dropped sharply by about 210,000 by November 2020, with the report citing that flexible work arrangements made it easier to move out of the city. 

The trend persisted, and by 2022, 43% of commuters lived over 30 minutes away from their workplace in the U.K., reflecting higher property prices in central areas, according to a report by commercial real estate firm CBRE which surveyed over 20,000 people globally.  

Additionally, CBRE found that 41% of people worldwide were planning to move to more remote locations in the next two years either in the same city or to a different city. 

However, in 2025, there's been a sharp recall in remote work offerings with major companies enforcing return to office mandates in London from HSBC to JPMorgan, Amazon, Salesforce and John Lewis. 

Zedwell's Aziz said one of the hotel's core demographics is young professionals and hybrid workers who are using Zedwell as a "base in the city" due to their flexible working patterns which require them to be in the office for a few days a week. Roughly 20% of the hotel's customers are corporate workers, Aziz said. 

"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high," she said. "Our product is often cheaper than their commute or late-night travel home." 

The return-to-office mandate has left workers who don't live in cities scrambling to find inexpensive ways of staying in the city, without having to resort to unattractive options like hostels. 

"Where they wouldn't traditionally consider a hostel product, we identified that they would indeed consider a capsule hotel, because it gave that privacy," Aziz added. 

As a Londoner, my usual commute to the office lasts just over 30 minutes, so the hotel doesn't offer much in terms of convenience for me, but I can see the appeal for those living further away from the city. 

When I awoke in the morning, I almost forgot that I wasn't in my bed at home. After a quick shower, I got ready inside my capsule before heading out and joining the throng of commuters in central London.

The rise of AI-powered no-code tools that allow users to create applications through linguistic prompts rather than computer code, decentralized through blockchain technology, will challenge Amazon Web Services' (AWS) dominance of the cloud computing market.

No-code tools will democratize access to app creation and custom-tailored user experiences that will require constant updates and maintenance from AI, Lomesh Dutta, vice president of growth at the Dfinity Foundation, a non-profit organization that guides development of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem, told Cointelegraph.

This rise of user-created applications eliminates the need for centrally managed software solutions stored on centralized servers. 

“When applications are continuously generated and evolved by AI, you need infrastructure that is secure, tamper-resistant, and able to stay online without constant human intervention,” he said. Lomesh added:

A significant portion of crypto companies and Web3 projects rely on centralized AWS infrastructure to power their consumer-facing applications and websites, Internet Computer founder Dominic Williams told Cointelegraph.

AWS outages rock the crypto industry in 2025 

Several AWS outages occurred in 2025, impacting multiple crypto platforms and exchanges using AWS servers and data centers to host their applications.

The first outage occurred in April, causing disruptions to centralized crypto exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin and MEXC. At the time, Binance temporarily paused withdrawals until normal service was restored. 

AWS experienced another outage in October, causing disruptions in crypto exchange Coinbase's mobile application, with users reporting login problems, slowdowns and withdrawal issues.  

Other financial applications were impacted by the outage, including the mixed-asset brokerage platform Robinhood and Web3 wallet MetaMask.

The October AWS outage lasted for about 15 hours and underscored the level of reliance crypto and Web3 projects, which market themselves as decentralized alternatives, have on centralized cloud infrastructure providers.

Crypto's reliance on centralized infrastructure has drawn criticism from several crypto industry executives, including Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at crypto wallet company Bitget Wallet, and Carlos Lei, co-founder of decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) marketplace Uplink.

“Decentralization has succeeded at the ledger layer but not yet at the infrastructure layer,” Elkaleh told Cointelegraph in October.

In a landmark move signaling a major shift in U.S. cryptocurrency oversight, the Senate confirmed two key nominees from President Donald Trump on December 19, 2025: Michael Selig as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Travis Hill as Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

These confirmations, part of a larger package of 97 nominees approved in a 53-43 party-line vote, mark a decisive pivot toward a more innovation-friendly regulatory environment after years of perceived hostility under the previous administration.

The appointments of Selig and Hill - both viewed as pro-crypto figures - come at a pivotal time as Congress considers legislation that could expand the CFTC's role in digital asset markets and as banks seek clearer paths to engage with the crypto sector. Industry advocates hail this as the dawn of a new era, potentially positioning the U.S. as the "crypto capital of the world," a goal echoed by Selig himself during his nomination process.

Selig, a former chief counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Crypto Task Force and senior advisor to SEC Chair Paul Atkins, brings deep expertise in digital asset policy. His background includes stints at the CFTC under former Chairman Chris Giancarlo (known as "CryptoDad") and private practice at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where he advised on financial innovation.

Selig has consistently advocated for classifying most cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities, favoring CFTC oversight over the SEC's enforcement-heavy approach. He supports regulated spot markets, stablecoins, and tokenization of real-world assets, arguing for rules that foster competition without stifling growth.

In his confirmation hearing on November 19, 2025, Selig pledged to prioritize well-functioning markets and help make the U.S. a global leader in blockchain technology.

If pending legislation like the CLARITY Act passes, the CFTC under Selig could gain primary authority over spot trading of major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, shifting power away from the SEC and providing the market structure clarity the industry has long demanded.

Hill, who has served as acting FDIC Chairman since January 20, 2025, following his prior role as Vice Chairman, has been a vocal critic of "Operation Chokepoint 2.0" - the alleged practice of pressuring banks to sever ties with crypto firms.

Under his interim leadership, the FDIC has already taken steps to reverse this trend, including releasing Biden-era "pause letters" that delayed crypto-related activities and clarifying in guidance (FIL-7-2025) that banks do not need prior approval for permissible crypto engagements.

Hill supports a banking-style regulatory model for stablecoins, emphasizing risk management over blanket restrictions. His confirmation solidifies these changes, allowing banks greater freedom to custody digital assets, issue stablecoins, and partner with crypto companies without fear of informal reprisals.

This reversal addresses longstanding complaints from firms like Coinbase and Custodia Bank, which faced account closures and denials amid heightened scrutiny.

The dual appointments could accelerate institutional adoption. With the CFTC potentially becoming the primary spot market regulator and the FDIC easing banking access, crypto firms may finally gain stable footholds in traditional finance. Recent actions—such as interagency withdrawals of anti-crypto statements and proposals to eliminate "reputational risk" from supervisory programs—further underscore this thaw.

This is not financial or investment advice. Always do your own research (DYOR).

However, challenges remain. The CFTC currently operates with Selig as its sole commissioner following earlier resignations, and broader market structure legislation is still pending in Congress. Midterm elections in 2026 could alter the political landscape if Democrats regain influence.

Industry reactions have been overwhelmingly positive. Leaders from groups like the Crypto Council for Innovation and The Digital Chamber praised the moves as signs of meaningful progress.

As one advocate noted, these leaders are poised to bridge traditional finance and blockchain, fostering innovation while maintaining safeguards.

As 2025 draws to a close, the U.S. crypto sector appears on the cusp of regulatory maturity.

With Selig and Hill at the helm, the focus shifts from enforcement to enablement - potentially unlocking trillions in tokenized assets and solidifying America's role in the global digital economy.

                            Wall Street firms have rallied around Ethereum as their preferred blockchain for tokenization. Credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images.                        

When JPMorgan launched a new tokenized money market fund this week, it followed BlackRock and Fidelity in selecting Ethereum as its blockchain rail of choice.

Now, with Wall Street poised to expand the concept to other classes of securities, the OG smart contract platform is leading the tokenization race.

Between BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Fidelity's Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), and now, JPMorgan's OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), some of the biggest names in asset management have launched tokenized MMFs on Ethereum.

The largest funds operated by BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan hold assets worth more than $1 trillion each, while the overall market for U.S. MMFs is worth more than $7.5 trillion .

That all three firms have converged on Ethereum is significant. Rather than opting for private blockchains or newer, faster networks, these institutions have chosen a platform known for its decentralization, deep developer ecosystem, and regulatory familiarity.

A strong network effect reinforces the preference for Ethereum, which already hosts the majority of tokenized U.S. Treasury products and regulated stablecoins.

This provides a ready-made infrastructure for asset managers seeking the most liquid and compliant venue for their on-chain offerings.

Although Ethereum is favored by the world's largest asset managers, it would be unwise to rule out alternative blockchains.

Thanks to Figure Technologies' home equity lending product, Provenance accounts for around 74%  of the market for on-chain private credit.

Meanwhile, a single 100 million euro issuance on Polygon outweighs the combined value of all corporate bonds  on Ethereum.

Against this backdrop, many of the companies building tokenization solutions have opted to remain blockchain-agnostic.

“We're seeing a lot of interest in the private networks from the big banks. But I think outside of that, there is still a massive push towards public [blockchains],” observed Ctrl Alt CEO Matt Ong.

In an interview with CCN, Ong noted that this approach is playing out across the market.

For Instance, while JPMorgan issued MONY on Ethereum, the bank has deployed other tokenized assets on its own Kynexis platform.

While early tokenization initiatives have focused on a limited set of use cases, other asset classes may soon follow.

The holy grail of tokenization is arguably native, on-chain stock issuance, and huge swathes of the global stock market could potentially be up for grabs.

To that end, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently granted approval for the Depositary Trust and Clearing Company (DTCC) to pilot a general-purpose framework for securities tokenization.

In doing so, the SEC essentially tasked the DTCC with establishing standards for issuing and settling securities on-chain.

With exchange operators like Nasdaq primed to list tokenized stocks as soon as possible, DTCC standards are expected to shape which blockchains are integrated into America's core market infrastructure.

Meanwhile, Euroclear, which serves as the centralized securities depository for European markets, is involved in equivalent projects across the pond, such as the U.K.'s digital securities sandbox.

As Ong pointed out, Euroclear and the DTCC “have a massive advantage in the fact that they basically have a monopoly in the space.” However, “the key is going to be speed.”

“We're already seeing others that are bringing digital securities depositories to life,” Ong noted, adding that if incumbent infrastructure giants don't move quickly enough, they risk losing market share to new players that can bring assets on-chain much faster.

On December 20, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) added eight CryptoPunks to its permanent collection. The acquisition recognizes CryptoPunks as an essential component of digital and cultural history.

According to CryptoPunks, the eight NFTs included Punk 4018, Punk 2786, Punk 5616, Punk 5160, Punk 3407, Punk 7178, Punk 74, and Punk 7899. The Punks confirmed that the NFTs will be preserved and cared for as part of the museum's collection, a testament to its history.

CryptoPunks, welcome to the @MuseumModernArt  collection!

Punk 4018, Punk 2786, Punk 5616, Punk 5160, Punk 3407, Punk 7178, Punk 74, and Punk 7899 have found a permanent home at MoMA, where they'll be preserved and cared for as part of the museum's history.

CryptoPunks said that this gift's collective generosity demonstrates the tenacity and spirit of the punk community, which has sustained the project. The team confirmed that Mara Calderon and ArtOnBlockchain made this historic donation possible. CozomoMedici, JudithESSS, NTmoney, kukulabanze, and Rhyd0n also contributed Punks from their own collection as part of their ongoing dedication to the project.

According to CryptoPunks, 1OF1_art assisted in the acquisition of the NFTs.

CryptoPunks are pixelated avatars that are randomly created by computer code recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Matt Hall and John Watkinson introduced the CryptoPunks in 2017. The two creators are also collectively known as Larva Labs.

CryptoPunks revealed that there are only 10,000 punks, and no two are the same. Currently, the 10,000 CryptoPunks are dispersed throughout the Ethereum wallets of 3,121 individuals.

CryptoPunk has progressed to dominate the NFT market. At a Christie's auction in 2021, one of the most sought-after CryptoPunk NFTs, CryptoPunk 9997, sold for HK$33.9 million (approximately US$4.35 million), nearly five times its highest estimate.

The NFT, which was initially purchased in 2017 for 0.15 Ethereum (then $66), is one of only 88 zombie CryptoPunks in the world. Only 273 and 254 punks, respectively, have a tiny beard and a cap.

CryptoPunks market activity remains stable, indicating ongoing interest in the collection's most affordable assets, with the current floor price at 26.58 ETH (approximately $79.37). The project has made 1,888 sales in the last 12 months.

The project's lifetime sales volume has reached 1.40 million ETH, equivalent to approximately $3.89 billion, underscoring its enduring significance in the NFT market.

According to CryptoPunks, the trade momentum remains strong in the short term, despite larger market cycles, with sales of 136.48 ETH ($407,540) over the last day, 505.91 ETH ($1,510,000) over the previous week, and 2,850 ETH ($8,500,000) over the last four weeks.

NFTs have become increasingly popular in the art market. In July,  the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami (ICA Miami) purchased CryptoPunk 5293, one of just 3,840 female punks. After being purchased, CryptoPunk 5293 became the first NFT to be included in a major art museum collection.

On February 25, 2021, Christie's posted an NFT-based digital artwork by artist Beeple, commonly known by his actual name, Mike Winkelmann, for online auction. The opening price for the NFT was $100, with no estimate provided. 

According to Christie's, Beeple sold for an outstanding price of $69.3 million. The NFT became the third most expensive living artist at auction (after Jeff Koons and David Hockney). Beeple set a record for the most costly digital artwork.

According to the 2025 Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report, the global art market may be recalibrating, but it's not collapsing, despite growing economic and geopolitical unrest. The report claimed that the industry is expanding its base at the lower and mid-price tiers, attracting a new breed of collectors, despite overall numbers indicating a period of adjustment.

The report revealed a 3 percent increase in transaction volume, reaching 40.5 million. According to the report, the increase in transactions reflected continued market participation despite the presence of headwinds. 

However, the report noted that sales across tracked geographies continued to face limitations in 2024 due to political tensions, economic volatility, and trade fragmentation. The report noted that the limitations resulted in a 12 percent decrease compared to the previous year, amounting to $57.5 billion.

ETH wallet growth hits new highs while BTC exchange balances fall.

Ethereum [ETH] looks bigger if you count heads. Bitcoin [BTC] looks stronger if you count coins.

On paper, the former outperforms the latter in user participation. But Bitcoin's supply on exchanges is thinning in a far more controlled way, while Ethereum's liquidity is moving differently altogether.

The contrast shows a lot about how each asset is being used, held, and valued right now.

At press time, the network has 167.96 million non-empty wallets, nearly three times Bitcoin's 57.62 million. That gap matters because it shows that Ethereum is being used.

Ethereum wallets are now active endpoints across the board. The climb in non-empty wallets means new users are still entering the ecosystem, even as prices move sideways. Bitcoin, by contrast, remains more concentrated.

AMBCrypto previously reported that Ethereum's network growth surged to multi-month highs in December, and new wallet creation is spiking.

Santiment data showed nearly 200,000 new ETH wallets added on the 2nd and 15th of December, levels not seen since Ethereum's late-summer rally.

While Ethereum leads in wallet activity, Bitcoin's supply on exchanges has been tightening.

According to Glassnode, BTC exchange balances have been gradually declining, from roughly 2.98 million in mid‑November to about 2.94 million by mid‑December. Despite price fluctuations, holders are not rushing to sell.

Source: Glassnode

Exchange balances matter because they show immediate selling pressure. Coins held off exchanges are less likely to be traded quickly. In that sense, Bitcoin's shrinking exchange means confidence, even with fewer wallets overall.

The pair attempted a short breakout in early December, but failed to hold gains and rolled over quickly. Since then, ETH has struggled to outperform BTC on a relative basis, with rebounds proving shallow and short-lived.

Even as Ethereum attracts more users, capital continues to favor Bitcoin's stability.

Source: TradingView

Traders appear more comfortable holding BTC during periods of uncertainty, while ETH remains more sensitive to risk. For now, participation strength has not translated into relative price leadership.

It looks like South Korea is in a bit of a pickle. With the world slowly but surely shifting towards digital currencies, the rise of dollar-pegged stablecoins is proving to be a formidable challenge to the nation's monetary sovereignty. And you know what that means? Lawmakers are scrambling to come up with a plan. But what does that really mean for South Korea? Well, grab a seat and let's talk about it.

The idea of a won-backed stablecoin is actually gaining traction among South Korean lawmakers. Why? Because the global financial landscape is evolving, and fast. Rep. Min Byoung-dug of the Democratic Party of Korea has been vocal about it, stating that it's not a matter of if, but how quickly they can roll something out. He believes that a stablecoin tied to the Korean won would be quite beneficial for cross-border payments, trade settlements, and remittances. In short, it might just keep South Korea in the game.

But there's a ticking clock here. With dollar-pegged stablecoins already getting a foothold in domestic transactions, South Korea is at risk of losing monetary sovereignty. If businesses start relying more on foreign stablecoins, it could erode the Bank of Korea's control over monetary policy. And that's a slippery slope no one wants to go down.

Now, let's get to the good stuff. Integrating stablecoins could be a game changer for businesses. Faster and cheaper transactions? Yes, please. Stablecoins could simplify cross-border payments and cut down on the expensive fees and delays that SMEs often face when dealing with international transactions.

On the inclusion side, stablecoins could open doors for underserved businesses, letting them tap into global markets. If more companies start accepting stablecoin payments, they could benefit from lower transaction costs and instant settlements. This isn't just good for businesses; it could position South Korea as a key player in the digital finance arena.

But, of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are some significant risks involved. The Bank of Korea is worried about the potential for depegging. Remember Terra's UST? Yeah, trust issues are real, and a solid regulatory framework is essential.

Then there's the issue of deposit protection. Unlike traditional bank deposits, stablecoins don't come with insurance, which could leave businesses high and dry during market fluctuations. And let's not forget about capital outflows, which could complicate monetary policy even further.

One interesting avenue for stablecoins is payroll. South Korean companies can collaborate with Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) providers to offer employees the option of receiving their salaries in stablecoins. This caters to the growing demand for cryptocurrency payments and offers more flexibility in payment methods.

To get this going, businesses have to audit their current payroll costs and ask employees if they want in on the stablecoin salary thing. Picking compliant platforms and weaving them into existing HR systems can make the payroll process smoother and cheaper. It's a win-win if you ask me.

In conclusion, South Korea's future with stablecoins looks like it's going to be a wild ride. Lawmakers are pushing for a won-backed stablecoin, and while the potential benefits for businesses and the economy are huge, so are the risks and regulatory hurdles. 

Embracing stablecoins could enhance payment sovereignty and keep South Korea competitive. But whether it can be done without a hitch is another story, and time will tell how this plays out.

Quantum computing and the threat it poses to encrypted blockchains has once again crept into online bitcoin conversations, raising concerns that it poses a long-term risk that investors and developers are still struggling to talk about in the same language.

The latest flare-up in the debate followed comments from prominent Bitcoin developers pushing back against claims that quantum computers pose any real risk to the network in the foreseeable future. Their view is straightforward: that machines capable of breaking Bitcoin's cryptography do not exist today and are unlikely to for decades.

Adam Back, co-founder of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, described the risk as effectively nonexistent in the near term, calling quantum computing “ridiculously early” and riddled with unresolved research problems. Even in a worst-case scenario, Back argued, Bitcoin's design would not allow coins to be instantly stolen across the network.

Back's assessment is broadly shared among protocol developers. Critics, however, say the problem isn't the timeline, but it's the lack of visible preparation.

Bitcoin relies on elliptic curve cryptography to secure wallets and authorize transactions. As CoinDesk previously explained, sufficiently advanced quantum computers running Shor's algorithm — a quantum algorithm used to find the prime factors of big numbers — could derive private keys from exposed public keys, putting a portion of existing coins at risk.

The network wouldn't collapse overnight, but funds sitting in older address formats — including Satoshi Nakamoto's 1.1 million bitcoins, which have been untouched since 2010 — could become vulnerable to threat actors

For now, that threat remains theoretical. Yet governments and large enterprises are already acting as if quantum disruption is inevitable. The U.S. has outlined plans to phase out classical cryptography by the mid-2030s, while companies such as Cloudflare and Apple have begun rolling out quantum-resistant systems.

Bitcoin, by contrast, has not yet agreed on a concrete transition plan. And that gap is where market unease is creeping in.

Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, said on X that the disconnect between developers and investors is becoming hard to ignore. Capital, he argues, is less concerned with whether quantum attacks arrive in five years or 15, and more focused on whether Bitcoin has a credible path forward if cryptography standards change.

Developers counter that Bitcoin can adapt well before any real danger appears. Proposals exist to migrate users toward quantum-resistant address formats and, in extreme cases, restrict spending from legacy wallets. All of this would be preventive rather than reactive.

One such plan is the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)-360, which introduces a new type of Bitcoin address designed to use quantum-resistant cryptography.

It provides users with a means to transfer their coins into wallets that rely on different mathematical algorithms, which are believed to be far more resistant to cracking by quantum computers.

BIP360 outlines three new signature methods, each offering varying levels of protection, so the network can gradually shift rather than force a sudden upgrade. Nothing would change automatically. Users would opt in over time by moving funds to the new address format.

Supporters of BIP360 argue the proposal is less about predicting when quantum computers arrive and more about preparation. Moving Bitcoin to a new cryptographic standard could take years, involving software updates, infrastructure changes, and user coordination.

Starting early, they say, reduces the risk of being forced into rushed decisions later.

However, Bitcoin's conservative governance becomes a challenge when addressing long-horizon threats that require early consensus.

Quantum computing is not currently an existential threat to Bitcoin, and no credible timeline suggests otherwise. However, as capital becomes more institutional and long-term, even distant risks require clearer answers.

Until developers and investors converge on a shared framework, the quantum question will continue to linger — not as a panic, but as a quiet friction weighing on sentiment.

Seoul, South Korea, Dec.  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ROM: Golden Age on CROSS, a global MMORPG, has officially been onboarded to CROSS, an open Web3 gaming platform and games-first blockchain. The launch marks a significant expansion step for the rapidly growing CROSS ecosystem and a major milestone in the convergence of blockchain technology and mainstream online gaming.



This onboarding initiative, led by Henry Chang, CEO of NEXUS, and Hyunkeun Shin, CEO of Redlab Games, reflects the two companies' shared vision to integrate blockchain infrastructure into high-quality MMORPG experiences while maintaining the core gameplay values that traditional players expect.

Bringing Blockchain to a Proven MMORPG Franchise 

ROM: Golden Age on CROSS is a blockchain-enhanced evolution of ROM: Remember of Majesty, Redlab Games' flagship MMORPG title. While preserving the franchise's core identity components of deep character progression, large-scale PvP content and a robust MMORPG framework, the new iteration introduces new blockchain-based systems designed to enhance player ownership, transparency and long-term ecosystem sustainability.
		



Rather than restructuring gameplay around token rewards alone, ROM: Golden Age on CROSS integrates blockchain technology through the NEXUS-built CROSS Protocol infrastructure, allowing in-game economies and digital assets to operate within a broader on-chain ecosystem. This approach is intended to support long-term stability while avoiding disruption to the core MMORPG experience.

“This is the direction we believe blockchain gaming must take,” says Henry Chang, CEO of NEXUS. “Integrate Web3 quietly, responsibly and at the infrastructure level into an expertly crafted game. We're not here to tamper with the ways players enjoy games, but to empower gamers without compromising the experience that millions already love.”

From an ecosystem perspective, ROM: Golden Age on CROSS is designed around a value-preserving tokenomics model built on the strictly limited supply of the ROMx token. Rather than prioritizing short-term speculation or reward-driven structures, the game focuses on long-term stability and responsible economic design, ensuring that blockchain technology supports a sustainable gameplay environment.

A Truly Global One-Build Service Experience 

One of the defining features of ROM: Golden Age on CROSS is its Global One-build service, where players from around the world compete in a large-scale, nation-versus-nation structure. This global environment enables real-time interaction between regions, fostering competitive dynamics on an international scale.
		



“The Global One-build service is designed to let players experience the true scale of competition beyond borders, where strategy, cooperation, and rivalry unfold in real time on a worldwide stage,” says Hyunkeun Shin, CEO of Redlab Games.

The game offers a high degree of PK freedom, delivering a level of intensity characteristic of hardcore MMORPGs. Players can participate in large-scale strategic gameplay, including territory wars and castle sieges, which require coordination, tactical planning, and strong guild-level cooperation.

To support seamless interaction among global users, the game includes a real-time chat translation system, allowing players speaking different languages to communicate effectively during gameplay. This feature is designed to lower barriers to international collaboration and competition.

Player-Driven Economy and Marketplace Systems 

ROM: Golden Age on CROSS features a highly sophisticated free-market economy, supported by both direct player-to-player transactions and a robust global marketplace. Players can trade items freely, allowing market supply and demand to be shaped organically and driven by in-game activity.
		



A dedicated Sealing System further expands economic depth. Costumes and Guardians acquired through gacha mechanics or synthesis can be sealed, converted into tradable assets and exchanged within the marketplace. This system enhances item circulation while providing players with greater flexibility in managing their in-game assets.

The title also supports cross-platform play across both PC and mobile devices, enabling players to enjoy the same gameplay experience regardless of platform and supporting continuous engagement within different play environments.

Launch Growth Support Event on CROSS Server 

To celebrate the launch of ROM: Golden Age on CROSS, an exclusive Growth Support Event will be held on the game's CROSS server, designed to help players progress quickly during the early stages of the game.

Event Period: December 23, 00:00 – January 21, 23:59 (UTC)
		



1)   Powerful Growth Buffs: 

2)   Starter Settlement Support Mail Rewards:  Throughout the event period, key rewards will be distributed via in-game mail every four hours, including the following items:

This event is intended to lower the entry barrier for new players, accelerate character growth, and encourage active participation in large-scale PvP and PvE content from the early stages of gameplay.

Long-Term Vision for the CROSS Ecosystem 

NEXUS and Redlab Games have emphasized their commitment to long-term service stability and scalable growth for ROM: Golden Age on CROSS. The companies plan to achieve this through regular content updates, continuous balance adjustments and robust live service operations.
		



Both companies view the title as a strategic foundation for the broader expansion of the CROSS gamechain and a key entry point into the global Web3 gaming market. By combining a proven MMORPG IP with blockchain infrastructure, they aim to deliver an experience that appeals to both traditional gamers and Web3-native users.

The sales data on the top NFT projects in the past week also shows that Courtyard is the best selling collection in sales volume, which is an indicator of the continued demand in established digital assets in the face of broader market trends. 

TOP #NFT COLLECTIONS BY WEEKLY SALES VOLUME                            #Courtyard #PudgyPenguins #GuildofGuardians #BoredApeYachtClub #Moonbirds #CryptoPunks #LilPudgys #Nakamigos #DMarket #MutantApeYachtClub #Froganas #GodsUnchained pic.twitter.com/wcojLCdjgB

Courtyard registered sales amounts to $2.85 million within the last seven days with a robust growth rate of 35.26% compared to the last week. The collection was also the best in terms of activity with 8,376 buyers, and an impressive 51,523 transactions, meaning participation by many as opposed to a few one-off high value NFT trades.

Pudgy Penguins took the second position with sales of $2.32 million per week with a significant increase of 69.33% in the seven days. Despite the fact that the collection registered only 97 buyers and 170 transactions, the sudden rise indicates that the interest returns and the average sale value goes up. Guild of Guardians came second with $2 million sales and a small 8.28 percent weekly growth. The collection also had 811 buyers and made 1,629 transactions and represented consistent demand due to its gaming-oriented ecosystem and engagement of community members.

Bored Ape Yacht Club remained in the list of the most successful collections, recording sales of $1.66 million per week and a growth of 23.25 percent. 

Although the NFT collection had only 70 buyers and 112 transactions, the collection's presence highlights the timelessness of blue-chip NFTs in times of selective market recoveries. 

Moonbirds showed an even greater momentum as sales reached 1.22 million with a steep upward growth of 71.75 percent per week. Moonbirds had 108 buyers and 281 transactions indicating growing interest that could be translated into a short-term resurgence with new NFT collector confidence.

CryptoPunks has registered sales of $1.17 million weekly and registered a 29.92 percent drop as compared to the last week. The participation was low as there were only 12 buyers and 14 transactions indicating that high-value assets are still experiencing a restrained involvement with a change in market sentiment. 

Lil Pudgys, on the other hand, had positive growth, as it sold $785.67 thousand with a 49.62 percent growth per week. The collection received 206 buyers and 473 transactions and was characterized by enhanced accessibility and greater appeal in comparison with premium-priced NFT collections.

The weekly sales of Nakamigos were on a negative trend, with the collection registering a 8.67% drop within seven days, reaching a sales of $780.53 thousand. 

Although the decreasing trend, buyer interest was significant as there were 268 buyers and 1,874 transactions, which represents continuous interest despite price pressure. 

DMarket, however, echoed one of the strongest drops in the rank of the collections. Sales were as high as $777.42 thousand which was a reduction of 83.88 percent per week. However, it registered 2,933 users and 20,124 sales, which highlights a lot of transactional volume based on the trading of in-game assets instead of a high-value sale of NFTs.

Mutant Ape Yacht Club became one of the leading collections as it had sold $718.37 thousand and a high 52.29% increment in their weekly sales. The collection reported 161 buyers and 354 transactions, indicating a reanimated demand correlated to its connection to the larger Yuga Labs ecosystem. 

Froganas recorded $665.34 thousand in sales but fell by 11.89% and 376 customers and 5148 transactions which were promising but strained. Gods Unchained took the last place in the rankings scoring $547.06 thousand in weekly sales and a decline in 22.44%.

The crypto market is entering a phase marked by rising uncertainty and persistent selling pressure, as major assets struggle to regain bullish momentum. Bitcoin remains capped below the $90,000 level, repeatedly failing to attract enough demand to flip resistance into support.

At the same time, Ethereum is experiencing heightened volatility and renewed selling pressure, reflecting broader risk aversion across the market. Sentiment has weakened, and price action suggests that investors are becoming increasingly selective rather than aggressively positioning for upside.

However, according to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the most important shift currently unfolding in crypto is not visible directly in price charts but in how and where capital is being positioned. On-chain data shows that global liquidity within the crypto ecosystem has not exited the market. Instead, it has changed form.

The total supply of ERC20-based stablecoins has expanded to approximately $160 billion, hovering near all-time highs. While this supply briefly contracted during the risk-off environment of 2022, it has since resumed a clear and sustained upward trend.

This behavior does not signal capital fleeing crypto. Rather, it reflects funds temporarily de-risking while remaining fully inside the ecosystem. Capital is accumulating in stablecoins as “waiting liquidity,” positioned on the sidelines and ready to be deployed once clearer directional signals emerge. Liquidity has not disappeared; it is simply paused, patient, and awaiting conviction.

The analysis also highlights that this shift in global capital behavior carries meaningful implications for Japan's crypto market. As regulatory clarity improves and tax frameworks gradually become more accommodating, Japan is positioned to benefit from a return of domestic capital that has remained cautious in recent years.

Combined with renewed interest from individual investors, this re-entry of sidelined capital could deepen local liquidity, improve price discovery, and strengthen Japan's role within the broader global crypto landscape.

A key element in this transition is the growing relevance of JPYC, Japan's yen-denominated stablecoin. While US dollar–based stablecoins continue to dominate global crypto flows, a yen-native digital currency offers Japan a strategic differentiator.

JPYC is not limited to speculative trading use cases; it is increasingly viewed as an infrastructure layer capable of supporting real economic activity. This includes integration with Web3 services, as well as domestic and cross-border payment applications that align more closely with Japan's existing financial systems.

Looking ahead, the report suggests Japan's crypto market may gradually shift away from a narrow focus on short-term price speculation. Instead, it could evolve into an ecosystem where capital actively circulates and is deployed for practical use cases. Ultimately, how effectively Japan absorbs and channels this globally mobile liquidity will play a central role in defining the market's next phase of growth.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is showing clear signs of structural stress after failing to sustain momentum above recent highs. As the weekly chart highlights, total market cap has retraced toward the $2.9–$3.0 trillion zone, an area that now acts as a critical inflection point for the broader market. This level coincides with the rising 100-week and 200-week moving averages, reinforcing its importance as medium- to long-term support.

The rejection from the $4 trillion region marks a decisive shift in market structure. After an extended expansion phase through 2024 and early 2025, the market has entered a corrective regime characterized by lower highs and weakening upside follow-through. Volume behavior supports this interpretation: selling pressure has increased during down weeks, while rebound attempts have been met with comparatively muted participation.

Despite the pullback, the long-term trend has not fully broken. The market remains well above the 2022–2023 base, suggesting this move resembles a consolidation or valuation reset rather than a full structural collapse. However, continued trading below the short-term moving averages indicates that risk appetite remains subdued.

For the bullish structure to reassert itself, the total market cap must stabilize above the $3 trillion threshold and reclaim the mid-range resistance near $3.3–$3.5 trillion. Failure to hold current support would expose the market to a deeper retracement toward the $2.4–$2.6 trillion region, where stronger historical demand previously emerged.

U.S. Plan to Drop Some Childhood Vaccines to Align with Denmark Will Endanger Children, Experts Say

The U.S. reportedly plans to overhaul the country's childhood vaccine schedule. The move could set public health back decades, experts say

The U.S. reportedly plans to overhaul the country's childhood vaccine schedule. The move, first reported by CNN, would change how many vaccines to protect against various diseases children get and when they receive those immunizations.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., secretary of health and human services, is a longtime vaccine skeptic and supports altering the vaccine schedule. Recommendations for several vaccines that are currently given routinely to children in the U.S.—including shots for rotavirus, varicella (chickenpox), hepatitis A, meningococcal bacteria, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—could be scrapped entirely under the plans, according to CNN.

Childhood vaccines collectively protect children and the U.S. population as a whole against diseases, such as measles and hepatitis B, that once sickened, hospitalized or killed hundreds or even thousands every year. Currently, children in the U.S. are recommended vaccines for 18 diseases, compared with 10 in Denmark.

Changing what vaccines kids get would be “a terrible mistake,” says Jessica Malaty Rivera, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Defend Public Health, an all-volunteer organization sponsored by a nonprofit. More children could get sick and die from preventable illnesses as a result.

RSV, for example, is the leading cause of infant hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 58,000 to 80,000 children younger than five years old are admitted to the hospital each year in the U.S. because of the disease. The two available shots, which are not technically vaccines but antibody drugs that protect against RSV, were approved in 2023 and 2025 and are more than 90 percent effective at protecting against hospitalization. Many of the vaccines that are reportedly targeted for removal are ones that were approved more recently, Malaty Rivera notes.

People have an arbitrary line of “old-school” vaccines, such as those for polio and measles, and “new-school” vaccines, such as those for chickenpox and human papillomavirus (HPV), Malaty Rivera says. But these newer vaccines have been around for decades and have been shown to be highly effective, she says.

The Trump administration has previously stated that it wants to model the U.S.'s vaccine policy after other developed countries and specifically Denmark, which recommends fewer vaccines than the U.S. does and recommends them at different times of life. The comparison was a core focus of discussion at the most recent meeting of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. But it doesn't make sense to compare the U.S. to countries, such as Denmark, that have a vastly different health care system.

Such a comparison is “not apples to oranges; it's apples to steaks,” Malaty Rivera says. “I cannot understate the value of universal health care and the extremely organized health care infrastructure” in Denmark.

“We can learn a lot from some studies that come from other countries, but we have to use a critical mind to figure out what is applicable to our context and what isn't,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University.

A key difference between the U.S. and Denmark that Kennedy and other U.S. health officials seem to avoid is that the European country has a national health care system that covers everyone for free while the U.S. does not.

“Denmark or other places have universal health coverage where people don't fall into health care gaps like they do in the United States. The reality of our health system is that people fall into the gaps,” Nuzzo says.

In the U.S., a change to the vaccine schedule would also affect who would be able to get a vaccine. Whatever the CDC recommends influences what private health insurers will cover and what federal programs, such as the Vaccines for Children program, will subsidize.

“When changes are made to the schedule, it will have consequences for who is able to get vaccines, whether or not you want them,” Nuzzo says. “This isn't about allowing you to opt out. This is about making it harder for you to opt in.”

The plan may yet change, according to CNN. The Department of Health and Human Services had scheduled a press conference about children's health on Friday but has since pushed the announcement back until next year.

If these further changes come to pass, they will chip away at the collective protection against deadly infectious diseases, Nuzzo says. Individual medical providers and states may step up to preserve access to vaccines, but people could still slip through the cracks of an increasingly patchwork public health system.

“We have to make public health recommendations that work for all. There are clearly people who can't spend a bulk of their time trying to find the credible sources of information,” Nuzzo says. “I'm worried about people who just won't get the lifesaving protection that they need.”

Predicting changes in protein thermostability caused by amino acid substitutions is essential for understanding human diseases and engineering proteins for practical applications. While recent protein generative models demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance in predicting various protein properties without task-specific training, their strong unsupervised prediction ability remains underexploited to improve protein stability prediction. We present SPURS, a deep learning framework that rewires and integrates two complementary protein generative models–a protein language model and an inverse folding model–and reprograms this unified framework for stability prediction through supervised fine-tuning on mega-scale thermostability data. SPURS delivers accurate, efficient, and scalable stability predictions and generalizes to unseen proteins and mutations. Beyond stability prediction, SPURS enables broad applications in protein informatics, including zero-shot identification of functional residues, improved low-N protein fitness prediction, and systematic dissection of stability-pathogenicity for human diseases. Together, these capabilities establish SPURS as a versatile tool for advancing protein stability prediction and protein engineering at scale.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture added a page to the space history books today by sending the first wheelchair user into space.

“It was the coolest experience,” said  Michaela “Michi” Benthaus, a German-born aerospace and mechatronics engineer at the European Space Agency who sustained a spinal cord injury in a mountain biking accident in 2018.

Blue Origin's suborbital New Shepard rocket ship lifted off from the company's Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:15 a.m. CT (6:15 a.m. PT). 

An initial launch attempt had been called off on Thursday because the flight team “observed an issue with our built-in checks prior to flight,” Blue Origin said. It didn't provide further details about the issue, but today's countdown went off without a hitch.

This was the 37th New Shepard mission, and the 16th to carry humans on a brief ride above the 100-kilometer (62-mile) altitude level that marks the internationally accepted boundary of space. Eighty-six people, including Bezos himself, have now flown on New Shepard. Six have gone multiple times.

Benthaus was one of six crew members on today's mission, known as NS-37. In a 2023 interview published by the Technical University of Munich, she said she set her mind on becoming an astronaut when she was 10 years old.

When Benthaus lost the use of her legs, she initially thought her flight into space “was never going to happen.” But in 2022, her hopes got a big boost when she experienced a zero-G flight arranged through AstroAccess, a project that's dedicated to paving the way for spacefliers with disabilities. Last year, she was the commander of an analog space mission conducted at the Lunares Research Station in Poland. 

Now the 33-year-old has blazed a new trail for space access. “You should never give up on your dreams,” she said after today's flight.

Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said in a post to the X social-media platform that the mission marked “another step toward making spaceflight accessible for everyone.” Phil Joyce, Blue Origin's senior vice president for the New Shepard program, said in a mission recap that “Michi's flight is particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone, and we are proud to help her achieve this dream.”  

Kent, Wash.-based Blue Origin has been working for several years to improve accessibility at its launch facility in Texas — for example, by adding an elevator to the seven-story launch tower. A business resource group named New Hawking, in honor of the late wheelchair-using physicist Stephen Hawking, helped lead the way. Blue Origin says it has previously flown people who are hard of hearing, have limited mobility or limb differences, have low vision or are legally blind.

Blue Origin didn't need to make significant modifications in the New Shepard crew capsule for today's flight. But launch commentator Joel Eby said the mission team made “a few ground system improvements,” such as providing a bench that Benthaus could use to get into and out of the capsule with assistance from others.

During their 10-minute flight, Benthaus and the rest of the crew rose to an altitude of 105.5 kilometers (65.6 miles). They experienced a few minutes of zero-gravity and views of a curving Earth against the blackness of space. At the end of the mission, the booster made an autonomous landing not far from the launch pad, while the crew capsule descended to a parachute-assisted touchdown in the West Texas desert.

Afterward, Benthaus said she enjoyed the ride. “I tried to turn upside-down,” she said. 

Benthaus' crewmates included:

In addition to the crew, NS-37 carried more than 20,000 postcards submitted by students and others through a program organized by the Club for the Future, Blue Origin's nonprofit educational foundation. The featured partners for this latest batch of postcards were UNIQLO, Arm & Hammer Baking Soda Rocket Day and Give Kids the World Village.

Blue Origin typically doesn't reveal how much people pay to take trips on New Shepard. In some cases, crew members have flown as invited guests. On the other end of the spectrum, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun paid $28 million for a ticket in a widely publicized auction.

The suborbital space program's previous milestones include flying the world's oldest spaceflier (former test pilot Ed Dwight, who was 90 when he rode on New Shepard last year); the world's youngest spaceflier (Oliver Daemen, who was 18 when he flew with Bezos and two others in 2021). and the first married couple to reach the final frontier together on a commercial spaceship (Marc and Sharon Hagle in 2022).

Update for 8:40 a.m. PT: NASA's new administrator, Jared Isaacman, congratulated Blue Origin and the NS-37 crew, with special shout-outs for Koenigsmann and Benthaus:

Congrats to the Blue Origin team and the NS-37 crew–including @HansKoenigsmann one of the great engineers of this new era. His work enabled so many to reach space–I am glad he finally made the journey himself. pic.twitter.com/hgtKRSZpPq

Congratulations, Michi! You just inspired millions to look up and imagine what is possible 🚀 https://t.co/RMHa54o6Xh

Like most tech leaders, I've spent the last year swimming in the hype: AI will replace developers. Anyone can build an app with AI. Shipping products should take weeks, not months.

The pressure to use AI to rapidly ship products and features is real. I've lost track of how many times I've been asked something to the effect of, “Can't you just build it with AI?” But the reality on the ground is much different.

AI isn't replacing engineers. It's replacing slow engineering.

At Replify, we've built our product with a small team of exceptional full-stack engineers using AI as their copilot. It has transformed how we plan, design, architect, and build, but it's all far more nuanced than the narrative suggests.

It can turn some unacceptable timelines into a same-day release. One of our engineers estimated a change to our voice AI orchestrator would take three days. I sanity-checked the idea with ChatGPT, had it generate a Cursor prompt, and Cursor implemented the change correctly on the first try. We shipped the whole thing in one hour: defined, coded, reviewed, tested, and deployed.

Getting it right on the first try is rare, but that kind of speed is now often possible.

It's better than humans at repo-wide, difficult debugging. We had a tricky user-reported bug that one of our developers spent two days chasing. With one poorly written prompt, Cursor found the culprit in minutes and generated the fix. We pushed a hot fix to prod in under 30 minutes.

Architecture decisions are faster and better. What used to take months and endless meetings in enterprise environments now takes a few focused hours. We'll dump ramblings of business requirements into an LLM, ask it to stress-test ideas, co-write the documentation, and iterate through architectural options with pros, cons, and failure points. It surfaces scenarios and ideas instantly that we didn't think of and produces clean artifacts for the team.

The judgment and most ideas are still ours, but the speed and completeness of the thinking is on a completely different level.

Good-enough UI and documentation come for free. When you don't need a design award, AI can generate a good, clean use interface quickly. Same with documentation: rambling notes in, polished documentation out.

Prototype speed is now a commodity. In early days, AI lets you get to “something that works” shockingly fast. Technology is rarely the competitive moat anymore, it's having things like distribution, customers, and operational excellence.

It confidently gives wrong answers. We spent an entire day trying to get ChatGPT and Gemini to solve complex AWS Amplify redirect needs. Both insisted they had the solution. Both were absolutely wrong. Reading the docs and solving “the old-fashioned way” took two hours and revealed the LLMs' approaches weren't even possible.

Two wasted engineers, one lost day.

You still need to prompt carefully and review everything. AI is spectacular at introducing subtle regressions if you're not explicit about constraints and testing. It will also rewrite perfectly fine code if you tell it something is broken (and you're wrong).

It accelerates good engineering judgment. It also accelerates bad direction.

Infra, security, and scaling require real expertise. Models can talk about architecture and infrastructure, but coding assistants still struggle to produce secure, scalable infrastructure-as-code. They don't always see downstream consequences like cost spikes or exposure risks without a knowledgeable prompter. 

Experts still determine the best robust solution.

Speed shifts the bottlenecks. Engineering moves faster with AI, so product, UI/UX, architecture, QA, and release must move faster, too. 

One bonus non-AI win helping us here: Loom videos for instant ticket creation (as opposed to laborious requirement documentation) result in faster handoffs, fewer misunderstandings, more accurate output, and better async velocity.

AI isn't replacing engineers. It's replacing slow feedback loops, tedious work, and barriers to execution.

We're not living in a world where AI writes, deploys, and scales your entire product (yet). But we are living in a world where a three-person team can compete with a 30-person team — if they know how to wield AI well.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Valve just announced that it will discontinue the $399 256GB LCD Steam Deck, making the most affordable option the $549 512GB OLED model. You can see the announcement when you visit the Steam Deck page on Steam, with the company adding a simple note underneath the Choose Your Steam Deck section.

Valve says, “We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.” With the purchase button under the LCD model grayed out and marked as “Out of stock,” it's safe to say that we'd no longer be able to purchase the best budget handheld gaming PC of 2025 brand new, although there's still a chance that you can score a refurbished version down the road.

 




The company did not explain why it's ending the production of one of its most popular Steam Deck models, so we can only guess as to why they're doing that. One plausible theory is that the 256GB model is no longer profitable due to the ongoing RAM crisis. A Kingston rep said NAND prices for kits have more than tripled since the start of the year, forcing memory module manufacturers to raise prices as their costs rise. More than that, the problem is expected to get worse in 2026, as memory chip makers hedge their bets against an AI bubble.

Others say that the company is clearing up inventory in preparation for new products. Valve just announced the new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and Steam Frame 3D headset. However, these are totally different device categories, so it's unlikely that their manufacturing lines would've affected Steam Deck production. It's also doubtful that Valve is preparing for a second-generation handheld gaming console, especially since it previously said it won't release a new model unless chipmakers have introduced chips with significant architectural improvements.

The discontinuation of the $399 Steam Deck is a disaster for budget gamers, especially as it's one of the most affordable mainstream handheld consoles available on the market. A quick look around for competing consoles shows that the base Asus ROG Ally starts at $489.99 at Best Buy, while the entry-level Lenovo Legion Go S is priced at $589.99 on Amazon. So, if you want to get a Steam Deck for Christmas, you have no choice but to shell out an extra $150 for the OLED model.

China has brought online a national experimental research network designed to support experimentation on future network designs and to improve data transmission quality, with early demonstrations centered on extreme data movement and tightly controlled traffic behavior. The China Environment for Network Innovation, or CENI, was formally switched on this week, according to Chinese state media, transferring 72TB over 1,000 kilometers.

The network's most notable result comes from a long-distance transfer test linked to the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou province. In that trial, researchers moved 72 terabytes of data to Hubei province in about 1.6 hours across a route of roughly 1,000 kilometers. Based on the published figures, that roughly works out to a throughput close to 100 Gbps. Chinese outlets contrasted this with conventional internet transfers, claiming the same dataset would take nearly 2 years to transfer over typical public network paths.

CENI has been built in response to the demands of data-heavy scientific facilities and distributed compute workloads. FAST alone is said to generate around 100 terabytes of data per day, volumes that strain shared, best-effort wide-area networks.

The network reportedly spans more than 40 cities and more than 55,000 kilometers of optical fiber, and the underlying platform is built to host thousands of parallel virtual networks, allowing researchers to run isolated experiments on top of shared physical infrastructure. Information from various sources indicates support for more than 4,000 concurrent test services, multiple cloud data centers, and dozens of edge nodes connected via dense wavelength-division multiplexing at 100 Gbps per channel.

Beyond throughput, CENI's designers emphasize deterministic networking as a core goal. Deterministic networks aim to guarantee latency, jitter, and packet delivery characteristics across long distances, properties that are difficult to maintain on the public Internet. Chinese researcher Bingqing Wu of the Jiangsu Future Network Innovation Institute has compared CENI to earlier national research networks such as ARPANET in the United States, which were used to complete much of the formative work that led to the early Internet.

While CENI's claims rest on controlled demonstrations, it's clear that this project is taking place on a massive scale, with 100 Gbps transfers, thousands of virtualized networks, and a footprint spanning much of the country. China is committing significant resources to exploring how future networks might support data-intensive science and AI workloads at a national level.

So /live is some kind of a redirect to whatever other stream source. My guess is that whoever was meant to post the latest stream had this guy's URL in his clipboard history. Oops! Hard to see it being hacking - there are way more "interesting" things to do if you have the keys to whitehouse.gov - and it's not really a big deal, except for the poor schmuck who was watching personal finance videos at work, and maybe to the guy who just found out he has a fan in the Whitehouse. Hope neither of them gets too much federal law enforcement attention.

Der8nechtable brings active PCB and convenience to extreme benchmarking and hardware reviewing

A few months back, you may have read news from Thermal Grizzly about a unique collaboration to create a professional-grade test bench, dubbed Der8enchtable, with an open design and an integrated PCB. The brainchild of overclocking legend Roman “der8auer” Hartung and ElmorLabs (Jon “elmor” Sandstrom) was first unveiled at Computex 2025, where it promptly earned a design award. The unique benchtable features an active PCB that adds functionality beyond a simple benching stand. Initially designed for internal use, the project matured into a full-on commercial venture for overclockers, reviewers, content creators, and hardware testers who frequently swap components. And moving forward, this is where we'll test all the motherboards we review.

The Thermal Grizzly Der8enchtable, priced at $269.99 on Amazon, is clearly a premium product, offering far more than a basic stand for a motherboard and peripherals. What sets it apart is its active PCB, which simplifies hardware testing by providing extensive connectivity: 11 four-pin fan headers across four independently controllable zones (including one for an AIO/pump), two SATA ports, four MicroSD card slots for storage, and six USB ports (four Type-A and two Type-C).

Additional features include the ability to mount radiators on the side and a space underneath to tuck away the power supply. Wire management is made easy with included velcro strips that utilize cutouts in the PCB/plexi. Finally, integrated RGBs in the plexi layer add a touch of flair. While it may not be as visually appealing as our previous benching table, its design is highly functional, streamlining component swapping and testing.

Included in the multi-layered box is everything you need to set up the benching table. From the legs and brackets to screws and cables, it's in the box, along with instructions for putting it all together. You get loads of screws to attach the parts, and the tools (Allen keys, 2/2.5/3mm) that fit them.

 




The der8enchtable PCB supports E-ATX, MicroATX, and Mini-ITX motherboards — just move the standoffs to the correct locations for the board. The PCB is matte-black, while the labels and branding are all white and easy to read (for small writing on a PCB anyway). The RGBs glow bright and, when attached to the motherboard with the included cable, can be controlled by the motherboard software. Again, it's not really meant to be artful; it is functional, but it's a clean-looking bench table, especially if you use the velcro wire loops to wrangle the loose wires.

Below, we'll take a quick look at the ports on the board, starting on the top half and left edge. Here we have a few USB ports: two Type-A and two Type-C. Speeds will be slow because all the data travels over the USB 2.0 connection, but when you're benchmarking or testing hardware, that's typically not a concern, as it's just peripherals, or you're saving small files.

 




On top is the first (of three) fan zones, each with three 4-pin fan headers and a switch to control them. The three-way switch offers external control (via the EXT FAN header off to the right, which connects to the motherboard), 50% and 100% settings, which can help achieve consistent test results. Next to that is the 3-pin ARGB header that routes to the motherboard. Finally, in the upper-right corner is the 6-pin PCIe connector for powering the board (fans, USB, etc.).

Down the right edge is another fan zone and two 4-pin pump headers. The only difference between these two is that the pump headers support 3A/36W each and have their own fuse. Below that are two more USB Type-A headers.

Continuing along the bottom-right edge are the two SATA port INPUTS, preconfigured for 2.5-inch SSDs and wired to the onboard SATA ports. The PCB also provides four microSD card slots, which are cost-effective alternatives to SSDs when considering price per gigabyte.

 




Along the bottom edge, starting on the right, is a small area for the power and reset buttons and their corresponding connections to the motherboard. If whatever you're testing doesn't have integrated power/reset buttons, connect the front panel power/reset headers here and voila, you now have buttons! To the left is the 9-pin USB 2.0 header used for benchtable-to-motherboard communications. Next to that is the third fan zone and the last of the ports and headers. We've listed all of them below.

The Thermal Grizzly Der8enchtable is an impressive improvement over standard benching tables. Its standout features—including an active PCB, peripheral attachment points, and manual fan/pump header control—offer significant advantages for testers. These additions make adjustments easier and yield more consistent test results. Furthermore, the integrated RGB lighting adds a bright aesthetic flair to the device, making it more than just a benching table.

As a motherboard reviewer (see my list of best motherboards and best motherboard deals), I have a couple of minor critiques of the benchtable. First, I would appreciate an option for M.2 connectivity directly on the benching table. While I acknowledge the difficulties with connecting PCIe and the fact that the speed isn't strictly necessary for benchmarking (and can introduce instability compared to SATA), having an M.2 mount would still be a beneficial feature for hardware reviewers and testers.

My second minor concern relates to the benchtable's legs. They are generally fine, but the setup becomes slightly unbalanced and prone to tipping when a large AIO cooler, such as our Arctic Freezer II 420 (non-RGB), is used. Some extra weight on the opposite side, or shifting the PSU mounting location in that direction, would provide additional stability in this use case. Otherwise, it's not a concern when using a smaller AIO, and it's perfectly stable.

The Thermal Grizzly Der8enchtable is an elevated take on the standard test bench, incorporating features that make it ideal for extreme overclockers using sub-ambient cooling, hardware reviewers, or anyone seeking a distinctive open-air PC setup. While its $269.99 price tag is steep, it offers significantly more value than competing benching tables (if you can use the features)—and is exponentially more useful that the motherboard's cardboard box.

From streamlined peripheral connections to integrated RGB lighting, the Der8enchtable excels for hardware testing and intense sub-ambient overclocking. However, those simply looking to showcase their PC may find more aesthetically pleasing, lower-cost alternatives if they don't require all the advanced features contributing to the price.

But there are a few catches.

AMD this week released a document titled "Performance Monitor Counters for AMD Family 1Ah Model 50h-57h Processors" (discovered by InstLatX64) that reveals numerous architectural details of AMD's Zen 6-based CPUs, including the EPYC 'Venice' processor for data centers, through performance monitoring interfaces. As it turns out, Zen 6 is not exactly an evolution of Zen 5, but rather an all-new design with a different ideology.

AMD has been talking about its Zen 6-based CPUs in very general terms for quite a while, revealing that they will feature up to 256 cores and be made using TSMC's 2nm-class process technology. This week's PMC document for software developers states that the Zen 6 microarchitecture is no longer an incremental evolution of Zen 4/Zen 5, but a deliberately wide, throughput-oriented design with an eight-slot dispatch engine and simultaneous multi-threading (SMT).

In such a design, two hardware threads dynamically contend for a shared pool of dispatch slots, so, at the same clock speeds, the single-thread performance of Zen 6-based processors may not be as high as that of Apple's 9-wide (or wider) CPUs in all situations. However, in some instances, this type of architecture promises very high performance. Furthermore, the core has dedicated counters for unused dispatch slots, backend stalls, and thread-selection losses, which confirms that wide issue and SMT arbitration are the factors AMD is betting on with Zen 6.

Zen 6 also substantially expands AMD's visibility into vector and floating-point execution, underscoring the architecture's emphasis on dense-math workloads. According to PMC documentation, Zen 6 processors support full-width AVX-512 execution with FP64, FP32, FP16, and BF16 data formats, including FMA/MAC operations and mixed FP-INT vector execution (including VNNI-class, AES, and SHA operations). Furthermore, it delivers sustained 512-bit throughput high enough to require merged performance counters for accurate measurement. This is hardly proof that Zen 6-based CPUs will be AVX-512 performance champions, but it does show that Zen 6 can retire enough vector work per cycle to overwhelm legacy measurement methods.

In general, Zen 6's performance-focused capabilities suggest it is AMD's first microarchitecture designed from the ground up for data center use cases. It remains to be seen which features will be retained in client offerings and how well these perform. But based on what we can observe today, Zen 6-based CPUs will be number-crunching monsters.

Thrift stores continue to produce surprising hardware finds.

A Reddit user managed to get their hands on an Nvidia GTX 1660 Super for just $8.40 at their local Goodwill thrift store. According to u\Lucky_Mess4798, the card is in working condition and, based on the shared photo, appears to be an MSI-branded model. A respectable 1080p gaming GPU for its time, the GTX 1660 Super typically sells for $50 to $100 on used marketplaces, making this purchase stand out as a rare find.

Released back in October 2019, the GeForce GTX 1660 Super featured Nvidia's Turing architecture. With a launch price of $229, one of the highlight features of the GTX 1660 Super was the faster GDDR6 memory compared to GDDR5 on the non-Super GTX 1660, which offered a boost in bandwidth and overall performance.

Sadly, it lacked any dedicated hardware for ray tracing or DLSS, thus making it one of the last GPUs before the RTX series went mainstream. The GPU is still quite capable, as it can handle popular eSports games and certain older titles with some minor tweaking (like FSR) required for demanding games due to its limited 6GB VRAM. While the GTX 1660 Super may not be as powerful as some of the more recent offerings, getting it for just $8.40 still makes it a great deal.

We often hear about Reddit users sharing stories about finding cheap computer hardware at clearance sales, thrift stores, or pawn shops. In one such case from earlier this year, a user managed to purchase an RTX 3060 12GB for only $4.99, which makes it even better than the GTX 1660 Super deal. The used GPU was reportedly purchased from a Red White & Blue Thrift Store, and worked without any issues.

However, some bargains don't turn out as expected. In another incident, a shopper managed to purchase a GeForce GTX 1060 for only $5 during a Black Friday sale, only to discover after opening the box that it contained an older GTX 560 Ti instead. The mix-up is a reminder that while thrift stores and clearance sales might lead to some incredible deals, it's always recommended to double-check what's actually inside the box before leaving the store.

Cancel any outdoor plans for next year because LG is dropping a flagship RGB LED TV in 2026. The new MRGB95B TV will use an upgraded processor and a brighter panel, and it will achieve 100 percent coverage of BT.2020, DCI-P3, and Adobe RGB color gamuts. Translation: insanely accurate color. The most exciting part of this new model is that it will come in more “everyday” screen sizes than one might expect, ranging from a massive 100 inches to a more normal modern size of 75 inches, meaning consumers might actually buy this for their posh new living room.

RGB LEDs allow for brighter displays with more accurate color, not to be confused with micro LED displays, where each pixel is its own self-emmisive LED. RGB LED uses clusters of red, green, and blue that illuminate multiple pixels at once. It's the next step in color accuracy in TV displays, following the quantum dot displays that have been popular for several years. —Parker Hall

Samsung is also getting in on the new technology, with Micro RGB TVs that will range in sizes from 55 to 115 inches in 2026. The new models represent the smallest RGB LED screen sizes we have seen from any brand so far (though we expect competition from more affordable RGB players like Hisense and TCL to come).

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

Just like LG, Samsung is announcing a next-generation, heavily AI-optimized chipset for its new TV, and Samsung also claims it hits 100 percent of BT.2020, which again should mean jaw-droppingly accurate color. We'll have to get eyes on it to tell you which brand does it better, but it'll be exciting to see the next generation of TV tech finally hit store shelves in 2026. Let the South Korean brand battle commence. —Parker Hall

It wasn't long ago that Google completely redid its device tracking app to align much more closely with Apple's Find My. Now, the next step is introducing it on even more platforms. The company brought its Find Hub app to Wear OS this week, allowing anyone running a Wear OS smartwatch to launch the app and see where their devices were last seen.

This isn't some half-baked version: you can track your device via Google Maps straight from the watch, play a sound to ping its location, secure the device, and even factory reset it. You'll just really need a cellular version of the smartwatch to make the most of this capability, especially if your phone is lost.

A memory shortage is looming on the horizon in 2026, and we're all bracing for impact as to how wide-ranging the effects will be. The pricing of some of the best graphics cards, for example, has remained stable so far. But will it last? A new report indicates this global memory crunch could affect Nvidia's supply of graphics cards in 2026. A rumor posted by Taiwanese tech site Benchlife claims that Nvidia will be reducing its current-gen, RTX 50-series graphics cards by up to 40 percent in the first half of next year. That reduction was based on a direct comparison to the available supply of Nvidia GPUs in the first half of 2025.

While I wouldn't chalk this up to more than a rumor at this point, it feels increasingly probable given the circumstances. Nvidia was originally rumored to launch the mid-generational refresh to the RTX 50-series (typically known as the "Super" line) in early 2026, but the latest reports say that late 2026 is now more likely.

That reduction in supply could just be a natural way of following the market as RAM and SSD prices continue to skyrocket, but it could also be an effect of the memory shortage hitting consumer graphics cards. While Nvidia has stated in the past that it avoided price hikes in the past, that doesn't mean availability and street pricing will manage to stay grounded.

Another report indicates that Nvidia will be leaving third-party partners like Asus and MSI to source their own VRAM, which was previously delivered as a package. These are all signs that the memory shortage could affect pricing and availability in the future.

But here's the good news: GPU pricing and availability right now are really solid. There are a lot of great, current-gen Nvidia graphics cards out there that can be purchased at retail, and most have dropped in price since the summer. (YouTube channel GamersNexus put together a helpful video rundown of price changes in the past six months, if you're interested. As with the current situation for laptops, now appears to be the calm before the storm. —Luke Larsen

Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor.

In since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student's digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.

Fast Company republished two of Maguire's deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter was later published supporting Maguire.

The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia's new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire's social media activity. Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia's inaction on Maguire's anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire's behavior during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners' right to “free speech.”

“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky' people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk's companies, managing Sequoia's investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.

However, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire's outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.

Lin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire's conduct since taking over leadership.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire's firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.”

TechCrunch has reached out to Sequoia for comment.

Resolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.

The headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company's actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.

The startup's annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn't be learned. 

Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn't respond to our request for comment.

Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk's former chief architect for observability. The duo's partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn't their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.

While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.

The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.

Last October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.

Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.

The United States Department of Justice on Friday published the first of an unknown number of releases of documents related to infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The nearly 4,000 files contain a hodgepodge of photos, handwritten notes, and more. What they do not contain are any clear revelations about who else may be criminally implicated in Epstein's abuse network.

Released in four volumes, the 3,951 documents the DOJ included in Friday's release represent only a fraction of the files the department is required to release under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Democratic lawmakers scolded the DOJ for withholding large portions of its archive, accusing the department of failing to comply with the law's disclosure mandate.

The documents the Justice Department did release contain hundreds of images of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his onetime girlfriend and convicted accomplice in a yearslong sex trafficking operation, along with other associates, celebrities, and politicians. Despite long-standing scrutiny of Donald Trump's social ties to Epstein, the president appears only sporadically in the initial release of material—for instance, in a framed photo on top of a dresser showing him and Melania Trump with Epstein.

It is currently unclear when the DOJ will release additional documents or what will be included in any subsequent releases. CNN has reported on frustrations within the DOJ over the allegedly vague guidance lawyers responsible for redacting the material were given, while Fox News has reported that the same standards used to protect victims were applied to “politically exposed individuals and government officials.” For now, here's a rundown of what you'll find in the DOJ's December 19 trove.

The first batch of documents the DOJ released contains 3,158 images of the inside of Epstein's Manhattan townhouse and Virgin Islands compound. These include several photographs of a painting of Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress and red high heels mounted next to a framed, handwritten letter, the author of which can't be made out. There are also dozens of photos of Epstein with women and, in at least two cases, what appear to be babies; their faces are redacted.

One photo is of a binder marked Black Family Trustee Meeting November 21, 2014; another appears to be of a Bank of America statement from 2011 for an account purportedly bearing the names of financier Leon Black as well as his wife Debra Black and a former employee. (Another set of images shows a note signed by a person with the same first name as the former employee along with a ledger of expenses from late 2011 into early 2012.) Other noteworthy documentation relates to Epstein's placement on a sex offenders registry and a 2019 note from the acting US attorney for the US Virgin Islands informing him that he would need to comply with certain travel restrictions despite previous “provisions.”

The redactions are inconsistent. In a handwritten note to Epstein, a signature is redacted, while in another image of that same note, the name “Kathe” is visible. A calligraphed note, seemingly written by a young woman and thanking Epstein for taking her and her sister on several “adventures,” has the signature redacted, but an envelope in a similar hand bears the name of the sender.

Much of the imagery is familiar from previous releases, and includes things like a photo of a stuffed tiger, a photo of a framed Times of London cover of Princess Diana placed at the back of a closet, photos of the many paintings of nude women in Epstein's townhouse, and framed photos of Epstein associates like Trump and Woody Allen.

The second volume contains 574 photos and one four-second video. Many of the photos feature Epstein and Maxwell in various locations. Several celebrities and politicians also appear in the photos, including actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, singer Michael Jackson, and Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards—none of whom appear in suspicious or compromising positions.

However, Bill Clinton appears multiple times in the second batch of images. In one photo, he is shirtless in a pool with a woman whose identity has been redacted; a photo that appears to have been taken at the same location shows Clinton and Maxwell in the pool. Clinton also appears in multiple photos with women whose identities have been redacted.

Clinton took four trips with Epstein in 2002 and 2003, including a humanitarian trip to Africa and London. During a portion of that trip, he was accompanied by Tucker and Spacey, according to The New York Times.

(Clinton spokesperson Angel Ureña released a statement reading, in part, “They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton.”)

Dozens of photos feature Jean-Luc Brunel, a modeling agent and close friend of Epstein's. The photos show Brunel with Epstein and Maxwell in multiple locations, as well as aboard what appears to be Epstein's infamous private jet. In several images, Maxwell is seen massaging Brunel's feet and sticking one foot between her breasts.

Brunel was arrested by French authorities in 2020 as part of a sex trafficking and sexual assault investigation into Epstein, and charged with rape of minors over 15 and sexual harassment. Brunel denied any wrongdoing. In 2022, Brunel was found dead, hanged in his jail cell.

The third volume contains several hundred photos. One of those, which appears to have been framed, shows a man who appears to be Prince Andrew posing on his side on the laps of at least four women, whose faces are all redacted. A smiling Maxwell, and a woman whose face is redacted, stand in the background.

Many of the photos, however, may have been printed out as they appeared in digital storage, since the individual photo names, the file extensions, and album names are all visible. Many images with those markers include Clinton, and several were seemingly taken on a group vacation to Thailand that Clinton is alleged to have taken with Epstein and Maxwell. Clinton also joined the couple for at least one leg of a multiple-destination vacation that stopped in China, Paris, and Stockholm, another that stopped in New York, Los Angeles, and London, another trip to Africa and London, and another trip to Morocco. In one photo, Clinton is shown with a woman, whose face is redacted, sitting on Clinton's lap.

Many photos show the faces of individuals that are unredacted but not clearly discernible, and several appear to have been taken on one of Epstein's group vacations with Clinton.

Several of the photos were attached to written notes from an interview with a woman who described being assaulted by Epstein several times when she was a minor, and who seemingly provided those photos to investigators. One photo shows a middle-aged man, whose face is redacted in some but not all photos, on a trip to what a woman told investigators was Disney World with Epstein and a young child. In one of the photos, the two men pose with the young child and an actor dressed as Piglet. The woman told investigators that she didn't know who the man was, but that she had taken the photos.

One PDF shows what appears to be a scrapbook commemorating an anniversary of some kind in September 2007. The scrapbook features Epstein posing in several photos with a woman whose face is redacted. The first page includes several photos of a girl or young woman and handwritten text reading, “Once upon a time… …there was a clueless little girl…” The second page shows cut-out photos arranged so that it looks as if Epstein is ogling the young woman adjusting her athletic wear. Consequent pages seem to convey that the girl eventually began traveling around the world with Epstein to at least four countries and territories, and spent at least one Christmas with him. A few pages show Epstein smiling with a clay or mud mask on his face, alongside jokes about fighting and later making amends.

Throughout the files, law enforcement included blue papers claiming that one or several photos were not scanned because they contained what investigators labeled as child sexual abuse material (CSAM). However, several of the photos that were ultimately scanned include individuals who are either nude or slightly clothed, with certain portions of the images redacted. Other photos appear to show physical objects that were cataloged by investigators, including sex toys and the DVD cases of commercial pornographic videos.

A fourth batch of records contains a mix of evidence inventories, retail records, and heavily redacted notes detailing what authorities collected during the investigation. They show that police logged and photographed numerous physical items from Epstein's Palm Beach residence, including a green massage table, framed photographs, and multiple adult novelty products such as vibrators and “sexy” soaps. Retail receipts document purchases from adult video stores, while Amazon order confirmations show shipments of BDSM-themed books, with titles focused on sexual dominance, submission, and erotic “training.”

The same batch also underscores the scope of evidence that exists but remains unreleased. Numerous entries are marked “ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED,” covering VHS tapes, microcassettes, MiniDV tapes, CDs, and DVDs, with some labeled as interviews, statements, voicemail messages, and other digital recordings. Other documents explicitly note the existence of what investigators say is CSAM within the case files, flagged but withheld from release.

Another document contains an early complaint alleging that Epstein possessed photographs of nude minors taken by a woman—who described them as artistic works—after she reported that he obtained the images and their negatives without her consent. The allegation, an apparent reference to a 1996 complaint famously ignored by the FBI, is presented as an unadjudicated claim documented during the initial stages of the investigation.

The batch also includes travel-related records ranging from commercial itineraries and hotel bookings to logs of repeated private-jet movements between hubs such as Teterboro, Palm Beach, and the US Virgin Islands, with recorded stops in France, Morocco, and Canada. Separate entries document international crossings through New York airports to destinations including Istanbul, Rome, Sao Paulo, Lisbon, Tel Aviv, Copenhagen, and Cancun, without identifying companions or purpose. The travel records in the documents appear to span September 2005 through 2018.

WIRED is continuing to review the newly released records and will report further findings as additional material is examined and verified.

Diego Coppola fears his dream of playing in the 2026 World Cup for Italy will be over unless he gets more game time with Brighton & Hove Albion.

The 21-year-old central defender made his first league start for the club alongside fellow summer signing Olivier Boscagli in the 0-0 home draw against Sunderland, with first choice pairing Lewis Dunk and Jan Paul van Hecke ruled out by suspension and illness respectively.

Coppola was called into Italy's senior squad for two appearances earlier this year as they chase qualification for next summer's tournament via the European play-offs in March.

“A dream for every footballer is to play in the World Cup,” said Coppola, who had been limited to 17 minutes of league action as a substitute since joining Brighton from Hellas Verona in the summer.

“I know that if I don't get many minutes I won't be in the Italy squad if we qualify. Of course, I want to also help the team here, but you don't get the chance to play in a World Cup every year. The next one will be in four years. A lot of things can happen. I could be a starter in some big teams, or I could be a non-starter in a bad team with all due respect, so I don't know, we'll see.”

Coppola has been linked by local media with interest from several clubs in Italy in the upcoming January transfer window. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said during his press conference on Friday that he wants to keep his squad intact.

Asked about the possibility of a January move, Coppola said: “I don't know yet. The club knows what is best for me. I like Brighton, the team, everything, the staff, the team-mates. I like being here, but with the World Cup coming I want to improve more by playing games.”

Dunk and Van Hecke are likely to return for Brighton's next game away to league leaders Arsenal on December 27.

The White House demanded Trump's made-up FIFA peace prize be as big as the actual World Cup trophy.

When FIFA president Gianni Infantino invented a "peace prize" to give Donald Trump after he lost out on the Nobel, the White House had specifications.

According to The Times of London, as reported by The Daily Beast, the top demand was that the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize trophy be at least as large as the actual FIFA World Cup Trophy, which stands 14.5 inches tall and is made of 18-karat solid gold. The White House also requested that two soldiers flank Trump as he received the hardware, though that didn't happen — Marines brought out the gifts instead.

The prize, which FIFA announced on November 5 (conveniently after Trump missed the Nobel), was presented at the World Cup 2026 draw on December 5. Trump and FIFA pretended not to know beforehand who would receive it, though reporting indicates Trump coordinated with FIFA to give himself the honor.

Trump received a trophy, a medal, and a certificate for his contributions to "world peace." The actual Nobel Peace Prize recipient only gets a medal.

The cozy relationship between Trump and Infantino has drawn scrutiny. FIFA set up a new office in Trump Tower in July. When FIFA Club World Cup champions Chelsea needed to hoist their trophy, they had to use a replica because Trump was using the real one as Oval Office décor after Infantino gave it to him in March.

A FIFA watchdog has opened an ethics probe, with advocacy group FairSquare alleging Infantino committed "repeated breaches" of FIFA's obligation to political neutrality.

After breaking down the first half of our rankings of the best group stage matches at the 2026 World Cup, the stakes only rise. The remaining five matches feature global superstars, historic rematches, and group-defining showdowns that could shape the entire knockout bracket. These are the games that will define the group stage of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Here are the top five most anticipated group stage matches.

France enter the tournament as joint favorites to lift the World Cup, a trophy they last claimed in 2018. Their final group stage match in Boston brings a collision of European star power, headlined by two players who both lay claim to being the world's best striker.

France's Kylian Mbappé of Real Madrid and Norway's Erling Haaland of Manchester City score at extraordinary rates for both club and country, regularly overwhelming even elite defenders. The odds of both finding the net in this matchup feel high, especially with quality surrounding them. Bayern Munich's Michael Olise and Barcelona defender Jules Koundé add further depth to France's attacking and defensive balance.

Norway's World Cup history is modest, but this squad is their best ever, and it's brimming with confidence. Arsenal captain Martin Ødegaard and Atlético Madrid striker Alexander Sørloth anchor a supporting cast for Haaland capable of punishing complacency. Historically, France hold a narrow 7-4-5 edge over Norway, though the nations have not met anytime recently. If France switch off, Norway have the tools to make them pay.

England's 6-2-3 all-time record against Croatia comes with a painful footnote. The most important meeting between these sides remains the 2018 World Cup semifinal in Moscow, where Mario Mandžukić's extra-time goal sent Croatia to the final and left England wondering what might have been.



England's current generation remains loaded with talent. Harry Kane, now 32 and still scoring freely at Bayern Munich, leads the line, while Declan Rice of Arsenal and Jude Bellingham of Real Madrid form a dominant midfield core. Croatia, however, remain fearless. Veterans Luka Modrić and Ivan Perišić continue to define a side that has reached consecutive World Cup semifinals or better.

England may have the stronger roster on paper, but Croatia's resilience is proven. With Ghana and Panama also in the group, every match in this group, including this one in Dallas will be competitive. This game will be played in front of what is expected to be a heavily pro-England crowd.

The connection between France and Senegal runs deeper than football. Senegal's historic 1–0 victory over France at the 2002 World Cup remains one of the most iconic results in African football history, when Papa Bouba Diop's goal stunned the defending champions who were led by Thierry Henry and other iconic names.



This Senegal side arrives with talent and confidence. Bayern Munich's Nicolas Jackson, Al-Nassr winger Sadio Mané, and Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye headline a roster built to compete physically and tactically. France, opening their tournament as potential favorites, will not underestimate an opponent familiar with many of their players.

Eligibility choices and shared footballing pathways mean this matchup carries added intensity between French speaking nations. Senegal will embrace their underdog status and an opportunity to beat the nation who once colonized them, while Mbappé and France will need to be sharp from the outset in one of the tournament's most emotionally charged fixtures.

Japan were the first nation to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, once again asserting their dominance in AFC qualifying. The Samurai Blue continue to improve with each cycle and now arrive as one of the tournament's most technically skilled sides.

The Netherlands, three-time World Cup finalists, cannot afford an opening slip. While the Dutch boast elite experience through Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong and Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, questions remain about their attacking consistency. Much of the scoring burden falls on Memphis Depay of Corinthians, who has 55 goals in 108 international appearances.

The two nations met at the 2010 World Cup, when Wesley Sneijder's lone goal secured a 1–0 Dutch victory. Japan's current core includes Liverpool's Wataru Endō, Celtic's Daizen Maeda, and AS Monaco's Takumi Minamino. With Tunisia and another European qualifier in the group, this match will set the tone — and a cautious draw would surprise no one.



The hottest ticket of the group stage arrives in Miami, as two World Cup dark horses collide in what will feel like a home match for Colombia. With Uzbekistan and a playoff winner rounding out the group, this final group stage fixture is likely to decide who tops the group.

Colombian support will be immense. Demand for tickets from Colombian fans and their global diaspora has surged, while Portugal remain one of world football's biggest draws. Cristiano Ronaldo's presence still matters, but Portugal are no longer dependent on him alone.

PSG midfielder João Neves has emerged as one of the world's best, Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes remains the creative hub, and AC Milan's Rafael Leão provides a quality attacking threat. Colombia, meanwhile, are chasing their best World Cup run since 2014 when they reached the quarterfinals.

This will be the final World Cup for James Rodríguez, who has 31 goals in 122 caps, now supported by Sporting CP striker Luis Suárez, Bayern Munich winger Luis Díaz, the new face of Colombian football, Benfica midfielder Richard Ríos, and Crystal Palace defender Daniel Muñoz. Many of these Colombian players are familiar with Portugal's league and style of play, and this is a classic tier 1 UEFA vs CONEMBOL clash in the World Cup.

The atmosphere promises to be unforgettable. The Miami metro area is home to more than a quarter million Colombians, and 30% of Colombian Americans live in Florida. Portuguese supporters, largely based in the Northeast, will also travel in force. The stakes may not be fully defined yet, but the battle for bragging rights already is.

Even with an expanded field, the 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage remains rich with quality and consequence. Across both halves of this ranking, these ten matches offer a reminder that the World Cup does not wait for the knockout rounds to deliver drama — it begins the moment the ball is kicked.

Newcastle United were left feeling deeply aggrieved after being denied what many believed was a clear penalty in a pulsating Premier League encounter that ultimately slipped from their grasp against Chelsea. A breathless contest at St. James' Park swung dramatically on a controversial second-half moment, with Anthony Gordon sent sprawling inside the area after contact from Trevoh Chalobah, only for referee and VAR to wave play on.

Determined to make amends for a flat derby showing the previous week, Newcastle exploded out of the blocks and overwhelmed Chelsea during a ferocious first half. Central to their dominance was Nick Woltemade, who seized his moment with ruthless efficiency. The opening goal stemmed from Gordon's sharp pressing, as he robbed Wesley Fofana in midfield and drove Newcastle forward. Jacob Murphy delivered a teasing cross, Gordon's initial effort was superbly repelled by Robert Sanchez, but Woltemade reacted quickest to hammer home the rebound. The second followed soon after and was even more emphatic. Gordon again was the architect, whipping in a delicious delivery from the left. Woltemade stretched instinctively to guide the ball beyond Sanchez, sparking a deafening roar as a tight offside check eventually confirmed the goal stood. Newcastle were flying, and Woltemade might easily have completed a hat-trick before the interval if he had not scuffed two more opportunities.

Chelsea, so ragged before the break, emerged transformed after half-time. Their revival was ignited by a moment of real quality from Reece James, who curled a sublime free-kick over the wall and into the corner.  Suddenly, belief surged through the visitors. Newcastle, who had looked so comfortable, began to retreat and the contest opened up. What followed was a sequence of events that would leave the home crowd incandescent. Midway through the second half, Gordon chased a loose ball into the penalty area and was met by Chalobah. The Chelsea defender barged across him, sending Gordon tumbling towards the advertising hoardings. St James' Park erupted, players surrounded the referee, and VAR was swiftly engaged.

Yet, to widespread disbelief, no penalty was awarded. The Premier League later explained on X: "The referee's call of no penalty to Newcastle was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the contact from Chalobah on Gordon deemed to be side-to-side in a shielding action and the ball within playing distance."

Ally McCoist was unequivocal on commentary, branding it "a stonewall penalty," while Joe Cole described the challenge as "too much aggression". Even former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin admitted it was "risky with bells on it".

Meanwhile, retired Premier League official Darren Cann told BBC Sport: “At normal speed I can understand why the referee didn't award a penalty. Chalobah certainly takes a risk in making such a challenge because there's clear contact with Gordon. So the decision was right to be reviewed by VAR, who came to the conclusion that a clear and obvious error had not been made and stayed with the on-field decision of no penalty. I do think that had a penalty been given, I believe the VAR would have stuck with that decision too. So this comes down to 'referee's call'".

The sense of injustice only deepened when Chelsea completed the turnaround. In direct contrast to Newcastle's intricate first-half play, the equaliser came via route-one football. Sanchez launched the ball long, João Pedro muscled beyond his marker, surged clear and finished calmly to silence the ground. Newcastle, who had been vibrant and inventive, suddenly looked deflated. Howe rolled the dice, withdrawing Woltemade, Gordon and Murphy for Harvey Barnes, Yoane Wissa and Anthony Elanga. The changes failed to spark a late response, and the points slipped away. It marked yet another frustrating statistic for the Magpies as they have now dropped 13 points from winning positions in the league this season.

Newcastle's focus now turns quickly to a daunting Boxing Day trip to Old Trafford, where they face Manchester United in the Premier League's only fixture on December 26 this season. The decision to stage a solitary match on a date traditionally overflowing with top-flight football has raised eyebrows. The Premier League's scheduling was shaped by fixture congestion, broadcast obligations and the expanded European calendar, with December 26 falling on a Friday and leaving only one viable broadcast slot. All other Matchweek 18 games have been spread across the following weekend. For Newcastle, though, attention remains fixed on what might have been. A scintillating first half deserved more, but once again, controversy and missed opportunities combined to leave a bitter taste on Tyneside.

December 20, 2025

The United States has come a long way in the evolution of soccer since hosting the 1994 World Cup. More than three decades later, with Major League Soccer still growing. now led by Lionel Messi as its global face, and a competitive U.S. Men's National Team, the World Cup will return to the U.S. in 2026 alongside Mexico and Canada.

That growth did not happen overnight, and the 1994 edition now feels worlds apart from what lies ahead in 2026. Considerable groundwork was required to reach this point. In an exclusive interview with World Soccer Talk, MLS co-founder and former U.S. Soccer President Alan Rothenberg reflected on the contrast between the two eras.

“If we go back to what we did in 94, everybody was concerned that this great experiment by FIFA might not have legs because the US obviously wasn't considered a soccer country, so we determined that Americans love a big event,” Rothenberg, one of the architects of that tournament, said. “And so while soccer would be at the core of it, we were going to just surround it with celebrities and entertainment and all kinds of things to get public attention, and make people believe this is a big event we can't miss it and therefore we'll buy tickets and come and we'll watch what we had on television.

“That really set the tone because up until then the World Cup basically was presented as a soccer tournament as it is, and of course it was in soccer loving countries and so you didn't have to, you know, create a hype around it because it was built in. And so in that way we set the tone and, of course, in 2026 they are expanding upon what we created in 1994.“

Compared to other nations, the U.S. struggled for decades to establish a stable domestic league, cycling through failed ventures such as the American Soccer League and the original NASL. Since its founding in 1996, however, Major League Soccer has emerged as the flagship of U.S. soccer, achieving steady, sustainable growth and global recognition.

Rothenberg reflected on that evolution: “I cover a lot of what you just talked about and then some in the book I just finished writing. It's going to be out in early February. It's called the ‘The Big Bounce, the Surge that Shaped the Future of U.S. Soccer‘ and it really goes into things even further back, but it starts in 1990 and the events that occurred, with everything building on what came before.“

Rothenberg also played a pivotal role in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics as soccer commissioner, a major turning point for the sport domestically. He highlighted the importance of the U.S. women's national team winning the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991, while also outlining the careful steps taken ahead of the 1994 men's tournament.

“We did a test case in the summer of 1993 where we invited England, Brazil and Germany and had a round-robin tournament. It was really just to make sure to logistically we could handle a tournament, and we did. We beat England, shocked everybody and played credibly against Brazil and Germany. Although they both defeated us, and that was important because no matter how we hype the tournament, if our team fell flat on its face, the future probably would not have been as rosy as it's become.“

Alan Rothenberg with his book “The Big Bounce: The Surge that Shaped the Future of U.S. Soccer.”

As with 2026, the 1994 World Cup draw was designed as a spectacle rather than a technical exercise. Rothenberg wanted to “make it huge.” “The night before we had a big gala and we had James Brown and Smokey Robinson were the performers, Stevie Wonder too, and then the day of the draw we had all kinds of celebrities present like Robin Williams, and seeded and was unbelievable to the point where he still gets YouTube viewers because it was such a classic performance and at the same time.“

“We still have the record for average attendance. It'll be broken in 2026. We still have the record for the amount of the surplus and that probably will stand. So from that standpoint there was a lasting effect where we launched Major League Soccer based on the results of 94. We had that surplus and with that we created the US Soccer Foundation, which still exists today and is will be in perpetuity in helping support.“

Following 1994, Rothenberg also pushed for women's soccer at the 1996 Olympics and helped secure hosting rights for the 1999 Women's World Cup. “One thing built off of the other and it's been straight uphill ever since. 30 years later, MLS has got 30 teams continuing to grow and NWSL, the Women's League, after some rocky starts, they're on a great trajectory, and the USL has teams virtually everywhere in America, and again well established; so ‘one thing built on the other' is going to continue.“

MLS celebrated its 30th anniversary season in 2025, marking remarkable growth from its original 10 teams to 30 today. “It surpassed whatever we thought. I mean, it isn't like we set goals that by, you know, year five, it'll be a this, year 10, it'll be at this stage,” Rothenberg admitted, with the objective to create a single entity instead of leaving clubs to operate independently.

“And then the MLS under Don Garber's leadership and the owner group has been clever enough to create some exceptions to the single entity, if you will.And allow for example, some special deal to bring (David) Beckham in and then more recently to bring Messi in exceeding our normal salary caps which were established through the single entity.“

Beyond Messi, Rothenberg highlighted Son Heung-min's arrival as equally significant: “I mentioned Messi, but I think in some ways the more dramatic signing recently like Son because he's not in his late 30s, he's just 30 (33). So he's still in the prime of his career and I think that's going to be key and I think that's going to be one of the things that comes out in 2026, that there'll be the a boost in the economic support for MLS teams and they can use that then to bring in more top world world class players from Europe.“

Stars like Thierry Henry, David Villa, Andrea Pirlo, and Zlatan Ibrahimović all left their mark on MLS, but none matched Messi's impact: “The first time around, when he played, it was a sellout. Obviously, as he returned and now he's played for three years, it's not a novelty anymore. But if you love sport, if you love soccer, you love seeing his magic, which continues.“

Rothenberg emphasized a key difference between Messi and many past signings: “The other thing too it's pretty clear, and it's that they aren't treating it as, you know, a paid retirement. They're really getting into it, supporting the team, going out and making public appearances and they're talking up the game. And so that's really crucial because in many cases. The other players that have come in, it's a nice way to finish their career, but they were not committed, if you will, to building the sport in America.

“Beckham is obviously because he's behind the ownership of Inter Miami and probably key to bringing Messi over, then Messi, and as I said, he just got here, so it's harder to tell, but based on his initial coming to the LAFC team, Son looks like he's comparably one that is really here to play, enjoy, be part of the team and be part of the growth of the league, which is great.”

Rothenberg even hinted at Messi's international future: “The one competition that he had not won up until now was the Major League Soccer and of course he just led Inter Miami to the win the MLS Cup. So his plate has been finally full. And obviously everybody's looking forward to a last hurrah, if you will, in 26. I mean, he previously said he's not going to play for the national team again, but I can't believe he'll stick to that.“

One of the central talking points of the 2025 season has been the MLS salary cap, which drew criticism from several Inter Miami players, including Lionel Messi, over the club's ability to build a competitive squad. Asked about the league's current limitations, Alan Rothenberg did not shy away from the topic, instead praising the work of MLS leadership.

“Don Garber and his owners have done an excellent job of doing what they have to do in order to take things to the next step and also to seize potential opportunities when they appear. So I have no doubt that they will continue to do that. Maybe they're going to add a fourth DP, and obviously as far as the salary cap is concerned, that goes up every year, and obviously some of that gets negotiated with the Players Association, so it will be more and more financially remunerative to players and to owners.

“I think for the path forward, there'll be hurdles obviously, but I think we'll do well. The change to get on to the international calendar also will benefit MLS because they'll have the equal opportunity in the player transfer area to the sign or sell players. Now, you know, they just have that brief window in the middle of the season, and it makes it disruptive. Obviously, if you're bringing in a player at midseason, we'd love to have him all year, so that move to the international calendar will be very beneficial also.”

Prior to Messi's arrival in MLS, Cristiano Ronaldo completed his move to Al Nassr in 2022, becoming the face of Saudi Arabian soccer and kickstarting an aggressive push to sign European stars. Compared to MLS' strategy, however, the Saudi Pro League has fallen short of securing the same level of global broadcast deals, underscoring that attracting star players alone is not enough to guarantee success.

Asked about the strategy of bringing stars as a core, Rothenberg was clear: “Well, ultimately everything depends on performance of the teams and the star power helps to win. It's the right player, but equally important, it draws attention beyond just the people that are in the stadium. And I'm now talking about people that are going to watch matches on television and the goal that every pro league and everywhere really depends on is media money.

Rothenberg expects the 2026 World Cup to be transformative. “Whatever the platform is, the key is TV money, and that's the one place where MLS is languished and I'm expecting that 2026 will change that dramatically,” he stated.

“Again, more people, more eyeballs, watching matches and therefore more money coming from various media platforms, and then it becomes certain, because with that more money then the MLS teams can bring more star players in which hopefully creates even more interest, which then in turn creates more media revenue. It won't be that in 2027 immediately everything just explodes. It'll be gradual, rapidly gradual, continued growth,” he concluded.

The U.S. Men's National Team has generated growing expectations among fans in recent months. Alan Rothenberg noted that beyond the advantage of hosting and the group-stage opponents revealed in the draw, recent performances against top nations, even without European-based stars such as Christian Pulisic, have fueled optimism about how far the team could go.

“I think there's a lot more enthusiasm and bordering now on a little bit of optimism as we go in. You know, it's hard to say that we're lucky with the draw, but it could have been worse, and two of the teams that are in there, we've already beaten just in this last round where we finally started to show some talent on the field,” Rothenberg added, as Paraguay and Australia are the confirmed rivals, previously defeated by Mauricio Pochettino's team.

Still, he highlighted a longstanding issue compared to other big nations: “I mean, the biggest problem with the US perennially is what I said: It's all scattered. When you look at who's been the most successful in World Cups, Spain obviously now is dominant. Well, most of their players played in Barcelona and Real Madrid. They know each other either as teammates or as opponents. So it is a consistent style of play. Before that, the Germans dominated, and what? 10 out of 11 starters were from Bayern Munich, so they were truly a team. France is unique because, but they have that Claire Fontaine national training site and so every player comes through that.

“So there is a French style of play, if you will, and unfortunately, the United States up until now hasn't had that because you got players scattered everywhere. I think a lot of that's going to change. I think we're going to end up having a Claire Fontaine type model because we now have just the generosity of Arthur Blank who created a new headquarters training site in Atlanta, and I think from now on we'll have our players going through that same way as the French have their players going to Claire Fontaine, so I'm optimistic about that.“

Romario of Brazil surges past Alexi Lalas of USA during the 1994 World Cup finals second round match.

Back at the 1994 World Cup, the U.S. Men's National Team was drawn into a group with Colombia, Switzerland, and Romania. Against expectations, the Americans upset Colombia and fell to Romania, flipping most pre-tournament predictions. Still, the team made a strong impression by advancing to the knockout stage, even if the results did not unfold exactly as anticipated.

“I don't think we dare get up over optimistic because, two of the teams that we've drawn into our group are teams we recently beat. So we can't be overly optimistic, but at least cautiously optimistic I guess is what I'd say. And then obviously once you get into the knockout phase, everything changes. A lot of it depends on who who we first play.

“And again in 94, good and bad news: The bad news, if you will, is who do we draw (Brazil). But it turns out actually it was the good news because we played them competitively. So that put us on the competitive match and people finally were going to give us a little bit of respect and say we actually belong in the tournament, not just because we're the host, but also it electrified our fans,” Rothenberg highlighted, before explaining the excitement and how fans showed their support.

“It was on our independent stage, July 4th. And our fans looked like the Brazilian fans. They were all painted, flag waving, singing. And so it was like the first time, as far as I could tell, that that they really caught the fever, that they really got the unique spirit of the World Cup, and so on one hand, it was a shame we drew Brazil because hopefully we would have beaten somebody else. But the good news is, as I said, we established our credibility on the pitch and the fans established themselves as being a true soccer fan.”

Over the past several months, Mauricio Pochettino has begun shaping a competitive squad after calling in more than 40 players throughout 2025. With the World Cup approaching, even Rothenberg, a central figure in U.S. soccer and the 1994 tournament, believes the 2026 edition is poised to reach new heights, not just for the USMNT, but for the sport in the United States as a whole.

Santos president Marcelo Teixeira says he has a "positive expectation" that Neymar will extend his contract despite reported interest from Flamengo. The 33-year-old played a crucial role in keeping his boyhood club in the Brazilian top-flight and despite having a huge amount of affection for the Vila Belmiro side, the forward is unsure about his future as his contract ticks down.

Despite playing through the pain of a knee injury, something he will have an arthroscopy on when he returns from his holiday in the United States, Neymar was instrumental in Santos maintaining their top-flight status in recent weeks. The veteran scored five goals and added an assist in his last four games as Peixe narrowly avoided the drop. Teixeira has previously said that renewing Neymar's contract, which expires at the end of December, is a big "priority" but the player himself left the door open to an exit.

In early December, Neymar said, "I do not know, really. I don't know. I need some days now, I need to rest, disconnect then decide my future. For sure my priority always goes to Santos."

While Santos want to keep Neymar up until the 2026 World Cup at the very least, Brazilian league winners Flamengo are reportedly eyeing a move for the former Barcelona star. Teixeira, however, is still hopeful of striking a deal with the ex-Paris Saint-Germain ace.

He told ESPN: "Neymar's project is a project for next year's World Cup. The conversation has always been this. He could go anywhere and wanted to come to Santos, his home. Maybe we imagined taking advantage of it more in the first half of the year and we couldn't, but it's nobody's fault. He ends the season in a better way, he was decisive. Neymar's participation continues to be important, off the field and on it. The dialogue remains. We are evaluating the numbers and extending these values. I have a positive expectation that we will reach a common denominator for his permanence."

While the Santos president is keeping his fingers crossed that they will be able to retain Neymar, who started his career at the Brazilian giants before leaving for Barcelona in 2013, they can only do so much to keep him in 2026. 

He added, "This is more of a decision for Neymar than for Santos. What we have is the will for him to stay, to stay. We left this deadline so that he could travel with his family. He is talking to his father, to his family. There is no set deadline, but we are in a strong and good dialogue. I believe (that he stays)."

Incidentally, Neymar has scored 12 goals and added six assists in 30 appearances in his second spell at Santos.

After Neymar finishes his holiday, before going under the knife, he will set his sights on getting back to fitness quickly as he bids to be in Brazil's World Cup squad. Although he is a Brazilian icon, partly due to guiding the Selecao to Olympic gold in Rio in 2016, the ex-Al-Hilal man has no divine right to be selected. Indeed, national team boss Carlo Ancelotti said as much.

The former AC Milan and Real Madrid manager said in early December, "If we talk about Neymar, we have to talk about other players. We have to think about Brazil, which can be with Neymar or without Neymar, with other players or without other players. The definitive list we will make after the FIFA date in March. I understand very well that they are very interested in Neymar, I want to clarify that we are in December, the World Cup is in June, I will choose the team that will go to the World Cup in May. If Neymar deserves to be, if he is well, better than someone else, he will play in the World Cup and period. I don't owe anyone a debt."

It's been an eventful year for the Chelsea forward who joined the Stamford Bridge mob over the summer

It's that time of the year when we look back at achievements over the past 12 months.

For most of us, there's likely to be a few highlights sat alongside the odd moment we'd rather not remember, but for Joao Pedro, 2025 has been a year he will never forget.

The 24-year-old not only made a £55 million move to Chelsea this summer, but hit the ground running with his new employers, playing a key role in their Club World Cup win, before starting for Brazil in the Maracana and cementing his place as one of the game's best young players.

“It's been a truly remarkable year in my life, no doubt about that,” he tells FourFourTwo. “The year a dream came true – playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, in the competition that I've always wanted to play in since I was a child: the Premier League.

“Along with that, the historic Club World Cup title, scoring important goals in the semi-final and the final, and making my debut as a starter for the Brazilian national team – playing for them at the Maracana, the greatest stage in football. Unforgettable.”

 




Pedro picked up his Club World Cup winners' medal less than a fortnight after joining Chelsea. Could he quite believe how that came about?

“The penny didn't drop immediately, to be honest with you,” he admits. “It all happened so fast, didn't it? [Laughs] I only really grasped the magnitude of what we'd accomplished when I got home and saw all of the reaction to it. That was when I thought to myself, ‘Wow, I've written my name into the history of one of the biggest football clubs in the world.' That's really cool.

The best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.

“The fact that I'd already been playing in English football for a few seasons was helpful. I already knew Chelsea's style of play and most of the players. Everything became easier when they welcomed me as soon as I arrived at the training camp. Everyone was very supportive, and they received me with open arms. “That made me feel comfortable and relaxed, so I could play my football.”

Another twist of fate saw Pedro's first start for Chelsea come in the semi-final against Fluminense, the club where he began his career in Brazil.

“It wasn't easy facing Fluminense – it's the club that shaped me as a person and as a footballer,” he continues. “I'll have an eternal affection for them, but I also needed to show my new club, the management, the coaching staff and my team-mates that they could count on me. So when the referee blew the whistle to start the game, I put all my emotions aside and gave my best as a professional athlete. I ended up scoring two beautiful goals that knocked Fluminense out of the tournament. It was a mix of emotions, because I was very happy that I'd made the final with Chelsea, but also a little sad because I knew it was the game of a lifetime for Fluminense.

 




“It was definitely a magical day in my life. My first game as a starter for a giant club like Chelsea, I scored both of my team's goals to send us into the final of the first big Club World Cup in history, and all while facing the team that shaped me. There's no way it was just an average day!”

Pedro then went on to net in the final, as the Blues cruised to a 3-0 victory over recently crowned European champions Paris Saint-Germain.

“I wasn't surprised,” he asserts. “We had momentum and were getting stronger throughout the competition. After the wins against Palmeiras and Fluminense, two teams who had been playing very well, our confidence increased even further. The whole world was betting on another PSG victory, as they'd recently won the Champions League, but we had belief that we could face them on equal terms. Thank God that our plan worked out and we managed to dominate the match for the whole 90 minutes. We made history.”

For more than a decade, Joe Mewis has worked in football journalism as a reporter and editor. Mewis has had stints at Mirror Football and LeedsLive among others and worked at FourFourTwo throughout Euro 2024, reporting on the tournament. In addition to his journalist work, Mewis is also the author of four football history books that include times on Leeds United and the England national team. Now working as a digital marketing coordinator at Harrogate Town, too, Mewis counts some of his best career moments as being in the iconic Spygate press conference under Marcelo Bielsa and seeing his beloved Leeds lift the Championship trophy during lockdown.

Under the agreement, Dempsey will feature across campaigns promoting Unilever's personal care portfolio, including Dove, Dove Men+Care, Degree, and AXE.

Clint Dempsey, the former United States men's national team captain and one of the most influential figures in modern American soccer, has entered into a new partnership with Unilever as the global consumer goods company accelerates its marketing push ahead of the FIFA World Cup 26, to be staged across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Under the agreement, Dempsey will feature across campaigns promoting Unilever's personal care portfolio, including Dove, Dove Men+Care, Degree, and AXE. The collaboration is built around themes of performance, confidence, and preparation, linking everyday routines with the intensity of elite competition and the emotional energy surrounding the world's biggest sporting event.

The partnership forms part of Unilever's wider relationship with FIFA, which spans men's, women's, and esports competitions. With FIFA World Cup 26 set to be the largest edition of the tournament to date, Unilever is positioning its brands at the centre of fan culture through integrated storytelling, retail activations, and consumer promotions. These will include opportunities for fans to engage with the tournament through experiential moments and ticket giveaways tied to Unilever's product portfolio.

Speaking on the partnership, Clint Dempsey, U.S. Soccer Hall of Famer, said, “When you feel fresh, you play better – simple as that. That rush of confidence sticks with you long after the whistle blows; it's what helps me show up every day. That's why I'm excited to partner with Unilever to help fans experience that same confidence in their own everyday routines.”

Laura DiMiceli, Head of Sports Marketing & Partnerships, Unilever Personal Care, added, “At Unilever, we know that the love of the game is so much more than what happens on the field – it's about the passion, connection, and joy that brings people together everywhere. We're proud to partner with Clint Dempsey to bring our brands to people in ways that celebrate that same energy, helping to inspire confidence, freshness, and connectivity during the excitement of FIFA World Cup 26 and the everyday moments that matter.”

Dempsey, a U.S. Soccer Hall of Famer, brings long-standing credibility to the campaign. During his international career, he earned more than 140 caps for the United States, scored 57 goals, and represented the country at three FIFA World Cups. At the club level, he played a key role in elevating the global perception of American players through successful spells in Major League Soccer and the Premier League, most notably with Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur.

From a commercial perspective, the deal strengthens Unilever's positioning ahead of a tournament expected to deliver record attendances, global broadcast reach, and sustained consumer engagement across North America. Personal care brands have historically benefited from major summer tournaments, driven by travel, live events, and heightened fan participation.

The collaboration also underlines the growing commercial maturity of soccer in the United States. With the country hosting the majority of matches in 2026, brands are investing early to establish authentic associations with the sport and its most recognisable cultural figures. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

Alexander Blockx moved to within one win of a debut title at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, thanks to another big-time performance on Saturday evening.

As well as deploying the explosive game that has defined his run in Jeddah, the 20-year-old Belgian showcased supreme physicality to fend off close friend Nicolai Budkov Kjaer 4-3(4), 4-3(8), 4-2. Blockx, who attended the inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals in 2017 as a fan, now awaits top seed Learner Tien or Nishesh Basavareddy in Sunday's final.

"I think it may have been straight sets but it was my most difficult match this week by far," Blockx said. "I think the level we both played was really high. The second set, again it is just here that the luck fell on my side a bit. We had some very long rallies and I am very happy I could share this moment with him.

"We have been speaking about the Next Gen for a long time. In September we were talking: ‘Imagine if we made it to Jeddah and played each other there', so it is amazing to have been able to share this match with him. He is one of my best friends on Tour so it was a really nice Saturday for me."

In a first Lexus ATP Head2Head contest between the two big hitters, Blockx was dragged into a physical battle after winning the opening set. Budkov Kjaer extended the rallies and displayed shot tolerance of his own to signal there was still life left in the 19-year-old Norwegian.

The power of Blockx, however, proved too much. A blistering forehand pass on the run in the final game was one of 27 winners the Belgian hit during the semi-final, adding to the 76 he fired en route to a 3-0 sweep of the Red Group.







"It sounds exciting," Blockx said on Sunday's final. "I am going to prepare the best I can. I think physically I am feeling good, even though these are tough matches and you have shorter time between the points. The rallies go longer and with the no Ads you don't have too much time to think, so I think the most important time here is to stay calm in the head and that is what I am doing."

In 2025, Blockx captured two ATP Challenger Tour titles and claimed his first tour-level win in Cincinnati to earn his place at the 20-and-under event. The 2023 Australian Open boys' champion also reached a career-high No. 101 in the PIF ATP Rankings and will be sure to target a Top 100 debut in 2026.
Budkov Kjaer will leave Jeddah with his head held high after notching two impressive wins and becoming the first Norwegian semi-finalist in tournament history. Despite defeat, the 19-year-old has showcased exactly why he is one of the brightest emerging talents on the ATP Tour, already with four Challenger titles to his name in 2025.

There is no easing your way into a match at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF.

Sets fly to four, points come thick and fast, and before players can even towel off, momentum has already shifted. It's tennis stripped of its safety nets, and as we have seen so far, this format rewards sharp starts, brave decisions and an unwavering focus from first ball to last.

Top seed Learner Tien, who let slip four match points in a bitter opening defeat to Rafael Jodar, has felt just how quickly control can slip away.

“I'm not sure if it's the format and it might just be me, but I feel like this week I've been struggling to focus in some of these matches,” Tien told ATPTour.com after notching his first win over Martin Landaluce. “My mind just kind of goes in and out, especially when I get up in the score, and with this format, momentum can change really quick.

“I get up and then I take a few points off and suddenly we're in a no-Ad point and momentum just shifts so quickly that suddenly you can lose a set off of one game.”

That razor-thin margin is magnified by sudden-death Deuce. For Belgium's Alexander Blockx, those moments have been opportunities rather than obstacles. The 20-year-old has thrived when matches tighten, a big reason why he completed a perfect 3-0 sweep of his group.

“Knowing a loss of serve could be costly for a set or having more break opportunities with the sudden-death Deuce comes into my head, but this week I feel I have played those big points well,” said Blockx, who saved 86 per cent (19/22) of break points across the group stage, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “I focus more when it's a deciding point. 

“I don't think too much about the pressure of those points, I just play full out and I think how I have handled the big moments has been important to why I made a good start here and qualified for the semi-finals.”

By crushing 76 winners across his first three group matches, Blockx offers a perfect example of how to expertly utilise aggression in this fast-paced format. That attacking mindset is reinforced in real time, with in-arena analytics giving players, coaches and fans insights into who is dictating points, how shots are performing across every stroke, and which player is winning the battle when on the front foot — or scrambling in defence.

Fast starts have been another recurring theme throughout the week. With sets to four, falling behind early can be costly. Croatia's Dino Prizmic experienced that the hard way in his opening defeat to Nishesh Basavareddy, but struck back with a sharp opening against Justin Engel.

“For the first set, it is very important to have a fast start but matches are long, needing to win three sets,” Prizmic said after his four-set win over Engel. “A fast start is important and you have to adapt quickly, but if you can make a fast start you can take a lot of control quickly.”



The physical rhythm of the match is also altered by the lack of a changeover after the first game of a set  For Prizmic, there is no room to hide and settle in easily. Instead, you have to be locked in and ready for battle from the get-go.

“For me it is better not to change every first game. Sometimes I sit down in matches after one game and I am a little bit cold, and then I need to find some rhythm and get warm again,” explained the 20-year-old. “Here it's good because we can play three games in a row to start and you get warm straight away.”



Layered on top of the on-court intensity is a round-robin format that offers both pressure and opportunity. Every match matters, but one loss doesn't spell the end, a dynamic that mirrors the challenge of life on Tour.

Tien, for example, rebounded from his opening heartbreak to top his group, while Jodar was eliminated despite also finishing with a positive 2-1 record.

“It is a very tough but good experience,” Prizmic said of the format. “Every win is very important and you have to stay balanced after a group defeat as you can come back. Everyone is also inside the Top 200, so you are straight into it.”

That, ultimately, is the magic of the Next Gen ATP Finals. It rewards boldness, punishes hesitation and accelerates development. A high-octane proving ground where the future of men's tennis learns to live on the edge.

	As Stranger Things comes to its explosive conclusion, Noah Schnapp is ready for fans to bring Will Byers' personal journey home.


	With the first part of Season 5 seeing Will explore not only his dormant psychic powers, but his sexual orientation, the actor teased that the Duffer Brothers “close it really well” with the character's apparent unrequited love for his best friend Mike (Finn Wolfhard).


	“Look, it's like a real, authentic representation of a queer kid in the '80s,” explained Schnapp on Watch What Happens Live. “I've dealt with that myself, being in love with my best friend, and maybe they don't love you back, or maybe they feel differently. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but I think the Duffers close it really well.”

	Following Season 4, which teased Will's sexual orientation and his affection for Mike, Schnapp's protagonist confides in Robin (Maya Hawke) after finding out she is also LGBTQ.


	With the Season 5 halfway point revealing Will's telekinetic powers, Schnapp and co-creator Matt Duffer previously explained to Deadline that the supernatural abilities are a metaphor for the character embracing his identity.


	“I think people mistake fear for weakness. Will has had a lot of fear through the years, because of what he's had to endure, but that doesn't mean he's weak,” said Schnapp, adding: “He always comes back, and he never crumbles. So that is his strength, and I think he shows that in the end, that he is stronger than we all think.”


	Duffer explained, “This was about Will's journey in terms of finding out really who he was, and coming to terms with that. So we liked the idea of tying that into some of the more supernatural elements, that in order to become his most powerful self, he had to also really come to terms with who he is.”


	With the first four episodes of Stranger Things, Season 5 now available to stream on Netflix, the next three roll out on Christmas, with the two-hour finale dropping on New Year's Eve.

The “It Ends With Us” legal war continues. 

Blake Lively's attorneys are now blasting Justin Baldoni's attorneys over their “probative” questions regarding the actress' sex life and alleged “disruptive” deposition behavior.

The “Gossip Girl” alum, 38, and her team submitted a letter from September as evidence in their latest Dec. 19 filing which has been obtained by Page Six. 

In the letter, they claim the September note highlights Baldoni's team's “inappropriate and unprofessional behavior” as they complained about Baldoni's lawyers asking unnecessary questions regarding Lively's sex life.

“Ms. Lively's sexual and/or romantic history has no bearing on the matters at issue in this case and we will not tolerate such examination, which will be the subject of a protective order and sanctions motion if it happens again,” Lively's attorneys wrote. 

The attorneys cited the rape shield law statute, which “bars evidence of a sexual assault victim's sexual behavior or sexual history” unless its merits “substantially outweighs the risk of unfair prejudice or harm” as the reason why such questions were irrelevant to the sexual harassment case. 

In addition, Lively's legal team also complained that Baldoni's lawyers showed a “lack of basic decorum” due to their “insulting comments, audible cross-talk and laughter during examination.”

In the Dec. 19 letter to Judge Lewis Liman, the “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” star's attorneys claimed the past behavior shown by attorneys Bryan Freedman and Kevin Fritz served as proof of their continued “conduct that impeded, delayed, and frustrated” the “fair” examination of one of their experts.

“Throughout discovery, multiple defense counsel insisted on making speaking objections, often in depositions they were not defending, and consuming time on the record to demean and orate,” Lively's attorney, Michael J. Gottlieb, writes.

Lively's lawyers not only requested that the judge impose sanctions on both attorneys for the behavior, but the actress' team is looking to compel their expert, Nicole Alexander, for another deposition and is asking that Baldoni pay the fees for the “necessitated” effort.

They are also asking that Lively be awarded “half of its reasonable expenses and attorney fees incurred in connection with the deposition and this motion.” 

Reps for Lively and Baldoni did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

Lively filed a formal lawsuit against the “It Ends With Us” director in December 2024 for alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and lost wages. 

Baldoni, 41, responded with a $400 million countersuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds. However, that suit has since been tossed.

A May 18, 2026, trial date has been set for their case. The two parties have a court-mandatory settlement conference scheduled for Feb. 11, per People.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: German actor Lars Eidinger will be Brainiac in James Gunn's Superman and Lex Luther movie Man of Tomorrow, we hear. 


	This is the first time that Brainiac, a very popular Superman villain in the comics next to Lex, will appear on the big screen.  The character was created by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, and made his debut in Action Comics #242. 


	Brainiac is a really smart android who comes from the planet of Colu. He's hellbent on collecting all the knowledge in the universe. What we know about Man of Tomorrow is that David Corenswet's Man of Steel and Nicholas Hoult's Luther have to team up against a new threat in the galaxy. Wouldn't be a surprise if it's Brainiac who can shrink cities and destroy planets. In the comics, the bad guy has a history of shrinking Superman's home planet of Krypton; and in some storylines even destructed the place.

	The UTA repped, European award nominated Eidinger has starred in such movies as Olivier Assayas' Clouds of Sils Maria and Personal Shopper, in the Netflix Noah Baumbach directed movies Jay Kelly and White Noise, among several others. Eidinger was nominated last year for European Actor at the European Film Awards for the Matthias Glasner directed movie Dying.

	Gunn wrote on Instagram, “In our worldwide search for Brainiac in Man of Tomorrow, Lars Eidinger rose to the top. Welcome to the DCU, Lars.” 


	An April production start is being eyed for Man of Tomorrow for a theatrical release on July 9, 2027. Superman was Gunn's first big tentpole in the new DC Studios, led by himself and Peter Safran; the pic grossing over $616M around the world.

Not sure how much “care” there is for the DCU, James.

Strong selection with a decent actor. Better than just getting a “star” that will phone it in and take up too much budget.

Bowen Yang marked his final day as a cast member on Saturday Night Live with a sweet farewell. On Saturday morning, he penned a note on social media, reminiscing about what he learned and expressing his gratitude for the experience. Yang spent seven seasons on the sketch comedy series.


	He posted his note on Instagram, alongside a carousel featuring photos and video skit clips with castmates and guests, including a clip featuring Jenna Ortega, and more fond memories.


	“i loved working at SNL, and most of all i loved the people. i was there at a time when many things in the world started to seem futile, but working at 30 rock taught me the value in showing up anyway when people make it worthwhile,” he wrote.He reminisced about the lessons he will take with him going forward. “i'm grateful for every minute of my time there. i learned about myself (bad with wigs). i learned about others (generous, vulnerable, hot). i learned that human error can be nothing but correct. i learned that comedy is mostly logistics and that it will usually fail until it doesn't, which is the besssst.”


	Yang kicked off his time at SNL first as a writer in 2018 for Season 44, before becoming a featured player in Season 45. He was promoted to the main cast in Season 47.“thank you to every single person who showed up there: friends and coworkers and audiences and hosts. thank you celeste, sudi, will, alison, julio, fran, drez, bulla, marty, john, ben, jimmy, ceara, deetch, jake, asha, jack, auguste, tucker, kent, streeter, james, alex, jasmine, gary, and billy for writing with me. thank you to every cast member for making me laugh and cry,” he continued. “to liz and don. tom, jodi, louie, eamon. gena, chris, eddie. the crews, the pages. and to audrey, jameson, cassandra and chris for the fastest, funnest quick-changes in all of showbiz. thank you to ari for sending me off in the dreamiest way i could imagine.”

	











	Yang's final SNL show as a castmate concludes with Ariana Grande, his Wicked co-star, as host and Cher is the musical guest. It's a full-circle moment as Yang played Glinda's (Grande) assistant Pfannee in the Wicked films.He concluded with a thank you to show creator Lorne Michaels. “thank you to lorne for the job. for the standard. and for bringing everyone at work together,” he wrote. “they all care deeply about people in the room, any room, enjoying themselves. i can't believe i was ever included in that. the show doesn't go on because it's ready, but shiiiiit, i hope i am.”

	Yang's SNL departure comes a couple of weeks after it was reported that he's set to work on a new endeavor with his Las Culturistas co-host Matt Rogers; the duo will co-write and co-star in a new comedy film for Searchlight, according to Deadline. He is also voicing a character opposite Bill Hader in a new version of The Cat in the Hat.

Jillian Lauren is finally ready to speak out — and she's “calling from hell.”


	The best-selling author and soon-to-be ex-wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner is joking, she says during a phone interview with Rolling Stone, but her life has been in a freefall for months – ever since a swarm of police descended on her Los Angeles neighborhood last April, leading to a bizarre standoff in her backyard. The incident thrust Lauren into national headlines. Police claimed she fired at officers who were shouting at her over a fence during a chaotic manhunt for fleeing hit-and-run suspects. Police returned fire, striking her in the arm. She was charged with two felonies.


	In her first interview since the incident, Lauren says she can't discuss certain aspects of the case. While she's now enrolled in a two-year mental health diversion program that is expected to lead to full dismissal of her charges, technically, her case is still pending.

	“I was doing the best I knew to protect my family,” she tells Rolling Stone. “[The] impulse was self-defense.”

	











	The comments were as close as Lauren would come to explaining her side of what happened that day, yet she was more forthcoming about what happened in the aftermath of the gunfire.


	“My world fell to pieces around me in a heartbeat,” she says. “It's like, you spend your whole life just getting an entire deck of cards in order. And just take them and throw them up in the air one day, and I'm still waiting to see how they're gonna land.”

	











	Lauren recalled being arrested and taken to jail, with newspaper headlines saying she was booked on suspicion of attempted murder. Inside her cell, she says, she tried to memorize the graffiti on the walls.


	“It gave me a chance to get out of my head for those hours in the jail cell and imagine who else had been there,” she says. “In the throes of it, I was saying I will never do a book about this because I can't experience this again,” she recalls. Now, she feels differently. “Books are what I do.”

	Prosecutors ultimately charged Lauren with negligent discharge of a firearm and assault with a semiautomatic weapon. The Los Angeles Police Department released body-worn camera and home-surveillance video in a presentation posted on YouTube. According to the police footage, as soon as an officer warned, “Oh, she racked it,” officers opened fire, unloading a barrage of ear-splitting shots. In the soundless home-surveillance video purportedly showing the same scene from Lauren's side of the fence, Lauren does not appear to react to the volley of shots or exhibit any injury in the seconds after she allegedly fired.


	After Lauren pleaded not guilty, a judge found her eligible for the mental health diversion program, which requires counseling and random drug and alcohol testing. More headlines followed.


	“When the [mental health diversion] headlines came out, my joke was, ‘I'm not just a gun-toting criminal, now I'm a crazy one,'” she says with another slight laugh. She then turned serious. “My PTSD is a very real thing. I'm a victim of sex trafficking and domestic violence. … When the headlines said ‘Mental Health Diversion,' what I really thought was, ‘OK, good. People are so scared to talk about this.'” She adds, “I'm in a position where I can speak to it.”


	Lauren, the mother of two adopted sons, ages 13 and 17, is already a New York Times bestselling author. Her memoir, Everything You Ever Wanted, chronicled her experience with adoption, and Some Girls: My Life in a Harem, recounted her 18 months as a paid member of a prince's harem in Brunei. Her latest book, Behold the Monster: Facing America's Most Prolific Serial Killer, focused on her interviews with convicted serial killer Samuel Little.

	On Dec. 2, Lauren filed for divorce from Shriner after 20 years of marriage. She says they had been growing apart for years, and then the incident with the police pushed everything to a “crisis” point. The self-care and counseling she has undertaken since then have been revelatory, she says.

	











	“I had to go back and work on trauma from a long time ago in order to try and understand myself now, my actions,” she says. Her goal now is to be her “best self” as she navigates the divorce.


	“The headlines about the divorce were the ones that really hurt me,” she says. “I was the one who served my husband, but still, to see it in the public was really painful. It was definitely a day [spent] under the covers, blocking out all the noise. Divorce is painful, I don't care who you are.”


	She and Shriner remain proud of the life they built together and the loving family they created, she says. “He's still my best friend. We still have beautiful kids together and have always really supported each other in our various transformations,” she says. For the first decade of their marriage, she traveled with Shriner and never missed a show, she says.


	Over time, she struggled to “carve out a space” for herself. Then her book about Little became a massive project, and their interests diverged.


	“We're people who grow. We're passionate people. We're creative people,” she says. “You hope you'll change and grow together. We grew apart.”


	Scott Shriner declined to comment when reached by Rolling Stone on Friday. In a joint statement posted on Lauren's Instagram Dec. 5, the couple said they will “always miss the wild-at-heart kids” they were when they met.

	“We'll always share the wonder we saw in each other's eyes, when we first held our children,” the statement read. “The same wild hearts that brought us together, carry us now in different directions. We'll forever be a family, united in love, laughter, and music.”


	During the conversation on Friday, Jillian said she's now looking toward the future and leaning on her family and friends. “They've circled the wagons around me. … When the chips are really down, you do find out who your friends are,” she says. “My tree was shaken, but it is still standing.”

Eventually the schtick gets old. That's the thing about “black hole” games—games like Valorant, Fortnite, Overwatch, and any other that's designed to eat up as much of your free time as possible, through the use of tactics like absurdly long playthrough times and live service models. You can't play them with the same level of dedication forever, even if that's what they want you to do. I've been hard-stuck Silver in Valorant for literal years; any one competitive match is merely a drop in a bucket, and won't make or break my (nonexistent) rank progression. So I find myself getting up for a snack between rounds more often, no longer caring if I get back in time to grab a Vandal before the buy phase ends. Or I find myself reaching for my phone. And in a game where every competitive match lasts upwards of an hour, who cares if I'm only half paying attention three matches in?

I'm not the only one who does this. I've been in games where all four of my teammates stood catatonic in spawn until the last possible second before the game started. My friends admit to tabbing out and watching YouTube videos or scrolling through Twitter between rounds. “Lock in” less often means “give it your all” than it does “get off your phone and pay attention to the game.”

It's becoming a common problem across all popular multiplayer games. “In [the first] Overwatch there was a lot of non-verbal communication through movement and emotes and voice lines in the spawn,” one player tells me. “Everyone would be emoting each other and talking about each others' skins. But in Overwatch 2, everyone—especially me—just stands around [away from the keyboard] until the game starts.”

In market analyst Matthew Ball's essay on the state of the games industry in 2025, Ball observes that the gaming boom that occurred from 2011 to 2021 has reached a definitive end, as the market doesn't just fall short of global benchmarks but actively shrinks—even as the market for other media, like books, music, and digital video has continued to grow. Ball appoints the decline to multiple causes, including (but not limited to) the slowing of decade-old growth drivers such as live service models, mobile gaming, and user-generated content platforms; the failure of would-be new growth engines like cloud gaming, AR/VR, and Web3; evolving user behaviors and monetization models; and the rise of social video consumption. That last one isn't just cutting into the player base, but causing some of those who remain to pay less attention to the game they're playing, leading to a worse experience for everybody.

It's tempting to call short-form videos a scourge on this earth—and probably not inaccurate. I'm not saying this to sound like a crotchety (young) geezer raving about the kids these days; I'm no stranger to the doom scroll, and I feel like I'm watching my own brain turn to putty in real time. Excessive consumption of short-form content is directly linked to decreased attention spans, increased distractibility, and desensitization. But deleting TikTok isn't enough to protect yourself anymore—every single social media platform has an algorithmic short-form video feed baked in, from Instagram Reels to YouTube Shorts to honest-to-god LinkedIn Videos For You. 

When every single diversion is designed to take up all of your time, it's impossible to feel like you aren't constantly missing out. The sheer amount of content out there has piled up so inconceivably high that it can feel like the only way to make a meaningful dent in it is by cutting corners—by watching TikTok while also playing Overwatch.

As short-form content consumption rises and the black hole of free-to-play games yawns ever-wider, double-dipping screens worsens, as I've seen first-hand. Valorant is no longer entertaining enough to keep me or my squad mates from the siren call of tabbing out; my dopamine-starved brain just can't stomach the thought of waiting, like, three whole minutes to get a kill without snacking on a Bluesky post first.

Not to act like distracted gaming is some sort of dire epidemic that threatens to undermine all society, or anything, but it's a symptom of a larger problem: our increasing inability to pay attention. And it's arguably as much the fault of live-service models as it is short-form videos that this phenomenon exists in the first place; there's only so much you can do to keep a game about doing the same exact thing forever and ever and ever fresh before it inevitably loses its luster. However you want to apportion the blame, it's a small tragedy that we can't keep up with our friends through social media or watch legitimately good videos online without having the most evil media ever designed—AI slop, blatant hate, wealth porn—constantly shoveled down our throats, and that this incredibly manipulative relationship with short-form content is eroding our ability to be a little bit bored for trivial amounts of time.

I'll keep playing Valorant because it's a convenient way to spend time with my friends, even if they aren't paying full attention. I'll keep watching YouTube because there's a lot of good stuff on there beneath the metric tons of nonsense, and until there's a way for me to block Shorts on my iPhone, I'm sure I'll keep getting sucked into them, too. It shouldn't have to be this way, but when every aspect of human life seems to be intrinsically linked to smart technology, it feels about as impossible to extricate yourself from its harmful effects as it does to focus.

There has been a lot of attention on Rob Reiner and Michele Singer's middle child, son Nick Reiner, after their sudden and tragic deaths on Sunday, December 14. Nick was arrested and charged with the murders of his parents, and a spotlight has been shone on who he is and what he has done. 

Nick has previously spoken about his struggles with addiction, which even led to brief stints of homelessness. In 2016, he was sober and talking about his collaboration with his father on the film “Being Charlie.” The movie gives an insight into addiction, and although it was not an accurate portrayal of Nick's life, it was something he penned because of his experiences. Who was Nick? And why does a producer feel that his parents would want forgiveness for his alleged actions?

Someone who worked with Nick around the time of “Being Charlie” is producer Douglas Shaffer, who described him as being a “gentle guy” in an interview with People. 

He shared why he thought Rob and Michele would want eventual forgiveness for their son over this “absolute Hollywood tragedy.”

“There's lots and lots of healing that needs to be done,” Shaffer told People. “I think they would probably want people to feel empathy towards Nick's struggles. And perhaps forgiveness down the road.”

Shaffer also discussed who Rob was as a father, calling him “proud” and a “loving father, along with Michele — she was a loving mother… Nick had a good support system, as far as I knew.” Although Nick had people around him who loved him, Shaffer says that Rob “struggled to understand” Nick's addiction issues. “I think he was trying to find the best way to help his son. He wasn't sure if he should be more demanding on [things like] getting into rehab. [Rob] took more of a loving approach.”

Shaffer revealed that Nick's parents wanted the best for him, and they wanted him to be happy. “Rob just wanted Nick to be safe. He just wanted him to be safe and happy. … It's just a shame, because all he wanted was the best for Nick,” he said. 

If Nick is to be forgiven, that is something his siblings will have to determine later. He is the middle child and has an older brother, Jake Reiner, and a younger sister, Romy Reiner. They are also half-siblings to Tracy Reiner, Rob's daughter from his previous marriage. 

Jake and Romy have released a statement about their absolute heartache after their parents' deaths. “Words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day,” they told People. “The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends.”

"They were incredibly passionate, all-in parents doing their best," Zabel said.

	A former yoga instructor who worked closely with the Reiner family during Nick Reiner's childhood is spoke to about early behavioral challenges she witnessed years before the deaths of filmmaker Rob Reiner and producer Michele Singer Reiner.

	Speaking exclusively to PEOPLE, Zabel described Nick's childhood behavior as complex and difficult to manage, characterizing it as “a perfect storm” that resisted simple solutions.

	“As hard as they tried to manage it, get help, address it,” she said, “it's just beyond any of us to be able to diffuse.”

	











	According to Zabel, Rob and Michele Reiner sought additional support rather than disengaging. After years of group lessons, the couple asked her to begin working with Nick privately in an effort to help him regulate his emotions and energy. 


	“They asked me to teach Nicky privately, which I started to do, to help him to calm down and channel his energy,” she said.




	Zabel noted that while there were moments of progress during those one-on-one sessions, the broader challenges persisted. 


	“Nick's issues as a child were beyond any of us,” she said, adding that the family consistently explored different approaches to help him.


	She described Rob and Michele as deeply involved parents throughout that time. “They were incredibly passionate, all-in parents doing their best,” Zabel said, singling out Michele as a particularly devoted presence. 


	“She lived for those kids,” Zabel added. “She was very gracious and lovely.”


Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14. Nick Reiner, 32, was later arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder in connection with their deaths. He has not entered a plea, and the case remains ongoing. An arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 7.


	In a statement released earlier this week, the couple's other children described the loss as “horrific and devastating,” adding that “words cannot even begin to describe the unimaginable pain we are experiencing every moment of the day.”


	Zabel said the news of Rob and Michele's deaths was “shocking,” emphasizing that the couple never stopped trying to help their son. “They tried everything,” she said. “Some things are simply beyond what any parent can control.”

The actor, who originated the role of Henry Creel/Vecna in the hit Netflix series, made his Broadway debut Friday night for 'The First Shadow' at the Marquis Theatre in New York City.

Jamie Campbell Bower has brought Henry Creel/Vecna from the small screen to the Broadway stage.


	On Friday night, Bower surprised audiences at a performance of Stranger Things: The First Shadow. The actor, who portrays the villain in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things, appeared in the show's final scene. As it unfolded, Bower turned around and revealed himself as an adult version of Henry, receiving rounds of applause and cheers from the shocked audience. It also prompted an emotional reaction from Bower.




	The moment connected the Stranger Things prequel — set in the 1950s — with the TV series, set in the 1980s, by bringing adult Henry (also known as Number One) face-to-face with a young Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) at Dr. Brenner's lab, as seen in season four. Bower's appearance also marked his Broadway debut.

Stranger Things: The First Shadow tells the story of Henry's origins, a young Joyce Byers and Jim Hopper (played by Winona Ryder and David Harbour in the show), and follows the start of Hawkins Lab under Dr. Brenner. Louis McCartney, who stars as Henry throughout the Broadway run, was nominated for a 2025 Tony award for best actor in a play.


	McCartney introduced Bower during the curtain call. “To have him here tonight to share this moment with you all — with all of us on stage — and to invite you into this moment at the Marquis stage, man, it is such an honor,” he said. “You're such an inspiration. You're such a support to me, to the show, all these years.”

	











	He continued, “Henry Creel is the dynamite of The First Shadow. Without you, nothing is possible. This is not possible without you, man. Your love, your talent, your devotion — everything you've put into this, all these years.”


Stranger Things season five is releasing in three parts, with Volume 1 already streaming on Netflix as of Thanksgiving. Volume 2 releases on Christmas and The Finale drops on New Year's Eve.

The achievement adds to a standout year for women on the ARIA albums tally.

	Olivia Dean shows no signs of loosening her hold on Australia's charts. 


	Her second album, The Art of Loving, remains at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart for a third non-consecutive week, extending one of the year's most consistent chart runs.

	Dean becomes the ninth female artist to land a No. 1 album in 2025, joining a list that includes Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, Tate McRae, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Lorde and Taylor Swift — a run that's shaped much of the year's chart narrative.

	Dean is also doubling up at the top. Her single “Man I Need” clocks a fifth straight week at No. 1 on the ARIA Singles Chart, making her the fourth solo female artist to lead the singles tally in 2025, alongside Lola Young, Doechii and Swift. The year's singles race has largely been driven by women, from Rosé's extended reign with “APT.” featuring Bruno Mars to the surprise dominance of “Golden” by fictional K-pop group HUNTR/X from KPop Demon Hunters.

	











	Further down the albums chart, new releases and catalogue favorites share the spotlight. The 50th anniversary edition of Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here opens at No. 5, while simultaneously topping the Vinyl Albums Chart and the On Replay Albums Chart. First released in 1975, the album originally spent four weeks at No. 1 and remains one of the band's most celebrated works.




	Australian acts are also making a strong showing. Boy & Bear return to the Top 20 with their sixth studio album Tripping Over Time, debuting at No. 13. The Sydney group's chart history includes two previous No. 1 albums and multiple ARIA Awards. Melbourne singer-songwriter Benjamin Stewart also enters the tally, with his second solo album Junkdrawers bowing at No. 48.


	As December settles in, festive favorites once again take control of the singles charts. Mariah Carey's holiday mainstay “All I Want for Christmas Is You” leads the On Replay Singles Chart, fronting a Christmas-heavy top six that includes Wham!, Brenda Lee, Bobby Helms, Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson.

Stranger Things: The First Shadow had quite the surprise in store for Friday night's audience at the Marquis Theatre in New York City.


Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays Henry Creel a.k.a. Vecna in Seasons 4 and 5 of the series, made his Broadway debut to replace Louis McCartney in the final scene of the stage play. The moment connects the live show directly to the flagship Netflix series, depicting a moment that viewers immediately recognize from the fourth season: Henry meeting young Eleven in the Rainbow Room at Hawkins Lab.


	In the scene, Henry takes Eleven's hand and promises to help her. Audiences, of course, know that plan doesn't exactly pan out how Henry hopes it will, and his eventual falling out with Eleven serves as the catalyst for the entire series. The Netflix series explains the backstory between Eleven and Henry in Season 4, Episode 7, “The Massacre at Hawkins Lab.”

	











	The swap served as a fun way to bring the story full circle ahead of the final installments of the Netflix series. Stranger Things 5 Vol. 2 debuts on Christmas Day, and the finale follows a week later on New Year's Eve.

	That is the only scene in the stage play that comes directly from the series, as most of the show seeks to fill in some of the gaps about Henry's backstory after he moves to Hawkins in 1959.

	While The First Shadow doesn't provide much completely new information about Henry (playwright Kate Trefry had to walk a narrow line as to not make the final season inaccessible to Stranger Things viewers who couldn't make it to see the play), it does give some helpful context about what the character had gone through before we met him in Stranger Things 4.


	Season 5 also includes a few callbacks to the play, including a scene in Vol. 1 where Max (Sadie Sink), while trapped in Henry's mindscape, wanders into a memory from Hawkins High School in 1959 as a young Joyce Byers tries to publicize the school's performance of the musical Oklahoma!












	McCartney has played Henry Creel since The First Shadow debuted on West End in 2023, making his own Broadway debut this year when the play opened at the Marquis Theatre.

Timothée Chalamet shouted out his girlfriend Kylie Jenner in his new rap song with his rumored alter-ego  EsDeeKid. 

“It's Timothée Chalamet chillin', tryin' to stack $100 million. Girl got $1 billion,” he rapped on the remix of the Liverpool rapper's hit “4Raws,” which was released on Friday. 

The line was a clear nod to his business mogul girlfriend, who became the world's youngest billionaire in 2020. 

He also later referenced the Khy clothing founder as he rapped: “Look at the Triple A girl that chose me.”

A music video — which appeared to be shot at Andover Minimarket Off Licence in north London, per BBC — accompanied the song release, which was shared on Chalamet, 29, and EsDeeKid's Instagram profiles.

Fans started speculating that Chalamet had a rapping alter-ego after they noticed similarities between his eyes and the rap star's. 

In the clip, the Oscar-nominated actor further fueled speculation by opening his part wearing a bandana over the lower half of his face, much like the drill artist's persona. 

However, he then did a face reveal as he rapped his verse in which he also gave a shout out to his forthcoming film, “Marty Supreme.”

The release comes shortly after Chalamet and Jenner, 28, squashed breakup rumors by attending the Los Angeles “Marty Supreme” premiere together in matching outfits earlier this month.

The couple walked the red carpet in coordinating neon orange looks. Jenner posed for photos alongside her beau wearing a cleavage-bearing, floor-length gown with rib cut-outs. 

Chalamet, on the other hand, stood by her side in a neon-orange leather pant and jacket set, matching Timberland boots and a cross-body bag shaped like a table-tennis paddle.

There was no sign of trouble in paradise as the “Dune” star kept his hand on the Kylie Cosmetics founder's hip while taking their photographs. 

The stars, who have been dating for two years, became the subject of breakup speculation after Chalamet's absence was noted at Kris Jenner's 70th birthday party last month. 

At the time, a source explained Chalamet's absence by telling Us Weekly that he was away filming two huge projects.

However, the two were able to spend some time together prior to the red carpet outing as they celebrated Thanksgiving together.

	The full lineup for A Concert for Altadena is here. The event announced that Rufus Wainwright, Lucius, and Lord Huron will also be performing at the Jan. 7 concert, scheduled for the Pasadena Civic Auditorium to benefit those affected by the Eaton Fire. Actor John C. Reilly, an Altadena resident, will host the event.


	The show, led by Dawes, will also feature stars such as Brad Paisley, the Killers' Brandon Flowers, Stephen Stills, Jackson Browne, Mandy Moore, Aloe Blacc, and Jenny Lewis. Alt-rock veterans Everclear and the multi-genre collective Ozomatli will also play their own sets, with Taboo from Black Eyed Peas performing alongside the Latino group.


	Proceeds are set to go toward the Altadena Builds Back Foundation, part of the Pasadena Community Foundation. The foundation supports long-term housing recovery, food assistance, interim housing, mental health support, and more relief for families affected. “It's gonna be a heavy night,” Dawes said in a statement when it first announced the show, “but it's going to be a beautiful one too.”

	











	Dawes' Griffin Goldsmith lost his home in Altadena, and his brother Taylor's home studio and much of the band's gear were destroyed in the same area.   John C. Reilly's home in Altadena was also completely burnt down.

	The benefit concert will mark one year since the Eaton Fire devastated the region, taking the lives of 19 people, forcing 100,000 residents to evacuate, and destroying nearly 9,500 structures.

	After Tom Holland began filming his latest entry as Peter Parker in August, Spider-Man: Brand New Day has officially wrapped production.


	On Friday, director Destin Daniel Cretton revealed that the much anticipated fourth installment in the MCU‘s Spider-Man franchise has completed filming on the upcoming prelude to Avengers: Doomsday, set to premiere July 31 in theaters.


	“I'm so deeply grateful for the people who walked with me through the biggest, most rewarding film I've ever been a part of,” he wrote on Instagram with photos of himself with Holland and the movie's cast and crew, thanking his wife and kids for their support.

	“To our amazing cast, for breathing so much life into these beloved characters and moving us every day. To our unbelievable crew, who worked tirelessly with unmatched creativity and craftsmanship, who made me laugh so hard my stomach never stopped hurting,” Cretton continued. “I love you all so much and can't wait for the world to see your stunning work on the big screen. And of course, to @tomholland2013, for your kind, generous leadership on and off screen, for your relentless work ethic, your fearless performances, and for your friendship. That's a wrap on Spider-Man: Brand New Day!”


Filming began in Scotland in August, although production briefly halted the next month after Holland was treated for a mild concussion, reportedly during a stunt gone wrong, amid production on the Pinewood UK set of the Sony and Marvel Studios movie. The actor was taken to the hospital and examined, but not admitted. No other cast or crew was affected during the incident.

	











	Helmed by Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings), producers include Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige returning. Zendaya will reprise her role as MJ, with Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas also joining the cast in undisclosed roles.

Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling teamed up for a rare family outing with their two children ahead of the holidays. 

The “Notebook” actor was pictured alongside the “Other Guys” actress in upscale Montecito, Calif., outside a vehicle on Wednesday.

Gosling, 45, wore a long-sleeved graphic shirt with jeans, a yellow ball cap and brown boots for the outing.

Mendes, 51, rocked an olive-toned leisure suit with brown riding boots and a navy ball cap, accessorizing with a hot pink purse.

Daughters Esmerelda, 11, and Amada, 9, accompanied them — both donning red hoodie sweatshirts at one point. 

The “Hitch” star was seen laughing affectionately with their daughters before the entire family piled into a large vehicle to drive away. 

In other photos, Gosling gently led Amada — who carried a shopping bag and wore a charm bracelet — as they walked in the sunshine.

The outing marks a rare sighting for the power couple's daughters, whom they're known for keeping out of the public eye.

They met in 2011 while filming “The Place Beyond the Pines,” and welcomed Esmerelda in 2014, with Amada joining the famous family in 2016. 

In 2022, Mendes seemingly confirmed they'd secretly tied the knot, referring to Gosling as her “husband” during an appearance on Channel 9's “Today” in Australia — as Gosling filmed “The Fall Guy.”

Mendes once explained why she keeps her personal life so close to the vest. 

“I have always had a clear boundary when it comes to my man and my kids. I'll talk about them of course, with limits, but I won't post pictures of our daily life,” she wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post in 2020, per E! News.

“Since my children are still so little and don't understand what posting their image really means, I don't have their consent. And I won't post their image until they're old enough to give me consent.”

She continued, “As far as Ryan and I, it just works for us this way, to stay private.”

In April, Mendes gushed over Gosling in a rare social media tribute.

“My man is the F best!”  she captioned an Instagram upload, which began with photos of the “Barbie” star promoting “Fall Guy” with the stunt workers from the 2024 movie.

 “Unfortunately, success is almost only measured by box office,” she continued. “So I'm extra proud of my man for turning his entire ‘Fall Guy' press tour into a campaign to get stunts recognized by the Oscars.” 

“And now after almost 100 years of stunt design not being acknowledged by the Academy, it's officially a category!!” she wrote, acknowledging that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will begin honoring stunt workers, starting with films released in 2027. 

“This is a HUGE success! And an achievement that will last.”

One of the easiest ways to underestimate the “Avatar” films is to assume they're powered by unlimited imagination. But despite an astronomical budget, James Cameron's alien epic isn't a blank-check fantasy where anything goes. “Avatar: Fire and Ash” production designer Ben Procter says the opposite is true and the secret to Pandora's staying power lies in its restraint. 

“I think the way the audience responds to ‘Avatar' is that they love the stories, they love the characters, but they also just love the world,” Procter said during IndieWire's recent craft roundtable series. “If we don't do the research, that world won't feel real.”

That research-centric mentality defines how Cameron's core team evolves and expands their creative toolkit. Pandora isn't treated like an endlessly fruitful dreamscape, easily shifting to accommodate crowd-pleasing spectacle. Instead, it's designed like a living, breathing ecosystem — one that's governed not only by biological logic but also the constraints of limited resources.

 










“It's not just a free-flowing fantasy,” Procter said. “We don't have an unlimited palette in which to just play around. We're always grounding it.”

The production designers say that coherence is what allows audiences to suspend their disbelief and enter Pandora as real. Whether that grounding effect ultimately comes from Cameron's boundary-pushing use of real technology, or the theoretical biology his creative team has imbued on their shared creative landscape, the goal is plausibility. When viewers believe fantastical something exists, that encourages emotional investment in the performances. 

“Where it's a technology thing or a biological thing, we're always trying to make it something that could really exist,” Procter said. “Unconsciously, people treat it that way and they care about it.”

That's why environmental destruction in “Avatar” feels like a tangible loss, too. As Cameron's universe continues to grow beyond “Fire and Ash,” Procter and fellow production designer Dylan Cole won't rely on the auteur's imagination alone. They'll use it to truly trace his ideas and see how far they go, creating spectacle with real psychological weight from an alternate reality that in some sense does exist.

Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner's bodies have been returned to their family nearly a week after the couple was discovered stabbed to death in their Los Angeles home on Sunday. 

The bodies were given back to the family on Friday following an autopsy by the Los Angeles Medical Examiner, reports People. 

While the office confirmed that full autopsies had been performed on both Rob and Michele's bodies, the outlet noted that a full, detailed medical report from the coroner likely won't be available for the next 90 days.

However, their official causes of death were revealed to be “multiple sharp force injuries,” according to a Wednesday report from the LACME office. Their deaths were ruled a homicide.

The Los Angeles Medical Examiner's office did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.

Sources previously told The Post that Rob and Michele's daughter, Romy, found the couple's bodies with their throats slit and multiple stab wounds on Sunday. Rob was 78. Michele was 70.

In the hours leading up to their deaths, which police believe took place in the early hours of Sunday morning, Rob and Michele were last seen attending Conan O'Brien's holiday party on Saturday night.

While there, a lifelong family friend of the Reiners told The Post that the parents got into an explosive fight with their son Nick.

“They had had an argument at Conan's holiday party, and Rob had been telling people that they're scared for Nick and scared that his mental state was deteriorating,” they shared. 

Nick's erratic behavior was allegedly witnessed by several other party goers, according to multiple outlets.

In addition to reports that Nick interrupted a conversation with comedian Bill Hader, sources told the Daily Mail on Friday that the 32-year-old, who has publicly struggled with drug addiction, worried other party attendees enough that some guests thought to call 911 following his altercation with his parents. 

However, O'Brien was said to have “talked them out of calling the police” that night. 

Nick was eventually arrested Sunday evening in connection with his parents' passing and has since been charged with two counts of first degree murder.

A rep for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office told Page Six that he was taken to Parker Center Jail in Downtown Los Angeles and later transferred to Twin Towers Correctional Facility, where he is currently being held without bail.

Nick made his first court appearance since his parents' deaths on Wednesday. After, his attorney, famed defense attorney Alan Jackson, told reporters outside the courthouse that an arraignment has been set for Jan. 7, 2026.

Gaurav Tiwari was one of the most recognisable names in India's paranormal community, a figure who combined traditional knowledge with modern technology to study, document, and understand paranormal phenomena.

Nearly a decade after his death, he remains a compelling, controversial and mysterious presence. The renewed attention stems from Bhay: The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery, a recent web series that revisits the investigator's life, the cases that shaped his public persona, and the unanswered questions surrounding his final hours.

His journey into the paranormal was far from predictable. Before he became a household name associated with ghosts, UFO sightings and unexplained events, Tiwari trained to become a commercial pilot, an early ambition that placed him on a completely different career trajectory.

Early Life And The Encounter That Changed His Path

Born in 1984, Gaurav Tiwari initially pursued aviation, completing pilot training in Singapore and later moving to Florida, USA. It was there, in 2007, that he and his housemates reportedly encountered a series of disturbances, experiences he later described as poltergeist-like activity, unexplained whispers, footsteps from the attic and sightings of a translucent apparition of a young girl. These episodes left a lasting impact on him, pushing him to seek scientific explanations for events that defied easy logic.

Around the same period, he also explored metaphysical studies, eventually becoming an ordained minister of the Metaphysical Church of Humanistic Science. His training expanded into certification as a paranormal investigator and UFO field investigator, giving him a unique blend of spiritual insight and technical methodology.

Building The Indian Paranormal Society

After returning to India in 2009, Tiwari founded the Indian Paranormal Society (IPS), positioned as the country's first formal organisation to investigate alleged hauntings using scientific tools and structured analysis. His approach rejected superstition and ritual-based fear, prioritising EMF readings, sound mapping, environmental factors, infrasound, chemical exposure and psychological triggers.

Over the next few years, he and his team reportedly examined more than 6,000 “haunted" locations, from Bhangarh Fort and Mukesh Mills to homes, institutions and abandoned industrial sites. Many investigations concluded that phenomena attributed to ghosts could be explained through infrasound, hallucinations, carbon monoxide exposure or stress.

Despite IPS having access to advanced equipment such as full-spectrum cameras, the team remained heavily reliant on Tiwari's judgement and field instincts, a sign of the strong investigative reputation he had built.

A Rising Television Personality And The Face Of India's Paranormal Scene

Tiwari's calm presence and data-driven approach brought him significant media visibility. He appeared in multiple shows, including Haunted Weekends with Sunny Leone, Bhoot Aaya, Fear Files, MTV He Ticket and MTV Girls Night Out, the last of which featured him spending nights inside allegedly haunted structures under camera surveillance. His appearances helped mainstream the idea of scientific paranormal investigations in India.

Before his shift to the unexplained, Tiwari also pursued acting, appearing in films such as 16 December and Tango Charlie, adding yet another layer to his eclectic public identity.

The Final Days And An Unsettling Case

One of the last cases he reportedly worked on was in Janakpuri, West Delhi, involving a young woman who claimed to be haunted by multiple entities. According to family statements in multiple news reports, Tiwari spoke of feeling disturbed and even “pulled by a negative force" afterward, though no independent evidence ever substantiated these feelings. Those close to him also mentioned that he had occasionally spoken about sensing “negative energies".

There were also hints of personal pressure and family disagreements, though the nature of these issues was never fully documented.

His Death And The Questions That Refuse To Fade

On 7 July 2016, Gaurav Tiwari was found dead in the bathroom of his Dwarka apartment at the age of 31. His family heard a loud thud, forced open the door, and discovered him unresponsive with a thin black line around his neck. Early reactions called it an unexplained death, given the suddenness of the incident and the absence of any documented health concerns.

The Delhi Police later concluded the death was a suicide by asphyxia, suggesting he had used a dupatta to hang himself from an iron rod. Officials cited personal issues and stress as possible contributing factors. His family disputed the suicide finding, pointing to his recent marriage, lack of a note and his active professional life. The absence of clarity ensured that speculation continued, ranging from psychological strain to theories linked to his paranormal work.

No conclusive evidence in any direction ever emerged, leaving the case suspended between official closure and lingering doubt.

Revisiting His Legacy Through The Screen

The mystery around his death continues to inspire retellings, documentaries and discussions, the latest being Bhay: The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery. The series stars Karan Tacker as Tiwari, alongside Kalki Koechlin, Saloni Batra and Danish Sood, and is directed by Robbie Grewal. It explores his investigations, the eerie spaces he walked into, the energies he documented, and the shadow of uncertainty that surrounds his final hours. The show began streaming on Amazon MX Player on 12 December.

More than eight years after his death, Gaurav Tiwari remains an unresolved figure, a man who popularised scientific paranormal investigation in India, refused superstition, chased the unexplained across thousands of locations, and left behind a story that continues to provoke fascination, debate and unease.

Our third interstellar visitor that we have detected, comet 3I/ATLAS, has been found to contain molecules that are key for life. But what does that mean? 

If you don't know the story by now, on July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System did its job beautifully and spotted an object as it hurtled its way through our Solar System. The object, now known to be a comet due to its distinct cometary behavior, was soon confirmed to be interstellar, and likely older than the Solar System it is temporarily passing through.

      

It has traveled alone, possibly for billions of years, and now as it heads through our neck of the cosmos astronomers on Earth and using humanity's space-based telescopes have had an opportunity to study it – a traveler from a different part of the galaxy, and an earlier age in the universe. But while December 19 brought the object's closest approach to Earth, we won't have too long before it heads out of the Solar System and away from our gawping telescopes.

“That's the great joy of interstellar objects, they're giving us clues, because they're made up of the building blocks of planet formation elsewhere in the galaxy. They're telling us about a star that's so ancient it might not even exist anymore," Associate Professor Michele Bannister, from the School of Physical and Chemical Sciences at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC), and key member of a team studying the object, explained in a statement.

"This comet is a calling card from the past, and we only have a few hundred days to try and interpret what it's telling us.”  

In our short time viewing the object, scientists have found some interesting things and unusual chemistry. Of particular interest is that it contains molecules that are key to life, and in abundance compared to most Solar System comets.

"We report the detection of methanol (CH3OH) toward interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Atacama Compact Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) on UT 2025 August 28, September 18 and 22, and October 1, and of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on September 12 and 15," a recent preprint paper explains.

"The CH3OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H2O sublimation zone at r H = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH3OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of 124+30 −34 and 79+11−14 on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous Solar System comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)."

To be clear, these molecules are not themselves indication of life on the comet. We've had enough of the (unnecessary and outlandish) hypothesis that 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft, we don't want people thinking that the comet contains life either. But they are considered so-called "building blocks" of life.

"Life as we know it requires building blocks, such as amino acids," NASA explains, "and hydrogen cyanide is one of the most important and versatile molecules needed to form amino acids." 

Similarly, methanol can be used to form more complex molecules like sugars, amino acids, and DNA/RNA precursors. In 3I/ATLAS, methanol is unusually abundant, making up around 8 percent of the comet's vapor, compared to around 2 percent in solar system comets. 

“It seems really chemically implausible that you could go on a path to very high chemical complexity without producing methanol,” Martin Cordiner, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and author on the paper, explained to New Scientist.

      

While seeing these building blocks doesn't mean that there are complex molecules on 3I/ATLAS, it is still intriguing to see them in our third interstellar visitor. It has long been suggested that asteroids and comets could have seeded early Earth with the essential ingredients for life, such as organic molecules and water. 

These, including evidence for water ice, have all been seen on comet 3I/ATLAS. While many on the Internet, and certain Harvard astronomers, cling onto the "alien spacecraft" hypothesis, the presence of these ingredients necessary for life could be among our first evidence that the building blocks of life are out there in the galaxy. And though we need to wait for more study and evidence, perhaps from a fourth interstellar visitor, that's pretty exciting indeed.

The preprint has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters and is available via arXiv.

Eating lunch before I headed home from the country-house party, we got to talking about my love of animals. My fellow guests had been shooting, then to church – a mismatch of beliefs as strange as my marriage.

We got to talking about my reasons for being vegan: I believe every animal has a right to a life free from confinement and violence. A fellow guest said that she and other family members were psychic and that a visiting aunt had recently said to her, 'Oh, you have a rabbit at your feet.' My fellow guest had lost her rabbit when she was little.

When I'm driving, I always feel Gracie, the collie I lost to cancer, on the back seat. As she was so chewy, she couldn't be left, so accompanied me everywhere.

Two years ago, I had to leave super-early to catch a train to Bath to give a talk to third-year journalism students (one asked me, when I was regaling them with stories of my interviews with film stars, 'What does sycophantic mean?'). There was thick snow, I was worried about catching the train and so I asked my neighbour, from whom I rent the stables and 26 acres, if she could make sure all the horses had their heads over the stable doors; Nic, my assistant who looks after them, would have still been asleep at home a few miles away. As I boarded the train, my neighbour sent me a photo and an urgent message. 'I've just checked them. Quincy [Nic's horse] is on the floor. He's breathing, but he can't get up.'

I had never, ever asked her to check them before.

I alerted Nic, who raced to the yard at 80mph and, with a vet, managed to get her horse to his feet. We don't think he has laid down since, due to loss of confidence. Horses who get cast can panic, get a twisted gut and die.

Another time I was walking my dogs late and I thought, I really need to check the gates to the paddocks. To my horror, one was wide open. Oh my god! Using the torch on my phone, I raced into the field to check the horses were still there while phoning Nic.

It turned out thieves had stolen our quad bike, wheeled it through the fields and, after cutting the chain, left the gate wide open. The police weren't interested.

My mum was psychic. She woke one morning convinced my brother had been in a fight. She went to his room and, yes, her vision was right: his pillow was covered in blood. One day, a man came to our door and told her that her daughter (my sister) was being followed by evil spirits. My sister died of alcohol-related disease, having lost her son to leukaemia. She was never lucky in love, despite being sweet and beautiful.

After my dad died, my mum said she would see him in the hallway, handsome, young, impeccable in his Army uniform. Suffering from dementia for a decade, she would plead with her carers to let her join him.

'I want to be with Robert,' she would say. The carers had no idea this was her late husband's name.

'There is no Robert!' they would say, trying to calm her down but only adding to her confusion.

There is a storm here in the Yorkshire Dales and Nic has just texted me to say she was checking the fields before turning out the horses – Quincy, my ex-racehorse Swirly and Blue Cross rescue pony Pocket – for the night now it's calmer.

'I was walking around in the dark, checking the fences, and I felt Jac, Benji and Dream walking beside me.' We lost her palomino Jac on Halloween 2024, my ponies Benji and Dream a few years before. 'They were escorting me across the field, it felt really strong. And then I spoke to my mum – I didn't mention what had happened – and she said she had a dream last night that she was in the field with Benji and Jac, who were standing next to each other. How weird is that?'

I really hope Gracie doesn't know she's dead: she's too small to cope with that, would panic if her breakfast was late. But I'm certain she knows she was loved.

Have a very merry Christmas. Hug your loved ones close.

Supernatural thrillers place ordinary people in situations where something unseen always feels close by. Fear builds slowly, turning everyday moments into tense and unsettling ones. Strange sounds, dark corners and unexpected twists keep the pressure high in every scene. These stories rely more on mood and mystery than loud scares, making the tension last longer and keeping you hooked until the very end. Get ready for some scary fun as we present movies that will take you on a nail-biting journey.

This supernatural thriller follows Mia (Sophie Wilde), a lonely teenager still struggling with her mother's death. One night, she and her friends discover a strange embalmed hand that allows them to communicate with spirits when they hold it and say, “Talk to me.” What starts as a thrilling party game quickly turns dangerous. Mia becomes obsessed with the hand after she believes she has contacted her mother's spirit. Her best friend Jade, Jade's younger brother Riley, and others soon realise the spirits don't always tell the truth, and some don't want to leave. As possessions grow more violent and rules are broken, the supernatural presence begins to bleed into the real world. The movie builds tension through short, intense scenes, showing how curiosity and grief can open doors that are impossible to shut.

Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist who is trying to help an eight-year-old boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole is quiet, scared and carries a terrifying secret — he can see and talk to dead people who don't know they are gone. These spirits appear suddenly and often look frightening, leaving Cole constantly anxious. As Malcolm spends more time with Cole, he slowly gains the boy's trust and encourages him to talk about what he sees. Cole's ability affects his relationship with his mother, Lynn Sear, who struggles to understand her son's strange behaviour and growing fear. Here, silence and small moments rather than loud scares evoke a sense of dread. Each encounter with the supernatural adds to the mystery, leading to an emotional and unforgettable twist at the end.

Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is an artist dealing with the death of her mother. As her family tries to move on, strange things start happening in their home. Her husband Steve, son Peter, and daughter Charlie begin to feel that something is very wrong. After a sudden tragedy, the family's grief takes a darker turn. Annie discovers unsettling details about her mother's past and suspects a powerful, unseen force is at work. The story slowly grows more disturbing as grief and fear take over. The tense mood and shocking scenes keep the movie unsettling from start to finish.

Manohar (R Madhavan), an ordinary man, moves into a new apartment, 13B on the 13th floor, with his family. Life seems normal until the family starts watching a TV serial called Yavarum Nalam (Everyone is Well). However, Manohar soon realises the show is mirroring events happening inside his own home and that it is not airing anywhere else. As each episode predicts something frightening before it happens, fear slowly takes over the family. Manohar tries to understand the connection between the serial and the apartment, only to uncover a dark past linked to the building. The tension grows with every episode, turning everyday family life into a chilling supernatural mystery and an adrenaline-fuelled finale.

The plot unfolds in 1967. A young medical student, John Form (Ward Horton), gifts his pregnant wife, Mia (Annabelle Wallis), a vintage doll – Mia loves collecting dolls and adding to her collection. However, after Annabelled enters their house, disturbing and violent events begin inside their home. After a tragedy, the two relocate to a new place, but the doll appears to draw in a dark presence that refuses to let them live in peace. As the fear escalates, Mia learns that Annabelle is connected to a deadly cult and acts as a conduit to a powerful demonic force. With their baby in danger, the couple struggles to survive the growing horror. The movie is part of The Conjuring Universe, expanding the world introduced by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, and linking the doll's story to a much larger web of supernatural evil.

Michael Karthikeyan (Vijay Sethupathi), a pizza delivery boy who does not believe in ghosts, and his girlfriend Anu (Ramya), who is deeply interested in the paranormal. One night, Michael is sent to deliver a pizza to an old, isolated bungalow. What should be a routine job quickly turns terrifying when strange things begin to happen inside the house. Trapped in the bungalow, Michael experiences events that challenge his disbelief. As fear takes over, the story moves between what seems supernatural and what might be something else entirely. The movie keeps the tension high with constant twists, making it hard to guess what is real until the very end.

Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub) is a widowed father who suddenly inherits a strange glass house from his late uncle. Arthur moves in with his children, Kathy and Bobby, along with their nanny, Maggie. Soon, they discover that the house is not ordinary – it is designed to hold twelve dangerous ghosts, each trapped behind powerful spells. As the seals begin to fail, the spirits are released one by one, turning the house into a deadly maze. With the help of psychic Kalina Oretzia and ghost hunter Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard), the family learns that a thirteenth ghost is needed to complete a dark ritual. The movie delivers constant danger and fast-paced supernatural chaos, keeping the tension high throughout.

Jewish leaders and groups in California's Bay Area have blasted socialist Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez's apology for sharing heinous antisemitic conspiracies online — and have even formed a new political advocacy organization over concerns about rising Jew-hate.

Martinez, a proud member of the ultra-left Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), is facing intense pressure to resign after he amplified sickening posts on LinkedIn claiming the Bondi Beach terror attack in Australia was a “false flag” operation and blaming Israel for rising antisemitism.

The embattled lefty pol deleted the posts and apologized, insisting, “We should not conflate Zionism with Judaism.”

However, critics are ripping the tepid regrets as a cop-out that failed to address the harm.  

Sam Yebri, a former Los Angeles City Council candidate with strong ties to the LA Jewish community, said that sharing hateful rhetoric is “beyond a mistake” with dangerous real-world consequences. 

“Martinez has consistently and repeatedly trafficked in the worst antisemitism imaginable, and now has put the lives of his Jewish constituents in jeopardy,” Yebri told The Post.

Rabbi Dean Kertesz, a recently retired longtime rabbi of Temple Beth El in Richmond, who describes himself as both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian, also labeled Martinez's actions as blatant “hatred of Jews.”

“My first reaction is anger,” Kertesz said.

“What we're seeing is not legitimate criticism of Israeli policy. It's hatred of Jews. And that's where this road leads.”

The Bay Area Jewish community is so concerned about rising antisemitism that they have formed a new political advocacy organization.

It was launched last summer in response to what leaders described as a growing sense that traditional approaches were no longer enough.

The group was structured for political muscle — free to lobby, pressure lawmakers and engage in hard-nosed advocacy — a sharp break from the cautious, charity-only approach that has long defined many Jewish institutions.

“During this unprecedented and uncertain moment for Bay Area Jews, it is crucial that our community feels safe, heard and understood,” Neal Rubin, president of BAJA, told The Post.

“BAJA is an important new resource that will allow us to build real influence with lawmakers and advocate forcefully for our shared values.”

Jonathan Mintzer, the organization's director, warned that antisemitism is no longer lurking in the shadows – but surfacing in mainstream politics and public office.

Mintzer insisted Mayor Martinez's response exposed a deeper breakdown — not just poor judgment, but a failure of accountability. 

Martinez, he said, should confront “what a real apology actually means,” including acknowledging why the posts were harmful, how they stoked fear, and how rhetoric that demonizes Jews and Israelis can lay the groundwork for real-world violence.

Jeremy Russell, director of marketing and communications at Bay Area Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC), said that since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Richmond's City Council — including members aligned with the DSA — has increasingly drawn the Israel-Hamas war into municipal governance.

This even culminated in a formal resolution declaring the city's support and solidarity with the Palestinian people of Gaza.

Jewish leaders say the vote didn't land in a vacuum. Instead, it amplified a growing sense of isolation and unease among Jewish residents, who watched an international conflict take center stage in local government chambers.

“This is something we felt we had to do,” Russell said of the newly formed advocacy group. “There's a real perception that this is getting worse.”

This is a particular concern Russell has with Martinez.

“This didn't start with one post,” he said. “We've engaged with the mayor and the city council before. We realized we were getting nowhere.”

Kertesz said Martinez's role as mayor also magnifies the consequences, giving his words and actions added weight — and making the fallout far more dangerous.

“He's the mayor,” Kertesz said. “What he says publicly reflects on the city. He doesn't get to separate his politics from his office.”

The JCRC has circulated an open letter calling on Martinez to resign, citing what it described as a pattern of behavior rather than an isolated mistake.

The letter also flagged Martinez's appearance at the People's Conference for Palestine in Detroit last summer, where he was photographed wearing a hat bearing the acronym “DDTTIDF,” which the Anti-Defamation League said is an acronym for “Death, Death to the Israeli Defense Forces.”

Martinez later said he did not understand the meaning of the acronym and does not condone violence — explanations Jewish leaders say only sharpened concerns about judgment and awareness.

The DSA, meanwhile, has taken openly anti-Israel positions, including calls to halt US military aid and support boycott efforts — stances Jewish leaders say have helped normalize antisemitism under the banner of political speech.

“Martinez must resign and leave public life forever, and other DSA candidates and elected officials like him should stop inviting violence against Jews in America,” said Yebri. 

The Post reached out to Martinez's office and the East Bay DSA for comment.

The DSA told The Post that it would pass our request to its Steering Committee Chairs.

The first alien signal humanity detects might not come from a thriving civilization, but rather from one in decline, possibly sending a cry for help.

That's the central idea behind a new paper by Columbia University astrophysicist David Kipping, who argues that the earliest confirmed signs of extraterrestrial intelligence are likely to be rare, unusually strong, and possibly tied to a civilization's final phase.

Kipping's research, titled The Eschatian Hypothesis, is set to appear in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is currently available on the arXiv preprint server.

The Greek word “eschatian” stems from “eschatology,” a religious term referring to the end of times, a fitting description for what may be the nature of the first alien contact.

He suggests that just as we tend to detect the brightest and most extreme astrophysical events first, the same might apply to intelligent life.

The initial alien signal might not represent the average extraterrestrial society but could instead be a one-time event—an unstable or even dying civilization releasing a powerful burst of detectable energy.

Kipping, who directs the Cool Worlds Lab and runs a YouTube channel under the same name, draws on history to support his theory. Early discoveries in astronomy often captured only the most obvious, dramatic objects.

For example, the first exoplanets were found orbiting pulsars—not because such planets are common, but because their presence altered the pulsars' precise timing in a way our instruments could detect. Similarly, many stars visible to the naked eye are not the most common, but rather the most luminous.

This detection bias, Kipping argues, means we are more likely to spot a civilization during a loud, visible moment—perhaps even during collapse. In one of his videos, he speculates whether the 1977 Wow! signal could have been such a moment, a desperate message from a society nearing its end.

Rather than chasing narrowly defined signs of life, Kipping believes future searches should focus on broad, unusual signals that don't match known natural phenomena.

These short-lived, high-intensity events are more likely to appear in wide-field sky surveys. He points to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as key tools already making this approach possible.

If his hypothesis proves correct, humanity's first contact may not be a grand arrival, but a fleeting, powerful sign from a distant world—one possibly asking for help before fading away.
