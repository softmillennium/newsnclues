      This incident is often cited as one of the most compelling due to the large number of child witnesses.
    


"The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gaurav Tiwari was one of the most recognisable names in India's paranormal community, a figure who combined traditional knowledge with modern technology to study, document, and understand paranormal phenomena. His journey into the paranormal was far from predictable. Early Life And The Encounter That Changed His Path It was there, in 2007, that he and his housemates reportedly encountered a series of disturbances, experiences he later described as poltergeist-like activity, unexplained whispers, footsteps from the attic and sightings of a translucent apparition of a young girl. His training expanded into certification as a paranormal investigator and UFO field investigator, giving him a unique blend of spiritual insight and technical methodology. After returning to India in 2009, Tiwari founded the Indian Paranormal Society (IPS), positioned as the country's first formal organisation to investigate alleged hauntings using scientific tools and structured analysis. Many investigations concluded that phenomena attributed to ghosts could be explained through infrasound, hallucinations, carbon monoxide exposure or stress. Despite IPS having access to advanced equipment such as full-spectrum cameras, the team remained heavily reliant on Tiwari's judgement and field instincts, a sign of the strong investigative reputation he had built. A Rising Television Personality And The Face Of India's Paranormal Scene Tiwari's calm presence and data-driven approach brought him significant media visibility. He appeared in multiple shows, including Haunted Weekends with Sunny Leone, Bhoot Aaya, Fear Files, MTV He Ticket and MTV Girls Night Out, the last of which featured him spending nights inside allegedly haunted structures under camera surveillance. His appearances helped mainstream the idea of scientific paranormal investigations in India. Before his shift to the unexplained, Tiwari also pursued acting, appearing in films such as 16 December and Tango Charlie, adding yet another layer to his eclectic public identity. One of the last cases he reportedly worked on was in Janakpuri, West Delhi, involving a young woman who claimed to be haunted by multiple entities. According to family statements in multiple news reports, Tiwari spoke of feeling disturbed and even “pulled by a negative force" afterward, though no independent evidence ever substantiated these feelings. Those close to him also mentioned that he had occasionally spoken about sensing “negative energies". His Death And The Questions That Refuse To Fade His family heard a loud thud, forced open the door, and discovered him unresponsive with a thin black line around his neck. The Delhi Police later concluded the death was a suicide by asphyxia, suggesting he had used a dupatta to hang himself from an iron rod. Officials cited personal issues and stress as possible contributing factors. No conclusive evidence in any direction ever emerged, leaving the case suspended between official closure and lingering doubt. More than eight years after his death, Gaurav Tiwari remains an unresolved figure, a man who popularised scientific paranormal investigation in India, refused superstition, chased the unexplained across thousands of locations, and left behind a story that continues to provoke fascination, debate and unease.</p>

If you don't know the story by now, on July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System did its job beautifully and spotted an object as it hurtled its way through our Solar System. It has traveled alone, possibly for billions of years, and now as it heads through our neck of the cosmos astronomers on Earth and using humanity's space-based telescopes have had an opportunity to study it – a traveler from a different part of the galaxy, and an earlier age in the universe. But while December 19 brought the object's closest approach to Earth, we won't have too long before it heads out of the Solar System and away from our gawping telescopes. They're telling us about a star that's so ancient it might not even exist anymore," Associate Professor Michele Bannister, from the School of Physical and Chemical Sciences at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC), and key member of a team studying the object, explained in a statement. "This comet is a calling card from the past, and we only have a few hundred days to try and interpret what it's telling us.” In our short time viewing the object, scientists have found some interesting things and unusual chemistry. Of particular interest is that it contains molecules that are key to life, and in abundance compared to most Solar System comets. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH3OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of 124+30 −34 and 79+11−14 on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous Solar System comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)." To be clear, these molecules are not themselves indication of life on the comet. We've had enough of the (unnecessary and outlandish) hypothesis that 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft, we don't want people thinking that the comet contains life either. "Life as we know it requires building blocks, such as amino acids," NASA explains, "and hydrogen cyanide is one of the most important and versatile molecules needed to form amino acids." Similarly, methanol can be used to form more complex molecules like sugars, amino acids, and DNA/RNA precursors. “It seems really chemically implausible that you could go on a path to very high chemical complexity without producing methanol,” Martin Cordiner, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and author on the paper, explained to New Scientist. While seeing these building blocks doesn't mean that there are complex molecules on 3I/ATLAS, it is still intriguing to see them in our third interstellar visitor. It has long been suggested that asteroids and comets could have seeded early Earth with the essential ingredients for life, such as organic molecules and water. These, including evidence for water ice, have all been seen on comet 3I/ATLAS. All “explainer” articles are confirmed by fact checkers to be correct at time of publishing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eating lunch before I headed home from the country-house party, we got to talking about my love of animals. My fellow guests had been shooting, then to church – a mismatch of beliefs as strange as my marriage. We got to talking about my reasons for being vegan: I believe every animal has a right to a life free from confinement and violence. A fellow guest said that she and other family members were psychic and that a visiting aunt had recently said to her, 'Oh, you have a rabbit at your feet.' My fellow guest had lost her rabbit when she was little. There was thick snow, I was worried about catching the train and so I asked my neighbour, from whom I rent the stables and 26 acres, if she could make sure all the horses had their heads over the stable doors; Nic, my assistant who looks after them, would have still been asleep at home a few miles away. As I boarded the train, my neighbour sent me a photo and an urgent message. Quincy [Nic's horse] is on the floor. I had never, ever asked her to check them before. We don't think he has laid down since, due to loss of confidence. To my horror, one was wide open. It turned out thieves had stolen our quad bike, wheeled it through the fields and, after cutting the chain, left the gate wide open. She woke one morning convinced my brother had been in a fight. She went to his room and, yes, her vision was right: his pillow was covered in blood. One day, a man came to our door and told her that her daughter (my sister) was being followed by evil spirits. My sister died of alcohol-related disease, having lost her son to leukaemia. She was never lucky in love, despite being sweet and beautiful. After my dad died, my mum said she would see him in the hallway, handsome, young, impeccable in his Army uniform. Suffering from dementia for a decade, she would plead with her carers to let her join him. 'I want to be with Robert,' she would say. The carers had no idea this was her late husband's name. There is a storm here in the Yorkshire Dales and Nic has just texted me to say she was checking the fields before turning out the horses – Quincy, my ex-racehorse Swirly and Blue Cross rescue pony Pocket – for the night now it's calmer. 'I was walking around in the dark, checking the fences, and I felt Jac, Benji and Dream walking beside me.' We lost her palomino Jac on Halloween 2024, my ponies Benji and Dream a few years before. 'They were escorting me across the field, it felt really strong. And then I spoke to my mum – I didn't mention what had happened – and she said she had a dream last night that she was in the field with Benji and Jac, who were standing next to each other. I really hope Gracie doesn't know she's dead: she's too small to cope with that, would panic if her breakfast was late.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural thrillers place ordinary people in situations where something unseen always feels close by. Fear builds slowly, turning everyday moments into tense and unsettling ones. Strange sounds, dark corners and unexpected twists keep the pressure high in every scene. These stories rely more on mood and mystery than loud scares, making the tension last longer and keeping you hooked until the very end. Get ready for some scary fun as we present movies that will take you on a nail-biting journey. This supernatural thriller follows Mia (Sophie Wilde), a lonely teenager still struggling with her mother's death. One night, she and her friends discover a strange embalmed hand that allows them to communicate with spirits when they hold it and say, “Talk to me.” What starts as a thrilling party game quickly turns dangerous. Her best friend Jade, Jade's younger brother Riley, and others soon realise the spirits don't always tell the truth, and some don't want to leave. The movie builds tension through short, intense scenes, showing how curiosity and grief can open doors that are impossible to shut. Dr Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a child psychologist who is trying to help an eight-year-old boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Cole is quiet, scared and carries a terrifying secret — he can see and talk to dead people who don't know they are gone. These spirits appear suddenly and often look frightening, leaving Cole constantly anxious. As Malcolm spends more time with Cole, he slowly gains the boy's trust and encourages him to talk about what he sees. Here, silence and small moments rather than loud scares evoke a sense of dread. Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is an artist dealing with the death of her mother. As her family tries to move on, strange things start happening in their home. Her husband Steve, son Peter, and daughter Charlie begin to feel that something is very wrong. Annie discovers unsettling details about her mother's past and suspects a powerful, unseen force is at work. The story slowly grows more disturbing as grief and fear take over. Manohar (R Madhavan), an ordinary man, moves into a new apartment, 13B on the 13th floor, with his family. Life seems normal until the family starts watching a TV serial called Yavarum Nalam (Everyone is Well). As each episode predicts something frightening before it happens, fear slowly takes over the family. The tension grows with every episode, turning everyday family life into a chilling supernatural mystery and an adrenaline-fuelled finale. A young medical student, John Form (Ward Horton), gifts his pregnant wife, Mia (Annabelle Wallis), a vintage doll – Mia loves collecting dolls and adding to her collection. Michael Karthikeyan (Vijay Sethupathi), a pizza delivery boy who does not believe in ghosts, and his girlfriend Anu (Ramya), who is deeply interested in the paranormal. What should be a routine job quickly turns terrifying when strange things begin to happen inside the house. Trapped in the bungalow, Michael experiences events that challenge his disbelief. Soon, they discover that the house is not ordinary – it is designed to hold twelve dangerous ghosts, each trapped behind powerful spells. With the help of psychic Kalina Oretzia and ghost hunter Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard), the family learns that a thirteenth ghost is needed to complete a dark ritual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jewish leaders and groups in California's Bay Area have blasted socialist Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez's apology for sharing heinous antisemitic conspiracies online — and have even formed a new political advocacy organization over concerns about rising Jew-hate. Martinez, a proud member of the ultra-left Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), is facing intense pressure to resign after he amplified sickening posts on LinkedIn claiming the Bondi Beach terror attack in Australia was a “false flag” operation and blaming Israel for rising antisemitism. Sam Yebri, a former Los Angeles City Council candidate with strong ties to the LA Jewish community, said that sharing hateful rhetoric is “beyond a mistake” with dangerous real-world consequences. Rabbi Dean Kertesz, a recently retired longtime rabbi of Temple Beth El in Richmond, who describes himself as both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian, also labeled Martinez's actions as blatant “hatred of Jews.” “What we're seeing is not legitimate criticism of Israeli policy. The Bay Area Jewish community is so concerned about rising antisemitism that they have formed a new political advocacy organization. It was launched last summer in response to what leaders described as a growing sense that traditional approaches were no longer enough. The group was structured for political muscle — free to lobby, pressure lawmakers and engage in hard-nosed advocacy — a sharp break from the cautious, charity-only approach that has long defined many Jewish institutions. “During this unprecedented and uncertain moment for Bay Area Jews, it is crucial that our community feels safe, heard and understood,” Neal Rubin, president of BAJA, told The Post. “BAJA is an important new resource that will allow us to build real influence with lawmakers and advocate forcefully for our shared values.” Jonathan Mintzer, the organization's director, warned that antisemitism is no longer lurking in the shadows – but surfacing in mainstream politics and public office. Martinez, he said, should confront “what a real apology actually means,” including acknowledging why the posts were harmful, how they stoked fear, and how rhetoric that demonizes Jews and Israelis can lay the groundwork for real-world violence. Jeremy Russell, director of marketing and communications at Bay Area Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC), said that since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Richmond's City Council — including members aligned with the DSA — has increasingly drawn the Israel-Hamas war into municipal governance. Jewish leaders say the vote didn't land in a vacuum. Instead, it amplified a growing sense of isolation and unease among Jewish residents, who watched an international conflict take center stage in local government chambers. “There's a real perception that this is getting worse.” This is a particular concern Russell has with Martinez. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Kertesz said Martinez's role as mayor also magnifies the consequences, giving his words and actions added weight — and making the fallout far more dangerous. The JCRC has circulated an open letter calling on Martinez to resign, citing what it described as a pattern of behavior rather than an isolated mistake. Martinez later said he did not understand the meaning of the acronym and does not condone violence — explanations Jewish leaders say only sharpened concerns about judgment and awareness. The DSA, meanwhile, has taken openly anti-Israel positions, including calls to halt US military aid and support boycott efforts — stances Jewish leaders say have helped normalize antisemitism under the banner of political speech.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first alien signal humanity detects might not come from a thriving civilization, but rather from one in decline, possibly sending a cry for help. That's the central idea behind a new paper by Columbia University astrophysicist David Kipping, who argues that the earliest confirmed signs of extraterrestrial intelligence are likely to be rare, unusually strong, and possibly tied to a civilization's final phase. He suggests that just as we tend to detect the brightest and most extreme astrophysical events first, the same might apply to intelligent life. The initial alien signal might not represent the average extraterrestrial society but could instead be a one-time event—an unstable or even dying civilization releasing a powerful burst of detectable energy. Kipping, who directs the Cool Worlds Lab and runs a YouTube channel under the same name, draws on history to support his theory. Early discoveries in astronomy often captured only the most obvious, dramatic objects. For example, the first exoplanets were found orbiting pulsars—not because such planets are common, but because their presence altered the pulsars' precise timing in a way our instruments could detect. This detection bias, Kipping argues, means we are more likely to spot a civilization during a loud, visible moment—perhaps even during collapse. In one of his videos, he speculates whether the 1977 Wow! Rather than chasing narrowly defined signs of life, Kipping believes future searches should focus on broad, unusual signals that don't match known natural phenomena. These short-lived, high-intensity events are more likely to appear in wide-field sky surveys. Contact our newsroom  to report an update or send your story, photos and videos.
