                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A photograph of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor shows him sprawled across the laps of five women as Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend Maxwell looks on. The photograph shows Maxwell smiling at Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, who is wearing a black suit and bow tie and smiling with his face close to the bare legs of one of the women, whose identities have all been obscured. He is set to move to Sandringham permanently next year after being forced out by the King over his friendship with Epstein. Sandringham was the scene of what Mr Mountbatten-Windsor described as a “straightforward shooting weekend” during his catastrophic Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis in 2019. Another photograph from the Epstein files shows Maxwell, who is now serving 20 years in prison for sex trafficking, standing outside 10 Downing Street. One picture captures the pair with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor in the Royal Box at Ascot, probably on a well-documented visit to Ladies' Day in June 2000, when both Elizabeth II and the late Queen Mother were in attendance. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has since described Epstein as his “plus one”, and in no way a guest of the Royal family. The released files also include a photograph of Andrew with Epstein and Maxwell shooting on the heathlands of Balmoral. Maxwell and actor Kevin Spacey were previously photographed sitting on the thrones in Buckingham Palace during a separate visit organised by Mr Mountbatten Windsor. Andrew Lownie, the Royal historian, said Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had allowed Epstein and Maxwell to treat royal residences as “their private playground, mixing public and private with no sense of decorum”. Epstein and Maxwell were given the opportunity to go anywhere and Andrew appears to have been too stupid to notice he was being taken advantage of in this way.” Other photos released from the Epstein files also show Sarah Ferguson, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, sitting with a woman on a sofa and standing with another in the street. She said she had never called him a paedophile after he reacted furiously to comments she had made about him in an interview, according to emails obtained by the Mail on Sunday. Fresh revelations over the extent of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein's friendship could prove a further embarrassment for the Royal family. Details of the former duke's friendship with the paedophile, which continued after Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a child for prostitution, had threatened to plunge the monarchy into crisis earlier in 2025, prompting the King to strip him of his remaining titles. The scandal effectively made Mr Mountbatten-Windsor a palace outcast. The former duke was ordered in October to leave Royal Lodge, his residence in Windsor, following weeks of scrutiny over his links to Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, his accuser. In a posthumous memoir published earlier that month, Giuffre repeated allegations that she was made to have sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions. He has always denied the claims and any other wrongdoing. In an unprecedented statement stripping his brother of the Duke of York title in November, the King said that his “utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse”. The move followed revelations in a drip-feed of documents, the latest tranche of which was published on Friday, that proved Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had lied to the public over claims that he had cut ties with Epstein. A recently surfaced email showed the former duke continued to pursue their friendship beyond this, writing to Epstein in 2011: “We are in this together.” Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail in Manhattan, New York, as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. He had previously pleaded guilty to child sex offences in 2008. A biography of the financier contained within the disclosures claims that he saved Maxwell from falling into a “deep depression” after her father's death. The British socialite had moved to New York in 1991, months before Robert Maxwell fell to his death from his yacht, Lady Ghislaine, in an apparent suicide aged 68. She met Epstein shortly after her father's death. The account, which is recorded as being Epstein's “personal history”, appears to have been drafted as part of his defence after he was charged in Florida in 2006 with solicitation of a minor. The profile claims that Epstein knew there were “few bright spots for [Maxwell] during that period” and that he took her regularly to comedy clubs, which she “found enormously palliative in relieving her depression”. The account states that Epstein arranged for Maxwell “to secure a loan that would help her get a foothold in the business world” , and that, “[o]ver time, their relationship became intimate”. The text also excerpts passages of what appear to be a character witness of Epstein written by Maxwell (above). In fact, I never saw him break a promise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The state's response includes sweeping new powers, intensified surveillance, and a crackdown on organizing. Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. When news broke of the Bondi Beach shooting, those of us in the global Palestine solidarity movement knew immediately what was coming. We've seen this pattern: when liberation movements challenge state power and when genocide is named and resisted, states seize on any incident, any tragedy, to justify criminalizing that resistance. Since October 2023, as Israel has carried out genocide in Gaza, Australia has built an apparatus to suppress Palestine solidarity: envoys, task forces, and “safety” initiatives that treat anti-genocide organizing as a threat. We knew the Bondi shooting would be weaponized against us because Zionism — through Israeli state institutions, lobby groups, and complicit governments — has made Jewish safety inseparable from Israeli state interests. Zionism has constructed a system where any harm to Jews, regardless of context or motive, becomes justification to criminalize Palestine solidarity and crush demands for liberation. By deploying the rhetoric of light versus darkness, it lays the foundations for a moral and legal framework where anything deemed threatening to the existing order — which, as we've established, includes Palestine solidarity — becomes a legitimate target for state repression. Jillian Segal — Australia's Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism and an executive member of Australia's peak Zionist lobby group, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry — drew an explicit line between a march across Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of Palestine to mass murder. No evidence connected the attack to Palestinian movement work, but that didn't matter. Suddenly, a shooting with no connection to Palestine had become proof that Palestine solidarity leads to mass murder, justifying repression that was already planned. Prime Minister Albanese adopted Segal's entire proposed antisemitism plan — recommendations she had released in July 2025. Her plan proposes defunding schools, universities, media outlets, and cultural institutions that “fail to act against antisemitism,” while monitoring the ABC and SBS, Australia's public broadcasters, for “fair” reporting. The IHRA definition — which treats criticism of Israel's policies, comparisons between Israel and apartheid South Africa, or claims that Israel is a racist endeavor as “antisemitic” — is now set to become the framework for cutting funding and terminating employment in Australia's media. Albanese announced sweeping new powers targeting “preachers and leaders who promote violence,” as well as organizations engaging in “hate speech promoting violence or racial hatred.” The Home Affairs Minister gained power to cancel visas for those who “spread hate and division,” allowing the government to deny entry to solidarity activists and deport organizers. Federal parliament may yet be recalled to rush through legislation. The government announced financial assistance payments for Bondi victims, mirroring the scheme established after October 7 for Australians impacted by Hamas attacks under the Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment — a scheme never extended to Australian-Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israeli forces. The Education Minister announced a 12-month antisemitism education taskforce led by the former Chancellor of the University of New South Wales David Gonski, working with the Special Envoy, to reshape curriculums “from early education right through to universities” to address students making Jewish peers “feel unwelcome” — campus organizing for Palestine will be embedded as antisemitism in educational policy from childhood. NSW Premier Chris Minns recalled parliament to pass laws allowing police to reject protest applications under a “terrorism designation.” He claimed mass demonstrations could “light a flame impossible to extinguish,” effectively designating Palestine protests — which have sustained nearly weekly demonstrations for over two years, making them among the most enduring solidarity movements in Australian history — as potential terrorism, giving police the power to ban them. (An Australian Defence Force officer recently lost his security clearance for “divided loyalty” after CSG training in Israel). Essentially, a foreign-aligned militia could be deputized to police Australian streets and surveil organizers. At the memorial for Bondi victims, an Israeli flag flies alongside Australian flags. When a Jewish woman wearing a keffiyeh attempted to attend the vigil — wearing it, she said, because of the Israeli flag on display — police escorted her out. A shooting at an iconic national beach becomes terrorism and justifies sweeping powers. The response to Bondi lays bare what the state has been building since October 2023: infrastructure to protect Australia's stake in Israeli genocide from challenge. This serves Zionist lobby groups like the Executive Council of Australian Jewry that weaponize Jewish safety to justify Israel's exterminationist policies. Ultimately, the response to this shooting accelerates what was already brewing: heightened powers, intensified surveillance, and violence against organizing, now legitimized. State repression doesn't require a connection between incident and response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has claimed that he could pay himself $1 billion in US government money as damages for a raid carried out at his Mar-a-Lago estate by the FBI. Federal agents searched Trump's property in Palm Beach, Florida in August 2022 as part of an investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified documents during his first term in office. Last year, the case was dismissed by a judge, who ruled that Special Counsel Jack Smith did not have the authority to prosecute the president. “These thugs are disgusting and we cannot let them get away with this stuff,” he insisted. “There is only one problem… I am suing and I am the one that is supposed to settle. Does that make sense?” he asked. Trump claimed that “there has never been a case like this. And now Donald Trump has to settle the suit… Isn't that a strange position to be in? Actually, maybe I shouldn't give it to charity. Maybe I should keep the money... No, I don't want to do it. But whatever happens, it is all going to good charities,” he promised. Trump's lawyers filed two separate administrative claims in 2023 and 2024 over DOJ's investigations into him. The claims are technically not lawsuits and are first reviewed by the US Department of Justice to determine if they can be resolved out of court. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

BUDAPEST, December 20. /TASS/. Financing Ukraine and sending military aid there to continue the conflict with Russia only weakens the European Union, instead of making it stronger, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.

He recalled that the European Union's summit on December 18 and 19 in Brussels decided to grant a military loan to Ukraine in 2026-2027 at the expense of a common European loan worth 90 billion euro. In the past four years, the EU allocated a sum of 180 billion euro to Kiev and thus, Europe's overall assistance to Ukraine has reached 270 billion euro.

"Today, the problem is that with each new decision we are weakening ourselves instead of making us stronger. Ukraine adds no strength to Europe but only takes it away. We should not finance the Ukrainian army, we should not strengthen Ukraine but we should strengthen the armies of countries located west of Ukraine. We need to reinforce the armies of the countries of Europe for Europe," he said at a meeting with activists of the ruling Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Alliance party in the city of Szeged.</p>

This article is part of CNN Underscored's The Reset, an editorial package featuring all our articles aimed at giving you the information and product recommendations to help achieve any and all New Year's resolutions. It could be the cheap sandals you're wearing with no arch support, a sudden change in your health or fitness routine or even a lack of foot strength exercises throughout your physical therapy. Related article The best orthopedic shoes for foot pain, according to podiatrists The Hoka Clifton 10 are Dr. Priya Parthasarathy's top pick for runners with plantar fasciitis. The board-certified podiatrist said the shoes have “generous heel cushioning to reduce stress” on your feet and added that they're also suitable for a multitude of foot types. In her review, she said that they offer a “bouncy, soft feel” and robust support, which kept her naturally high arches happy on longer runs. Cunha said this is “critical for reducing strain on the plantar fascia.” The Adrenaline also earned plaudits in our guide to walking shoes for flat feet, with podiatrist Dr. Danny Phan praising their high toe drop (the height distance between where your heels and toes sit), which reduces stress on the calves and Achilles tendon. When our testing and updates writer Michelle Rae Uy got her hands on New Balance's Fresh Foam line, she was impressed by the shoes' stability, breathability and bouncy insoles, writing that they'll “be very kind to your knees, lower back and, naturally, feet and legs.” She also tried the 1080v14, which are a great option if you need shoes for standing all day or cushioned running shoes. Cartwright said she relies on these shoes all throughout her marathon training, because even when she's going on 20-mile runs, they remain comfortable and supportive. Like other shoes on this list, these come with the APMA Seal of Acceptance. Related article The best knee braces, according to physical therapists and orthopedists Parthasarathy said these are “casual, cute walking shoes that provide support.” Though they look like an everyday pair of casual shoes, they boast bouncy, breathable footbeds that offer plenty of support. “This is one of the best walking shoes for plantar fasciitis because of its ultra-plush cushioning,” Cunha said, adding that they provide “soft, shock‑absorbing heel strike” that keeps stress at a minimum. According to her, the “heavily cushioned footbeds” reduce impact and fatigue, whether you're wearing them while running or pumping iron. With their shock-absorbing midsoles, deep heel cups and contoured arch support, Cunha said the Vionic 23 Walk 2.0 effectively alleviate plantar fascia stress. Unlike more technical running or walking shoes, they also look like laid-back sneakers you can wear for casual outings. These sneakers also topped our best walking shoes list, with podiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Daughtry highlighting their removable arch supports and firm heel counters, which make them perfect for short-distance strolls. In our guide of the best walking shoes, experts said sneakers should be supportive and cushioned to allow for shock absorption. The Echelon Walker 3 checks those boxes with its PWRRUN midsoles, which Cunha said “cushions every step to absorb impact.” While the shoes have been discontinued, you can still find them in men's sizes at Amazon. Consider the Bondi 9, which Cunha said make great max-cushion running shoes for plantar fasciitis patients. He especially recommends them for people with wide feet, as they're available in wide and extra‑wide widths, which “allow your foot to splay naturally without feeling jammed,” he said. This is a crucial design feature because when your feet sit naturally, less pressure is placed on your joints and tendons, allowing for a (hopefully) pain-free experience. In her glowing review, the four-time marathoner said they offer tons of support. With plush midsoles, they're tuned for long runs and walks on pavement. “The GTS model adds stability for patients with overpronation, while the Max version provides enhanced shock absorption for those needing additional cushioning,” she said. Cunha said the Cloudrunner 2 are supportive stability shoes with plenty of cushioning, making them another top pick for plantar fasciitis patients with wide feet. That's in large part thanks to the Helion midsoles, which he said “[provide] plush, energy returning cushioning to reduce strain of the plantar fascia.” The Cloudmonster, which our associate testing writer Gareen Puglia tried when testing the best beginner running shoes, are an even cushier option from On. Related article The 17 best arch-support shoes, according to podiatrists and editors CNN Underscored contributing writer Dana Zepeda also loves these recovery sandals, calling them a “revelation” for sore feet in her review. The APMA-approved slippers, which come recommended by Parthasarathy, combine peak-cozy, faux-shearling uppers with shock-absorbing, supportive midsoles. “While I can't say the Oofos have cured all my foot ailments — my flat feet, after all, are a structural issue — I can report that pain associated with my plantar fasciitis has never been triggered by the Ooahh slides,” she said in her review. The Ooahh sandals, another Parthasarathy pick, are also helpful for plantar fasciitis on account of their shock-absorbent soles. Related article The 13 best recovery sandals for sore, achy feet, according to podiatrists Finding supportive shoes is, therefore, paramount to treating plantar fasciitis, especially since Parthasarathy said flexible, nonsupportive shoes “increase load on your plantar fascia.” To find the right shoes, it's always recommended to see a health care provider for their insights, as well as visiting a specialty shoe store like Fleet Feet for an in-depth foot analysis. The following FAQs have been answered by podiatrists Dr. Miguel Cunha, Dr. Priya Parthasarathy and Dr. Naomi Shields. Anything that irritates or damages this tissue can cause plantar fasciitis, she added, including changes in weight, pregnancy, the shoes you wear or your activity level. Shields said shoe inserts can help especially if you have flat feet, which tend to put more stress on the plantar fascia. Proper support is crucial to increasing stability, reducing arch collapse and preventing foot fatigue, Cunha said. All three podiatrists said that you should generally avoid barefoot shoes while dealing with plantar fasciitis because they don't offer enough support. If you want to try them when your feet have recovered, Parthasarathy advises consulting a podiatrist for recommendations and only wearing them for short periods of time during low-impact activities. Like barefoot shoes, Cunha said that “walking barefoot, especially on hard floors, can result in overstretching of the plantar fascia, leading to tiny tears, inflammation and an increased risk of developing plantar fasciitis.” Instead, opt for shoes with proper arch support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FCI Dublin was shut down in 2024 after revelations of abuse against prisoners. As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. On December 16, 2025, the Dublin City Council in California unanimously passed a resolution formally opposing reopening or reusing the notorious FCI Dublin prison for detention of any kind, including as an immigration jail. That includes Darlene Baker, who was incarcerated at the Dublin federal prison camp from 2022 to 2023. There, she was sexually assaulted by then-medical officer Jeffrey Wilson. “I suffered severe retaliation by Dublin officers and staff” for reporting the assault, she recounted in a letter to the Dublin City Council. “During this time, I served as a whistleblower, forwarding details of abuse and neglect to former Congresswoman Jackie Speier who was actively investigating the ‘toxic culture' of Dublin,” she continued. They were the ninth and tenth staff members to be convicted of sexually abusing women imprisoned in Dublin. As reported earlier by Truthout, FCI Dublin was abruptly shuttered in April 2024 following widespread coverage of rampant sexual abuse and the arrests of staff, from the warden and chaplain to more than half a dozen officers. In December 2024, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) agreed to a $116 million settlement for 103 survivors, including Baker. It is the largest settlement for sexual assault survivors in U.S. prison history. In August 2024, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) put out a request for information for available detention facilities within a two-hour commute of four urban areas in California, including San Francisco. The nearest ICE prisons are four to five hours away in Bakersfield. Since Donald Trump's second inauguration, ICE has opened 59 new facilities and reopened 77 previously-closed sites to jail migrants. “I was especially concerned about the vulnerable population of immigrants — with language difficulties, no due process, and limited access to legal assistance.” The city council resolution notes the ongoing opposition from longtime residents, county officials, medical professionals, and those whose family members have been taken by ICE. Dublin is located 23 miles from Oakland in the East Bay area of Alameda County, one of three counties that make up the Tri-Valley. In 2022, Detention Watch Network found that immigrants in counties with more detention beds are significantly more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE. When news of FCI Dublin's potential conversion spread, residents sprang into action. During the first Trump administration, area residents had formed Indivisible Tri-Valley, a regional chapter of a larger network aimed at electing progressive Democrats and defeating the MAGA agenda. After hearing about the potential conversion, the group joined ICE Out of Dublin, a coalition encompassing residents, faith-based organizations, advocacy groups, and those who were imprisoned in Dublin. Every Saturday afternoon, Indivisible Tri-Valley members hold a vigil on Dublin Boulevard, the city's main street. Dubbed the Dublin Peace Corner, 20 to 100 people rally with signs, flags, whistles, and horns. They demonstrate their opposition in other ways as well. At another community gathering, members screen-printed signs that read “No ICE prison in Dublin” and “Immigrants are welcome here.” Members took those signs, along with red cards notifying people of their rights and yellow cards with hotline numbers to report ICE sightings, to local businesses, including restaurants, corner stores, and taquerias. Indivisible Tri-Valley member Dan Morley told Truthout that more than one restaurant proprietor thanked them for their actions. Representatives Mark DeSaulnier and Zoe Lofgren sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, the BOP, and ICE opposing any planned conversion. “You Have the Power to Stop History From Repeating Itself” “Legally they can't do anything more because it's federal — not city — property,” local activist Liz Schmitt explained. At the city council's November meeting, more than two-thirds of the 35 people who spoke were Dublin residents, ranging from high school students to grandparents. Others had family members detained by ICE and some feared similar detentions. My mother has no answer because he was kidnapped,” they wrote. Reopening it would reopen trauma that many of us are still fighting our way through.” She noted that ICE jails are rife with the same abuses, silencing, and retaliation. “It's shameful that people associate Dublin with ‘Club Rape,'” he said before adding, “I hope that Dublin doesn't move on to become known as the City Against Human Rights.” Douglas Yoshida is an emergency physician at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley medical center, the nearest medical facility to the Dublin prison. His parents were teenagers when they were detained under then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, which led to the imprisonment of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans. “My parents survived these prison camps — but their experience was not a relic of history; it's an injustice that feels all too familiar today,” he wrote in a June op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle, comparing the ICE raids and detentions to his parents' experiences. Standing before the city council five months later, he added that an ICE jail “will threaten the health care of our community. We will have to admit many patients that could be treated as outpatients in the community. Furthermore, will our large immigrant community feel safe seeking care if there are armed, masked men patrolling the hospital?” “I have a vivid memory of what it felt like to be detained, watching and experiencing the atrocities and inhumane conditions, and not really having a voice to help … I pray no other humans will have to experience this despair.” “It offers community members more of a sense of safety, that the city is standing up for them and supporting them. Then, the goal is to get surrounding cities to do similar resolutions because this affects the entire Bay Area and other northern California cities.” Dublin is not the only city fighting to stop ICE from opening a migrant jail. A state court issued an injunction doing just that. And in Newport, Oregon, local residents launched a campaign against a prospective migrant jail ahead of rumors that ICE was looking into opening one in their city. “I pray no other humans will have to experience this despair.” December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luigi Mangione's lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi's decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer's parent company. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. By involving herself in the death penalty decision and making public statements suggesting that Mangione deserves execution, Bondi broke a vow she made before taking office in February that she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year, Mangione's lawyers said. They argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard — and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group — through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers. The “very person” empowered to seek Mangione's death “has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,” his lawyers wrote. Messages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners. Bondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.” Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group's annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims. Mangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. Friday's filing put the focus back on Mangione's federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to “wack” a health insurance executive. Mangione's defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi's past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case. In a September court filing, Mangione's lawyers argued that Bondi's announcement that she was ordering prosecutors to seek the death penalty — which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance — showed the decision was “based on politics, not merit.” They also said her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later. Bondi's statements and other official actions — including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration's flouting of established death penalty procedures — “have violated Mr. Mangione's constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,” his lawyers said. In a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that “pretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.” “What the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments” rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. Mangione's lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi's ties to Ballard and the firm's relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi's compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from “all individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian long-range drones have struck two Russian Su-27 fighter jets at the Belbek military airfield in Russian-occupied Crimea, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on Dec. 20. Belbek is a Russian military airfield in occupied Crimea located near Sevastopol. It has been used by Russian forces as a key hub for deploying fighter aircraft and positioning air defense assets on the peninsula. "Long-range drones of the SBU's Alpha Special Operations Center hit two Su-27 aircraft at the Russian military airfield in Belbek, temporarily occupied Crimea. One of the planes was on a taxiway with a full combat load and ready for a combat sortie — it was destroyed," the SBU wrote on Telegram. On Dec. 18, our drones struck Russian equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars — including two Nebo-SVU radars, a 92N6 radar of the S-400 Triumph system, a Pantsir-S2 air defense system, and a MiG-31 aircraft with a full combat load," the agency added. "This systematic work will continue," the SBU said. Tania Myronyshena is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent. Before joining the Kyiv Independent, she worked as a freelance journalist with a focus on cultural narratives and human stories. in publishing and editing from Borys Hrinchenko Kyiv University. Liberated in 2022, Kherson is still under daily attack from Russian forces across the Dnipro River. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry is working on establishing a mechanism for providing Ukrainian citizen living abroad the ability to vote in the country's next election, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 20. Sea drones have become a crucial component of Ukraine's defense toolkit, and co-production with a NATO ally could enhance long-term output and deepen European defense-industrial cooperation at sea. The planned Miami meetings follow Witkoff and Kushner's talks in Berlin earlier this week with Ukrainian and European officials on revisions to a U.S.-backed peace plan. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia targeted Ukraine overnight with three Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from occupied Crimea and 51 attack drones. SSO drones also hit a Russian oil platform located at the Filanovsky oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea. The platform is owned by Russian oil company Lukoil and is used for oil and gas extraction. "Yesterday evening, Russia carried out a missile strike on a port infrastructure facility in Odesa Oblast. "This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance," U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. "We agreed with our American partners on further steps and the continuation of our joint work in the near future," delegation leader Rustem Umerov said after the meeting. I think they have their hands full in Ukraine," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Dec. 19.</p>

MOSCOW, December 20. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a greeting read by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, stated that Russia prioritizes developing "friendly, fully equal, and mutually beneficial relations with African partners."

"It is symbolic that this event is taking place in Egypt," the greeting at the second ministerial conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum stated. Putin noted that African states "possess enormous economic and human potential and are playing an increasingly significant role in global politics," establishing the continent as a key center of the "multipolar world order."

He highlighted intensified cooperation, with Russia supporting African nations in security, food security, counterterrorism, disaster relief and disease control and stressed that the conference is tasked with reviewing the progress of the current Action Plan and outlining new joint work in trade, economics and investment. Putin expressed confidence that discussions would prepare for the next Russia-Africa Summit with concrete proposals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies seeking government funding or fast-tracking must make their case to the blunt former investment banker, who has little interest in partisanship or policy debates For companies that arrive cap-in-hand to pitch energy or mining projects that might meet Canada's moment of economic reckoning, a sit-down with the most influential member of Prime Minister Mark Carney's cabinet can be a novel and jarring experience. Tim Hodgson isn't much for the pleasantries that usually kick off such meetings, sometimes at length, with other ministers. Nor is he one to make make broadly enthusiastic if non-committal noises about whatever is on the table, be gentle in discussing qualms or potential roadblocks, or spend much time talking about where the project might fit into the wider policy landscape. Instead, Mr. Hodgson – who this year went straight from a long career as an investment banker to being the country's Energy and Natural Resources Minister – tends to almost immediately go deeply and unsparingly into the proposal's financial fundamentals. Prime Minister Mark Carney holds a news conference in Ottawa on Nov. 26, accompanied by ArcelorMittal Dofasco CEO Ron Bédard, left, and Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Tim Hodgson.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press But to others, including some who have endured his bluntness, it's a major virtue – forcing companies to up their games when seeking federal support, giving them a clearer sense than previously of how to get across the finish line, and helping the government figure out which projects really deserve to be fast tracked for permitting or public financing. And in the eyes of admirers – including, by all accounts, a Prime Minister who counts him as his closest friend and confidant in cabinet – it's one of the ways that Mr. Hodgson is necessarily reorienting Ottawa's relationship with resource-based industries on which it's largely pinning Canada's hopes for greater economic sovereignty in the face of U.S. aggression. To get a sense of what that involves, The Globe and Mail interviewed more than 20 people who have interacted with Mr. Hodgson during his seven months in office – including industry leaders, lobbyists and government officials – as well as Mr. Hodgson himself. What emerged, through descriptions of his dealings with industry and within government, is a picture of a minister who is highly unusual in ways that perfectly align with Mr. Carney's economic ambitions, yet could pose some risk to them. Veteran executives who enter government tend to talk about running it more like the private sector, but Mr. Hodgson is proving better positioned and more determined to do so than most. Less interested than colleagues in Liberal orthodoxy or policy debates, he's squarely focused on reaching investment deals – including for critical-mineral extraction, oil-and-gas infrastructure and carbon-capture technology that is billed as making it sustainable, and to strengthen electricity grids – at a pace to which Ottawa is unaccustomed. He remains so inclined toward Bay Street language that ministry officials half-joke they need to send him term sheets, not briefing notes. Yet despite his private-sector track record – highlighted by a Goldman Sachs tenure in which he became chief executive officer of its Canadian operations, a stint as managing partner of private investment firm Alignvest Management Corp. and an array of recent board memberships that included chairing Ontario's Hydro One Ltd. – he has entered Ottawa with limited knowledge of its workings. He's known among friends to be deeply patriotic, informed by continuing his family's history of military service before entering business and by charitable work for veterans, but few previously imagined him seeking office. “I was shocked,” said Jim Leech, the former Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan CEO who is close to Mr. Hodgson. Mr. Leech thought it likelier that Mr. Hodgson, whom he considers a somewhat fiscally conservative political centrist like himself, would ease into retirement, before a sense of duty and the chance to serve with his friend Mr. Carney beckoned. Among them: running afoul of other Liberals as he steers a de-prioritization of climate goals in favour of re-embracing the oil-and-gas sector, and misaligning the need for speed with getting First Nations support that could make or break projects he's pursuing. So, authoritative though he is poring over capital stacks with would-be investors, Mr. Hodgson has been on a steep learning curve when it comes to the demands of public life, and what being a chief dealmaker on the government's side of the table really entails. Mr. Hodgson is not especially inclined toward reflecting on that personal journey thus far, at least for public consumption. Asked at the start of an interview in his office what lessons he's taken from his first months in Ottawa, he replied with more of an explanation of a governing philosophy that he (like Mr. Carney) has seemingly adopted from the get-go. The minister is focused on reaching investment deals, including for critical-mineral extraction, oil-and-gas infrastructure and carbon-capture technology.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press Delivering introductory speeches to business audiences shortly after entering cabinet, he read from prepared texts in a monotone, occasionally stumbling over words. He also does not particularly care for performing political theatre. He surprised himself by enjoying knocking on doors in his Greater Toronto Area riding during this year's election campaign, he said, where largely first-generation Canadians “fully understand this is the greatest country in the world” and counterbalanced the “everything's broken” grumbling he was hearing in elite circles. “Look, I have colleagues who relish the sport of Question Period,” he said. Discussing Indigenous relations, he recalled going to a First Nations summit where he felt that the vast majority of chiefs were supportive of his pitch about shared economic prosperity, or open-minded, only for journalists to seek out the small minority who were hostile to it. One of the worst moments of his fledgling political career came weeks ago, when he was asked by a TV interviewer about ensuring Indigenous consultation around a potential oil pipeline and replied that “It's called Zoom.” (He apologized the next day.) And he managed a dash of folksiness when he brought up how childhood experiences in an Armed Forces family across Canada – in logging and mill towns, in Nova Scotia with kids who'd miss school to work on lobster boats, at a vocational high school where friends went on to oil rigs – help make his current job feel visceral. A common hope, among allies, is that he's landing in a sweet spot where he can speak political language well enough to get by while maintaining some plain-spoken outsider appeal. “His power is he acts like a normal executive in these situations,” Mr. Hogan said. The rookie minister's executive instincts were on display, in a different way, as he began his new job. Government officials who interacted with him immediately following his swearing-in last May were struck by his negativity toward Ottawa's bureaucratic and political culture – a mindset, common on Bay Street, that the capital was beset by laziness and incompetence. The impression they got, not entirely different from one conveyed by Mr. Carney, was that Mr. Hodgson viewed himself as an adult who had arrived to cut the nonsense. At the same time, he also understandably had limited knowledge of government processes or his departmental responsibilities. Meanwhile, controversial powers to override normal permitting processes under the Building Canada Act, which the government hurriedly pushed through shortly after Mr. Carney and Mr. Hodgson took over, have yet to be used. But if his views have softened, he hasn't abandoned them entirely. Toward that end, he has (more than many incoming ministers) jettisoned most of the policy staff he inherited from Mr. Wilkinson, who was known as a policy wonk committed to carefully finding the right balance between economic and environmental goals. To replace them, he's largely sought out young staff who, like him, have more financial than political experience. That is, if those bureaucrats are engaging with him at all. That lack of access, which has prompted some grumbling internally, has not been a complaint from industry – at least sectors such as oil and gas, nuclear, mining and forestry, in which Mr. Carney's government sees opportunity to leverage existing strengths. How Mr. Hodgson chooses to spend his time points toward his emphasis on the nitty-gritty of reaching specific deals rather than obsessing over broader policy frameworks. Though leveraging his position to nail down investments is also likely a more complex undertaking than when he was in the private sector. It's not as though Mr. Hodgson can make snap permitting decisions, many of which don't even rest with his ministry, when at the table across from project proponents. The government's largest vehicles for loans, equity stakes, offtake agreements and other forms of concessional financing to get projects off the ground – including the Canada Growth Fund, Canada Infrastructure Bank and new Indigenous Loan Guarantee Corp. – are all supposed to function with high degrees of independence. Now in the mix, too, is the Major Projects Office established by Mr. Carney and run out of Calgary by former energy executive Dawn Farrell, which is meant to provide some regulatory and financial co-ordination. Mr. Hodgson does have some dollars at his disposal, including a $2-billion critical minerals fund in last month's budget. And there are plenty of projects, particularly in that sector, that are too small to go to the MPO but could collectively add up. Among his responsibilities is chairing the Build Canada committee, which Mr. Carney established and which Mr. Hodgson described as cabinet's main economic committee, responsible for trying to spur $500-billion of investment across sectors. Among its focuses, he said, is “de-pancaking” regulations (reducing overlap across departments), plus being “a fulcrum for all the different financing tools and a convening forum.” Mr. Carney makes a major projects announcement at Skeena Substation in Terrace, B.C., in November, accompanied by Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure, left, and Dawn Farrell, CEO of the Major Projects Office.ETHAN CAIRNS/The Canadian Press And then there is how he puts his business acumen to use in determining which possibilities are credible – particularly important in mining, as a wide range of companies seek to capitalize on the frenzy to counter China's critical-minerals dominance. As for how he tries to make those assessments, and work with proponents to get pitches ready for prime time, Mr. Hodgson invoked the five factors in the Building Canada Act for designating large projects to be in the national interest, which may be instructive of how hard the government tries to advance smaller projects as well. Boiled down, those criteria include strengthening Canada's sovereignty, providing economic benefit, having a high likelihood of success, and advancing Indigenous interests and climate-change objectives. If another pencilled out to only an 8 per cent IRR, it might not totally align with the likelihood of success metric. In that case, he might try to help figure out which financial tools at the government's disposal – low-interest lending, equity stakes, money for surrounding infrastructure – might get the rate of return to a more attractive level. Those conversations would happen with the proponent and within Mr. Hodgson's department. “I'm kind of like: Hey, how have you thought about it? What Mr. Hodgson didn't say, but others in government observed, is that he will sometimes then try to wield soft power around Ottawa, signalling to other departments and agencies that he thinks targeted dollars could get a desirable project over the line. Such efforts are taken seriously by other ministers and officials, both because of Mr. Hodgson's expertise and because they know how much Mr. Carney has entrusted him. But his perceived influence on the government's agenda could also prove a double-edged sword – including with members of the governing party to which he is a newcomer. Mr. Hodgson arrives for a cabinet meeting on Parliament Hill in December.Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press Initially, Mr. Hodgson did not seem terribly concerned about endearing himself to fellow Liberal caucus members, whom he made little secret of considering fortunate to have gotten or kept their jobs by virtue of Mr. Carney's leadership. There is nevertheless a large fault line running between him and the many Liberal MPs for whom an ambitious agenda to combat climate change is an article of faith. Mr. Hodgson was not primarily responsible for last month's memorandum of understanding with Alberta, in which Ottawa agreed to drop or soften several environmental policies put in place under former prime minister Justin Trudeau in return for strengthening industrial carbon pricing, and opened the door to a new oil pipeline. One of the corporate boards he sat on was that of oil-sands producer MEG Energy Corp. And asked how he sees Canada's place in the global energy transition, he spoke almost entirely about fossil fuels, including through advancing (still notional) carbon-capture projects in the oil sands and exporting natural gas as a transition fuel. As for his message to climate-concerned colleagues, he invoked broader benefits. “If we produce the cleanest, best version of those products, our allies want them,” he said. “It's a point of national security, and we can use that revenue to pay for our $10-a-day daycare, our new dental care program and our school lunch programs ... or provincially pay for universal health care or subsidized postsecondary education. Invoking success during his time chairing Hydro One in partnering with First Nations to build transmission lines, he emphasized the importance of Indigenous participation in all projects while acknowledging he's still learning countrywide dynamics. Still, his move-fast approach has already at times seemed an awkward fit with Indigenous leadership's desire for extensive consultation. It's unlikely that danger is keeping Mr. Hodgson up at night. It's too early for him or anyone else to pass that judgment. There have been initial signs of success, mostly around minerals, highlighted by investments in six mining and processing projects in Ontario and Quebec announced on the margins of a G7 summit this fall. “What the Prime Minister has said, which I've taken to heart,” Mr. Hodgson said, “is that we need to focus on outcomes, not how we get there.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) carried out kamikaze drone strikes on a Russian patrol ship and an oil platform in the Caspian Sea on Dec. 19, the SSO reported on Dec. 20. The patrol ship is designated Project 22460 Hunter, part of the Rubin class of Russian Coast Guard vessels designed to combat surface and airborne threats. "They are equipped with weapons and systems to perform a wide range of missions in coastal waters. In the same operation, SSO drones also hit a Russian oil platform located at the Filanovsky oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea. The platform is owned by Russian oil company Lukoil and is used for oil and gas extraction. The initial reserves of the field are estimated at approximately 129 million tons of oil and 30 billion cubic meters of gas," the SSO said. Ukrainian forces have previously carried out successful strikes on Russian patrol vessels and other naval assets. In September 2025, Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said it hit and damaged a multifunctional Russian Project MPSV07 ship patrolling the Black Sea. Liberated in 2022, Kherson is still under daily attack from Russian forces across the Dnipro River. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry is working on establishing a mechanism for providing Ukrainian citizen living abroad the ability to vote in the country's next election, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 20. Sea drones have become a crucial component of Ukraine's defense toolkit, and co-production with a NATO ally could enhance long-term output and deepen European defense-industrial cooperation at sea. The planned Miami meetings follow Witkoff and Kushner's talks in Berlin earlier this week with Ukrainian and European officials on revisions to a U.S.-backed peace plan. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia targeted Ukraine overnight with three Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from occupied Crimea and 51 attack drones. SSO drones also hit a Russian oil platform located at the Filanovsky oil and gas field in the Caspian Sea. The platform is owned by Russian oil company Lukoil and is used for oil and gas extraction. "Yesterday evening, Russia carried out a missile strike on a port infrastructure facility in Odesa Oblast. "This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance," U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. "We agreed with our American partners on further steps and the continuation of our joint work in the near future," delegation leader Rustem Umerov said after the meeting. I think they have their hands full in Ukraine," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Dec. 19.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Clinton grabs the headlines in a swimming pool in tight trunks while Donald Trump is conspicuous by his absence Donald Trump fought the release of the Epstein files for as long as he could before eventually bowing to pressure from his own supporters to reveal all. “Oh my!” posted Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, as she shared the photograph of Bill Clinton. Although early analysis reveals that Mr Trump, once a close friend of the late paedophile, gets a handful of mentions in the files, it is Mr Clinton who emerges as one of Epstein's closest associates. There he is in a swimming pool with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. In other photographs, he poses in a red hoodie with a clenched fist beside another woman with her face obscured. He visits Winston Churchill's War Rooms with Maxwell and actor Kevin Spacey. He sits at dinner with Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stone, and poses with Epstein, both men dressed in loud silk shirts. And there he is, one arm around Michael Jackson, the king of pop, and Diana Ross on his other side. White House aides revived an old nickname, originally coined for Mr Clinton's polished but slippery style. “Slick Willy!” posted Steven Cheung, director of communications, alongside the hot tub picture. “@BillClinton just chillin, without a care in the world. In contrast, Mr Trump is notable almost for his absence. He appears tangentially: a name on a giant cheque and an image of one of his books (Trump: The Art of the Comeback) on a bookshelf. The president has never been accused of any wrongdoing in the cases against Epstein and maintains that he never knew about Epstein's crimes. During the campaign he promised to release all the documents as conspiracy-minded allies claimed that they hid details of a powerful circle of abusers who had been protected by the authorities. But once in office he tried to brush off the whole affair. He has flashed irritation at reporters' questions about his relationship with Epstein. And on Friday, hours before publication of the files, he ended a White House event on drug prices by saying “this is such a big announcement ... Mr Trump rarely misses a chance to joust with reporters, suggesting rare presidential nerves on what might come out of the files. It was his department of justice after all that was in charge of the release, and it quickly emerged that only a fraction of the files were being published. It means the delivery can be carefully managed. And an hour-and-a-half after the Epstein dump, Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, announced strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria after three Americans were killed last week. Meanwhile, it was Mr Clinton who appeared in all the headlines. Even the White House chief of staff gave the game away with indiscreet comments in an interview with Vanity Fair. Although the president has for years claimed that Mr Clinton visited Epstein's private island, Susie Wiles said “there is no evidence” of that. Is there any incriminating evidence against Mr Clinton in the files? “The president was wrong about that,” she said.</p>
