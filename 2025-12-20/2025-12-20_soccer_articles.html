                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diego Coppola fears his dream of playing in the 2026 World Cup for Italy will be over unless he gets more game time with Brighton & Hove Albion. The 21-year-old central defender made his first league start for the club alongside fellow summer signing Olivier Boscagli in the 0-0 home draw against Sunderland, with first choice pairing Lewis Dunk and Jan Paul van Hecke ruled out by suspension and illness respectively. Coppola was called into Italy's senior squad for two appearances earlier this year as they chase qualification for next summer's tournament via the European play-offs in March. “A dream for every footballer is to play in the World Cup,” said Coppola, who had been limited to 17 minutes of league action as a substitute since joining Brighton from Hellas Verona in the summer. Of course, I want to also help the team here, but you don't get the chance to play in a World Cup every year. The next one will be in four years. Coppola has been linked by local media with interest from several clubs in Italy in the upcoming January transfer window. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said during his press conference on Friday that he wants to keep his squad intact. Asked about the possibility of a January move, Coppola said: “I don't know yet. The club knows what is best for me. For the last 25 of those years he was chief sports reporter, primarily responsible for coverage of Brighton and Hove Albion FC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The remaining five matches feature global superstars, historic rematches, and group-defining showdowns that could shape the entire knockout bracket. Here are the top five most anticipated group stage matches. Their final group stage match in Boston brings a collision of European star power, headlined by two players who both lay claim to being the world's best striker. France's Kylian Mbappé of Real Madrid and Norway's Erling Haaland of Manchester City score at extraordinary rates for both club and country, regularly overwhelming even elite defenders. Arsenal captain Martin Ødegaard and Atlético Madrid striker Alexander Sørloth anchor a supporting cast for Haaland capable of punishing complacency. Historically, France hold a narrow 7-4-5 edge over Norway, though the nations have not met anytime recently. If France switch off, Norway have the tools to make them pay. England's 6-2-3 all-time record against Croatia comes with a painful footnote. The most important meeting between these sides remains the 2018 World Cup semifinal in Moscow, where Mario Mandžukić's extra-time goal sent Croatia to the final and left England wondering what might have been. Harry Kane, now 32 and still scoring freely at Bayern Munich, leads the line, while Declan Rice of Arsenal and Jude Bellingham of Real Madrid form a dominant midfield core. Veterans Luka Modrić and Ivan Perišić continue to define a side that has reached consecutive World Cup semifinals or better. England may have the stronger roster on paper, but Croatia's resilience is proven. The connection between France and Senegal runs deeper than football. Senegal's historic 1–0 victory over France at the 2002 World Cup remains one of the most iconic results in African football history, when Papa Bouba Diop's goal stunned the defending champions who were led by Thierry Henry and other iconic names. This Senegal side arrives with talent and confidence. Bayern Munich's Nicolas Jackson, Al-Nassr winger Sadio Mané, and Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye headline a roster built to compete physically and tactically. Eligibility choices and shared footballing pathways mean this matchup carries added intensity between French speaking nations. Senegal will embrace their underdog status and an opportunity to beat the nation who once colonized them, while Mbappé and France will need to be sharp from the outset in one of the tournament's most emotionally charged fixtures. The Samurai Blue continue to improve with each cycle and now arrive as one of the tournament's most technically skilled sides. The Netherlands, three-time World Cup finalists, cannot afford an opening slip. While the Dutch boast elite experience through Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong and Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, questions remain about their attacking consistency. Japan's current core includes Liverpool's Wataru Endō, Celtic's Daizen Maeda, and AS Monaco's Takumi Minamino. With Tunisia and another European qualifier in the group, this match will set the tone — and a cautious draw would surprise no one. The hottest ticket of the group stage arrives in Miami, as two World Cup dark horses collide in what will feel like a home match for Colombia. Demand for tickets from Colombian fans and their global diaspora has surged, while Portugal remain one of world football's biggest draws. Cristiano Ronaldo's presence still matters, but Portugal are no longer dependent on him alone. PSG midfielder João Neves has emerged as one of the world's best, Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes remains the creative hub, and AC Milan's Rafael Leão provides a quality attacking threat. Colombia, meanwhile, are chasing their best World Cup run since 2014 when they reached the quarterfinals. This will be the final World Cup for James Rodríguez, who has 31 goals in 122 caps, now supported by Sporting CP striker Luis Suárez, Bayern Munich winger Luis Díaz, the new face of Colombian football, Benfica midfielder Richard Ríos, and Crystal Palace defender Daniel Muñoz. Many of these Colombian players are familiar with Portugal's league and style of play, and this is a classic tier 1 UEFA vs CONEMBOL clash in the World Cup. The Miami metro area is home to more than a quarter million Colombians, and 30% of Colombian Americans live in Florida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newcastle United were left feeling deeply aggrieved after being denied what many believed was a clear penalty in a pulsating Premier League encounter that ultimately slipped from their grasp against Chelsea. A breathless contest at St. James' Park swung dramatically on a controversial second-half moment, with Anthony Gordon sent sprawling inside the area after contact from Trevoh Chalobah, only for referee and VAR to wave play on. Determined to make amends for a flat derby showing the previous week, Newcastle exploded out of the blocks and overwhelmed Chelsea during a ferocious first half. Central to their dominance was Nick Woltemade, who seized his moment with ruthless efficiency. The opening goal stemmed from Gordon's sharp pressing, as he robbed Wesley Fofana in midfield and drove Newcastle forward. Jacob Murphy delivered a teasing cross, Gordon's initial effort was superbly repelled by Robert Sanchez, but Woltemade reacted quickest to hammer home the rebound. The second followed soon after and was even more emphatic. Woltemade stretched instinctively to guide the ball beyond Sanchez, sparking a deafening roar as a tight offside check eventually confirmed the goal stood. Newcastle were flying, and Woltemade might easily have completed a hat-trick before the interval if he had not scuffed two more opportunities. Chelsea, so ragged before the break, emerged transformed after half-time. Their revival was ignited by a moment of real quality from Reece James, who curled a sublime free-kick over the wall and into the corner. Newcastle, who had looked so comfortable, began to retreat and the contest opened up. What followed was a sequence of events that would leave the home crowd incandescent. St James' Park erupted, players surrounded the referee, and VAR was swiftly engaged. Ally McCoist was unequivocal on commentary, branding it "a stonewall penalty," while Joe Cole described the challenge as "too much aggression". Meanwhile, retired Premier League official Darren Cann told BBC Sport: “At normal speed I can understand why the referee didn't award a penalty. So the decision was right to be reviewed by VAR, who came to the conclusion that a clear and obvious error had not been made and stayed with the on-field decision of no penalty.

Newcastle, who had been vibrant and inventive, suddenly looked deflated.

The Premier League's scheduling was shaped by fixture congestion, broadcast obligations and the expanded European calendar, with December 26 falling on a Friday and leaving only one viable broadcast slot. All other Matchweek 18 games have been spread across the following weekend. For Newcastle, though, attention remains fixed on what might have been.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than three decades later, with Major League Soccer still growing. now led by Lionel Messi as its global face, and a competitive U.S. Men's National Team, the World Cup will return to the U.S. in 2026 alongside Mexico and Canada. That growth did not happen overnight, and the 1994 edition now feels worlds apart from what lies ahead in 2026. Considerable groundwork was required to reach this point. In an exclusive interview with World Soccer Talk, MLS co-founder and former U.S. Soccer President Alan Rothenberg reflected on the contrast between the two eras. “If we go back to what we did in 94, everybody was concerned that this great experiment by FIFA might not have legs because the US obviously wasn't considered a soccer country, so we determined that Americans love a big event,” Rothenberg, one of the architects of that tournament, said. “That really set the tone because up until then the World Cup basically was presented as a soccer tournament as it is, and of course it was in soccer loving countries and so you didn't have to, you know, create a hype around it because it was built in. Since its founding in 1996, however, Major League Soccer has emerged as the flagship of U.S. soccer, achieving steady, sustainable growth and global recognition. Rothenberg reflected on that evolution: “I cover a lot of what you just talked about and then some in the book I just finished writing. It's going to be out in early February. Rothenberg also played a pivotal role in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics as soccer commissioner, a major turning point for the sport domestically. “We did a test case in the summer of 1993 where we invited England, Brazil and Germany and had a round-robin tournament. Although they both defeated us, and that was important because no matter how we hype the tournament, if our team fell flat on its face, the future probably would not have been as rosy as it's become.“ Rothenberg wanted to “make it huge.” “The night before we had a big gala and we had James Brown and Smokey Robinson were the performers, Stevie Wonder too, and then the day of the draw we had all kinds of celebrities present like Robin Williams, and seeded and was unbelievable to the point where he still gets YouTube viewers because it was such a classic performance and at the same time.“ So from that standpoint there was a lasting effect where we launched Major League Soccer based on the results of 94. We had that surplus and with that we created the US Soccer Foundation, which still exists today and is will be in perpetuity in helping support.“ Following 1994, Rothenberg also pushed for women's soccer at the 1996 Olympics and helped secure hosting rights for the 1999 Women's World Cup. “One thing built off of the other and it's been straight uphill ever since. 30 years later, MLS has got 30 teams continuing to grow and NWSL, the Women's League, after some rocky starts, they're on a great trajectory, and the USL has teams virtually everywhere in America, and again well established; so ‘one thing built on the other' is going to continue.“ I mean, it isn't like we set goals that by, you know, year five, it'll be a this, year 10, it'll be at this stage,” Rothenberg admitted, with the objective to create a single entity instead of leaving clubs to operate independently. Lionel Messi #10 of Inter Miami CF and MLS Commissioner Don Garber pose for a photo with the 2025 Landon Donovan MLS MVP trophy. “And then the MLS under Don Garber's leadership and the owner group has been clever enough to create some exceptions to the single entity, if you will.And allow for example, some special deal to bring (David) Beckham in and then more recently to bring Messi in exceeding our normal salary caps which were established through the single entity.“ Beyond Messi, Rothenberg highlighted Son Heung-min's arrival as equally significant: “I mentioned Messi, but I think in some ways the more dramatic signing recently like Son because he's not in his late 30s, he's just 30 (33). So he's still in the prime of his career and I think that's going to be key and I think that's going to be one of the things that comes out in 2026, that there'll be the a boost in the economic support for MLS teams and they can use that then to bring in more top world world class players from Europe.“ Stars like Thierry Henry, David Villa, Andrea Pirlo, and Zlatan Ibrahimović all left their mark on MLS, but none matched Messi's impact: “The first time around, when he played, it was a sellout. Rothenberg emphasized a key difference between Messi and many past signings: “The other thing too it's pretty clear, and it's that they aren't treating it as, you know, a paid retirement. They're really getting into it, supporting the team, going out and making public appearances and they're talking up the game. And so that's really crucial because in many cases. The other players that have come in, it's a nice way to finish their career, but they were not committed, if you will, to building the sport in America. Lionel Messi #10 of Inter Miami CF celebrates after winning the Audi 2025 MLS Cup Final. “Beckham is obviously because he's behind the ownership of Inter Miami and probably key to bringing Messi over, then Messi, and as I said, he just got here, so it's harder to tell, but based on his initial coming to the LAFC team, Son looks like he's comparably one that is really here to play, enjoy, be part of the team and be part of the growth of the league, which is great.” And obviously everybody's looking forward to a last hurrah, if you will, in 26. Maybe they're going to add a fourth DP, and obviously as far as the salary cap is concerned, that goes up every year, and obviously some of that gets negotiated with the Players Association, so it will be more and more financially remunerative to players and to owners. Now, you know, they just have that brief window in the middle of the season, and it makes it disruptive. Obviously, if you're bringing in a player at midseason, we'd love to have him all year, so that move to the international calendar will be very beneficial also.” Compared to MLS' strategy, however, the Saudi Pro League has fallen short of securing the same level of global broadcast deals, underscoring that attracting star players alone is not enough to guarantee success. Rothenberg expects the 2026 World Cup to be transformative. It won't be that in 2027 immediately everything just explodes. A detailed view of the Apple TV and MLS logo on an Inter Miami CF jersey. The U.S. Men's National Team has generated growing expectations among fans in recent months. “I think there's a lot more enthusiasm and bordering now on a little bit of optimism as we go in. You know, it's hard to say that we're lucky with the draw, but it could have been worse, and two of the teams that are in there, we've already beaten just in this last round where we finally started to show some talent on the field,” Rothenberg added, as Paraguay and Australia are the confirmed rivals, previously defeated by Mauricio Pochettino's team. Still, he highlighted a longstanding issue compared to other big nations: “I mean, the biggest problem with the US perennially is what I said: It's all scattered. When you look at who's been the most successful in World Cups, Spain obviously now is dominant. Well, most of their players played in Barcelona and Real Madrid. So it is a consistent style of play. France is unique because, but they have that Claire Fontaine national training site and so every player comes through that. “So there is a French style of play, if you will, and unfortunately, the United States up until now hasn't had that because you got players scattered everywhere. I think a lot of that's going to change. I think we're going to end up having a Claire Fontaine type model because we now have just the generosity of Arthur Blank who created a new headquarters training site in Atlanta, and I think from now on we'll have our players going through that same way as the French have their players going to Claire Fontaine, so I'm optimistic about that.“ Against expectations, the Americans upset Colombia and fell to Romania, flipping most pre-tournament predictions. And then obviously once you get into the knockout phase, everything changes. “And again in 94, good and bad news: The bad news, if you will, is who do we draw (Brazil). So that put us on the competitive match and people finally were going to give us a little bit of respect and say we actually belong in the tournament, not just because we're the host, but also it electrified our fans,” Rothenberg highlighted, before explaining the excitement and how fans showed their support. And so it was like the first time, as far as I could tell, that that they really caught the fever, that they really got the unique spirit of the World Cup, and so on one hand, it was a shame we drew Brazil because hopefully we would have beaten somebody else. Over the past several months, Mauricio Pochettino has begun shaping a competitive squad after calling in more than 40 players throughout 2025. Inter Miami selected defender Abdel Talabi in the 2025 Major League Soccer SuperDraft, making him a new teammate of Lionel Messi. Ahead of the 2026 season, Lionel Messi is set to receive a major squad boost as Inter Miami are reportedly closing in the signing of a star included in the 2025 MLS Best XI. This week, Inter Miami delivered a decision on Luis Suarez's future that strengthens not only its sporting future but also the emotional core of the project, offering a major boost to Messi as the club prepares for a pivotal 2026 season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Santos president Marcelo Teixeira says he has a "positive expectation" that Neymar will extend his contract despite reported interest from Flamengo. The 33-year-old played a crucial role in keeping his boyhood club in the Brazilian top-flight and despite having a huge amount of affection for the Vila Belmiro side, the forward is unsure about his future as his contract ticks down. Despite playing through the pain of a knee injury, something he will have an arthroscopy on when he returns from his holiday in the United States, Neymar was instrumental in Santos maintaining their top-flight status in recent weeks. The veteran scored five goals and added an assist in his last four games as Peixe narrowly avoided the drop. Teixeira has previously said that renewing Neymar's contract, which expires at the end of December, is a big "priority" but the player himself left the door open to an exit. In early December, Neymar said, "I do not know, really. For sure my priority always goes to Santos." While Santos want to keep Neymar up until the 2026 World Cup at the very least, Brazilian league winners Flamengo are reportedly eyeing a move for the former Barcelona star. Teixeira, however, is still hopeful of striking a deal with the ex-Paris Saint-Germain ace. Maybe we imagined taking advantage of it more in the first half of the year and we couldn't, but it's nobody's fault. Neymar's participation continues to be important, off the field and on it. We are evaluating the numbers and extending these values. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. While the Santos president is keeping his fingers crossed that they will be able to retain Neymar, who started his career at the Brazilian giants before leaving for Barcelona in 2013, they can only do so much to keep him in 2026. We left this deadline so that he could travel with his family. There is no set deadline, but we are in a strong and good dialogue. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting After Neymar finishes his holiday, before going under the knife, he will set his sights on getting back to fitness quickly as he bids to be in Brazil's World Cup squad. Although he is a Brazilian icon, partly due to guiding the Selecao to Olympic gold in Rio in 2016, the ex-Al-Hilal man has no divine right to be selected. Indeed, national team boss Carlo Ancelotti said as much. The former AC Milan and Real Madrid manager said in early December, "If we talk about Neymar, we have to talk about other players. We have to think about Brazil, which can be with Neymar or without Neymar, with other players or without other players. I understand very well that they are very interested in Neymar, I want to clarify that we are in December, the World Cup is in June, I will choose the team that will go to the World Cup in May. If Neymar deserves to be, if he is well, better than someone else, he will play in the World Cup and period. I don't owe anyone a debt."</p>

For most of us, there's likely to be a few highlights sat alongside the odd moment we'd rather not remember, but for Joao Pedro, 2025 has been a year he will never forget. “It's been a truly remarkable year in my life, no doubt about that,” he tells FourFourTwo. Pedro picked up his Club World Cup winners' medal less than a fortnight after joining Chelsea. “The penny didn't drop immediately, to be honest with you,” he admits. [Laughs] I only really grasped the magnitude of what we'd accomplished when I got home and saw all of the reaction to it. The best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. “The fact that I'd already been playing in English football for a few seasons was helpful. Everyone was very supportive, and they received me with open arms. “That made me feel comfortable and relaxed, so I could play my football.” Another twist of fate saw Pedro's first start for Chelsea come in the semi-final against Fluminense, the club where he began his career in Brazil. “It wasn't easy facing Fluminense – it's the club that shaped me as a person and as a footballer,” he continues. “I'll have an eternal affection for them, but I also needed to show my new club, the management, the coaching staff and my team-mates that they could count on me. I ended up scoring two beautiful goals that knocked Fluminense out of the tournament. It was a mix of emotions, because I was very happy that I'd made the final with Chelsea, but also a little sad because I knew it was the game of a lifetime for Fluminense. “It was definitely a magical day in my life. My first game as a starter for a giant club like Chelsea, I scored both of my team's goals to send us into the final of the first big Club World Cup in history, and all while facing the team that shaped me. There's no way it was just an average day!” Pedro then went on to net in the final, as the Blues cruised to a 3-0 victory over recently crowned European champions Paris Saint-Germain. “We had momentum and were getting stronger throughout the competition. After the wins against Palmeiras and Fluminense, two teams who had been playing very well, our confidence increased even further. The whole world was betting on another PSG victory, as they'd recently won the Champions League, but we had belief that we could face them on equal terms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clint Dempsey, the former United States men's national team captain and one of the most influential figures in modern American soccer, has entered into a new partnership with Unilever as the global consumer goods company accelerates its marketing push ahead of the FIFA World Cup 26, to be staged across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The partnership forms part of Unilever's wider relationship with FIFA, which spans men's, women's, and esports competitions. With FIFA World Cup 26 set to be the largest edition of the tournament to date, Unilever is positioning its brands at the centre of fan culture through integrated storytelling, retail activations, and consumer promotions. These will include opportunities for fans to engage with the tournament through experiential moments and ticket giveaways tied to Unilever's product portfolio. Speaking on the partnership, Clint Dempsey, U.S. Soccer Hall of Famer, said, “When you feel fresh, you play better – simple as that. That rush of confidence sticks with you long after the whistle blows; it's what helps me show up every day. That's why I'm excited to partner with Unilever to help fans experience that same confidence in their own everyday routines.” Laura DiMiceli, Head of Sports Marketing & Partnerships, Unilever Personal Care, added, “At Unilever, we know that the love of the game is so much more than what happens on the field – it's about the passion, connection, and joy that brings people together everywhere. Dempsey, a U.S. Soccer Hall of Famer, brings long-standing credibility to the campaign. During his international career, he earned more than 140 caps for the United States, scored 57 goals, and represented the country at three FIFA World Cups. At the club level, he played a key role in elevating the global perception of American players through successful spells in Major League Soccer and the Premier League, most notably with Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur. From a commercial perspective, the deal strengthens Unilever's positioning ahead of a tournament expected to deliver record attendances, global broadcast reach, and sustained consumer engagement across North America. Personal care brands have historically benefited from major summer tournaments, driven by travel, live events, and heightened fan participation. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</p>
