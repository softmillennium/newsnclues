                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rise of AI-powered no-code tools that allow users to create applications through linguistic prompts rather than computer code, decentralized through blockchain technology, will challenge Amazon Web Services' (AWS) dominance of the cloud computing market. No-code tools will democratize access to app creation and custom-tailored user experiences that will require constant updates and maintenance from AI, Lomesh Dutta, vice president of growth at the Dfinity Foundation, a non-profit organization that guides development of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) ecosystem, told Cointelegraph. This rise of user-created applications eliminates the need for centrally managed software solutions stored on centralized servers. “When applications are continuously generated and evolved by AI, you need infrastructure that is secure, tamper-resistant, and able to stay online without constant human intervention,” he said. A significant portion of crypto companies and Web3 projects rely on centralized AWS infrastructure to power their consumer-facing applications and websites, Internet Computer founder Dominic Williams told Cointelegraph. The first outage occurred in April, causing disruptions to centralized crypto exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin and MEXC. At the time, Binance temporarily paused withdrawals until normal service was restored. AWS experienced another outage in October, causing disruptions in crypto exchange Coinbase's mobile application, with users reporting login problems, slowdowns and withdrawal issues. The October AWS outage lasted for about 15 hours and underscored the level of reliance crypto and Web3 projects, which market themselves as decentralized alternatives, have on centralized cloud infrastructure providers. Crypto's reliance on centralized infrastructure has drawn criticism from several crypto industry executives, including Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at crypto wallet company Bitget Wallet, and Carlos Lei, co-founder of decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) marketplace Uplink.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a landmark move signaling a major shift in U.S. cryptocurrency oversight, the Senate confirmed two key nominees from President Donald Trump on December 19, 2025: Michael Selig as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Travis Hill as Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The appointments of Selig and Hill - both viewed as pro-crypto figures - come at a pivotal time as Congress considers legislation that could expand the CFTC's role in digital asset markets and as banks seek clearer paths to engage with the crypto sector. Selig, a former chief counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Crypto Task Force and senior advisor to SEC Chair Paul Atkins, brings deep expertise in digital asset policy. His background includes stints at the CFTC under former Chairman Chris Giancarlo (known as "CryptoDad") and private practice at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where he advised on financial innovation. Selig has consistently advocated for classifying most cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than securities, favoring CFTC oversight over the SEC's enforcement-heavy approach. He supports regulated spot markets, stablecoins, and tokenization of real-world assets, arguing for rules that foster competition without stifling growth. In his confirmation hearing on November 19, 2025, Selig pledged to prioritize well-functioning markets and help make the U.S. a global leader in blockchain technology. Hill, who has served as acting FDIC Chairman since January 20, 2025, following his prior role as Vice Chairman, has been a vocal critic of "Operation Chokepoint 2.0" - the alleged practice of pressuring banks to sever ties with crypto firms. Under his interim leadership, the FDIC has already taken steps to reverse this trend, including releasing Biden-era "pause letters" that delayed crypto-related activities and clarifying in guidance (FIL-7-2025) that banks do not need prior approval for permissible crypto engagements. Hill supports a banking-style regulatory model for stablecoins, emphasizing risk management over blanket restrictions. His confirmation solidifies these changes, allowing banks greater freedom to custody digital assets, issue stablecoins, and partner with crypto companies without fear of informal reprisals. This reversal addresses longstanding complaints from firms like Coinbase and Custodia Bank, which faced account closures and denials amid heightened scrutiny. Recent actions—such as interagency withdrawals of anti-crypto statements and proposals to eliminate "reputational risk" from supervisory programs—further underscore this thaw. Innovative entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in IT, fintech, and blockchain. Specializes in decentralized solutions for freelancing, helping to overcome the barriers of traditional finance, especially in developing regions. The CFTC currently operates with Selig as its sole commissioner following earlier resignations, and broader market structure legislation is still pending in Congress. Midterm elections in 2026 could alter the political landscape if Democrats regain influence. As one advocate noted, these leaders are poised to bridge traditional finance and blockchain, fostering innovation while maintaining safeguards. With Selig and Hill at the helm, the focus shifts from enforcement to enablement - potentially unlocking trillions in tokenized assets and solidifying America's role in the global digital economy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street firms have rallied around Ethereum as their preferred blockchain for tokenization. When JPMorgan launched a new tokenized money market fund this week, it followed BlackRock and Fidelity in selecting Ethereum as its blockchain rail of choice. Between BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Fidelity's Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), and now, JPMorgan's OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY), some of the biggest names in asset management have launched tokenized MMFs on Ethereum. The largest funds operated by BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan hold assets worth more than $1 trillion each, while the overall market for U.S. MMFs is worth more than $7.5 trillion . That all three firms have converged on Ethereum is significant. Rather than opting for private blockchains or newer, faster networks, these institutions have chosen a platform known for its decentralization, deep developer ecosystem, and regulatory familiarity. Although Ethereum is favored by the world's largest asset managers, it would be unwise to rule out alternative blockchains. Against this backdrop, many of the companies building tokenization solutions have opted to remain blockchain-agnostic. But I think outside of that, there is still a massive push towards public [blockchains],” observed Ctrl Alt CEO Matt Ong. In an interview with CCN, Ong noted that this approach is playing out across the market. While early tokenization initiatives have focused on a limited set of use cases, other asset classes may soon follow. The holy grail of tokenization is arguably native, on-chain stock issuance, and huge swathes of the global stock market could potentially be up for grabs. To that end, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently granted approval for the Depositary Trust and Clearing Company (DTCC) to pilot a general-purpose framework for securities tokenization. With exchange operators like Nasdaq primed to list tokenized stocks as soon as possible, DTCC standards are expected to shape which blockchains are integrated into America's core market infrastructure. “We're already seeing others that are bringing digital securities depositories to life,” Ong noted, adding that if incumbent infrastructure giants don't move quickly enough, they risk losing market share to new players that can bring assets on-chain much faster.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On December 20, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) added eight CryptoPunks to its permanent collection. The acquisition recognizes CryptoPunks as an essential component of digital and cultural history. The team confirmed that Mara Calderon and ArtOnBlockchain made this historic donation possible. CozomoMedici, JudithESSS, NTmoney, kukulabanze, and Rhyd0n also contributed Punks from their own collection as part of their ongoing dedication to the project. CryptoPunks are pixelated avatars that are randomly created by computer code recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Matt Hall and John Watkinson introduced the CryptoPunks in 2017. The two creators are also collectively known as Larva Labs. CryptoPunk has progressed to dominate the NFT market. At a Christie's auction in 2021, one of the most sought-after CryptoPunk NFTs, CryptoPunk 9997, sold for HK$33.9 million (approximately US$4.35 million), nearly five times its highest estimate. The NFT, which was initially purchased in 2017 for 0.15 Ethereum (then $66), is one of only 88 zombie CryptoPunks in the world. CryptoPunks market activity remains stable, indicating ongoing interest in the collection's most affordable assets, with the current floor price at 26.58 ETH (approximately $79.37). The project's lifetime sales volume has reached 1.40 million ETH, equivalent to approximately $3.89 billion, underscoring its enduring significance in the NFT market. NFTs have become increasingly popular in the art market. In July,  the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami (ICA Miami) purchased CryptoPunk 5293, one of just 3,840 female punks. After being purchased, CryptoPunk 5293 became the first NFT to be included in a major art museum collection. On February 25, 2021, Christie's posted an NFT-based digital artwork by artist Beeple, commonly known by his actual name, Mike Winkelmann, for online auction. According to Christie's, Beeple sold for an outstanding price of $69.3 million. The NFT became the third most expensive living artist at auction (after Jeff Koons and David Hockney). Beeple set a record for the most costly digital artwork. According to the 2025 Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report, the global art market may be recalibrating, but it's not collapsing, despite growing economic and geopolitical unrest. The report claimed that the industry is expanding its base at the lower and mid-price tiers, attracting a new breed of collectors, despite overall numbers indicating a period of adjustment. The report revealed a 3 percent increase in transaction volume, reaching 40.5 million. However, the report noted that sales across tracked geographies continued to face limitations in 2024 due to political tensions, economic volatility, and trade fragmentation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH wallet growth hits new highs while BTC exchange balances fall. But Bitcoin's supply on exchanges is thinning in a far more controlled way, while Ethereum's liquidity is moving differently altogether. The contrast shows a lot about how each asset is being used, held, and valued right now. Ethereum wallets are now active endpoints across the board. AMBCrypto previously reported that Ethereum's network growth surged to multi-month highs in December, and new wallet creation is spiking. Santiment data showed nearly 200,000 new ETH wallets added on the 2nd and 15th of December, levels not seen since Ethereum's late-summer rally. While Ethereum leads in wallet activity, Bitcoin's supply on exchanges has been tightening. Despite price fluctuations, holders are not rushing to sell. Exchange balances matter because they show immediate selling pressure. Coins held off exchanges are less likely to be traded quickly. In that sense, Bitcoin's shrinking exchange means confidence, even with fewer wallets overall. The pair attempted a short breakout in early December, but failed to hold gains and rolled over quickly. Since then, ETH has struggled to outperform BTC on a relative basis, with rebounds proving shallow and short-lived. Even as Ethereum attracts more users, capital continues to favor Bitcoin's stability. For now, participation strength has not translated into relative price leadership. Trading, buying or selling cryptocurrencies should be considered a high-risk investment and every reader is advised to do their own research before making any decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawmakers are scrambling to come up with a plan. But what does that really mean for South Korea? Well, grab a seat and let's talk about it. The idea of a won-backed stablecoin is actually gaining traction among South Korean lawmakers. Because the global financial landscape is evolving, and fast. Rep. Min Byoung-dug of the Democratic Party of Korea has been vocal about it, stating that it's not a matter of if, but how quickly they can roll something out. He believes that a stablecoin tied to the Korean won would be quite beneficial for cross-border payments, trade settlements, and remittances. With dollar-pegged stablecoins already getting a foothold in domestic transactions, South Korea is at risk of losing monetary sovereignty. If businesses start relying more on foreign stablecoins, it could erode the Bank of Korea's control over monetary policy. And that's a slippery slope no one wants to go down. Integrating stablecoins could be a game changer for businesses. Stablecoins could simplify cross-border payments and cut down on the expensive fees and delays that SMEs often face when dealing with international transactions. On the inclusion side, stablecoins could open doors for underserved businesses, letting them tap into global markets. If more companies start accepting stablecoin payments, they could benefit from lower transaction costs and instant settlements. This isn't just good for businesses; it could position South Korea as a key player in the digital finance arena. But, of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Yeah, trust issues are real, and a solid regulatory framework is essential. Unlike traditional bank deposits, stablecoins don't come with insurance, which could leave businesses high and dry during market fluctuations. And let's not forget about capital outflows, which could complicate monetary policy even further. South Korean companies can collaborate with Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) providers to offer employees the option of receiving their salaries in stablecoins. This caters to the growing demand for cryptocurrency payments and offers more flexibility in payment methods. To get this going, businesses have to audit their current payroll costs and ask employees if they want in on the stablecoin salary thing. In conclusion, South Korea's future with stablecoins looks like it's going to be a wild ride. Embracing stablecoins could enhance payment sovereignty and keep South Korea competitive. But whether it can be done without a hitch is another story, and time will tell how this plays out. OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quantum computing and the threat it poses to encrypted blockchains has once again crept into online bitcoin conversations, raising concerns that it poses a long-term risk that investors and developers are still struggling to talk about in the same language. Their view is straightforward: that machines capable of breaking Bitcoin's cryptography do not exist today and are unlikely to for decades. Adam Back, co-founder of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, described the risk as effectively nonexistent in the near term, calling quantum computing “ridiculously early” and riddled with unresolved research problems. Even in a worst-case scenario, Back argued, Bitcoin's design would not allow coins to be instantly stolen across the network. Bitcoin relies on elliptic curve cryptography to secure wallets and authorize transactions. As CoinDesk previously explained, sufficiently advanced quantum computers running Shor's algorithm — a quantum algorithm used to find the prime factors of big numbers — could derive private keys from exposed public keys, putting a portion of existing coins at risk. The network wouldn't collapse overnight, but funds sitting in older address formats — including Satoshi Nakamoto's 1.1 million bitcoins, which have been untouched since 2010 — could become vulnerable to threat actors Yet governments and large enterprises are already acting as if quantum disruption is inevitable. Bitcoin, by contrast, has not yet agreed on a concrete transition plan. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, said on X that the disconnect between developers and investors is becoming hard to ignore. Capital, he argues, is less concerned with whether quantum attacks arrive in five years or 15, and more focused on whether Bitcoin has a credible path forward if cryptography standards change. Developers counter that Bitcoin can adapt well before any real danger appears. Proposals exist to migrate users toward quantum-resistant address formats and, in extreme cases, restrict spending from legacy wallets. BIP360 outlines three new signature methods, each offering varying levels of protection, so the network can gradually shift rather than force a sudden upgrade. Users would opt in over time by moving funds to the new address format. Moving Bitcoin to a new cryptographic standard could take years, involving software updates, infrastructure changes, and user coordination. Starting early, they say, reduces the risk of being forced into rushed decisions later. However, Bitcoin's conservative governance becomes a challenge when addressing long-horizon threats that require early consensus. Quantum computing is not currently an existential threat to Bitcoin, and no credible timeline suggests otherwise. However, as capital becomes more institutional and long-term, even distant risks require clearer answers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seoul, South Korea, Dec.  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ROM: Golden Age on CROSS, a global MMORPG, has officially been onboarded to CROSS, an open Web3 gaming platform and games-first blockchain. This onboarding initiative, led by Henry Chang, CEO of NEXUS, and Hyunkeun Shin, CEO of Redlab Games, reflects the two companies' shared vision to integrate blockchain infrastructure into high-quality MMORPG experiences while maintaining the core gameplay values that traditional players expect. While preserving the franchise's core identity components of deep character progression, large-scale PvP content and a robust MMORPG framework, the new iteration introduces new blockchain-based systems designed to enhance player ownership, transparency and long-term ecosystem sustainability. Rather than restructuring gameplay around token rewards alone, ROM: Golden Age on CROSS integrates blockchain technology through the NEXUS-built CROSS Protocol infrastructure, allowing in-game economies and digital assets to operate within a broader on-chain ecosystem. “This is the direction we believe blockchain gaming must take,” says Henry Chang, CEO of NEXUS. “Integrate Web3 quietly, responsibly and at the infrastructure level into an expertly crafted game. We're not here to tamper with the ways players enjoy games, but to empower gamers without compromising the experience that millions already love.” From an ecosystem perspective, ROM: Golden Age on CROSS is designed around a value-preserving tokenomics model built on the strictly limited supply of the ROMx token. Rather than prioritizing short-term speculation or reward-driven structures, the game focuses on long-term stability and responsible economic design, ensuring that blockchain technology supports a sustainable gameplay environment. One of the defining features of ROM: Golden Age on CROSS is its Global One-build service, where players from around the world compete in a large-scale, nation-versus-nation structure. This global environment enables real-time interaction between regions, fostering competitive dynamics on an international scale. “The Global One-build service is designed to let players experience the true scale of competition beyond borders, where strategy, cooperation, and rivalry unfold in real time on a worldwide stage,” says Hyunkeun Shin, CEO of Redlab Games. To support seamless interaction among global users, the game includes a real-time chat translation system, allowing players speaking different languages to communicate effectively during gameplay. This system enhances item circulation while providing players with greater flexibility in managing their in-game assets. The title also supports cross-platform play across both PC and mobile devices, enabling players to enjoy the same gameplay experience regardless of platform and supporting continuous engagement within different play environments. 2)   Starter Settlement Support Mail Rewards:  Throughout the event period, key rewards will be distributed via in-game mail every four hours, including the following items: This event is intended to lower the entry barrier for new players, accelerate character growth, and encourage active participation in large-scale PvP and PvE content from the early stages of gameplay. The companies plan to achieve this through regular content updates, continuous balance adjustments and robust live service operations. By combining a proven MMORPG IP with blockchain infrastructure, they aim to deliver an experience that appeals to both traditional gamers and Web3-native users. Beyond core dApp and protocol work, NEXUS publishes and supports multiple gaming titles in the CROSS ecosystem, partnering with developers to launch fair, sustainable game ecosystem at global scale. The mission is simple: unlock the next generation of player ownership and studio growth by keeping Web3 invisible until it matters-and indispensable once it does. Redlab Games is a premier game developer specializing in hardcore MMORPGs, committed to delivering authentic and intense gaming experiences. A team of veterans with deep expertise in the genre, the company is best known for its flagship global title, ROM: Remember of Majesty. Redlab Games focuses on creating expansive global one-build services where players from around the world can compete and cooperate in real-time. With the launch of ROM: Golden Age on CROSS, Redlab Games continues to innovate by combining deep strategic gameplay with sustainable blockchain ecosystems.

The collection was also the best in terms of activity with 8,376 buyers, and an impressive 51,523 transactions, meaning participation by many as opposed to a few one-off high value NFT trades. Pudgy Penguins took the second position with sales of $2.32 million per week with a significant increase of 69.33% in the seven days. Guild of Guardians came second with $2 million sales and a small 8.28 percent weekly growth. Moonbirds showed an even greater momentum as sales reached 1.22 million with a steep upward growth of 71.75 percent per week. Moonbirds had 108 buyers and 281 transactions indicating growing interest that could be translated into a short-term resurgence with new NFT collector confidence. CryptoPunks has registered sales of $1.17 million weekly and registered a 29.92 percent drop as compared to the last week. The participation was low as there were only 12 buyers and 14 transactions indicating that high-value assets are still experiencing a restrained involvement with a change in market sentiment. Lil Pudgys, on the other hand, had positive growth, as it sold $785.67 thousand with a 49.62 percent growth per week. Although the decreasing trend, buyer interest was significant as there were 268 buyers and 1,874 transactions, which represents continuous interest despite price pressure. Mutant Ape Yacht Club became one of the leading collections as it had sold $718.37 thousand and a high 52.29% increment in their weekly sales. The collection reported 161 buyers and 354 transactions, indicating a reanimated demand correlated to its connection to the larger Yuga Labs ecosystem. Froganas recorded $665.34 thousand in sales but fell by 11.89% and 376 customers and 5148 transactions which were promising but strained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market is entering a phase marked by rising uncertainty and persistent selling pressure, as major assets struggle to regain bullish momentum. Sentiment has weakened, and price action suggests that investors are becoming increasingly selective rather than aggressively positioning for upside. However, according to an analysis by XWIN Research Japan, the most important shift currently unfolding in crypto is not visible directly in price charts but in how and where capital is being positioned. The total supply of ERC20-based stablecoins has expanded to approximately $160 billion, hovering near all-time highs. While this supply briefly contracted during the risk-off environment of 2022, it has since resumed a clear and sustained upward trend. Rather, it reflects funds temporarily de-risking while remaining fully inside the ecosystem. Capital is accumulating in stablecoins as “waiting liquidity,” positioned on the sidelines and ready to be deployed once clearer directional signals emerge. Liquidity has not disappeared; it is simply paused, patient, and awaiting conviction. The analysis also highlights that this shift in global capital behavior carries meaningful implications for Japan's crypto market. As regulatory clarity improves and tax frameworks gradually become more accommodating, Japan is positioned to benefit from a return of domestic capital that has remained cautious in recent years. Combined with renewed interest from individual investors, this re-entry of sidelined capital could deepen local liquidity, improve price discovery, and strengthen Japan's role within the broader global crypto landscape. A key element in this transition is the growing relevance of JPYC, Japan's yen-denominated stablecoin. JPYC is not limited to speculative trading use cases; it is increasingly viewed as an infrastructure layer capable of supporting real economic activity. This includes integration with Web3 services, as well as domestic and cross-border payment applications that align more closely with Japan's existing financial systems. Looking ahead, the report suggests Japan's crypto market may gradually shift away from a narrow focus on short-term price speculation. Instead, it could evolve into an ecosystem where capital actively circulates and is deployed for practical use cases. Ultimately, how effectively Japan absorbs and channels this globally mobile liquidity will play a central role in defining the market's next phase of growth. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is showing clear signs of structural stress after failing to sustain momentum above recent highs. This level coincides with the rising 100-week and 200-week moving averages, reinforcing its importance as medium- to long-term support. After an extended expansion phase through 2024 and early 2025, the market has entered a corrective regime characterized by lower highs and weakening upside follow-through. Volume behavior supports this interpretation: selling pressure has increased during down weeks, while rebound attempts have been met with comparatively muted participation. The market remains well above the 2022–2023 base, suggesting this move resembles a consolidation or valuation reset rather than a full structural collapse. However, continued trading below the short-term moving averages indicates that risk appetite remains subdued. Failure to hold current support would expose the market to a deeper retracement toward the $2.4–$2.6 trillion region, where stronger historical demand previously emerged.
