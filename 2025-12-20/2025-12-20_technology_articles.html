                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blue Origin's suborbital New Shepard rocket ship lifted off from the company's Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:15 a.m. CT (6:15 a.m. PT). An initial launch attempt had been called off on Thursday because the flight team “observed an issue with our built-in checks prior to flight,” Blue Origin said. It didn't provide further details about the issue, but today's countdown went off without a hitch. Eighty-six people, including Bezos himself, have now flown on New Shepard. Benthaus was one of six crew members on today's mission, known as NS-37. When Benthaus lost the use of her legs, she initially thought her flight into space “was never going to happen.” But in 2022, her hopes got a big boost when she experienced a zero-G flight arranged through AstroAccess, a project that's dedicated to paving the way for spacefliers with disabilities. Now the 33-year-old has blazed a new trail for space access. “You should never give up on your dreams,” she said after today's flight. Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said in a post to the X social-media platform that the mission marked “another step toward making spaceflight accessible for everyone.” Phil Joyce, Blue Origin's senior vice president for the New Shepard program, said in a mission recap that “Michi's flight is particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone, and we are proud to help her achieve this dream.” Kent, Wash.-based Blue Origin has been working for several years to improve accessibility at its launch facility in Texas — for example, by adding an elevator to the seven-story launch tower. Blue Origin says it has previously flown people who are hard of hearing, have limited mobility or limb differences, have low vision or are legally blind. Blue Origin didn't need to make significant modifications in the New Shepard crew capsule for today's flight. But launch commentator Joel Eby said the mission team made “a few ground system improvements,” such as providing a bench that Benthaus could use to get into and out of the capsule with assistance from others. Blue Origin typically doesn't reveal how much people pay to take trips on New Shepard. In some cases, crew members have flown as invited guests. The suborbital space program's previous milestones include flying the world's oldest spaceflier (former test pilot Ed Dwight, who was 90 when he rode on New Shepard last year); the world's youngest spaceflier (Oliver Daemen, who was 18 when he flew with Bezos and two others in 2021). His work enabled so many to reach space–I am glad he finally made the journey himself. You just inspired millions to look up and imagine what is possible 🚀 https://t.co/RMHa54o6Xh This is an updated version of a report first published on Dec. 18.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shipping products should take weeks, not months. I've lost track of how many times I've been asked something to the effect of, “Can't you just build it with AI?” But the reality on the ground is much different. At Replify, we've built our product with a small team of exceptional full-stack engineers using AI as their copilot. It has transformed how we plan, design, architect, and build, but it's all far more nuanced than the narrative suggests. It can turn some unacceptable timelines into a same-day release. We shipped the whole thing in one hour: defined, coded, reviewed, tested, and deployed. Getting it right on the first try is rare, but that kind of speed is now often possible. It's better than humans at repo-wide, difficult debugging. We had a tricky user-reported bug that one of our developers spent two days chasing. We pushed a hot fix to prod in under 30 minutes. What used to take months and endless meetings in enterprise environments now takes a few focused hours. We'll dump ramblings of business requirements into an LLM, ask it to stress-test ideas, co-write the documentation, and iterate through architectural options with pros, cons, and failure points. It surfaces scenarios and ideas instantly that we didn't think of and produces clean artifacts for the team. Good-enough UI and documentation come for free. In early days, AI lets you get to “something that works” shockingly fast. Technology is rarely the competitive moat anymore, it's having things like distribution, customers, and operational excellence. We spent an entire day trying to get ChatGPT and Gemini to solve complex AWS Amplify redirect needs. You still need to prompt carefully and review everything. AI is spectacular at introducing subtle regressions if you're not explicit about constraints and testing. It will also rewrite perfectly fine code if you tell it something is broken (and you're wrong). Infra, security, and scaling require real expertise. Models can talk about architecture and infrastructure, but coding assistants still struggle to produce secure, scalable infrastructure-as-code. They don't always see downstream consequences like cost spikes or exposure risks without a knowledgeable prompter. Experts still determine the best robust solution. One bonus non-AI win helping us here: Loom videos for instant ticket creation (as opposed to laborious requirement documentation) result in faster handoffs, fewer misunderstandings, more accurate output, and better async velocity. It's replacing slow feedback loops, tedious work, and barriers to execution. We're not living in a world where AI writes, deploys, and scales your entire product (yet). University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines. Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You can no longer buy the $399 Steam Deck new. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Valve says, “We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.” With the purchase button under the LCD model grayed out and marked as “Out of stock,” it's safe to say that we'd no longer be able to purchase the best budget handheld gaming PC of 2025 brand new, although there's still a chance that you can score a refurbished version down the road. The company did not explain why it's ending the production of one of its most popular Steam Deck models, so we can only guess as to why they're doing that. A Kingston rep said NAND prices for kits have more than tripled since the start of the year, forcing memory module manufacturers to raise prices as their costs rise. More than that, the problem is expected to get worse in 2026, as memory chip makers hedge their bets against an AI bubble. Others say that the company is clearing up inventory in preparation for new products. However, these are totally different device categories, so it's unlikely that their manufacturing lines would've affected Steam Deck production. It's also doubtful that Valve is preparing for a second-generation handheld gaming console, especially since it previously said it won't release a new model unless chipmakers have introduced chips with significant architectural improvements. So, if you want to get a Steam Deck for Christmas, you have no choice but to shell out an extra $150 for the OLED model.

China has brought online a national experimental research network designed to support experimentation on future network designs and to improve data transmission quality, with early demonstrations centered on extreme data movement and tightly controlled traffic behavior. The China Environment for Network Innovation, or CENI, was formally switched on this week, according to Chinese state media, transferring 72TB over 1,000 kilometers. Chinese outlets contrasted this with conventional internet transfers, claiming the same dataset would take nearly 2 years to transfer over typical public network paths. CENI has been built in response to the demands of data-heavy scientific facilities and distributed compute workloads. FAST alone is said to generate around 100 terabytes of data per day, volumes that strain shared, best-effort wide-area networks. The network reportedly spans more than 40 cities and more than 55,000 kilometers of optical fiber, and the underlying platform is built to host thousands of parallel virtual networks, allowing researchers to run isolated experiments on top of shared physical infrastructure. Information from various sources indicates support for more than 4,000 concurrent test services, multiple cloud data centers, and dozens of edge nodes connected via dense wavelength-division multiplexing at 100 Gbps per channel. Beyond throughput, CENI's designers emphasize deterministic networking as a core goal. Deterministic networks aim to guarantee latency, jitter, and packet delivery characteristics across long distances, properties that are difficult to maintain on the public Internet. While CENI's claims rest on controlled demonstrations, it's clear that this project is taking place on a massive scale, with 100 Gbps transfers, thousands of virtualized networks, and a footprint spanning much of the country. China is committing significant resources to exploring how future networks might support data-intensive science and AI workloads at a national level.

So /live is some kind of a redirect to whatever other stream source. My guess is that whoever was meant to post the latest stream had this guy's URL in his clipboard history. Oops! Hard to see it being hacking - there are way more "interesting" things to do if you have the keys to whitehouse.gov - and it's not really a big deal, except for the poor schmuck who was watching personal finance videos at work, and maybe to the guy who just found out he has a fan in the Whitehouse. Hope neither of them gets too much federal law enforcement attention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A few months back, you may have read news from Thermal Grizzly about a unique collaboration to create a professional-grade test bench, dubbed Der8enchtable, with an open design and an integrated PCB. The brainchild of overclocking legend Roman “der8auer” Hartung and ElmorLabs (Jon “elmor” Sandstrom) was first unveiled at Computex 2025, where it promptly earned a design award. The unique benchtable features an active PCB that adds functionality beyond a simple benching stand. Initially designed for internal use, the project matured into a full-on commercial venture for overclockers, reviewers, content creators, and hardware testers who frequently swap components. What sets it apart is its active PCB, which simplifies hardware testing by providing extensive connectivity: 11 four-pin fan headers across four independently controllable zones (including one for an AIO/pump), two SATA ports, four MicroSD card slots for storage, and six USB ports (four Type-A and two Type-C). Wire management is made easy with included velcro strips that utilize cutouts in the PCB/plexi. Finally, integrated RGBs in the plexi layer add a touch of flair. While it may not be as visually appealing as our previous benching table, its design is highly functional, streamlining component swapping and testing. From the legs and brackets to screws and cables, it's in the box, along with instructions for putting it all together. The PCB is matte-black, while the labels and branding are all white and easy to read (for small writing on a PCB anyway). Again, it's not really meant to be artful; it is functional, but it's a clean-looking bench table, especially if you use the velcro wire loops to wrangle the loose wires. Speeds will be slow because all the data travels over the USB 2.0 connection, but when you're benchmarking or testing hardware, that's typically not a concern, as it's just peripherals, or you're saving small files. On top is the first (of three) fan zones, each with three 4-pin fan headers and a switch to control them. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Down the right edge is another fan zone and two 4-pin pump headers. Below that are two more USB Type-A headers. The PCB also provides four microSD card slots, which are cost-effective alternatives to SSDs when considering price per gigabyte. If whatever you're testing doesn't have integrated power/reset buttons, connect the front panel power/reset headers here and voila, you now have buttons! The Thermal Grizzly Der8enchtable is an impressive improvement over standard benching tables. Its standout features—including an active PCB, peripheral attachment points, and manual fan/pump header control—offer significant advantages for testers. These additions make adjustments easier and yield more consistent test results. Furthermore, the integrated RGB lighting adds a bright aesthetic flair to the device, making it more than just a benching table. First, I would appreciate an option for M.2 connectivity directly on the benching table. While I acknowledge the difficulties with connecting PCIe and the fact that the speed isn't strictly necessary for benchmarking (and can introduce instability compared to SATA), having an M.2 mount would still be a beneficial feature for hardware reviewers and testers. My second minor concern relates to the benchtable's legs. They are generally fine, but the setup becomes slightly unbalanced and prone to tipping when a large AIO cooler, such as our Arctic Freezer II 420 (non-RGB), is used. Some extra weight on the opposite side, or shifting the PSU mounting location in that direction, would provide additional stability in this use case. The Thermal Grizzly Der8enchtable is an elevated take on the standard test bench, incorporating features that make it ideal for extreme overclockers using sub-ambient cooling, hardware reviewers, or anyone seeking a distinctive open-air PC setup. While its $269.99 price tag is steep, it offers significantly more value than competing benching tables (if you can use the features)—and is exponentially more useful that the motherboard's cardboard box. From streamlined peripheral connections to integrated RGB lighting, the Der8enchtable excels for hardware testing and intense sub-ambient overclocking. However, those simply looking to showcase their PC may find more aesthetically pleasing, lower-cost alternatives if they don't require all the advanced features contributing to the price.

AMD this week released a document titled "Performance Monitor Counters for AMD Family 1Ah Model 50h-57h Processors" (discovered by InstLatX64) that reveals numerous architectural details of AMD's Zen 6-based CPUs, including the EPYC 'Venice' processor for data centers, through performance monitoring interfaces. AMD has been talking about its Zen 6-based CPUs in very general terms for quite a while, revealing that they will feature up to 256 cores and be made using TSMC's 2nm-class process technology. This week's PMC document for software developers states that the Zen 6 microarchitecture is no longer an incremental evolution of Zen 4/Zen 5, but a deliberately wide, throughput-oriented design with an eight-slot dispatch engine and simultaneous multi-threading (SMT). In such a design, two hardware threads dynamically contend for a shared pool of dispatch slots, so, at the same clock speeds, the single-thread performance of Zen 6-based processors may not be as high as that of Apple's 9-wide (or wider) CPUs in all situations. However, in some instances, this type of architecture promises very high performance. Furthermore, the core has dedicated counters for unused dispatch slots, backend stalls, and thread-selection losses, which confirms that wide issue and SMT arbitration are the factors AMD is betting on with Zen 6. Zen 6 also substantially expands AMD's visibility into vector and floating-point execution, underscoring the architecture's emphasis on dense-math workloads. Furthermore, it delivers sustained 512-bit throughput high enough to require merged performance counters for accurate measurement. This is hardly proof that Zen 6-based CPUs will be AVX-512 performance champions, but it does show that Zen 6 can retire enough vector work per cycle to overwhelm legacy measurement methods. In general, Zen 6's performance-focused capabilities suggest it is AMD's first microarchitecture designed from the ground up for data center use cases. But based on what we can observe today, Zen 6-based CPUs will be number-crunching monsters. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancel any outdoor plans for next year because LG is dropping a flagship RGB LED TV in 2026. The most exciting part of this new model is that it will come in more “everyday” screen sizes than one might expect, ranging from a massive 100 inches to a more normal modern size of 75 inches, meaning consumers might actually buy this for their posh new living room. RGB LEDs allow for brighter displays with more accurate color, not to be confused with micro LED displays, where each pixel is its own self-emmisive LED. RGB LED uses clusters of red, green, and blue that illuminate multiple pixels at once. The new models represent the smallest RGB LED screen sizes we have seen from any brand so far (though we expect competition from more affordable RGB players like Hisense and TCL to come). Just like LG, Samsung is announcing a next-generation, heavily AI-optimized chipset for its new TV, and Samsung also claims it hits 100 percent of BT.2020, which again should mean jaw-droppingly accurate color. It wasn't long ago that Google completely redid its device tracking app to align much more closely with Apple's Find My. Now, the next step is introducing it on even more platforms. The company brought its Find Hub app to Wear OS this week, allowing anyone running a Wear OS smartwatch to launch the app and see where their devices were last seen. This isn't some half-baked version: you can track your device via Google Maps straight from the watch, play a sound to ping its location, secure the device, and even factory reset it. You'll just really need a cellular version of the smartwatch to make the most of this capability, especially if your phone is lost. A new report indicates this global memory crunch could affect Nvidia's supply of graphics cards in 2026. A rumor posted by Taiwanese tech site Benchlife claims that Nvidia will be reducing its current-gen, RTX 50-series graphics cards by up to 40 percent in the first half of next year. That reduction in supply could just be a natural way of following the market as RAM and SSD prices continue to skyrocket, but it could also be an effect of the memory shortage hitting consumer graphics cards. While Nvidia has stated in the past that it avoided price hikes in the past, that doesn't mean availability and street pricing will manage to stay grounded. Another report indicates that Nvidia will be leaving third-party partners like Asus and MSI to source their own VRAM, which was previously delivered as a package. But here's the good news: GPU pricing and availability right now are really solid. There are a lot of great, current-gen Nvidia graphics cards out there that can be purchased at retail, and most have dropped in price since the summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor. In since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student's digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation. Fast Company republished two of Maguire's deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia's new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire's social media activity. Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia's inaction on Maguire's anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk's companies, managing Sequoia's investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI. Lin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire's conduct since taking over leadership. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire's firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.” Coursera and Udemy enter a merger agreement valued at around $2.5B Hacking group says it's extorting Pornhub after stealing users' viewing data</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, the company's actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say. Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn't respond to our request for comment. Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk's former chief architect for observability. This isn't their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019. While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues. Last October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean. Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The nearly 4,000 files contain a hodgepodge of photos, handwritten notes, and more. What they do not contain are any clear revelations about who else may be criminally implicated in Epstein's abuse network. The documents the Justice Department did release contain hundreds of images of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his onetime girlfriend and convicted accomplice in a yearslong sex trafficking operation, along with other associates, celebrities, and politicians. Despite long-standing scrutiny of Donald Trump's social ties to Epstein, the president appears only sporadically in the initial release of material—for instance, in a framed photo on top of a dresser showing him and Melania Trump with Epstein. There are also dozens of photos of Epstein with women and, in at least two cases, what appear to be babies; their faces are redacted. Other noteworthy documentation relates to Epstein's placement on a sex offenders registry and a 2019 note from the acting US attorney for the US Virgin Islands informing him that he would need to comply with certain travel restrictions despite previous “provisions.” In a handwritten note to Epstein, a signature is redacted, while in another image of that same note, the name “Kathe” is visible. A calligraphed note, seemingly written by a young woman and thanking Epstein for taking her and her sister on several “adventures,” has the signature redacted, but an envelope in a similar hand bears the name of the sender. The second volume contains 574 photos and one four-second video. Many of the photos feature Epstein and Maxwell in various locations. However, Bill Clinton appears multiple times in the second batch of images. In one photo, he is shirtless in a pool with a woman whose identity has been redacted; a photo that appears to have been taken at the same location shows Clinton and Maxwell in the pool. Clinton also appears in multiple photos with women whose identities have been redacted. During a portion of that trip, he was accompanied by Tucker and Spacey, according to The New York Times. (Clinton spokesperson Angel Ureña released a statement reading, in part, “They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton.”) The photos show Brunel with Epstein and Maxwell in multiple locations, as well as aboard what appears to be Epstein's infamous private jet. In several images, Maxwell is seen massaging Brunel's feet and sticking one foot between her breasts. One of those, which appears to have been framed, shows a man who appears to be Prince Andrew posing on his side on the laps of at least four women, whose faces are all redacted. Many images with those markers include Clinton, and several were seemingly taken on a group vacation to Thailand that Clinton is alleged to have taken with Epstein and Maxwell. Many photos show the faces of individuals that are unredacted but not clearly discernible, and several appear to have been taken on one of Epstein's group vacations with Clinton. Several of the photos were attached to written notes from an interview with a woman who described being assaulted by Epstein several times when she was a minor, and who seemingly provided those photos to investigators. One PDF shows what appears to be a scrapbook commemorating an anniversary of some kind in September 2007. The scrapbook features Epstein posing in several photos with a woman whose face is redacted. The first page includes several photos of a girl or young woman and handwritten text reading, “Once upon a time… …there was a clueless little girl…” The second page shows cut-out photos arranged so that it looks as if Epstein is ogling the young woman adjusting her athletic wear. Consequent pages seem to convey that the girl eventually began traveling around the world with Epstein to at least four countries and territories, and spent at least one Christmas with him. A few pages show Epstein smiling with a clay or mud mask on his face, alongside jokes about fighting and later making amends. Throughout the files, law enforcement included blue papers claiming that one or several photos were not scanned because they contained what investigators labeled as child sexual abuse material (CSAM). However, several of the photos that were ultimately scanned include individuals who are either nude or slightly clothed, with certain portions of the images redacted. Other photos appear to show physical objects that were cataloged by investigators, including sex toys and the DVD cases of commercial pornographic videos. A fourth batch of records contains a mix of evidence inventories, retail records, and heavily redacted notes detailing what authorities collected during the investigation. Retail receipts document purchases from adult video stores, while Amazon order confirmations show shipments of BDSM-themed books, with titles focused on sexual dominance, submission, and erotic “training.” Numerous entries are marked “ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED,” covering VHS tapes, microcassettes, MiniDV tapes, CDs, and DVDs, with some labeled as interviews, statements, voicemail messages, and other digital recordings. Another document contains an early complaint alleging that Epstein possessed photographs of nude minors taken by a woman—who described them as artistic works—after she reported that he obtained the images and their negatives without her consent. The batch also includes travel-related records ranging from commercial itineraries and hotel bookings to logs of repeated private-jet movements between hubs such as Teterboro, Palm Beach, and the US Virgin Islands, with recorded stops in France, Morocco, and Canada. Separate entries document international crossings through New York airports to destinations including Istanbul, Rome, Sao Paulo, Lisbon, Tel Aviv, Copenhagen, and Cancun, without identifying companions or purpose.

Separate entries document international crossings through New York airports to destinations including Istanbul, Rome, Sao Paulo, Lisbon, Tel Aviv, Copenhagen, and Cancun, without identifying companions or purpose. WIRED is continuing to review the newly released records and will report further findings as additional material is examined and verified.
