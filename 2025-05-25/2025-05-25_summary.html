After boasting he would end the war within 24 hours, the question now is whether US president has disengaged



The noises in Kyiv in the early hours of Sunday morning went like this. First was the staccato sound of the air defences booming on the edge of the city. As those guns stopped, the sound of drone motors approaching was audible, getting quickly louder before the briefest moment of silence and then a sudden detonation.

But, after two days of heavy Russian air raids that hit civilian buildings across Ukraine, the response has been silence from Donald Trump.

In the space of just over a week, since the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since March 2022 broke up inconclusively with no sign of a ceasefire, the failure of his intervention has become clear.

Boasting before his inauguration as US president that he could end the war in 24 hours, he has instead emboldened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by declining to impose pressure for an immediate ceasefire – backed by Europe – or meaningful sanctions.

Since Trump's two-hour call with Putin last Monday, the Russian leader has made clear his disdain even as Trump's own Defense Intelligence Agency predicted that Moscow would continue fighting through this year.

In the aftermath of the call, Putin has ordered the creation of a “security buffer zone” along Ukraine's eastern border. Strikes on civilian targets only seem to be accelerating, culminating in two straight days of air raids, including Saturday night's – the heaviest aerial bombardment of the war so far, with almost 300 drones and nearly 70 missiles.

Ukrainian and western officials anticipate that Russia will once again attempt a large-scale offensive during the summer, even if they are highly sceptical that it will be effective given Moscow's punishing losses.

The reality is that with deadlock on the ground, the escalating long-range drone war on both sides is becoming ever more significant, even if it cannot conquer territory.

As it has become ever larger, with Russian and Ukrainian factories turning out thousands of new drones, it has become more sophisticated with Moscow's employment of big numbers of decoys and systems designed to fool air defence systems.

While Ukraine has targeted bases and factories, including those producing fibre optic cable for a new generation of small combat zones, the purpose on Russia's side appears aimed solely at undermining morale on the home front. In recent days, drones and missiles have hit apartment blocks, homes and a student dormitory.

On Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, angrily denounced “the silence of America … encouraging Putin”. His words raised a more critical question: whether Trump, as he has long threatened, has already walked away from his perfunctory efforts to end the war.

When a US official did stir themselves to condemn the strikes, what was missing – any suggestion that Putin and Moscow were responsible- was as significant as what was said.

Posting on X, Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, condemned the attacks under an image of fires in the Ukrainian capital. “This is Kyiv,” he wrote. “The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.”

Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, has suggested in his newsletter on the war that, far from the recent talks heralding any hopes of a breakthrough, they had in fact removed any pretence that the US-mediated talks were going anywhere.

“On Monday the great charade we have been seeing for months came to an end,” wrote O'Brien this weekend. “The charade was that Trump was trying to negotiate a deal between Ukraine and Russia that would work for both states. The reality was always that Trump was trying to bludgeon Ukraine into making major concessions to Russia and help Putin achieve many of his strategic goals.”

If Trump has already disengaged, that raises a number of difficult questions for Kyiv: will the US continue supplying military aid in sufficient quantities? More crucially, can Europe step into the diplomatic and military void provoked by that disengagement?

What is clear to Ukrainians, despite the several weeks of headlines over the potential for a breakthrough in peace talks, is that without pressure from Washington, or hugely accelerated aid from Europe, the war will grind on. And there will be more nights like Saturday's in their future.

While the Heritage Foundation document focuses on the Palestine solidarity movement, its ultimate target is far broader.

While the Heritage Foundation document focuses on the Palestine solidarity movement, its ultimate target is far broader.

Project Esther isn't just about Palestine. Crafted by the Heritage Foundation — the same far right organization behind Project 2025 — the playbook purports to provide a “national strategy to combat antisemitism.” First published and reported on last year, the document has seen new life in recent days following a New York Times investigation into Trump administration policies that mirror the plan. But Project Esther's authors make clear that their war on the Gaza solidarity movement is just a Trojan horse for a far more ambitious project: destroying the American left.

Mainstream coverage of Project Esther has largely framed the document as an effort to crush the pro-Palestinian movement. It's important to emphasize, however, that the threat Project Esther poses to the left more broadly is not a byproduct — it's part of the plan's core design. The text lays bare the McCarthyist nature of this political moment and underscores the urgent need for the left to mount a multipronged, coalitional defense.

At the center of Project Esther's crosshairs are the people and organizations it dubs the “Hamas Support Network,” or HSN, though there's no evidence that the entities it's targeting actually support Hamas, or that they are even organized in any sort of a network. The playbook proposes a slew of recommendations for dismantling this fictional network, including deporting international students, purging pro-Palestine faculty from educational institutions, defunding organizations, increasing criminalization and promoting social ostracization of people that speak out in support of Palestinian rights. “Within the United States, the HSN receives the indispensable support of a vast network of activists and funders with a much more ambitious, insidious goal — the destruction of capitalism and democracy,” Project Esther claims.

This is, of course, pure projection. There is no “vast network” of funders behind the grassroots uprising for Palestine — unlike Project 2025, which was crafted by 100 conservative organizations and, as DeSmog reported, bankrolled by six billionaire families. By attempting to frame the Gaza solidarity movement as a well-funded and cohesive network, Project Esther clearly aims to implicate any and all organizations on the left — a target that includes, but is not limited to, people and organizations that have spoken out in defense of Palestine.

That goal is demonstrated in Project Esther's repeated claim that the so-called HSN is seeking to destroy capitalism, which carries clear echoes of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch hunts of the 1950s. The project goes so far as to ludicrously equate Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto, Soviet agitprop and Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. (The Soviets, you might recall, fought against the Nazis in World War II.)

The proposals offered up by Project Esther can also be traced back to these witch hunts. One of Project Esther's suggested tools for quashing pro-Palestine activism is the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law enacted in 1938 to combat Nazi propaganda, which requires that agents of foreign countries register with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and periodically disclose their political activities, and creates criminal and civil penalties for noncompliance. Although FARA was intended to provide transparency around foreign lobbying, it was coopted for McCarthyist suppression in the ‘50s to paint left activists as agents of communist regimes. In one egregious abuse of power, the DOJ used FARA to prosecute renowned civil rights leader and historian W.E.B. Du Bois for his perceived communist sympathies. That case was dismissed, but Project Esther is now urging federal leadership to pull from the same playbook, painting leftist activists and groups as “Hamas supporters” to tee up its own weaponization of FARA.

And Republicans have already expanded their use of the “foreign agent” rhetoric beyond Hamas: Last month, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) accused The People's Forum, a New York-based community center, and CODEPINK, an antiwar group, of ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and urged the DOJ to investigate the groups for FARA violations. The Trump administration levied similar allegations against Harvard University in a May 22 post on X, claiming that the school has coordinated with the CCP and fostered antisemitism on campus. Citing a “pro-Hamas” campus environment, an accompanying letter from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the administration is barring Harvard from enrolling international students.

Many on the left have highlighted how the government's crackdown on pro-Palestine groups is itself in service of the Israeli state and its foreign lobbyists in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. But pointing out Project Esther's hypocrisy does little to undermine its mission, which hinges on equating anti-Zionism with anti-Americanism. This sleight of hand is how Project Esther widens its scope of attack. Pointing out that Zionist lobbyists are the “real” foreign agents ultimately obfuscates the deeper root of the problem — the deployment of money and imperial power, regardless of where they originate, in support of policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing — while also capitulating to Project Esther's framing of Palestinian liberation as having anything to do with being pro- or anti-American.

Even more concerning than FARA, however, is Project Esther's recommendation that the government use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to prosecute activists. By weaponizing RICO against the pro-Palestine movement, the Trump administration could ensnare people and groups across the left in a massive policing dragnet, attempting to paint everyone from anti-capitalists to Black Lives Matter activists as Hamas supporters. We have already seen RICO weaponized in Georgia against the Defend the Atlanta Forest movement, where Attorney General Chris Carr indicted 61 protesters on flimsy racketeering charges. Prosecutors claimed in legal filings that the fight to stop a massive police training center began during the nationwide protests against George Floyd's murder by police in 2020. Project Esther's authors also invoke George Floyd's name, making clear they perceive all mass mobilizations against injustice as threats: The document claims that the pro-Palestine movement is using Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel as a “George Floyd-style event to spring onto center stage and grab a giant microphone.”

Crucially, while Project Esther claims to be about combating antisemitism, no major Jewish organizations participated in its drafting, and the blueprint targets progressive Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. Only one of the four people on the project's leadership task force is Jewish, while two are evangelical Christian Zionists, and the document, notably, does not make any mention of right-wing antisemitism. Ironically, Project Esther claims that the pro-Palestine movement is “a threat to the foundations of the United States and the fabric of our society.” But the glaring lack of Jewish voices that went into crafting the document, coupled with the draconian, far-reaching tactics it proposes, should dispel any lingering doubt about the project's true aims: an assault on democracy and the overall suppression of the left.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

A Russian military commander has claimed that President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was "at the epicenter" of a Ukrainian drone attack on May 20 in Russia's Kursk Oblast. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this claim, and the commander did not provide any evidence. 

"We were simultaneously engaged in an air defense battle and ensuring airspace security for the president's helicopter flight," Yury Dashkin, commander of an air defense division, said, as cited by the Russian news agency RBC on May 25. "The helicopter was effectively at the epicenter of the response to the massive drone attack."

Ukrainian observers noted that the claims could be an attempt to garner support for the Russian president by painting him as more closely involved in the fighting. 

Putin visited Kursk earlier this week, marking his first known visit to Kursk Oblast since Russian forces took back most of the Ukrainian foothold in the region in March. 

Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. It held a significant portion of the territory until a successful counter-offensive by Russia in March, which was carried out with the help of North Korean troops.

Leslie O'Neal of Georgia pulled over college student who then spent more than two weeks in federal immigration jail

A Georgia police officer has resigned from his job after erroneously pulling over a teenager, causing her to spend more than two weeks in a federal immigration jail, and leaving her facing deportation.

The officer, Leslie O'Neal, was employed at the police department in Dalton, a small city more than an hour north of Atlanta.

Though no reason for O'Neal's resignation was provided, his arrest of college student Ximena Arias-Cristobal not only led to a domino effect that could lead to her deportation – it also engendered anger and criticism, especially given the circumstances of her immigration-related detention.

On 5 May, O'Neal pulled Arias-Cristobal over in Dalton. The officer accused her of improperly making a false turn – but those charges were later dropped after the police force admitted to mistaking her car for another.

The damage, though, was done by the time Arias-Cristobal's charges were dismissed. The 19-year-old – who is undocumented and was driving with a Mexican license – was brought to the US from Mexico in 2007, when she was just four.

The timing of her having been taken to the US barely missed the deadline for her to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program initiated during Barack Obama's presidency that provided children in her situation some protections from deportation.

After O'Neal arrested her, local authorities contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the federal agency that detains and deports immigrants. Ice agents then transferred her to an immigration jail in the state.

“I cannot go to jail,” Arias-Cristobal said during the arrest, according to dash-cam footage. “I have my finals next week. My family depends on this.”

Arias-Cristobal's plight captured national attention, with many supporting her and calling for her release. Others – including the far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – agitated for Arias-Cristobal to be deported.

“In Mexico, today, there's over 1.6 million United States of America citizens, living and thriving in Mexico, and I'm sure she and her family will be able to do the same,” Greene said during an interview with Georgia's Local 3 News. “But it's important for our nation, for our sovereignty, for us to uphold the law. And this is what we have to do.”

The White House's attempts to engage in “mass deportations” during Donald Trump's second presidency has led to an increase in arrests throughout the country. Immigration enforcement operations have been aided by local jurisdictions that partner with Ice, under what are known as 287(g) contracts. These contracts deputize local officials to carry out immigration enforcement arrests, collaborating closely with Ice.

The Whitfield county sheriff's office, which runs the local jail for people arrested in Dalton, has a 287(g) contract with Ice.

Additionally, a law signed last year by Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, requires local law enforcement, in the entire state, to apply to enter into 287(g) contracts with Ice. Immigration advocacy organizations have called that law “disastrous”.

The Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, for instance, said it would lead to “racial profiling, terrorize immigrant communities and waste local resources”.

Arias-Cristobal's father, José Arias-Tovar, had also been detained by Ice weeks earlier after another traffic stop for speeding. He bonded out of Ice detention on 16 May. Five days later, Arias-Cristobal paid a $1,500 bond, leading to her release. She was home with her family by Thursday evening.

“We're going to keep working on her case to try to keep her here permanently,” Arias-Cristobal's attorney, Dustin Baxter, told local TV station WSB-TV.

Arias-Cristobal's arrest has prompted some to rally for her release, whether in person or online. Her advocates have criticized Ice and the local police department for how they have handled her case.

A GoFundMe campaign launched for her legal defense has raised more than $90,000.

The jail where Arias-Cristobal was detained before she bonded out is known as the Stewart detention center. It is a run privately in Lumpkin, Georgia, by CoreCivic under a contract with Ice and for years has been accused of violating rights and maintaining horrific conditions.

MOSCOW, May 25. /TASS/. Russia will refer a note of protest to Sweden following a drone attack on the Russian embassy in Sweden, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS.

"Tomorrow, Stockholm will receive a note of protest. Sweden must tame its ultras, take control of the situation and strictly observe the Vienna Convention," she said.

The Russian embassy in Stockholm said earlier that on May 25 it was attacked by a drone, which dropped a container with paint near the building's entrance.

The embassy recalled that such attacks have been continuing for more than a year. It repeatedly urged the Swedish police and foreign ministry to take measures to avert such attacks and ensure the implementation of the country's commitments under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

After boasting he would end the war within 24 hours, the question now is whether US president has disengaged



The noises in Kyiv in the early hours of Sunday morning went like this. First was the staccato sound of the air defences booming on the edge of the city. As those guns stopped, the sound of drone motors approaching was audible, getting quickly louder before the briefest moment of silence and then a sudden detonation.

But, after two days of heavy Russian air raids that hit civilian buildings across Ukraine, the response has been silence from Donald Trump.

In the space of just over a week, since the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since March 2022 broke up inconclusively with no sign of a ceasefire, the failure of his intervention has become clear.

Boasting before his inauguration as US president that he could end the war in 24 hours, he has instead emboldened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by declining to impose pressure for an immediate ceasefire – backed by Europe – or meaningful sanctions.

Since Trump's two-hour call with Putin last Monday, the Russian leader has made clear his disdain even as Trump's own Defense Intelligence Agency predicted that Moscow would continue fighting through this year.

In the aftermath of the call, Putin has ordered the creation of a “security buffer zone” along Ukraine's eastern border. Strikes on civilian targets only seem to be accelerating, culminating in two straight days of air raids, including Saturday night's – the heaviest aerial bombardment of the war so far, with almost 300 drones and nearly 70 missiles.

Ukrainian and western officials anticipate that Russia will once again attempt a large-scale offensive during the summer, even if they are highly sceptical that it will be effective given Moscow's punishing losses.

The reality is that with deadlock on the ground, the escalating long-range drone war on both sides is becoming ever more significant, even if it cannot conquer territory.

As it has become ever larger, with Russian and Ukrainian factories turning out thousands of new drones, it has become more sophisticated with Moscow's employment of big numbers of decoys and systems designed to fool air defence systems.

While Ukraine has targeted bases and factories, including those producing fibre optic cable for a new generation of small combat zones, the purpose on Russia's side appears aimed solely at undermining morale on the home front. In recent days, drones and missiles have hit apartment blocks, homes and a student dormitory.

On Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, angrily denounced “the silence of America … encouraging Putin”. His words raised a more critical question: whether Trump, as he has long threatened, has already walked away from his perfunctory efforts to end the war.

When a US official did stir themselves to condemn the strikes, what was missing – any suggestion that Putin and Moscow were responsible- was as significant as what was said.

Posting on X, Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, condemned the attacks under an image of fires in the Ukrainian capital. “This is Kyiv,” he wrote. “The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.”

Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, has suggested in his newsletter on the war that, far from the recent talks heralding any hopes of a breakthrough, they had in fact removed any pretence that the US-mediated talks were going anywhere.

“On Monday the great charade we have been seeing for months came to an end,” wrote O'Brien this weekend. “The charade was that Trump was trying to negotiate a deal between Ukraine and Russia that would work for both states. The reality was always that Trump was trying to bludgeon Ukraine into making major concessions to Russia and help Putin achieve many of his strategic goals.”

If Trump has already disengaged, that raises a number of difficult questions for Kyiv: will the US continue supplying military aid in sufficient quantities? More crucially, can Europe step into the diplomatic and military void provoked by that disengagement?

What is clear to Ukrainians, despite the several weeks of headlines over the potential for a breakthrough in peace talks, is that without pressure from Washington, or hugely accelerated aid from Europe, the war will grind on. And there will be more nights like Saturday's in their future.

MOSCOW, May 24. /TASS/. EU politicians were silent after the massive Ukrainian attacks on civil targets in Russia, but now they are "squealing wildly" because of Russia's allegedly disproportionate use of force, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said on Telegram.

There were several explosions in Kiev this night.

"After massive UAV raids on our country and its capital on the eve of the Victory Day to intimidate foreign guests, there was a grave silence in the European centers. After 500 drones that were launched at civilian targets in Russia in recent days to intimidate our people, there is silence again," Medvedev said.

Now, he continued, public figures "in Paris, Berlin and London will raise a wild squeal about the disproportionate use of force, the urgent need for a 30-day truce and new sanctions against Russia."

Medvedev called on them to destroy Bandera's "parasites" on their bodies.

"And remember: as a last resort, the nurses destroy the lice with fire, burning all sources of a long-standing pediculosis!" - the politician emphasized.

Canada's Victoria Mboko celebrates beating New Zealand's Lulu Sun during their first round match of the French Tennis Open, at the Roland-Garros stadium, in Paris, May 25.Christophe Ena/The Associated Press

Victoria Mboko is still just 18, still rather new to the top level of professional tennis, and yet with a big serve, a terrific backhand and enviable court coverage, the Canadian is making the most of her first season on tour, including a victory in her Grand Slam debut on Sunday at the French Open.

When it was mentioned that her 6-1, 7-6 (4) elimination of 2024 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Lulu Sun meant Mboko has claimed all eight sets she's played over the past week-plus on the red clay at Roland-Garros – including six in a trio of triumphs in the qualifying rounds – the teen laughed, revealing the braces on her teeth.

“This does, obviously, feel really quick for me. Although it feels quick, I feel like I'm also adapting very quickly. I want to be in this level,” said Mboko, represented by talent agency IMG since the age of 12. “To adapt really fast is really important to me. The more I feel like I make it seem normal to me, the more normal it's going to be in these tournaments.”

Against the left-handed Sun, Mboko's serve – which she considers her game's greatest strength – played a significant role in the outcome.

With her father and two of her older siblings in the stands at Court 9, a short walk from Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Mboko reached a top speed of 115 mph and delivered seven aces. She won all 10 of her service games, saving all seven break points accumulated by Sun.

“I love to dictate points on my serve, and I love to use that as an opportunity to be more aggressive and be up in the score,” said Mboko, who is currently ranked 120th. “Especially in women's tennis, having a good serve and holding all the time is pretty crucial. It helps me get out of a lot of sticky situations.”

Her favourite player as a kid – not all that long ago, actually – was Serena Williams, whose 23 Grand Slam titles often came with the help of top-notch serving.

“I always modelled myself on the idea of her game. Of course, not everything I do is the same. But she had such a powerful game, and that's something that I would love to replicate and love to present my game off of that,” Mboko said. “It's great to have a role model like that and try to do something like she did.”

Mboko began to really get noticed in the world of tennis at the start of this year, when she won 22 matches in a row – all in straight sets – to earn four lower-level International Tennis Federation titles. Her first WTA match arrived at the Miami Open in March, and she won that debut, too.

She's been impressing opponents along the way, including 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff. Mboko pushed the American, who is ranked No. 2 right now, to three sets on clay at the Italian Open this month.

“She's playing top-level tennis,” Gauff said after that win. “For sure, on the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that. As far as the other parts of her game, she's obviously a big hitter, can play well, moves pretty well, has a nice backhand, same on the forehand.”

Mboko grew up playing mostly on indoor hard courts in Canada and calls that her “favourite surface for my whole life.”

That said, she's starting to get used to – and enjoy – the clay used at the French Open.

“In the future? I guess we'll see. You never know. I feel like I've been doing pretty OK on the clay so far, even though it was my least favourite surface and I thought it was my worst surface, too,” Mboko said. “But you never know.”

The Freedom of the Press Foundation notified company executives that a settlement  “could amount to a bribe.”

If Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, settles a $20 billion lawsuit brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, it could face another lawsuit from a leading press freedom organization.

The Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF), a Paramount shareholder, notified company executives in a letter on Friday that a settlement with Trump “could amount to a bribe” to the president and his administration “for their approving and not impeding” a merger of Paramount and the entertainment company Skydance.

FPF addressed its letter to Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder. In recent weeks, Redstone — who stands to profit from federal approval of the merger — has come under fire for advocating a settlement with Trump and keeping tabs on CBS coverage of the president, who claims the outlet deceptively edited an interview it conducted with Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.

Paramount's leadership has reportedly discussed settling the Trump lawsuit for up to $20 million. Redstone has privately pushed for a settlement in hopes that it will “clear the way for the merger's approval,” The Wall Street Journal reported last month.

“I am writing to demand that you institute an immediate litigation hold, as FPF plans to file a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of Paramount in the event of a settlement by Paramount,” wrote Seth Stern, FPF's director of advocacy. “We expect that other long-term shareholders will join the suit.”

FPF notes that a derivative lawsuit “is a procedure that allows shareholders of a company to recover damages incurred due to impropriety by executives and directors.”

“Any damages award would go to Paramount, not FPF,” the group added.

“I'm proud that @freedom.press is doing what CBS's corporate owners won't — standing up for press freedom and against authoritarian shakedowns. People who aren't willing to defend the First Amendment should not be in the news business,” says @johncusack.bsky.social freedom.press/issues/we-pl…

The lawsuit warning comes after a trio of U.S. senators cautioned that Paramount “may be engaging in potentially illegal conduct” by pursuing a settlement with Trump in exchange for approval of the Skydance merger.

“Paramount appears to be attempting to appease the administration in order to secure merger approval,” wrote Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in a May 19 letter to Redstone.

Internally, Paramount executives have acknowledged that settling the Trump suit “could expose directors and officers to liability in potential future shareholder litigation or criminal charges for bribing a public official,” the Journal reported in February.

In a statement on Friday, Stern said that “corporations that own news outlets should not be in the business of settling baseless lawsuits that clearly violate the First Amendment and put other media outlets at risk.”

“A settlement of Trump's meritless lawsuit may well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system,” said Stern. “Not only would it tank CBS's reputation but, as three U.S. senators recently explained, it could put Paramount executives at risk of breaking the law.”

“Our mission as a press freedom organization is to defend the rights of journalists and the public, not the financial interests of corporate higher-ups who turn their backs on them. When you run a news organization, you have the responsibility to protect First Amendment rights, not abandon them to line your own pockets,” Stern added. “We hope Paramount will reconsider the dangerous path it appears to be contemplating but, if not, we are prepared to pursue our rights as shareholders. And we hope other Paramount shareholders will join us.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Some states are allowing private companies to decide which people in prison are allowed to contact their family members.

Some states' departments of corrections are outsourcing to private companies their decision-making about who can and who cannot communicate with people in their prisons. These decisions cut families and loved ones off, sometimes permanently.

The Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) has said it does not maintain any records of who has been blocked from communications with people incarcerated in the state. According to the department, these lists are maintained by the private company Securus, which manages phone, e-messaging and video calls for the state.

In a denial of an open records request submitted by Truthout, the department said: “The records you request from the Securus messaging system are not public records, created, used or maintained by the department and; therefore, are not disclosable under the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56. You may submit your request directly to Securus.” Neither Securus nor its parent company Aventiv responded to any requests from Truthout for further information.

As a private company, Securus is not subject to open records laws in Washington State or anywhere else in the U.S. Prisons are public agencies, and increasing privatization of communications options has contributed to decreased transparency.

People in prison exist in a state of highly restricted communication with the outside world. They cannot have cellphones or access the internet. They can place outgoing phone calls but cannot receive calls, and they can exchange e-messages accessed at a kiosk or on an individual tablet. Unlike email, each of these messages costs money to send and they require both parties to have an account with the messaging service.

Phone and messaging services in prisons across the country are managed by private companies like Aventiv and Global Tel Link. These companies charge people in prison and their loved ones up to 50 cents per message for their services. Out of these fees, they also often offer a commission back to the prison itself, creating a system in which both the state and the private company make money off some of the poorest people in the U.S.

The same companies provide video call services (also for a fee), which in many facilities have been allowed to replace in-person visitation. Increasingly, the ability to receive snail mail from loved ones has been restricted as well; since 2017, at least 16 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have moved to scanning all incoming mail and providing recipients with the electronic scan in lieu of the original paper. People in prison have spoken extensively about how they are harmed by this practice, which eliminates the smells and physical traces of their loved ones from letters and replaces it with a sometimes inadequate scan. Mail scanning creates a massive surveillance database, with few companies offering clarity on what happens to the private data collected or how long it is retained.

In all forms of communication, prison staff insist they “have to know who's on the other end,” Jim Kopriva, spokesperson for the Washington Department of Corrections, told Truthout. From the prison's perspective, such monitoring is critical to catching and squashing criminal enterprises that are conducted from within the prison walls. This is why most prisons have strict rules prohibiting any third-party contact, meaning relaying a message to or from another person who is not directly on the phone, message or visit.

Knowing who is “on the other end” means the prison also maintains control over who can (and cannot) communicate with people in prison. Certain people outside the prison are blocked from communicating directly, as a result of rule violations, court orders and sometimes even administrative mistakes.

Without notification from the prison about what rules have been violated and what remedies are available, people can find themselves permanently blocked from contact with a loved one behind bars.

Take third-party contact: Since incarceration disproportionately impacts Black and poor communities, it is likely that many people know more than one person in prison. Prison rules in Washington (DOC policy 200.00) dictate that outside supporters can only deposit money to one account, punishing those with more than one loved one inside. The rule forces people to choose who they can support or risk running afoul of the rules and being blocked altogether.

Similarly, nonprofits and advocates who communicate with large rosters of people in prison, often sharing vital information or doing essential newsgathering, are open to being blocked altogether if prison officials decide that their activities constitute third-party contact.

The privatization of communications increases the risk of people being blocked with very little oversight. These companies directly advertise a set of automated tools to more effectively surveil and control communications. The contract between Securus and the Washington Department of Corrections, for example, says Securus offers software benefits such as the Threads application which “allows authorized users to analyze corrections and communications data to generate targeted investigative leads,” and the “Investigator Pro” application which “help[s] investigators find correlations among calls.”

One prison staffer familiar with mail review procedures told Truthout that a lot of communication bans come “from the company itself doing it instead of the facility doing it…. Most people that were restricted come down to the company JPay actually restricting them.”

The staff member, who spoke anonymously in order to protect their job, added that as a corrections officer reviewing e-messages, “I couldn't even see who was restricted and who wasn't restricted.”

The process that occurs when someone is blocked is opaque. People on the outside are not always notified by the DOC when there is a problem, and there is no clear appeal process for those not within the system. Emails obtained by Truthout show officials at the Washington DOC acknowledging that the gap in their notification process is a problem, but Kopriva said he was not aware of any updated processes.

Without notification, people on the outside find that their messaging accounts just suddenly stop working. Answers from Aventiv, the parent company of both JPay and Securus, are very hard to come by. Typical of corporate helpdesks, these companies offer generic email addresses and 1-800 numbers for customers with any issue, including being blocked. Most responses are automated, and human assistance is tricky to obtain. In this author's experience, for example, the only way to be directed to a live person on the JPay helpline appeared to be pressing buttons on the automated phone tree for at least three minutes.

Without notification from the prison about what rules have been violated and what remedies are available, people can find themselves permanently blocked from contact with a loved one behind bars. The ability to communicate with loved ones, whether birth family or otherwise, has critical mental health impacts for those in prison and can even decrease violence within the prison. Permanently blocking contact with someone in the outside world can be extremely damaging, yet prisons are allowing private companies to do just that.

Kopriva says the Washington Department of Corrections does everything it can to promote a “core mission of rehabilitation,” and that “includes contact with the outside world and loved ones and support networks.” This must be balanced, he told Truthout, with “interrupting negative behavior,” and particularly reducing drug trafficking in the prison.

Kopriva says drug-running is the main reason that people who want to be in touch are blocked, citing specifically the skyrocketing rate of overdoses as a main concern. But others argue that there are many other actions the department could take to more effectively curb overdoses and drug use inside.

A recent piece in the Prison Journalism Project describes addiction treatment in Washington State prisons as “scarce and confusing.” Treatment programs that are advertised are often hard to access in practice, with extremely limited availability. Another prison journalist, writing for Filter magazine, reported on the repeated failure of guards in his Washington State prison to use Narcan to reverse overdoses. The failures were due to a false belief that Narcan is not effective in the case of a fentanyl overdose (it is), lack of Narcan availability and a general hesitancy on the part of guards to administer the drug themselves.

In his discussion with Truthout, Kopriva highlighted Suboxone abuse as a major problem in prison. This is itself a demonstration of the prison's focus on control rather than safety and well-being: Suboxone is the prescription medication used to treat opioid addiction. It does not lead to overdoses, because it contains naloxone (Narcan) within it.

Prison staff have a long history of overstating the benefits of mail scanning and other severe limitations to communication while providing little evidence of their success. A Prison Policy Initiative report shows that there is no solid evidence that mail scanning limits the flow of drugs or decreases the risks of overdose. Meanwhile, addiction treatment beyond peer-support groups in prisons is exceedingly scarce across the United States.

As with book-banning, drugs are a justification that can be used to paper over communication bans issued for all kinds of reasons. Outsourcing these decisions to private companies eliminates the transparency and public accountability that can limit prisons from targeting activists and outspoken family members, or engaging in other forms of retaliation.

I don't use social media much anymore, but, just like every other personal trainer in search of an audience, every now and then I'll share videos offering technique tips for various exercises. These videos typically end with me in my body's default state of repose: a deep, butt-to-heels squat or seated on the floor with my legs crossed in a quasi lotus pose, where I'd recap some key takeaways. These positions come naturally to me – still, in the comments for these videos, people would chime in with praise for my ability to simply sit.

This feedback on my sitting form proved to be the catalyst that led to my eureka moment. It hit me, then and there, that strong muscles are nearly useless unless you can move your body in a graceful, pain-free manner.

Now, I know when it comes to grand revelations, this one isn't quite up there with Archimedes figuring out the principle of water displacement, but simple ideas can still have a profound impact. Ever since I started prioritizing movement and mobility over the pursuit of muscle mass, all of my clients have reported seeing greater results. Training injuries have all but disappeared. Same goes for the typical aches and pains that tend to plague people over 40. Just as important, our training sessions became more fun. 

Developing high-quality mobility doesn't have to be a complicated process, nor does it have to be a separate entity removed from strength training. In fact, when done properly, strength training can be mobility training, and vice versa. My approach involves taking two basic positions – the A-frame and the squat – and spicing them up with some added movements. Here are two of my favourite variations on these familiar standards.

The A-frame is essentially the same as the downward dog, only we're taking it out of the context of yoga class. Whatever you want to call it, the basic setup is the same. Begin on all fours – hand under the shoulder, knees under the hips. Lift your butt towards the ceiling as you push through the floor with your arms and extend your legs, putting your body into an inverted “V” shape. 

Now for the magic. Take one hand and reach back toward the opposite foot, allowing your torso to twist from the shoulders to the hip in the process. Repeat the movement with the other hand, and continue to alternate hand to foot for 30-45 seconds. To make this a little easier, try reaching for your knee instead of your foot. To make the movement more intense, reach for the outside edge of your heel.

For the most benefit, your grounded arm needs to push deep into the floor, and your hips need to remain as high in the air as possible. The combination of these actions – reaching and twisting with hips high – allows the spine to decompress, while also strengthening the shoulders, hands and wrists. You'll feel a nice stretch in the hamstrings and calves, too.

Settling into a deep squat is a great way to improve hip, knee and ankle mobility. Add in some thoracic rotation and an overhead reach, and you've got one of the most productive, total-body movements. Don't worry if your squat isn't picture perfect. Work within the range of motion that's comfortable for you, making use of props for extra support if needed. 

Once you've found a suitable depth, reach one arm toward the ceiling while rotating your torso in the same direction. Keeping the opposite arm on the ground (or your prop) will help to generate some leverage and will also keep you balanced. Now switch sides and keep repeating the sequence for 30-45 seconds. 

You'll likely notice right away that reaching directly overhead from this position is a tall order. That's pretty much the point of the exercise. Try not to force things into place; if you hit a sticky spot, stop, switch sides, and then see if you can go a little deeper on the next repetition. 

Each of these exercises can be performed as part of a warm-up before any activity, or they can be the very foundation of your entire training plan. You can even toss them into your weight training routine as a form of active rest between lifts. It all depends on your goals, and your willingness to explore new avenues.

MOSCOW, May 25. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was at the epicenter of repelling a large-scale attack by Ukrainian drones during his visit to the Kursk Region on May 20, air defense division commander Yuri Dashkin said.

"[Helicopter of Russian President] was virtually at the epicenter of repelling a large-scale attack by the enemy's drones. <…> The intensity of the attack during the flight of the aircraft with the Commander-in-Chief over the territory of the Kursk Region increased significantly. Therefore, we simultaneously conducted an air defense battle and ensured the safety of the presidential helicopter's flight in the air," Dashkin said in an interview broadcast by the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

The task was fulfilled, "the attack by the enemy's drones was repelled, all airspace targets were destroyed," he added.

Putin visited the Kursk Region on May 20. In particular, he met with volunteers, as well as heads of municipalities, and acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein. The visit was the first since the bordering Russian region was liberated on April 26.

An Italian tourist was tortured by a crypto investor who allegedly dangled him from the fifth floor of a Manhattan townhouse to steal his Bitcoin passwords.

Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, 28, told police he had been held captive in a $30,000 per month, eight-bedroom home for the past three weeks where he was beaten and electrocuted.

The Italian eventually handed over his passwords after his captors threatened to kill him and his family. He managed to escape while the men's back were turned and alert the police.

John Woeltz, 37, known as “the crypto king of Kentucky” with an estimated worth of $100 million, has been arrested for the alleged torture.

He faces four charges, including assault and unlawful imprisonment. He denies all of the offences.

The arrest comes as after a wave of cryptocurrency-linked kidnappings by criminals desperate to cash in on the coveted “digital gold”, including two men in France who were found with severed fingers, and a broker who escaped from his captors in Spain.

Michael Mattson, an assistant district attorney, told a Manhattan court that the victim was abducted on May 6 when he went to Mr Woeltz's Soho flat after travelling from Italy to New York City.

It is not clear why Mr Carturan went to the apartment or what his relationship to the accused is.

When he got there Mr Woeltz allegedly snatched the Italian man's electronic devices and passport before demanding that he turn over his Bitcoin password.

When he refused, the victim told officers he was bound by the wrists with electrical wire and tortured.

At one point, the captors “carried the victim to the top flight of stairs of the apartment in the compound and hung the victim over the ledge, after threatening to kill the victim if [he] did not provide the defendant with the victim's Bitcoin password”.

Prosecutors also alleged that the victim was urinated on and forced to take crack cocaine during the ordeal. They also cut his leg.

Sources told the New York Post that Mr Carturan was fitted with an AirTag that tracked his movements. But he made a “daring escape” on Friday just after 9.30am, as he ran out of the townhouse in the Nolita neighbourhood of Manhattan and toward a traffic agent nearby.

Police found cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armour, night vision goggles, ammunition and Polaroid photos of the victim with a gun pointed to his head during a search of the townhouse.

The victim was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries that Mr Mattson said were consistent with his descriptions of being bound and assaulted.

On Saturday, Mr Woeltz, who is being held without bail, was ordered to surrender his passport as prosecutors said he had the means to flee, including a private jet and a helicopter. He is due back in Manhattan criminal court next week.

A second man, who has only been named as an “un-apprehended male”, is also alleged to have taken part.

An Italian woman, identified as Beatrice Folchi, Mr Woeltz's assistant, was reportedly arrested and charged in the case. But, she told the New York Post on Saturday that she had not been arrested.

It is the third reported case of kidnappings targeting those linked to cryptocurrency fortunes.

In early May, the pregnant daughter and grandson of a cryptocurrency boss escaped abduction in Paris in broad daylight by a group of hooded individuals who sought to drag the mother and son into a delivery van.

Pierre Noizat, the French cryptocurrency boss, later praised his “heroic” son-in-law and a neighbour armed with a fire extinguisher for thwarting the attempted kidnapping.

A 60-year-old Frenchman had a finger chopped off by attackers who demanded his crypto-millionaire son pay a ransom. Le Parisien reported that the attackers had demanded a ransom of €5-7 million (£4-6 million), which was not paid.

After being held for more than two days, armed police freed him from a house south of Paris.

Russia and Ukraine swapped hundreds more prisoners on Sunday, the third and last part of a major exchange that reflected a rare moment of co-operation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the more than three years of war.

Hours earlier, the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other regions came under a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack that killed at least 12 people and injured dozens. Ukrainian officials described it as the largest aerial assault since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Russia's Defence Ministry said each side exchanged 303 soldiers, following the release of 307 combatants and civilians each on Saturday, and 390 on Friday – the biggest total swap of the war.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed Sunday's exchange, saying on X that “303 Ukrainian defenders are home.” He noted that the troops returning to Ukraine were members of the “Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service, and the State Special Transport Service.”

Nataliya Borovyk, the sister of released Ukrainian soldier Ihor Ulesov, was overwhelmed when she learned of her brother's return.

“My uncle had to calm me down and put me in a taxi so I could get here,” she told the Associated Press. “A moment like that stays with you forever.”

Borovyk said the family had been waiting anxiously for news, and that she had hoped her brother might be released in the first part of the exchange on Friday.

“We were worried about all the guys. He wasn't there on Friday, but I was here – I at least greeted them, I stood there until the very end and waited, (hoping) maybe he would appear after all.”

In talks held in Istanbul earlier this month – the first time the two sides met face to face for peace talks – Kyiv and Moscow agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees each. The exchange has been the only tangible outcome from the talks.

The scale of the onslaught was stunning – Russia hit Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles, the largest single aerial attack of the war, according to Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force.

In all, Russia used 69 missiles of various types and 298 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed drones, he told the Associated Press.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the strikes.

For Kyiv, the day was particularly sombre as the city observed Kyiv Day, a national holiday that falls on the last Sunday in May, commemorating its founding in the 5th century,

Zelensky said Russian missiles and drones hit more than 30 cities and villages, and urged Western partners to ramp up sanctions on Russia – a long-standing demand of the Ukrainian leader but one that despite warnings to Moscow by the United States and Europe has not materialized in ways to deter Russia.

“These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities,” Zelensky wrote on X, adding that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions.

“America's silence, the silence of others in the world, only encourages” Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said. “Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will certainly help.”

Keith Kellogg, Washington's special envoy to Ukraine, condemned the Russian attacks on X, calling it “a clear violation” of the Geneva Protocols. “These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.”

Russia's Defence Ministry, meanwhile, said its air defences shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Sounds of explosions boomed throughout the night in Kyiv and the surrounding area as Ukrainian air defence persisted for hours in efforts to shoot down Russian drones and missiles. At least four people were killed and 16 were injured in the capital itself, according to the security service.

“A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X, adding that the assault “lasted all night.”

Fires broke out in homes and businesses, set off by falling drone debris.

In Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, the emergency service said three children were killed, aged 8, 12 and 17. Twelve people were injured in the attacks, it said. At least four people were killed in the Khmelnytskyi region, in western Ukraine. One man was killed in Mykolaiv region, in southern Ukraine.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district was hit by a drone and one of the building's walls was on fire. In Dniprovskyi district, a private house was destroyed and in Shevchenkivskyi district, windows in a residential building were smashed.

The scale of Russia's use of aerial weapons aside, the attacks over the past 48 hours have been among the most intense strikes on Ukraine since the February 2022 invasion.

A massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted Kyiv and other regions in Ukraine for a second consecutive night, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens, according to officials.

The Associated Press

In Markhalivka, just outside Kyiv where several village homes were burned down, the Fedorenkos watched their ruined home in tears.

“The street looks like Bakhmut, like Mariupol, it's just terrible,” said 76-year-old Liubov Fedorenko, comparing their village to some of Ukraine's most devastated cities. She told the AP she was grateful her daughter and grandchildren hadn't joined them for the weekend.

“I was trying to persuade my daughter to come to us,” Fedorenko said, adding that she told her daughter, “After all, you live on the eighth floor in Kyiv, and here it's the ground floor.“'

“She said, `No, mum, I'm not coming.' And thank God she didn't come, because the rocket hit (the house) on the side where the children's rooms were,” Fedorenko said.

Ivan Fedorenko, 80, said he regrets letting their two dogs into the house when the air raid siren went off. “They burned to death,” he said. “I want to bury them, but I'm not allowed yet.”

The PoW exchange was the latest of scores of swaps since the war began but also the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians.

Still, it has not halted the fighting. Battles have continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometre front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.

Russia's Defence Ministry quoted Yaroslav Yakimkin of the “North” group of Russian forces as saying Sunday that Ukrainian troops have been pushed back from the border in the Kursk region, which Putin visited days ago.

“The troops continue to advance forward every day,” Yakimkin said, adding that Russian forces have taken Marine and Loknya in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, which borders Kursk, over the past week, and were advancing in the Kharkiv region around the largely destroyed town of Vovchansk.

Speaking on Russian state TV on Sunday, a Russian serviceman said that Putin was reportedly flying over the Kursk region in a helicopter when the area came under intense Ukrainian drone attack during his visit.

Putin's helicopter was “virtually at the epicentre of repelling a large-scale attack by the enemy's drones,” said Yuri Dashkin, described as commander of a Russian air defence division. He added that Russian air defence units shot down 46 drones during the incident.

            It's been described as the world's most dangerous race, and it's certainly one of the most ridiculous – a 200-yard dash after a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese.
    


            To win, all you have to do is chase it down a grassy hill and cross the finish line before anyone else; however, that's much easier said than done. The hill is so steep that it could give you vertigo on the start line and there is absolutely no guarantee that you will make it down to the bottom in one piece.
    


            “You've just got to have a disregard for your own safety,” Chris Anderson explained to CNN Sports. Anderson won his first of his record 23 races in 2005 and broke his ankle in the celebrations, but the excruciating pain and eight weeks in a cast didn't put him off.
    


            The next year he won again, but he doesn't remember much about his third victory in 2007, when he crossed the finish line unconscious. “That was a bit of a blur,” he noted, recalling that he'd banged his head on the way down.
    


            Nobody seems to know for sure how long they've been chasing cheese wheels down Cooper's Hill in the village of Brockworth in southwest England, but it first appeared in written records in 1826. It might have started as a pagan ritual to bless the farmers' crops, or perhaps they were originally rolling barrels down to test their integrity – a cooper is, after all, a barrel maker.
    


            But it's a tradition that the locals have fought to preserve and it's one they are intensely proud of. And now, with the advent of the internet age, it's an event which has become truly international; thousands of people flock to the event on the last bank holiday in May, and winners have hailed from as far afield as New Zealand and Australia, Egypt and the United States.
    


            But the ultimate champions are the people who know the hill best: the locals. “I used to go up there camping with my friends,” Anderson said. “We used to get drunk and throw each other down.”
    


            The hill is absurdly steep: an initial drop of 60 degrees with an average of 45 degree incline. Looking down from the top, it initially seems like a sheer drop and many runners have changed their minds at the last minute when they realize what they're in for.
    


            “The first 10 meters are, like, near vertical,” Anderson explained to CNN. “You've just got to almost dive into it and try to stay on your feet.
    


            “As soon as you go, there's no stopping, you've just got the let momentum take over. Just try and keep on your feet as long as possible, and if you fall, get up as quick as you can.”
    


            Ideally, Anderson prefers the ground to be soft, but not wet. The drier it is, the better the traction, the harder the terrain, the greater the potential for injuries.
    


            Video footage of any cheese rolling race depicts a scene of utter chaos. Few competitors are able to remain upright for very long, some are anxiously trying to maintain control by sliding on their bottoms, while others have lost all dignity, careening down in various states of distress.
    


            Still images captured by photographers at the bottom present a confusing tableau, as if a giant has tipped a box of action figures out onto the hillside, bodies are upside down, or airborne sideways, and limbs are flailing everywhere.
    


            Anderson first attended the cheese rolling when he was around 10 years old, and he remembers seeing the mass of humanity flashing past him on the hill.
    


            “It was so fun to watch people flying and falling,” he reminisced, adding that it wasn't all fun and games. “One of the most standout things was someone breaking their leg, his studs got stuck in the ground and the momentum just pushed him forward. He was sat in the middle of the hill with his leg just dangling, it was pretty disgusting!”
    


            Serious injuries are practically guaranteed, one year Anderson witnessed three broken ankles, two of which belonged to international runners who missed their flights home because of emergency surgery.
    


            Ankle injuries are common – some have witnessed feet out of alignment by 180 degrees – as are concussions; 2023 women's champion Delaney Irving was knocked out just before the finish line and only learned of her triumph when she was told about it in the medical enclosure.
    


            On the Netflix docuseries “We Are the Champions,” women's record holder and four-time winner Flo Early revealed a protrusion of her right shoulder, a permanent disfigurement, caused by a collar bone that was broken on the hill.
    


            It's therefore no surprise that many runners might need a splash of alcohol in order to run. Anderson said that the races used to start at 6:30 p.m. in the evening, but the start time was moved earlier because too many people were intoxicated. Now, runners in need of some Dutch courage just start drinking earlier.
    


            Anderson told CNN Sports he prepares in moderation by drinking a single can of lager on the walk up. “I always saw that if you were drunk and you broke something, there's not a great deal they can give you for the pain, so I always try to do it as sober as possible,” he said.
    


            Signs posted all over the hill make it clear that runners are participating at their own risk, the local enthusiasts who stage the event say they are not official organizers – in case of injury, there is nobody to sue, and the event is uninsured.
    


            Nevertheless, the BBC reported in 2013 that the Gloucestershire police force advised 86-year-old cheesemaker Diana Smart – who makes the 6.6-pound (three-kilogram) wheel of Double Gloucester cheese used in the race – that she could be held liable because anyone who facilitates the event could be deemed an organizer by default.
    


            Anderson told CNN that he never had any intention of breaking the record of 21 cheese wins, which was set in 1991, but once he got to 13, he decided to keep going. In 2011 and 2017, he won three races in a single day and he broke the record with two more wins in 2018.
    


            At the age of 37, he's recovering from a long-term hip injury – and he is “supposed to be retired” – but if his 16-year-old son decides to compete then he could be tempted back onto the hill, partly to make sure he does it right.
    


            “I'd be happy for him to run,” he said, “but I've told him if you're not gonna commit, there's no point in even doing it.” The veteran cheese-chaser knows that there are many ways to be hurt on the hill. “The most dangerous thing is going slow and getting hit from behind. I'd like him to be quick enough to get away from the carnage.”
    


            And if he ever decides to run again, he said it won't be for the cheese: “I actually don't like it. It's got quite a strong aftertaste to it.”

Ukraine brought home 303 prisoners of war on May 25 in the final phase of a 1000-for-1000 prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. 

The prisoner exchange took place in three phases carried out over three days and was agreed on during peace talks held in Turkey on May 16, the first direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in three years. 

"I thank the team that worked around the clock to successfully carry out this exchange. We will definitely bring back every single one of our people from Russian captivity," Zelensky wrote in a post on X. 

The returning prisoners included members of Ukraine's Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Guard Service, and State Special Transport Service, Zelensky stated. 

Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs said that the released prisoners included 70 men who had defended Mariupol during the Russian siege of the port city in 2022. 

The coordination headquarters added that 5,757 Ukrainian prisoners had been returned through negotiations and exchanges since March 2022, while another 536 Ukrainians had returned through other means. 

The prisoner exchange was the only concrete agreement to arise out of the direct talks held last week. 

Ukraine and the United States have been pushing for Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire, but Russia "categorically" rejected the appeal in Turkey, according to First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Serhiy Kyslytsia, who attended the talks as a member of the Ukrainian delegation. 


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information
          should be available to all.

            From day to day, Donald Trump's second term often seems like a roman candle of grievance, with the administration spraying attacks in all directions on institutions and individuals the president considers hostile.
    


            Hardly a day goes by without Trump pressuring some new target: escalating his campaign against Harvard by trying to bar the university from enrolling foreign students; deriding musicians Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift on social media; and issuing barely veiled threats against Walmart and Apple around the companies' responses to his tariffs.
    


            Trump's panoramic belligerence may appear as to lack a more powerful unifying theme than lashing out at anything, or anyone, who has caught his eye. But to many experts, the confrontations Trump has instigated since returning to the White House are all directed toward a common, and audacious, goal: undermining the separation of powers that represents a foundational principle of the Constitution.
    


            While debates about the proper boundaries of presidential authority have persisted for generations, many historians and constitutional experts believe Trump's attempt to centralize power over American life differs from his predecessors' not only in degree, but in kind.
    


            At various points in our history, presidents have pursued individual aspects of Trump's blueprint for maximizing presidential clout. But none have combined Trump's determination to sideline Congress; circumvent the courts; enforce untrammeled control over the executive branch; and mobilize the full might of the federal government against all those he considers impediments to his plans: state and local governments and elements of civil society such as law firms, universities and nonprofit groups, and even private individuals.
    


            “The sheer level of aggression and the speed at which (the administration has) moved  ” is unprecedented, said Paul Pierson, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. “They are engaging in a whole range of behaviors that I think are clearly breaking through conventional understandings of what the law says, and of what the Constitution says.”
    


            Yuval Levin, director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, also believes that Trump is pursuing the most expansive vision of presidential power since Woodrow Wilson over a century ago.
    


            But Levin believes Trump's campaign will backfire by compelling the Supreme Court to resist his excesses and more explicitly limit presidential authority. “I think it is likely that the presidency as an institution will emerge from these four years weaker and not stronger,” Levin wrote in an email. “The reaction that Trump's excessive assertiveness will draw from the Court will backfire against the executive branch in the long run.”
    


            Other analysts, to put it mildly, are less optimistic that this Supreme Court, with its six-member Republican-appointed majority, will stop Trump from augmenting his power to the point of destabilizing the constitutional system. It remains uncertain whether any institution in the intricate political system that the nation's founders devised can do so.
    


            One defining characteristic of Trump's second term is that he's moving simultaneously against all of the checks and balances the Constitution established to constrain the arbitrary exercise of presidential power.
    


            He's marginalized Congress by virtually dismantling agencies authorized by statute, claiming the right to impound funds Congress has authorized; openly announcing he won't enforce laws he opposes (like the statute barring American companies from bribing foreign officials); and pursuing huge changes in policy (as on tariffs and immigration) through emergency orders rather than legislation.
    


            He's asserted absolute control over the executive branch through mass layoffs; an erosion of civil service protections for federal workers; the wholesale dismissal of inspectors general; and the firing of commissioners at independent regulatory agencies (a move that doubles as an assault on the authority of Congress, which structured those agencies to insulate them from direct presidential control).
    


            He's arguably already crossed the line into open defiance of lower federal courts through his resistance to orders to restore government grants and spending, and his refusal to pursue the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the undocumented immigrant the administration has acknowledged was wrongly deported to El Salvador. And while Trump so far has stopped short of directly flouting a Supreme Court order, no one could say he's done much to follow its command to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return.
    


            Trump has trampled traditional notions of federalism (especially as championed by conservatives) by systematically attempting to impose red state priorities, particularly on cultural issues, onto blue states. His administration has arrested a judge in Wisconsin and a mayor in New Jersey over immigration-related disputes. (Last week, the administration dropped the case against the Newark mayor and instead filed an assault charge against Democratic US Rep. LaMonica McIver.)
    


            Most unprecedented have been Trump's actions to pressure civil society. He has sought to punish law firms who have represented Democrats or other causes he dislikes; cut off federal research grants and threatened the tax exempt status of universities that pursue policies he opposes; directed the Justice Department to investigate ActBlue, the principal grassroots fundraising arm for Democrats, and even ordered the DOJ to investigate individual critics from his first term. Courts have already rejected some of these actions as violations of such basic constitutional rights as free speech and due process.
    


            It's difficult to imagine almost any  previous president doing any of those things, much less all of them. “This ability to just deter other actors from exercising their core rights and responsibilities at this kind of scope is something we haven't had before,” said Eric Schickler, co-author with Pierson of the 2024 book “Partisan Nation” and also a UC Berkeley political scientist.
    


            For Trump's supporters, the breadth of this campaign against the separation of powers is a feature, not a bug. Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget and one of the principal intellectual architects of Trump's second term, has argued that centralizing more power in the presidency will actually restore the Constitution's vision of checks and balances.
    


In Vought's telling, liberals “radically perverted” the founders' plan by diminishing both the president and Congress to shift influence toward “all-empowered career ‘experts'” in federal agencies. To restore proper balance to the system, Vought argued, “The Right needs to” unshackle the presidency by “throw(ing) off the precedents and legal paradigms that have wrongly developed over the last two hundred years.”
    


            Trump summarized this view more succinctly during his first term, when he memorably declared, “I have an Article II (of the Constitution), where I have  to the right to do whatever I want as president.”
    


            Whatever else can be said about the first months of Trump's second term, no one would accuse him of faltering in that belief.
    


            Earlier this year, Trump signed a proclamation honoring the 250th anniversary of the famous “give me liberty or give me death” speech by Patrick Henry, the Revolutionary War era political leader.
    


            Trump's proclamation did not note the speech Henry delivered 13 years later to the Virginia convention considering whether to endorse the newly drafted US Constitution. Henry opposed ratification, mostly because he believed the Constitution provided too little protection against a malign or corrupt president.
    


            “If your American chief, be a man of ambition, and abilities, how easy is it for him to render himself absolute!” Henry declared. If a president sought to misuse the vast authorities placed at his disposal, Henry warned, “what have you to oppose this force? What will then become of you and your rights? Will not absolute despotism ensue?”
    


            Brown University political scientist Corey Brettschneider, who highlighted that speech in his recent book “The Presidents and the People,” wrote that Henry was among the founders who most clearly recognized that the “presidency was a loaded gun and its ostensibly benign powers might be used for ill.”
    


            Even those who supported the Constitution shared some of Henry's misgivings. Preventing a descent into tyranny was a major theme throughout the Federalist Papers, the essays written primarily by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton to encourage states to adopt the Constitution.
    


            To Madison, one of the document's chief virtues was that it divided power in a manner that made it difficult for any single individual or political faction to assume absolute power. A core idea in the Constitution's design was that executive, legislative and judicial branch officials would zealously guard the prerogatives of their institution and push back when either of the others encroached on it. “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition,” Madison wrote in one of the Federalist Papers' most famous sentences. “The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place.”
    


            Madison thought the Constitution created a second line of defense against despotism. Not only would power be diffused across the three branches of the federal government, it would also be apportioned “between two distinct governments” at the national and state level. That federalism would create what Madison called “a double security (for) the rights of the people.”
    


            The Constitution always had faults, most glaringly its tolerance of slavery. And its protections wobbled and cracked at times when presidents threatened basic rights – often in, or immediately after, war time.
    


            But as Pierson and Schickler argued in “Partisan Nation,” the separation of powers generally worked as intended through most of US history. “For almost a quarter of a millennium,” they wrote, “the operation of American government tended to frustrate the efforts of a particular coalition or individual to consolidate power, dispersing political authority and encouraging pluralism.”
    


            The founders' strategy, though, was showing signs of strain even before Trump emerged as a national figure. In recent decades, Pierson and Schickler argue, the increasingly polarized and nationalized nature of our political parties has attenuated the Constitution's system of checks and balances and separation of powers (a structure often described as the Madisonian system). While Madison and his contemporaries thought that other officials would focus primarily on defending their institutional prerogatives, in modern politics, state and federal officials, and even judicial appointees, appear to prioritize their partisan identity on the Democratic or Republican team.
    


            That's steadily diminished the willingness of other power centers to push back in the way Madison expected against a president from their own side overstepping his boundaries. Trump is both building on that process and escalating it to an entirely new level of ambition.
    


            Will Trump succeed in overwhelming the separation of powers and concentrating power in the presidency – potentially to the point of undermining American freedom and democracy itself?
    


            Even to pose those questions is to contemplate possibilities that Americans have rarely needed to imagine.
    


            Brettschneider's book traces the history of public resistance to presidents who threatened civil liberties and the rule of law, including John Adams, Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. He says those precedents offer reason for optimism, but not excessive confidence, that the system will survive Trump's offensive. “We have these past victories to draw on,” Brettschneider said. “But we shouldn't be naïve: The system is fragile. We just don't know if American democracy will survive.”
    


            Levin, the author of “American Covenant,” an insightful 2024 book on the Constitution, doesn't see Trump presenting such an existential challenge. He agrees Congress is unlikely to muster much resistance to Trump's claims of unbounded authority: “The weakness of Congress, and the vacuum that weakness creates, is the deepest challenge confronting our constitutional system, even now,” Levin wrote. But he believes the Supreme Court ultimately will constrain Trump.
    


            Levin believes the court will distinguish between what he calls the “unitary executive” theory – which posits the president should exert more authority over the executive branch – and the “unitary government” theory, which would expand the president's power over other branches and civil society. “So this court will simultaneously strengthen the president's command of the executive branch … and restrain the president's attempts to violate the separation of powers,” Levin predicts. That expectation underpins his belief that Trump's power grabs ultimately are more likely to weaken than strengthen the presidency.
    


            Analysts to Levin's left are much less confident the same Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority that voted to virtually immunize Trump from criminal prosecution for official actions will consistently restrain him – or that it is guaranteed Trump will comply if it does. They tend to see Trump's second term as presenting an almost unparalleled stress test for the Constitution's interlocked mechanisms to preserve freedom and democracy.
    


            The fact that the Madisonian system of checks and balances, separation of powers and federalism has “sustained itself for 235 years can give you a lot of confidence” that it will endure, Schickler said. “What I would say is: We shouldn't be too confident. It broke once before in the Civil War. It's not going to break in the same way, but the possibility of it breaking is real.”
    


            The first months of Trump's return have revealed his determination to shatter the defenses  that system has constructed against the misuse of presidential power. Less certain is whether officials from the other branches of government, leaders in civil society, and even ordinary Americans, will show the same determination to defend them.

U.S. President Donald Trump with his predecessor, Joe Biden.SAUL LOEB/Reuters

Gus Carlson is a U.S.-based columnist for The Globe and Mail.

Popular culture is littered with references to the gullibility of the average consumer, from the apocryphal declaration that there's a sucker born every minute to the infamous movie line “What the American public doesn't know is what makes them the American public.”

To be sure, U.S. companies have grown rich by finding ways to sell people things they don't need at prices they can't afford. And they will look for every excuse to improve profit margins by raising prices.

The latest case in point: U.S. President Donald Trump says big companies, particularly retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, but also manufacturers such as Ford and Mattel, are using tariffs as a convenient excuse to raise prices. 

In a shot across the bow, he said, “I'll be watching,” then suggested they should “eat” the tariffs rather than pass on any pain to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Mr. Trump's detractors say he picked this fight and that any knock-on effects of his tariff policy are self-inflicted. In short, he has no one but himself to blame. 

His supporters counter that any price gouging and attendant whining simply make his strategic point – that tariffs are meant to encourage more U.S. manufacturing, more sourcing of materials and products domestically and, as a result, lower prices, more job creation and broader economic prosperity.

Big retailers say that until U.S. manufacturing comes online at scale, they have no choice but to go offshore for goods to meet demand. Especially for companies such as Walmart WMT-N, price is everything; their business model is rooted in offering low-priced goods at high volumes to value-minded Americans. 

More businesses weigh tariff surcharges as trade wars drag on

The gap between what Mr. Trump sees as a new era of homegrown prosperity and the current reality is a valley of death for consumers, especially those on tight budgets. 

Research from the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America circulating on Capitol Hill tries to make the point. It shows how a theoretical pair of children's shoes made in China and sold in the U.S. for US$19 would cost US$24 post-tariff. With U.S. retailers ordering millions of pairs of shoes, that US$5 per pair adds up.

The math is simple. Importers must pay the tariff, and the most obvious way to recoup the cost is to pass it along to consumers. 

Despite his widely controversial tariff policy, Mr. Trump is not the first U.S. president to wrestle with the corporate sector over consumer prices and inflation levels, which are consistently among the top issues among voters.

Joe Biden claimed – and his vice-president, Kamala Harris, echoed in her 2024 presidential campaign messaging – that big U.S. retailers were price gouging, using high inflation as cover for price hikes. During Mr. Biden's term, inflation averaged about 5 per cent and was often much higher.

The real question is this: Are tariffs really hurting companies to the point where they need to raise prices? 

Many economists suggest the impact of tariffs at the retail level won't really be felt until the summer or later in the second half of the year because most big retailers are still selling pre-tariff inventories. 

That point of view supports Mr. Trump‘s concern that companies are already looking to gouge consumers now by using tariffs as a convenient excuse to jack up prices.

Most interesting in the latest standoff on pricing is that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, while at opposite ends of the spectrum on most issues, and while dealing with different root causes of consumer dissatisfaction, are aligned on how to deal with companies who raise prices unfairly. 

Mr. Trump is reported to be considering several tactics from Mr. Biden's policy toolbox – from having the Federal Trade Commission launch industry-wide investigations to more targeted probes into specific products and company profits and new legislation. Even price controls imposed by executive order are an option, harking back to Mr. Nixon's Economic Stabilization Act of 1970.

Whether government intervention can counter the effects of tariffs, real or imagined, remains to be seen. In the meantime, consumers are caught in the middle, waiting to see if Mr. Trump's strategy of reigniting domestic manufacturing will catch fire quickly enough to offset tariff-based pricing pressures.

Until then, the biggest opportunity in this land of opportunity remains duping the consumer.

Romanian presidential candidate George Simion has called on supporters to engage in peaceful protest against what he claims was a fraudulent election, warning that the country narrowly avoided a “bloodbath” caused by “demonic plans” allegedly orchestrated by his Western-backed political opponents.

The conservative EU critic lost a run-off vote last Sunday to pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Simion has contested the outcome, alleging “external interferences by state and non-state actors,” but Romania's Constitutional Court rejected his petition.

In a video message to supporters streamed on social media Friday night, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) described Dan as a “puppet of France” who won the election through manipulation and fearmongering after “mobilizing the entire Soros network, all the NGOs” to undermine his campaign.

“This fight is not lost,” Simion told supporters, claiming that “the right of Romanians to take to the streets” must be exercised – while stressing that any demonstrations must remain peaceful.

“Make it peaceful. I will say this every time, because they want to put us in prison,” he said, alleging that his political opponents were attempting to provoke violence in order to justify a crackdown on the opposition.

“That's what they wanted on election night,” he said, claiming that the opposing camp planned to manipulate his supporters into a “bloodbath” akin to Ukraine's 2014 coup – and allegedly had “some people who participated in the Euromaidan in Kiev.”

They had the crowd prepared – to have Romanians turn against each other again and for a civil war to erupt in Romania.

“Bloodbath. This was bound to happen. We were supposed to take to the streets… And I am glad about the decision made to avoid bloodshed. We were one step away from the country being torn apart due to the demonic plans they had,” he added.

Simion said he has stayed away from protests and would continue to do so to avoid escalating tensions, but urged supporters to “fight in the name of truth, democracy, freedom, peace, and in the name of God.”

“We are not getting anywhere. I advise you to join the AUR party or another sovereignist party, to participate with organizations, unions, your civic groups to hold protests, get involved, take to the streets, and demonstrate. Fight for Romania, because they are truly afraid of us,” he said.

The contested election followed the annulment of the previous vote, in which independent candidate Calin Georgescu led the first round with 23% of the vote. Romania's Constitutional Court overturned the results, citing electoral irregularities and allegations of foreign interference – including claims of Russian involvement, which Moscow has denied.

The Kremlin described Romania's election as “strange, at the very least,” noting that the declared winner did not secure victory until the second attempt, after the frontrunner was disqualified. Telegram founder Pavel Durov claimed on Sunday that Nicolas Lerner, the head of French foreign intelligence, personally urged him to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of the election.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia's large-scale attack on May 25 killed three people in Kyiv Oblast and injured 10 others, including two children, according to regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk. 

Russia barraged Ukraine with missiles and drones throughout the night, threatening every region in the country. The attacks marked the second night in a row Russia launched a mass aerial assault on Kyiv and other cities. 

The wave of attacks left three people dead in Kyiv Oblast, Kalashnyk said. 

The bodies of two victims were found when first responders extinguished a fire in the Obukhiv district, he said. Another person was killed in the Bucha district. 

Two other people in the Bucha district were wounded. 

Six people were also injured in the Bila Tserkva district, Kalashnyk reported. Two of the victims were children. 

In the Fastiv district, the attacks injured two women, the governor said. 

Emergency services are at work at the attack sites. 

Across Ukraine, attacks continued throughout the night and into the morning as Russia fired relentless waves of drones and missiles. Explosions were in Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Konotop, Chernihiv, and Kharkiv.

The night before, three civilians outside the capital in Kyiv Oblast were injured amid another large-scale Russian aerial attack.

The White House confirmed a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the key issues they discussed on May 22.

“President Trump and President Sheinbaum discussed economic and security issues,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly wrote in an email to The Epoch Times.

“And we continue to talk about trade issues, nothing in particular, but we continue to negotiate, and with a good relationship and good communication,” the Mexican president said.

Sheinbaum said she has held seven calls with trump so far.

“In the beginning, we continued talking about trade and tariffs. Remember that we, in the case of the automotive industry, have a very preferential situation for Mexico, although we would still like more, but we have a preferential situation,” she said.

Sheinbaum said they discussed other issues, without specifying which ones, and noted that both governments are continuing to work on the steel and aluminum issue, but clarified that “I would not like to say much more until we can reach an agreement.”

The call between the two presidents took place after Sheinbaum's meeting with the new U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ronald Johnson, for the presentation of credentials at the National Palace on May 19.

“We invite them to come to Mexico on this occasion,” Sheinbaum said.

“We've been primarily focused with Mexico on two things ... one is on trade, which is not my department ... and then the other is on security cooperation,” Rubio said.

On May 22, the Mexican president announced that, as part of the negotiations between the two countries, Mexican Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will travel to Washington for a meeting.

Russia's military advantage against Ukraine is declining, the Washington Post (WP) reported on May 24, citing U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials and military experts. 

While Russia's military difficulties could be an opportunity for Ukraine's allies to mount pressure against Moscow in hopes of securing a ceasefire, U.S. President Donald Trump has backed away from international sanctions efforts and appears increasingly unwilling to challenge Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Moscow faces critical shortages of weapons and manpower, making the time ripe for escalated pressure, multiple officials told the WP, many speaking on the condition of anonymity.

"Russia is very gradually taking bits of territory still, but at an unsustainably high cost," said Richard Barrons, the former head of the United Kingdom's Joint Forces Command.

A Ukrainian security official told the WP that Russia was not able to gain ground despite its significant personnel advantages and that the slowed advance may be partly a result of Ukraine's incursion in Kursk Oblast, which aimed to divert Russia's military resources from the front lines. 

"Russia is not able to take any ground, and this is the situation pretty much since the end of the Ukrainian counteroffensive," the official said, referring to Ukraine's attempt to retake Russian-occupied territories in 2023. 

"Despite the fact that they still have three-to-one superiority in number of troops — and maybe even bigger in terms of (weapons) systems — it's still not enough."

Western experts also calculate that Russia's arsenal of tanks is likely to run out in the next few months, the WP reported. 

"The Russians can continue fighting, but … the force will become more and more de-mechanized over time, and that does put a timeline on how long they can sustain the current way they operate," Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the WP. 

Barrons also said Russia was running out of opportunities to conduct major offensives in Ukraine. 

"It is very unlikely now that the Russian military have the equipment, the people, and the training and logistics to mount an offensive that would break the Ukrainian line and — even if they did — to exploit it immediately," he said. 

In light of these obstacles, coordinated pressure against Russia could be more effective now than any point since the eary days of the full-scale war, officials said. 

According to a May report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Putin still remains confident in Russia's ability to secure "ultimate victory" in Ukraine, including the full occupation of four Ukrainian regions. 

This confidence is reflected in Russia's strategy of dragging out peace talks while escalating deadly attacks against Ukraine. Trump even admitted, just days after holding a two-hour phone conversation with the Russian leader, that Putin is not interested in peace because he believes he is winning the war. 

"Putin believes that time is on his side, and Ukraine is bleeding faster than Russia," a senior European official told the WP. 

But some officials suggested that Putin may be basing his confidence on reports from subordinates that understate Russia's increasing difficulties. 

"I think they overestimate the current success of Russia," one senior European official said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called Putin's continued delays in the peace process "a mockery of the whole world" in remarks on May 23. 

"And it's definitely time to put more pressure on Russia," he said.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Tens of thousands of Poles took part in dueling patriotic marches in Warsaw on Sunday, led by the two men vying for the presidency in a June 1 runoff election which is expected to be both close and consequential for the nation's future.

Many of those who joined Sunday's marches had traveled from across Poland, a country of nearly 38 million people, not just to support a candidate but to rally behind sharply divergent visions for the nation's future.

At the head of one march was Rafał Trzaskowski, 53, the pro-European Union mayor of Warsaw who supports abortion rights and LGBTQ+ inclusion. He is a close political ally of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has led a centrist coalition government since late 2023.

During a speech to a huge crowd Trzaskowski laid out his vision for a Poland that is inclusive and vowed to work to help develop Polish industry as the nation continues an economic transformation into a regional economic and military power.

In another part of Warsaw, Karol Nawrocki, 42, addressed his supporters. A conservative historian and former boxer, Nawrocki is backed by the national conservative Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. He heads the state-run Institute of National Remembrance, which under Law and Justice became known for promoting nationalist versions of Polish history.

His supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values — a man who, like U.S. President Donald Trump, promises to restore what they call “normality.” Many voiced opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, saying Nawrocki reflects the values they grew up with.

“I am a Pole who understands the hardships of everyday life,” Nawrocki told the crowd. “I stand before you and I am fully convinced that I am your voice.”

Earlier this month, the White House released photos of Nawrocki meeting Trump in the Oval Office — a tacit but unmistakable show of support from the U.S. president.

But Nawrocki's candidacy has also been dogged by controversy. Allegations recently surfaced that he swindled an elderly man out of an apartment — claims many of his supporters dismiss as politically motivated. 

Reports also emerged that he participated in a brawl involving football hooligans in 2009, something he did not deny, saying in that in his life he took part in “various forms of noble combat.” 

His behavior during a presidential debate on Friday also generated a lot of attention and controversy: at one point Nawrocki appeared to discreetly put something in his mouth. He later said it was a nicotine pouch.

Trzaskowski argued in his speech that Nawrocki was not fit to represent the nation as its president.

“It's high time for truth, honesty to win, for the future to win, and that's exactly what's at stake in these elections,” Trzaskowski said. “On June 1, we will all make a decision that may be one of the most important in our lives. A decision that will affect the fate of our children, the fate of our grandchildren.” 

Trzaskowski previously ran for president in 2020, narrowly losing to incumbent Andrzej Duda, whose second and final five-year term ends this summer.

The runoff follows a first-round vote on May 18 that narrowed the initial field of 13 candidates to Trzaskowski and Nawrocki. Recent polls show them running neck-and-neck, within the margin of error, making the outcome impossible to predict.

Both men are now courting voters who backed the hard-right libertarian Sławomir Mentzen, who won nearly 15% in the first round. 

Trzaskowski supporters believe their candidate would better protect the country's interests by strengthening ties with European partners such as France and Germany. In their view, those alliances are vital to Poland's security, especially in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine and fears that a victorious Russia could seek to reassert control over parts of Central and Eastern Europe.

During its eight years in power, Law and Justice was accused by the European Union of undermining democratic norms, particularly judicial independence and press freedom. Trzaskowski has pledged to support Tusk's efforts to restore the independence of Poland's judiciary — something that the conservative Duda has stymied.

Romanian President-elect Nicusor Dan, a pro-EU centrist who pulled off an upset in Romania's presidential election to beat out a hard-right nationalist, traveled to Warsaw, and joined Trzaskowski's march.

MONACO (AP) — Lando Norris realized a childhood dream as he won the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday, and boosted his chances of achieving an even bigger goal, the Formula 1 title. 

Norris took his first Grand Prix win since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix — though he did win a sprint race in Miami this month — and reduced his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri's lead from 13 points to three.

Starting on pole position, Norris locked up a wheel into the first corner but still managed to hold off last year's winner, Charles Leclerc of Ferrari.

“It feels amazing. It's a long, grueling race, but good fun,” Norris said. “This is what I dream of. This is what I did dream of when I was a kid.”

Leclerc was second after closing in on Norris late in the race — though he wasn't able to attempt a pass — while Piastri was third and defending champion Max Verstappen fourth, with seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton a distant fifth.

Verstappen was the leader on track until the second-to-last lap but only because he had yet to make his mandatory second pit stop under a rule change introduced in an attempt to spice up the Monaco Grand Prix, where overtaking is almost impossible. 

Verstappen was almost certain to end the race fourth, no matter when he stopped, so he eased off, slowing down Norris and allowing Leclerc and Piastri to catch up. Verstappen seemed to be trying to pressure Norris into a costly mistake, or maybe hoping for a red-flag stoppage which could have allowed him a free tire change while keeping the lead.




Norris said the end of the race was a “little bit nervous with Charles close behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco, so it doesn't matter how you win, I guess.”

Despite predictions it could allow some teams and drivers to spring a surprise, the rule had little overall impact on the results, except for a few cases of teams seemingly slowing down one car to benefit a teammate. 

“We lost the race yesterday,” was Leclerc's verdict, referring to the importance of qualifying on pole in Monaco, his home race.

It was McLaren's record-extending 16th win in Monaco and its first since a victory for a young Lewis Hamilton in 2008. Hamilton went on to win his first championship that year.

McLaren leaves Monaco with six wins from the first eight races of 2025 as its two drivers battle for the title. Even with just a third of the season gone, a second successive constructors' title for McLaren looks all but assured, as the team's 319 points are more than double the total of any other team.

Piastri was on the podium for the second year running in Monaco, and being disappointed with third was a sign of the progress he's made in those 12 months. Second place a year ago was only the third career podium finish for the Australian, who had yet to win a Grand Prix. Third place Sunday was Piastri's seventh podium finish in a row.

“If this is a bad weekend,” Piastri said, “then it's not going too badly at all.”

A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.

Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they've become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well). 

Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it's still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:

"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?"

I get what you're saying, Frank. You'd think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn't be bypassed. But you'd be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they're not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.

There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods. 

Hackers exploit the concept of "masterprints," which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at NYU Tandon developed "DeepMasterPrints" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.  

Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you've touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.

On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn't crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn't necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn't work on them.

19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF

Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone's secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work. 

PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.

Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.

TOP 20 APPS TRACKING YOU EVERY DAY

Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don't need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.

Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.

HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFO FROM PEOPLE SEARCH SITES

10 SIMPLE STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR SMARTPHONE'S SECURITY AND PRIVACY

Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.

1. Choose trusted phone brands: If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.

2. Keep your phone updated: Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don't have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.

3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage. Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

4. Don't rely only on your fingerprint: Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn't be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your iPhone and Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.

5. Be careful about who handles your phone: If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don't know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It's rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.

6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps: Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It's safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it's better to skip it and use your password instead.

7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE

Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they're compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don't need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn't work, so both systems often go hand in hand.

            Dr. Alaa al-Najjar left her ten children at home on Friday when she went to work in the emergency room at the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza.
    


            Hours later, the bodies of seven children - most of them badly burned - arrived at the hospital, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. They were Dr. Najjar's own children, killed in an Israeli airstrike on her family's home, Gaza Civil Defense said. The bodies of two others – a 7-month-old and a two-year-old – were trapped under the rubble.
    


            Only one of her ten children, 11-year-old Adam, survived. Dr. Najjar's husband Hamdi, himself a doctor, was also badly injured in the strike.
    


            Civil defense and the health ministry say that the family's home, in a neighborhood of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, was targeted by an Israeli airstrike.
    


            In response to a CNN request for comment, the Israeli military said aircraft had “struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis.” It said it was reviewing the claim civilians had been killed.
    


            Israel's military chief Eyal Zamir went to Khan Younis on Sunday, according to a statement from the IDF.
    


            “Hamas is under immense pressure—it has lost most of its assets and its command and control. We will deploy every tool at our disposal to bring the hostages home, dismantle Hamas, and dismantle its rule,” Zamir told troops, adding that the the military needs to now take down Hamas' Khan Younis brigade.
    


            Gaza Civil Defense published graphic video from the scene of the strike. It showed medics lifting an injured man onto a stretcher as other first responders try to extinguish a fire engulfing the house. They recover the charred remains of several children from the debris and wrap them in white sheets.
    


            Dr. Sahar al-Najjar, a niece, told CNN that Hamdi, 38, had dropped his wife at the hospital and gone to get food for his children. When he returned, he witnessed a missile strike on their home that failed to detonate. He rushed inside to rescue his children but was hit by a second Israeli strike.
    


            “My father went to rescue Uncle Hamdi but found Adam on the street and took him to the hospital. Uncle Hamdi was taken by civil defense, and the rest of the children were all charred,” she said.
    


            Sahar said Dr. Alaa broke down when she showed the last bottle of breast milk she had expressed for her infant daughter, Sidra, whose body remains under the rubble.
    


            “She told me today that her chest aches so much as she was breastfeeding,” Sahar said on Sunday. “Every day at work, Dr. Alaa pumped milk to provide for Sidra, and today she showed me the last bottle she prepared for her.”
    


            “Dr. Alaa can barely speak. If you could see her face, you would understand her pain. She is only praying for her son and husband to recover.”
    


            When Adam, the sole surviving child, came out of the operating room, he called out for his sister Eve, saying, “There's blood on the tree.” One of Adam's arms is severely injured, and he will need another surgery in a few days. His father, Hamdi, remains in critical condition.
    


            In a condolence message to Dr. Najjar, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the Israeli-occupied West Bank said she will always be remembered as “the steadfast Palestinian woman and the noble doctor who heals the wounds of others while bearing her own pain in silence.”
    


            “This horrific crime is not an isolated incident, but part of a systematic targeting of medical personnel and institutions, aimed at breaking the will of those standing steadfast in Gaza,” it said.
    


            Munir al-Boursh, Director-General of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said that Dr. Najjar's husband had just returned home when the home was struck.
    


            “Nine of their children were killed: Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman, and Sidra,” Boursh posted on X.
    


            “This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. Words fall short in describing the pain. In Gaza, it is not only healthcare workers who are targeted—Israel's aggression goes further, wiping out entire families,” Boursh said.

            Ahmad al-Farra, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex, told CNN that Dr. Najjar continued to work despite losing her children, while periodically checking on the condition of her husband and Adam.
    


            Youssef Abu al-Reesh, a senior official at the Health Ministry, said Dr. Najjar had left her children at home to “fulfill her duty and her calling toward all those sick children who have no place but Nasser Hospital.”
    


            Reesh said that when he arrived at the hospital, he had seen her “standing tall, calm, patient, composed, with eyes full of acceptance. You could hear nothing from her but quiet murmurs of (glorification of God) and (seeking forgiveness).”
    


            Dr. Najjar, 38, is a pediatrician, but like most doctors in Gaza, she has been working in the emergency room during Israel's onslaught on the territory.
    


            As southern Gaza comes under renewed attack, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Sunday that two of its team members were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis on Saturday. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike.
    


            “Their killing points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza,” the ICRC said in a statement posted to X.

The U.K. is considering mandating the use of chemical castration for sex offenders under an overhaul of the justice system aimed at freeing up more space in its overcrowded prisons, Reuters reported. (Credit: Reuters.)

A British government minister says she's "not squeamish" about the idea of chemical castration for male sex offenders, and wants to make it mandatory. 

The UK is considering a range of options from a new report, which aims to cut the country's prison population by 10,000 inmates to help alleviate chronic overcrowding.

"Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offense under certain circumstances," the new report states.

Prisons in the south-west of England have been involved in a pilot program of chemical castrations since 2002, and Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood from the ruling Labour Party told lawmakers in parliament on Thursday that the program would expand to 20 more prisons in two other regions of England.

Prisoners would be given two drugs as part of the treatment: one limits sexual thoughts, while the other reduces testosterone and "problematic sexual arousal." Inmates would also have ongoing counseling to treat their psychological issues, such as a desire for sexual power and control. One recent study found that reoffending rates were up to 60% lower for prisoners who had received the treatment. 

"For some, offending relates to power, but for another subset of offenders, the combination of chemical suppressants and psychological interventions can, we believe, have a big and positive impact," Minister Mahmood told parliament. 

Initially, the option for chemical castration treatment would be only voluntary, and medical ethicists say it could be a problem to force doctors to treat an inmate who doesn't want to have it done. In Britain, there is a strict tradition of informed medical consent where a patient can refuse medical treatment, and a doctor can't ordinarily be forced to carry it out.

Sex offenders make up a significant percentage of the prison population in England, and at the end of March, more than 20% of inmates were incarcerated on sex crimes charges. The new report cautions that chemical castration "should never be used as a risk management tool or standalone rehabilitative offer, and it is only appropriate for a limited number of sex offenders".

Chemical castration is already being used in some other European prisons to treat sex offenders. Authorities in Sweden have been carrying out limited clinical trials on volunteers at a Stockholm prison, while in Germany and Denmark it is more widely used but still on a voluntary basis. In Poland, courts can pass a sentence of mandatory chemical castration for some categories of sex-offense prisoners. 

Thursday's report, written by a former government minister from the Conservative Party, also made four dozen recommendations to try and ease prison overcrowding. 

These include giving fewer people jail sentences under 12 months and encouraging other types of punishment instead, such as community service or fines; developing new policies for early release with good behavior for inmates, and tagging all offenders who committed crimes of abuse against women and girls.

The opposition Conservative Party has criticized the new report, saying that by scrapping shorter prison sentences the government "is effectively decriminalizing crimes like burglary, theft and assault." 

"This is a gift to criminals, who will be free to offend with impunity," the party's justice spokesman Robert Jenrick told reporters. 

However, the report has been broadly welcomed by the Howard League for Penal Reform, the world's oldest prison charity.

"The government is taking an important step forward by accepting most of the recommendations from this important review," says Chief Executive Andrea Coomber, but she cautioned that "the prisons crisis will not be solved by half-measures." 

Senior police officers have cautioned that if there will be fewer prisoners behind bars, they need more resources to manage the risk that offenders pose outside of jail.

            Francisco Ayala and his wife have canceled the cruise they planned to take to see the Northern Lights this year. The reasons are complicated.
    


            Ayala is a natural-born US citizen, and his wife is a naturalized citizen. But given reports of people — even with legal status — being detained and questioned at US borders, Ayala said taking a trip out of the country for fun doesn't seem worth the potential risk.
    


            Ayala also sees another problem: the economy. “The writing is on the wall … The moment I saw the market volatility, I'm like, ‘Yep, this is not going to be good.'”
    


            Travel advisers are seeing the impact of that uncertainty. More than 80% of the 460 advisers surveyed recently by TravelAge West were “very” or “somewhat” concerned about the impact of a possible economic downturn on their business, and more than half were “very” concerned about the impact of government policies.
    


            Their clients' top concern was economic uncertainty, followed by worries about the treatment of Americans abroad, safety and security, fears of cost increases due to tariffs, immigration and border policies, and travel restrictions.
    


            “You can't just take one angle and say, ‘Oh, the economy is having an issue. So let's find something less expensive,'” said Beci Mahnken, CEO of MEI-Travel. Other clients say, “‘I don't want to travel to the United States,' or ‘I don't want to travel outside the United States.' … It's like a rock tunnel, going and going.”
    


            One shaft of light at the end of that tunnel could be savings on last-minute summer trips as travelers increasingly take a wait-and-see stance with their plans.
    


            Mahnken first saw signs of trouble in early April, when US stocks plunged over fears of a chaotic trade war.
    


            Mahnken and her travel agency staff started getting phone calls from clients, calling to cancel vacations they had booked or seeking refundable trips. She said they were fearful because their 401(k)s and other investments had taken a dive. That uncertainty, she says, made them pause on discretionary spending like a summer trip.
    


            Until that moment, Mahnken said, the frenzy of heightened “revenge travel” activity that started after pandemic restrictions lifted had not slowed over the course of four years.
    


            “We were still on this incredible high,” Mahnken said. “And then … it almost hit a brick wall.”
    


            Flight analytics firm Cirium pulled flight booking data from online travel agencies from the end of January through early May, when people typically book summer trips. That data, which Cirium shared with CNN, indicates that bookings for travel in June, July and August are down nearly 10% when looking at flights from major US airports to favorite European destinations, compared to the same period last year.
    


            Flights booked in the opposite direction from Europe to the US are down 12% in the same period. That substantial drop is unusual, according to Jeremy Bowen, CEO of Cirium.
    


            “We don't often see it as wholesale as this and over such a short period of time. Really, that Q1 booking is really quite substantially lower since the beginning of the year,” said Bowen.

            Data on US travelers booking summer trips to Asia is a bit more mixed, with increased bookings to destinations like Hong Kong and Tokyo, but decreases in flights booked to other major cities in the region.
    


            Domestic travel in the US also seems to be down by about 5%, using the same search parameters.
    


            “Potentially people are waiting to see,” Bowen said.
    


            The drop hasn't been steady. Mahnken said once the stock market stabilized, her clients started feeling a little bit more comfortable with spending more. But it's what Mahnken calls a “bouncing ball” that could change again tomorrow.
    


            Mahnken, who has been in the travel industry since before 9/11, remembers how travelers behaved after terrorist attacks, during the 2008 recession and post-Covid. But the challenge this time, she says, is a combination of those experiences, including economic unpredictability and geopolitical forces.
    


            Deloitte's 2025 summer travel survey shows Americans still plan to travel this season. In fact, Deloitte data released on May 20 shows a 5% increase in Americans planning to take leisure trips this summer, but they may be taking cheaper trips than ones planned just months ago.
    


            That could mean more road trips, rather than dealing with flights that would have to be canceled in case the whole trip is scrapped, Mahnken said.
    


            That's especially true for anyone concerned about their job stability, or people worried they might have to scale back on discretionary spending if markets take another tumble.
    


            “We have people (who) are tending to now book closer in, rather than booking farther out, because … they feel more comfortable with their situation over the next four to six months, as opposed to the next eight to 12, which is a normal booking window for big vacations,” she said.
    


            For Ayala, this environment means being strategic about which trips are worth taking.
    


            “I actually don't believe that we're going to have a full-blown recession,” Ayala said. “But we are definitely going to have a slowing down of the economy, at least … If you can save yourself a hassle and save yourself the money, this would be the year to do it.”
    


            He and his wife canceled their cruise to Alaska, departing from a Canadian port, after seeing several European nations issue warnings to their citizens about potential problems entering the United States.
    


            But they still plan to attend two weddings in Mexico this year because they are important family events.
    


            Still, Ayala said he fears being profiled coming back from those trips just because of his name, even if there is no malice on the side of the border agent. He said he feels that on paper, agents could see a Hispanic name and become overzealous in questioning him.
    


            “I do dread the return. I do think that there is a non-zero chance that I will have to call my employer and say, ‘Hey, guess what? I'm not coming into work because I couldn't get back,'” he said. “But it is an important life event. This one is worth the risk, whereas just traveling for pleasure is not.”
    


            The difference in the way people are booking summer travel, and where they're going, could create opportunities for people looking for a last-minute deal.
    


            Tiffany Funk, co-founder of point.me, a travel points optimization site, said people with loyalty points should use them, because they're worth more now than they will be in the future. Funk said people can be surprised at how much farther points will take them internationally than on domestic trips.
    


            But she said there are some interesting trends domestically, partly because some Canadians have canceled their trips.
    


            “There's actually some deals to be had in places like New England and the coast of Maine, where typically you would have had to book in some cases years ago, in order to secure availability there. But we're seeing some good deals there,” Funk said.
    


            “Florida, you have the Gulf Coast, where you can get some pretty decent pricing on very popular family-friendly destinations that are usually just horrifically expensive for summer vacations,” she said.
    


            Mahnken said as cruise lines continue to launch megaships that were in production long before the current economic turbulence, they will need to fill rooms. She also points out the unusual number of theme park discounts out this season.
    


            “I am seeing a lot of cruise lines do incredibly good sales for their closer-in [dates],” she said. “Theme parks … we're seeing them put out a lot of marketing and a lot of monetary offers during what's usually a high-season time.”

            The American penny isn't going anywhere anytime soon.
    


            The US Treasury Department announced Thursday that it plans to start winding down production of the one-cent coin it has been minting for more than 230 years. But the penny will still remain legal tender, and will still be in use at thousands of retailers around the country for sometime to come.
    


            “If we look at the experience in Canada, for the first year after they stopped making pennies, there's really no change in transactions,” Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores, told CNN. Convenience stores do more cash transactions than any other group, about 32 million a day, or about 20% of the total number of purchases by their customers, Lenard said.
    


            The National Retail Federation, which represents most major US store chains as well as thousands of small retailers, also said it anticipates its members will use pennies even after production stops at some point early next year, although it does anticipate that many will round cash transactions to the nearest nickel once the supply of pennies at banks starts to run short.
    


            “Retailers' primary goal is serving customers and making this transition as seamless as possible,” said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations for NRF.

            There are an estimated 114 billion pennies currently in circulation, but they are “severely underutilized” according to the Treasury department. Many are at home in coin jars or junk drawers, or some other forgotten location gathering dust.
    


            The math says that all those pennies could fill a cube roughly 13 stories high. Many people don't even take them as change, tossing them into the leave-a-penny-take-a-penny dishes at store checkouts.
    


            Lenard said the large number of pennies in circulation means that retailers won't necessary run out of them for a while. But eventually stores won't be able to get new rolls of pennies from their banks and will start rounding transactions up or down to the nearest nickel. The decision when to do that will rest with each retailer, not official government policy.
    


            Electronic transactions such as credit and debit card purchases, will continue to be down to the penny, Lenard said, with only cash transactions being rounded.
    


            Even in countries like Canada, where penny production has been discontinued, the penny remains legal tender today. Canada's finance ministry said pennies retain their value for transactions “indefinitely” despite the fact that it stopped making the coin in 2012. If a customer wants to use pennies to complete a transaction, most retailers are likely to allow them, Lenard said.
    


            “There's a saying in retail, ‘Never lose a customer over a penny,'” he said. “I never really thought of it in these terms, but it applies even more here. I think if someone wants to pay with pennies, most retailers will err on the side of making those customers happy.”

As the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in federal funding to scientific research, thousands of scientists in the U.S. lost their jobs or grants — and governments and universities around the world spotted an opportunity.

The “Canada Leads” program, launched in April, hopes to foster the next generation of innovators by bringing early-career biomedical researchers north of the border.

Aix-Marseille University in France started the “Safe Place for Science” program in March — pledging to “welcome” U.S.-based scientists who “may feel threatened or hindered in their research.”

Australia's “Global Talent Attraction Program,” announced in April, promises competitive salaries and relocation packages.

“In response to what is happening in the U.S.,” said Anna-Maria Arabia, head of the Australian Academy of Sciences, “we see an unparalleled opportunity to attract some of the smartest minds here.”

Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world's leading scientific power — and has led to the invention of cell phones and the internet as well as new ways to treat cancer, heart disease and strokes, noted Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the journal Science.

But today that system is being shaken.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.




The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation's by 55%. 

“The Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration's projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people's priorities and continue our innovative dominance,” said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.

Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold. 

Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. — but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.

“There are threats to science ... south of the border,” said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada's leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the “Canada Leads” recruitment drive. “There's a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.”

Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends “to enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.” She spoke at the launch of the bloc's “Choose Europe for Science” — which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.

Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution's “Safe Place for Science” program.

“Our American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,” he said of applicants. “What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.”

It's too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.

Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous — and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world's leading funder of R&D — including government, university and private investment — for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world's R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to “Safe Place for Science” — 139 out of 300 total — came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.

U.S.-based applicants in this year's recruitment round for France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.

At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program — aimed at young female researchers — drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.

Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.

Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., “we are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.”

Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.

Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he's applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.

“I've never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,” said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

But it's not easy to pick up and move a scientific career — let alone a life.

Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. She said it felt like “America as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.”

Still, she wasn't sure of her next move. “It's no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,” she said.

The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide “Choose Europe” initiative.

But it's unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.

Even as universities and institutes think about recruiting talent from the U.S., there's more apprehension than glee at the funding cuts.

“Science is a global endeavor,” said Patrick Cramer, head of the Max Planck Society, noting that datasets and discoveries are often shared among international collaborators.

One aim of recruitment drives is to “to help prevent the loss of talent to the global scientific community,” he said.

Researchers worldwide will suffer if collaborations are shut down and databases taken offline, scientists say.

“The U.S. was always an example, in both science and education,” said Patrick Schultz, president of France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology. So the cuts and policies were “very frightening also for us because it was an example for the whole world.”

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the Trump administration's hopes to change birthright citizenship amid some pushback, on 'America Reports.'

The Supreme Court heard a case this month centered on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end so-called birthright citizenship, in one of the most closely watched and potentially impactful cases heard by the court in recent years.  

Though the case itself was used largely as a means of challenging lower court powers to issue so-called universal or nationwide injunctions, justices on the high court did inquire about the merits of the order itself, "Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship," which Trump signed on the first day of his second White House term.

The order, which was slated to take force Feb. 20, directed all U.S. agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to children born to illegal immigrants or children born to mothers living in the country on a temporary visa, if the father is not a permanent resident or U.S. citizen.

Despite the Supreme Court's focus on universal injunctions in hearing the case, deep and unyielding concerns persist about Trump's attempt to undo more than 100 years of legal precedent.

The ACLU included in its lawsuit the story of one couple from Indonesia but living in New Hampshire whom they said would be affected by the order.

"They arrived in 2023, applied for asylum, and their application awaits review," ACLU attorneys said of the couple. "The mom-to-be is in her third trimester. 

"Under this executive order, their baby would be considered an undocumented noncitizen and could be denied basic health care and nutrition, putting the newborn at grave risk at such a vulnerable stage of life," they added.

And such problems would persist throughout their lives, lawyers for the group noted. These persons would not be able to obtain necessary identification, such as drivers' licenses, and would not be able to vote, hold some jobs or serve on juries.

Though Trump had spoken in detail in his first term and on the campaign trail about wanting to end birthright citizenship, his executive order sent shockwaves through the nation. It was met by a wave of lawsuits from Democrat-led states and immigrants' rights groups.

One lawsuit, brought by 18 Democratic attorneys general, warned that ending birthright citizenship would strip hundreds of thousands of U.S.-born children of their citizenship as the result of a circumstance completely outside a child's control.

Statistics also bear this out. Roughly 150,000 children are born annually in the U.S. to parents of noncitizens.  If the order were to take force as Trump envisioned, experts warned the impact would be catastrophic.

​​"President Trump's attempt to unilaterally end birthright citizenship is a flagrant violation of our Constitution," New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who joined 17 other Democrat-led states in suing to block the order, said earlier this year.

More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship prior to the Supreme Court's decision to take up the case, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and "unprecedented."

To date, no court has sided with the Trump administration in upholding the executive order.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera has the latest on the legal dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard University over foreign enrollment on ‘Fox Report.'

President Donald Trump on Sunday criticized foreign countries for paying "nothing" toward the education of their citizens who are attending college at Harvard and other U.S. institutions.

This comes amid the fight between the Trump administration and Harvard for its plans to revoke the university's ability to enroll foreign students.

"Why isn't Harvard saying that almost 31% of their students are from FOREIGN LANDS, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay NOTHING toward their student's education, nor do they ever intend to," Trump wrote early Sunday morning on Truth Social. "Nobody told us that!"

"We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, but Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming," he continued. "We want those names and countries. Harvard has $52,000,000, use it, and stop asking for the Federal Government to continue GRANTING money to you!"

On Friday, a judge temporarily blocked the administration from canceling Harvard's student visa program after the university filed a lawsuit against the federal government.

Harvard argued that the policy would affect more than 7,000 visa holders — nearly a quarter of the student body — and that the administration's effort is a "blatant violation of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act," according to its court filing.

"It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students," Harvard wrote in its complaint.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM TERMINATING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS' LEGAL STATUS 

The Department of Homeland Security moved to terminate Harvard's visa program after the university allegedly failed to provide extensive behavioral records of student visa holders the agency had requested.

The records sought include any footage of protest activity involving student visa holders, even if it's not criminal, and the disciplinary records of all student visa holders in the past five years. 

Requested records also include footage or documentation of illegal, dangerous or violent activity by student visa holders, any records of threats or the deprivation of rights of other students or university personnel.

Harvard called the new policy "pernicious" and accused the administration of departing from "decades of settled practice" and coming "without rational explanation." The university also said the policy was "carried out abruptly without any of the robust procedures the government has established to prevent just this type of upheaval to thousands of students' lives."

At least a dozen Harvard students have had their student visas revoked over campus protest activity. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said before Congress on Tuesday that the administration has probably revoked thousands already and would "proudly" revoke more.

The administration has already frozen close to $3 billion in federal funding to the university, largely dedicated to research, over claims that Harvard has not adequately responded to alleged campus antisemitism in protests and has not moved to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion practices.

Fox News Digital spoke with Julia Mossbridge, the founder and board chair of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT), about a mysterious metal sphere that was discovered in Buga, Colombia.

Scientists have made a remarkable discovery of a sphere that some believe to be an unidentified flying object (UFO).

The sphere, according to social media page @Truthpolex, was spotted March 2 flying over the town of Buga, Colombia, before it landed. Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers studying the three-layered sphere, noted that it shows "no welds or joints," characteristics normally indicative of human manufacture, which further bolstered his belief in its extraterrestrial origin.

Julia Mossbridge, the founder and board chair of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT), and a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics, told Fox News Digital she remains skeptical of its extraterrestrial origins.

"It looks to me like a really cool art project," she said, urging caution in drawing immediate conclusions.

Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a "bigger picture" in which humanity must confront its own limitations.

"We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had," she said, noting that prior "grandiose" beliefs in total mastery blind us when "something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world.

"If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies, what's in our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us," she said.

She says sightings of unexplained objects have been around for decades.

"Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them," she said.

Mossbridge said the coalition of individuals working to find answers, such as the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies, the UAP Disclosure Fund and the Galileo Project, are made of people of "all political persuasions."

"They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things," she said. "Because, for instance, the sphere in Colombia is in a different country. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?"

Mossbridge urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries.

"Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," she said. 

She said experts can determine if the material is "clearly non-human-made."

Despite her misgivings about the discovery in Buga, she said it doesn't "discount all the other objects that are of extraterrestrial origin."

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas would require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a Republican proposal that cleared a major vote Saturday and would make the state the nation's largest to impose such a mandate. 

If passed as expected, the measure is likely to draw a legal challenge from critics who consider it a constitutional violation of the separation of church and state.

The Republican-controlled House gave its preliminary approval with a final vote expected in the next few days. That would send the bill to the desk of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has indicated he will sign it into law. 

“The focus of this bill is to look at what is historically important to our nation educationally and judicially,” said Republican state representative Candy Noble, a co-sponsor of the bill.

Two other states, Louisiana and Arkansas, have similar laws, but Louisiana's is on hold after a federal judge found that it was “ unconstitutional on its face.”

Those measures are among efforts, mainly in conservative-led states, to insert religion into public schools. The vote in Texas came after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively ended a publicly funded Catholic charter school in Oklahoma on Thursday with a 4-4 tie following a string of high court decisions in recent years that have allowed public funds to flow to religious entities. 

Texas lawmakers also have passed and sent to Abbott a measure that allows school districts to provide students and staff a daily voluntary period of prayer or time to read a religious text during school hours. Abbott is expected to sign it.




“We should be encouraging our students to read and study their Bible every day,” Republican state Rep. Brent Money said. “Our kids in our public schools need prayer, need Bible reading, more now than they ever have.”

Supporters of requiring the Ten Commandments in classrooms say they are part of the foundation of the United States' judicial and educational systems and should be displayed.

But critics, including some Christian and other faith leaders, say the Ten Commandments and prayer measures would infringe on the religious freedom of others.

The Ten Commandments bill requires public schools to post in classrooms a 16-by-20-inch (41-by-51-centimeter) poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, even though translations and interpretations vary across denominations, faiths and languages and may differ in homes and houses of worship. 

Democratic lawmakers made several failed attempts Saturday to amend the bill to require schools display other religious texts or provide multiple translations of the commandments.

A letter signed this year by dozens of Christian and Jewish faith leaders opposing the bill noted that Texas has thousands of students of other faiths who might have no connection to the Ten Commandments. Texas has nearly 6 million students in about 9,100 public schools.

In 2005, Abbott, who was state attorney general at the time, successfully argued before the Supreme Court that Texas could keep a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of its Capitol.

Even as more Americans tap, swipe or scan to pay, most still carry at least a little cash — and financial planners say that's a good idea.

Americans keep $67 in their wallet, on average, according to a recent Federal Reserve survey on how people use their money. While cash remains widely carried, usage has been slipping: in 2024, 83% of consumers said they used it at least once in the past 30 days — down from 87% in 2023, according to the Federal Reserve. 

Still, financial planners tell CNBC Make It that it's worth keeping some on hand — particularly for situations when digital payments fall short. Whether it's a power outage, a dead phone, a vendor with a card minimum or just the need to get home, cash can bridge the gap.

The amount of cash you should have on hand depends on your routine, says Christopher Rand, a certified financial planner in San Diego. He recommends keeping enough to handle a typical expense if something goes wrong — whether that's gas, food, parking or a tip — but not so much that you'd lose sleep if it went missing. "Generally, $50 to $100," he says.

Melissa Caro, a CFP in New York, carries a similar amount — usually $60 to $80, depending on her plans. "If I know I'll need it — say for tipping, parking, or certain small businesses — I'll add a bit more to my wallet," she says. "A good gut check is: If I lost my phone and needed a cab home, would I be covered? That's my 'panic point.'"

Other planners emphasize the value of cash when tech fails altogether. Leslie Beck, a CFP in New Jersey, recommends keeping at least $50 in your wallet for outages and emergencies. "When Hurricane Sandy hit the NYC area, ATMs were out, internet was down in many areas, and cash was king," she says.

Some people only start carrying cash after a mishap. Brett Anderson, a CFP in Minnesota, says he used to carry less than $5 — until his credit card was declined due to suspected fraud.

"It's truly inconvenient and embarrassing, depending on who you're with," he says. As a "financial advisor, your real friends will never let you forget if your credit card gets declined, and they take financial advice from you, I'm just saying." He now keeps a couple hundred dollars on hand as a backup.

You probably don't need a lot of cash, and certainly shouldn't carry more than you'd be upset to lose or have stolen.

"Having large amounts of cash in your wallet makes you more susceptible to losing the funds." says Tipiwa Walker, a CFP based in California. Unlike cards, "cash simply does not have the protections that credit cards do."

But having about $50 can be a smart backup for tips, low-dollar purchases or tech hiccups — even if you rarely use it, financial pros say.

Carrying cash isn't about "replacing digital tools, but having just enough cash to handle those moments when tech fails or feels like overkill," says Caro.Want to boost your confidence, income and career success?

Warren Buffett is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of this year — but he may not actually stop working.

Instead of sitting at home, the 94-year-old plans to spend his post-CEO days regularly going into Berkshire Hathaway's Omaha, Nebraska, headquarters to keep contributing his investment ideas and decision-making skills, he told the Wall Street Journal on May 14.

"I'm not going to sit at home and watch soap operas," said Buffett. "My interests are still the same."'

Before Berkshire Hathaway's most recent annual shareholders' meeting, on May 3, Buffett hadn't publicly announced plans to retire. Internally, he'd decided to "remain CEO as long as I thought I was more useful than anybody else ... And it surprised me, you know, how long it went," he said.

In May 2021, Buffett named his eventual successor as Greg Abel, the company's vice-chairman of non-insurance operations. Recently, he compared his energy levels to Abel's, and decided that his successor had surpassed him in terms of ability to be the company's CEO, he told the Journal.

"The difference in energy level and just how much [Abel] could accomplish in a 10-hour day compared to what I could accomplish in a 10-hour day—the difference became more and more dramatic," said Buffett. "He just was so much more effective at getting things done, making changes in management where they were needed, helping people that needed help someplace, but just all kinds of ways."

But even as Buffett occasionally loses his balance or has trouble recalling a person's name, as the Journal reported, his ability to make smart decisions in turbulent markets hasn't faltered, he said.

"I will be useful here if there's a panic in the market because I don't get fearful when things go down in price or everybody else gets scared," said Buffett. "And that really isn't a function of age."

Buffett's quasi-retirement isn't unprecedented. A small but quickly growing number Americans are choosing to work past the age of 75, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Continuing to work seems like an especially prevalent mindset among business leaders, from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal. "My friend Warren Buffett still comes into the office six days a week," Gates, 69, told CNBC Make It in September 2024. "So, I hope my health allows me to be like Warren."

Sinegal, 89, stepped down from his own CEO role in 2012 — and still goes into the office some Tuesdays, The Wall Street Journal reported on April 16. He always viewed running Costco as more of a hobby than a job, and wanted to continue that sense of enjoyment even after leaving the CEO role, he told the Journal.

Sinegal's sentiment echoes a notable piece of advice that Buffett wrote in his 2022 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: Job seekers should look for a role that "they would select, if they had no need for money." The mindset is good for your career, and helps you live a longer, happier life, Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's most recent shareholders' meeting.

"I think a happy person lives longer than somebody that's doing things they don't really admire that much in life," said Buffett.

Largely due to President Donald Trump's changing tariff policies, markets have been on a rollercoaster ride since April. Although the S&P 500 has largely rebounded from last month's lows, some families who have been diligently saving for future college costs may still see their 529 college savings plan balance hasn't fully recovered.

For those with tuition bills now coming due, there are a few key considerations before tapping those accounts.

"With a little planning, making withdrawals can be something to celebrate, not just something to fear," said Smitha Walling, Head of Vanguard's Education Savings Group.

Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business.

For parents worried about their 529 account's recent performance, Mary Morris, CEO of Commonwealth Savers, advises starting with a look at the asset allocation. "What you need to think about is assessing your risk appetite," she said.

Generally, 529 plans offer age-based portfolios, which start off with more equity exposure early on in a child's life and then become more conservative as college nears. By the time high school graduation is around the corner, families likely have very little invested in stocks and more in investments like bonds and cash. That can help blunt their losses but also mute gains.

Pay attention to your fund's approach toward shifting from stocks to bonds, Morris said.

"If you are in a total stock portfolio, you may not want that ride," she said: "You don't want to get seasick."

If the market volatility is still too much to bear, consider adjusting your allocation.

"One strategy is to start de-risking a portion of their portfolio and reallocate a portion into cash equivalent, which will provide a protection of principle while also proving a competitive return and peace of mind," said Richard Polimeni, head of education savings at ‎Merrill Lynch.

Still, financial experts strongly caution against shifting your entire 529 balance to cash. "The worst thing an investor can do in a down market is panic and sell investments prematurely and lock in losses," Polimeni said.

Often that is the last resort. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, only 10% of investors liquidated their entire 529 accounts, and 20% switched to less risky assets, according to an earlier survey by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

For those who must make a hefty withdrawal for tuition payments now due, "consider whether it's better to use the funds now or let the funds continue to grow and those returns compound," said Vanguard's Walling.

Polimeni suggests using income or savings outside the 529 to cover immediate college expenses, and requesting a reimbursement later to give the account a chance to recover from the recent market rout.

You can get reimbursed from your 529 plan for any eligible out-of-pocket expenses within the same calendar year. "Using that strategy gives another six to seven months for the market to recover," Polimeni said.

Another option is to tap a federal student loan and take a qualified distribution from the 529 plan to pay off the debt down the road. However, if you're thinking of taking out private student loans or a personal loan that starts incurring significant interest immediately, you may want to spend 529 funds first in that case, and defer that borrowing until later.

Once you have a withdrawal plan, you can — and should — keep contributing to your 529, experts say. Not only can you get a tax deduction or credit for contributions, but earnings will grow on a tax-advantaged basis, whether over 18 years or just a few.

"The major advantage is the tax-deferred growth, so the longer you are invested, the more tax-deferred growth you will have," Polimeni said.

"Markets go up and down, but students' goals remain the same," said Chris McGee, chair of the College Savings Foundation.

Even as concerns over college costs are driving more would-be college students to rethink their plans, college savings accounts are still as vital as ever.

Roughly 42% of students are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are opting to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or in-state public school, according to a recent survey of 1,000 high schoolers by the College Savings Foundation. That's up from 37% last year. 

As a result of those shifting education choices, 69% of students are expecting to live at home during their studies, the highest percentage in three years. 

Despite those adjustments, some recent changes have helped make 529 plans even more worthwhile: As of 2024, families can roll over unused 529 funds to the account beneficiary's Roth individual retirement account, without triggering income taxes or penalties, so long as they meet certain requirements.

Restrictions have also loosened to allow 529 plan funds to be used for continuing education classes, apprenticeship programs and student loan payments. For grandparents, there is also a new "loophole," which allows them to fund a grandchild's college without impacting that student's financial aid eligibility.

In part because of the new changes, more parents are utilizing a 529 college savings plan. 

In 2024, the number of 529 plan accounts increased to 17 million, up more than 3% percent from the year before, according to Investment Company Institute.

Total investments in 529s rose to $525 billion as of December, up 11% from a year earlier, while the average 529 plan account balance hit a record of $30,961, data from the College Savings Plans Network, a network of state-administered college savings programs, also showed.

"The industry is coming off its best year ever in terms of new inflows," said Polimeni.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Sunday said Tokyo aims to advance tariff talks with the United States, with the goal of achieving an outcome during the Group of Seven summit next month.

Japan's top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa held a third round of Japan-U.S. talks in Washington on Friday.

Speaking to reporters in Kyoto, Ishiba said there has been progress in negotiations, pointing to discussions on trade expansion, non-tariff measures and economic security.

"We will continue to further refine our discussions with the G-7 summit in mind," he said.

Ishiba on Friday held a 45-minute phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss security, diplomacy, and tariffs, and said they exchanged hope for an in-person meeting at the G-7 summit.

On Sunday, Ishiba expressed Japan's willingness to cooperate in shipbuilding. He said the U.S. has shown interest in the possibility of repairing U.S. warships in Japan and that Japan would like to assist.

He said Japan has an advantage in icebreakers, such as those used on Arctic trade routes, which could become an area of cooperation with the U.S.

In Tokyo, Akazawa on Sunday said the schedule for the next Japan-U.S. talks is being arranged and that he hopes to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his next visit to the U.S.

Speaking to reporters at Haneda Airport following his return from Washington, Akazawa said an agreement will be reached only when all elements are settled as a package, meaning that until everything is agreed upon, nothing is agreed upon.

"Therefore, I won't comment on how far we've progressed," he said.

A massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other regions in the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens, officials said early Sunday.

The scale of the onslaught was stunning — Russia hit Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles, making this the largest single aerial attack of the more than three-years-long war, according to Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force.

In all, Russia used 69 missiles of various types and 298 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed drones, he told The Associated Press.

It was "the most massive strike in terms of the number of air attack weapons on the territory of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022," Ihnat said.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow.

For Kyiv, the day was particularly somber as the city observes Kyiv Day, a national holiday that falls on the last Sunday of May commemorating its founding in the 5th century,

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian missiles and drones hit more than 30 cities and villages across Ukraine and urged Western partners to ramp up sanctions on Russia.

That has been a long-standing demand of the Ukrainian leader but one that — despite warnings to Moscow by the United States and Europe — have not materialized in ways to deter Russia.

Zelenskyy wrote on X that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions.

"These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities. Ordinary residential buildings were destroyed and damaged," he said.

"Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will certainly help," Zelenskyy said. "Determination matters now — the determination of the United States, of European countries, and of all those around the world who seek peace."

The attack came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month that have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. The exchange amounted to a rare moment of cooperation between the warring sides.

Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Sounds of explosions boomed throughout the night in Kyiv and the surrounding area as Ukrainian air defense forces persisted for hours in efforts to shoot down enemy drones and missiles. At least four people were killed and 16 were injured in the capital itself, according to Ukraine's security service.

"A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night. The most massive Russian air attack in many weeks lasted all night," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X.

Fires broke out in homes and businesses, set off by falling drone debris.

In the region of Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, three children were killed, aged 8, 12 and 17, according to the emergency service. Twelve were injured in the attacks, the service said. At least four people were killed in the Khmelnytskyi region, in western Ukraine. One man was killed in Mykolaiv region, in southern Ukraine.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district was hit by a drone and one of the building's walls was on fire. In Dniprovskyi district, a private house was destroyed and in Shevchenkivskyi district, windows in a residential building were smashed.

The scale of Russia's use of aerial weapons aside, the attacks over the past 48 hours have been among the most intense strikes on Ukraine since the February 2022 full-scale war. The last in a three-day prisoner swap was expected to take place later on Sunday.

In the village of Markhalivka, just outside Kyiv, where several homes were burned down in the overnight strikes, the Fedorenkos watched their ruined home in tears.

"The street looks like Bakhmut, like Mariupol, it's just terrible," says 76-year-old Liubov Fedorenko, comparing their village to some of Ukraine's most devastated cities in the war. She told the AP how grateful she was her daughter had not joined them for the weekend with her family.

"I was trying to persuade my daughter to come to us," Fedorenko said, adding she told her daughter, "After all, you live on the eighth floor in Kyiv, and here it's the ground floor.'"

"She said, 'No, mum, I'm not coming.' And thank God she didn't come, because the rocket hit (the house) on the side where the children's rooms were," Fedorenko said.

Ivan Fedorenko, 80, said he regrets letting their two dogs into the house after the air raid siren went off. "They burned to death," he said. "I want to bury them, but I'm not allowed yet."

Zelenskyy and Russia's defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers the previous day, on Saturday, a day after each side released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Once completed, the swap will amount to the largest exchange of prisoners in more than three years of war.

"We expect more to come tomorrow," Zelenskyy said on his official Telegram channel on Saturday. Russia's defense ministry also said it expected the exchange to be continued, though it did not give details.

The previous night, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard throughout Kyiv as many sought shelter in subway stations as Russian drones and missiles targeted the Ukrainian capital.

The ongoing POW exchange, the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians so far did not bring a halt in the fighting.

Battles have continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.

Marc Faber, a longtime investor who says his nickname is "Dr. Doom" (not to be confused with this Dr. Doom), has been buying gold for decades and telling other people to stock up for just as long.

The gold bug regularly appears on videos extolling the metal's virtues while sounding alarms about economic collapse. He's eyeing a litany of crises coming our way: a debt crisis, a plunge in asset prices, and soaring inflation round out his list of concerns.

"My sense is that a debt crisis is inevitable," he said, adding that he buys gold regularly, with the metal comprising 25% of his overall portfolio.

Faber's clients also hold a significant portion of their wealth in gold, but the scramble to own more of the metal that's helped drive prices higher this year is spreading to more everyday investors.

Blame the bad energy in the economy in 2025, with "soft data" like consumer sentiment and inflation expectations souring even as the economy continues to hold up.

Some of what these buyers are worried about—which, among Faber's clients range from hyperinflation to the start of World War III—are unlikely. But forecasters don't expect the heightened demand from nervous buyers to end anytime soon.

Gold bugs having been popping up in the US and abroad. Global demand for gold bars climbed to 257 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025, up 13% in a year, according to the World Gold Council.

Joe Cavatoni, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, said he believes concerns about the US dollar, economic weakness in the US, and the government's debt and deficit are several reasons gold demand is rising.

This year, Google search interest for "gold bars" has spiked on market-moving events, like the announcement of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and Moody's downgrading the US debt.

Genesis Gold Group, a gold dealer that commonly works with clients it describes as "homesteaders" or "preppers," says it's seen intense interest in gold in the last few quarters. Demand for gold has been so hot, the company rolled out a prepper bar, a gold bar that can be broken off into pieces, making it easier to trade in the event of a crisis.

Jonathan Rose, the CEO of Genesis, says demand for prepper bars briefly surged after the presidential election and then jumped 20% in the first quarter of 2025, around the time President Donald Trump began to iron out his tariff policy.

More clients who have invested in gold have also been requesting that the gold be sent to them, Rose said, estimating that the number of the firm's clients who insist on holding physical gold has risen to 70%, up from 20% in past years.

Most of Genesis's clients are off-the-grid types who desire to be self-sufficient in the event of a collapse, Rose said. But not all of them are as extreme. More everyday people have come to him over the years, with fears about the dollar, inflation, and volatility in risk assets like stocks.

"They have a preparedness plan, you then find out — you kind of peel the layers back — that these people also have dry food, they have water supplies, and it doesn't mean that they're tinfoil hat people and they're living off the grid and they're listening to shortwave radio. These are just general people looking for a hedge," he said of their interest in gold.

On the subreddit r/preppers, where membership has soared 354% since 2020, according to historical subreddit data, questions about stocks up on gold regularly flow in from users.

"It helps when a currency collapses. Cash is always king, until it collapses, then that's where gold and silver step in," one user wrote.

It's been a good time to own gold. The price of bullion has climbed 25% in 2025, handily beating the S&P 500, which is down by about 1% year-to-date.

Analysts say that some of the worries driving gold demand could be overstated.

While the risk of a US recession is elevated, Wall Street forecasters don't expect the economy to enter a serious downturn. Goldman Sachs recently lowered its recession outlook from 45% to 35%, while Barclays recently removed its forecast for a mild recession.

Trump's tax bill has also stoked more concern about the US debt and budget deficit in the last week. But those worries will likely ease, especially if policymakers amend the bill to appease investors in the bond market, Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, told BI this week.

"There's definitely a feel that there may be a little bit excessive influx," Michael Boutros, a senior technical strategist at StoneX, told BI. "There's a lot of fearmongering going on in the markets right now."

Still, Boutrous thinks the demand for gold will remain strong as long as people feel uncertain about the economy. Even when trade agreements get hammered out, he believes investors will still be jittery as they wait to see the impact of tariffs on the economy.

"The rockier things get, the more this is going to find footing," he said of gold's price momentum. "It's just really hard to justify a strong bearish, a bear sentiment on this."

"We see the price support and the upward trajectory very well positioned for 2025," the World Gold Council's Cavatoni added.

A year into the job, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has scored some key wins, including recently signing major trade deals with the U.S., India and European Union that will boost the British economy and wages.

Opinion polls paint a different picture of his success.

A survey by pollster YouGov, published in mid-May, showed that the British public's approval the prime minister has plummeted to a record low, with 69% of voters now having an unfavorable view of Starmer, while just 23% regard him enthusiastically.

More worryingly for the Labour Party leader, the fall in popularity is concentrated among Labour voters, half of whom (50%) now have an unfavorable view of Starmer — a 17-point increase from the last poll in mid-April. The share of Labour voters with a favorable opinion of him has meanwhile fallen from 62% to 45% over the month.

With things seeming to point in the right direction for the British economy, what's going wrong for its prime minister?

The U.K.'s leadership might be touting their impressive record on trade deals recently, but cost-of-living pressures continue to worry ordinary British voters, and businesses are reckoning with Labour-led tax rises.

The U.K.'s annual inflation rate hit a hotter-than-expected 3.5% in April, up sharply from 2.6% in March, according to data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday.

The data highlighted increasing pressures on British households, as prices of electricity, gas and other fuels rose by 6.7% in the year to April. The prices of water and sewerage meanwhile added 26.1% in the month to April, marking the largest monthly hike since at least February 1988, the ONS said.

British businesses now face a higher tax burden as a result of government policies introduced in the "Autumn Budget," as well as other measures deemed be many economists to be "anti-growth." These include limits on immigration set to affect foreign workers — who are key to a number of sectors — a rise in the national minimum wage and reforms to workers' rights, which put pressure on many small and medium-sized firms.

As such, lofty trade deals promising economic growth and investment that will take time to feed through are cold comfort for many British consumers and businesses struggling right now.

"On domestic policy, this government hasn't scored well so far; let's give it a C-minus," Kallum Pickering, chief U.K. economist at Peel Hunt, told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Wednesday. "[We've seen] mostly anti- growth measures and that's the thing that disrupted bond markets over the past few months."

On foreign and international policy, the government is "doing a fairly good job," with its latest trade deals a testament to that, Pickering said.

"Starmer has contained the downside risk that the U.K. and the U.S. could really escalate on trade. It's not a good deal, but it contains downside risk. The U.K.-India deal is actually a strong signal that the U.K. is open for business. And if you read the press, people that are unhappy with the deal that the U.K. and the EU is striking but, actually, what's the alternative?" he asked.

Big business leaders say they're happy with the British government's general direction of travel, with C.S. Venkatakrishnan, group chief executive of Barclays, telling CNBC Thursday that it was "absolutely on track."

"If you look at if you look at what they've achieved over the last few weeks, they've had trade deals with the U.S., with India, with Europe, important trading partners. They continue to be repairing relationships with Europe, which they need to," he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick.

Inflationary pressures, he noted, were evident but were not yet leading to "consumer distress," the Barclays exec believed.

"We're in fact seeing conduit continued consumer strength, but it's coming because of people managing their balances and their finances prudently. So [they're] economizing. The job market is still strong. But as you see ... people are worried about inflation. People are worried about cost, whether it's winter fuel bills or whether it's more generalized inflation from tariffs, and the only real answer to that is growth, which is what this government is focused on, and what we want to help them."

Although some quarters welcome Keir Starmer's calmer and less bombastic approach to leadership than politicians like Reform UK leader Nigel Farage or former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he continues to face criticism that his leadership style and personality hold him and the Labour Party back.

CNBC has contacted the Labour Party for comment on Starmer's poll ratings and is awaiting a reply.

"Starmer has great positives — [signing] the trade deals" for one, Bill Blain, strategist and founder of Wind Shift Capital, said that the prime minister's lack of charisma is a deficit.

"But he is dull, boring and precise. He is competent, but he is not a personality and lacks political charisma ... Farage has it in spades. So did Boris Johnson," he told CNBC Tuesday.

"A additional problem is Starmer lacks able cabinet colleagues able to create the illusion of a cabinet of smart, leaders. Some are settling into their roles but most look out their depth. This is particularly true of Rachel Reeves ... who is naturally not a risk taker," Blain added.

"The bigger issue is the narrative — Labour present it as doing the right thing to control spending, but it's backfired as insensitivity to their voters. They are perceived as cruel," he said.

Starmer is coming "under pressure," Blain noted, increasing the risk that rank and file Labour lawmakers "will revolt if the polls bite."

"That may be happening — [meaning] mutiny!," he said.

 Bitcoin's price rally takes a breather over the weekend, but a bullish weekly close could translate to gains from HYPE, XMR, AAVE and WLD. 

Key points:

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 

Bitcoin's demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

While the long-term picture looks promising, traders need to be careful in the near term. The failure to swiftly push the price back above $109,588 could attract profit-booking by short-term traders. If Bitcoin pulls back, several altcoins could also give up some of their recent gains.

Could Bitcoin rise back above $109,588, pulling altcoins higher? If it does, let's look at the cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts.

Bitcoin dropped back below the breakout level of $109,588 on May 23, and the bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price back above the overhead resistance on May 24.

The bulls will again attempt to drive the price above the $109,588 to $111,980 overhead resistance zone. If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the target objective of $130,000.

The 20-day exponential moving average ($104,199) is the critical level to watch out for in the near term. If the support cracks, the pair could plummet to $100,000 and later to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,916).

The bears have pulled the price below the 50-SMA. The 20-EMA has started to turn down, and the relative strength index has dipped into negative territory, signaling that the bears have the upper hand. If the price sustains below the 50-SMA, the pair could descend to $102,500 and later to $100,000.

Buyers will regain control if they push and maintain the price above the $109,588 resistance. The pair could then challenge the $111,980 level. A break above $111,980 could open the doors for a rally to $116,654.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) has broken above the $35.73 resistance, indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure.

If the price sustains above $35.73, the HYPE/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to $42.25. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $42.25, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket to $50.

Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below the breakout level of $35.73. If they do that, the pair could drop to the $32.15 support, where buyers are expected to step in. 

The pair bounced off the 20-EMA and cleared the overhead barrier at $35.73. If the price remains above $35.73, it suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The pair could then attempt a rally to $42.25.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the 20-EMA. That could trap several aggressive bulls, pulling the pair to $32 and subsequently to $28.50.

Monero (XMR) soared above the $391 resistance on May 21, indicating that the bulls remain in control.

The sharp rally of the past few days has kept the RSI in the overbought zone, suggesting that the bulls remain in command. If buyers maintain the price above $412, the XMR/USDT pair could resume its uptrend toward $456.

Sellers will have to yank the price below the $375 level to weaken the bullish momentum. That could attract selling by short-term buyers, pulling the pair to the 20-day EMA ($347). A break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests a short-term trend change.

The pair is finding support at the 20-EMA, indicating that the bulls remain in control. If the price rises above $412, the uptrend could start the next leg of the uptrend to $456.

Alternatively, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could tug the price to the 50-SMA, which is likely to witness buying by the bulls. A bounce off the 50-SMA could face selling at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break below the 50-SMA increases. The pair could then tumble to $332.

Aave (AAVE) successfully held the retest of the breakout level of $240 on May 23, indicating demand at lower levels.

The rising 20-day EMA ($231) and the RSI in the overbought zone show that the bulls have the edge. The AAVE/USDT pair could rally to the $285 level, which is expected to behave as a strong resistance. If buyers overcome the barrier at $285, the up move could extend to $300 and later to $350.

Any pullback is expected to witness solid buying at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to pierce the overhead resistance. The bears will be back in the game on a break below the 20-day EMA. 

The pair has pulled back to the 20-EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $285. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $300.

Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, the pair could slide to the 50-SMA and later to $240. A bounce off $240 is expected to face selling at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-EMA, it increases the risk of a drop to $217.

Worldcoin's (WLD) recovery is facing selling at $1.65, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1.20).

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. If the price turns up from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to shove the price above the $1.65 resistance. If they can pull it off, the WLD/USDT pair could rally to $2.50. There is resistance at $1.89, but it is likely to be crossed.

This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.99).

The bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA, indicating the start of a deeper correction toward the 50-SMA. The bulls will try to start a rebound off the 50-SMA but are likely to meet stiff resistance at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-EMA and breaks below the 50-SMA, the pair could plunge to $1.09.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the downtrend line. The pair could then rise to $1.52 and subsequently to $1.65.

The recent bullish optimism across the crypto space this May has been highlighted by Bitcoin reclaiming pole position and surging past its $109,000 all-time high from earlier in the year. While the market continues to see dominance by AI altcoins, bots, and revived ETF optimism for many top altcoins, savvy investors are looking for the next 100x crypto ICO to invest in for massive gains.

The lucky ones who bought Bitcoin at a discounted price following its last pullback in April are once again searching the market for the next 100x prospect. This time, they are focused on the best ICO prospects and believe Mantix, powered by the Ethereum blockchain, is one to consider. As its $600,000 token presale takes flight in its first stage where it's currently selling at $0.02, experts tip this project's ICO as a potential 100x ERC20 crypto. But that it is still under the radar makes now the best part to accumulate the coin before it booms!

After over $300 million in leveraged crypto positions got liquidated in four hours following a sudden Bitcoin plunge, no thanks to new tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, the momentum is changing rapidly.

At press time, BTC has a market cap of $2.15 trillion and a price of $107,510. According to the charts, Bitcoin's price has risen by 4.48% this week after $3.06 billion went into the U.S. Spot ETFs and news of Morgan Stanley starting direct crypto trading emerged.

Crypto analysts believe that Bitcoin's growth to $176,000 by October 2025 might be possible if support holds strong at $100,000. However, should the price drop below $97,000, the pressure from a short-selling frenzy might grow, pushing Bitcoin further below toward $90,000.

Mantix is fast gaining widespread momentum and enjoying attention across the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and the digital economy. Its new high-flying crypto ICO is setting the tone for a project threatening to dominate the DEX market. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Mantix allows users to utilize its native $MTX crypto to trade, stake and participate in perpetual trading with up to 1000x leverage.

A major feature that differentiates Mantix is how it prioritizes real-world utility and user-centered value over hype. With incredibly low transaction fees, deep liquidity and capacity for cross-chain trading, this project is effortlessly accessible to a vast range of crypto users.

Such positioning explains why the Defi project is where analysts believe the next big crypto bag is coming for investors who prioritize growth. They tipped MTX to be the next 100x crypto ICO to invest in for its imminent astronomical rise.

Phase 1 of the Mantix presale has recorded over $600,000 in total presale funding, with $MTX tokens currently selling for a low cost of $0.02. As an early-stage investment opportunity, Mantix is drawing in experienced Bitcoin investors, retail traders, and institutional investors seeking massive returns. Mantix tokenomics also provides a revenue-sharing model where holders enjoy passive income without having to provide liquidity directly. That's a share in the future of a value-driven project set for incredible growth.

Global economic tensions and trade disputes continue to influence cryptocurrency markets, with ETH showing resilience despite broader market uncertainty.

The second-largest cryptocurrency is currently navigating a critical technical zone between $2,500-$2,530, which analysts identify as immediate resistance that must be overcome for continued upward movement. 

Institutional interest remains strong, with spot Ethereum ETFs recording consecutive days of positive inflows, signaling growing confidence from larger investors despite the recent volatility.

Global economic tensions are weighing heavily on cryptocurrency markets as XRP experiences a significant correction amid heavy selling pressure. 

The recent announcement of potential 50% tariffs on European Union imports by the US government has triggered widespread market uncertainty, with XRP falling alongside most major cryptocurrencies despite Bitcoin recently reaching new all-time highs. 

Technical analysts point to critical support at the $2.25-$2.26 range, with market watchers warning that a break below this level could trigger deeper corrections toward the $1.55-$1.90 zone. 

Meanwhile, institutional interest remains strong with Volatility Shares launching an XRP futures ETF and leveraged ETF inflows surging despite the price dip, suggesting Wall Street continues accumulating positions during market weakness.

Bitcoin's recent pullback has established strong volume-based resistance near $108,300, with support forming in the $106,700-$107,000 zone.

The correction accelerated with a notable price surge from $107,373 to $107,671 between 13:06-13:36, followed by a sharp reversal.

Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin is now trading within a compression zone, trapped between two major fair value gaps that will determine the upcoming market direction. 

If bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, price could push toward resistance beyond $112K, while a break below $107,000 might test liquidity around $106K.

A cryptocurrency investor from Kentucky allegedly held and tortured an Italian businessman in a luxury flat in Manhattan for over two weeks in a bid to steal his digital currency passwords, according to reports.

The businessman, 28, managed to escape the apartment on Prince Street in SoHo on Friday morning and ran to a police officer for help. He told police he had been held captive and tortured, quoting unnamed sources.

John Woeltz, 37, was arrested shortly afterwards. He is facing charges including kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and weapon possession.

Photos found at the scene reportedly showed the victim tied up with electrical wires. In one image, he appeared to be bound to a chair with a gun pointed at him, New York Post sources said.

The alleged abuse included being tasered while his feet were in water, pistol-whipped, forced to take cocaine, and threatened with an electric chainsaw. The Post said the man had a cut on his arm believed to have been caused by the chainsaw.

The flat was being rented for $30,000 to $40,000 a month, according to the report.

The police sources as saying the businessman had flown in from Italy on 6 May to meet Woeltz, with whom he had previous business dealings. Once inside the flat, Woeltz allegedly took his passport and tied him up.

Police found Polaroid pictures of the alleged torture and various items including broken glass, night vision goggles, a gun, a bulletproof vest and an Apple AirTag — which the victim said had been placed around his neck to track him in case he tried to escape.

The man told police he believed he was going to be killed on Friday, so he made his escape that morning.

Beatrice Folchi, 24, of Manhattan, was also arrested and charged with kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment.

Two other people linked to Woeltz were also being questioned by police, the Post said.

A photographer working nearby, Ciaran Tully, told the New York Post he saw a man in a robe being taken away in handcuffs. “This is definitely the strangest thing I've seen in my time here,” he said.

A local jewellery seller told the Post that the people renting the flat gave off a “weird vibe.” He said, “I knew there was something strange going on. I just assumed they were filming something.”

The NYPD's Emergency Service Unit searched the apartment for other possible victims but found none, according to the report.

What happens when retail logs off from crypto and Wall Street tunes in? Looking at bitcoin's BTC$107,289.09 recent all-time-high, one would say it feels bullish and the industry is maturing. 

That might as well be the case, but we might not be there yet. So before we floor our Lambos, let's look under the hood. 

First things first, retail investors have basically ghosted this rally. A quick search on Google Trends using the keyword "bitcoin" shows that the surge that was seen back in 2021's bull market is non-existent. Back then, everyone and their grandmothers were Googling bitcoin, aping into altcoins and flooding the social media with rocket emojis. In 2025? It's a ghost town in retail-land. 

There was a blip of high retail interest surrounding the U.S. presidential election, when a short-lived memecoin mania took over retail sentiment. However, that surge is long gone, as memecoin prices tanked swiftly, even as bitcoin hit an all-time high this week, ripping past $111,000. 

"Early in this cycle, memecoins became a concentration of risky retail-driven trading with related trading peaking in January," said Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial. "However, since then, there has been a virtual wash-out of interest and memecoin trading activity," which shows "the tepid risk appetite in crypto at the moment," FRNT added. 

Translation: "Wen Lambo" crowd got burned, and they aren't rushing back into the race track en masse anytime soon. 

On the topic of risk appetite, let's go back to the car analogy. 

During the 2021 bull market, people bought unreliable performance cars, stripped out the brakes and seatbelts to go faster than ever before, and did not care that there might be engine blowouts. As long as there was a promise of reaching the moon, bullish vibes were all that mattered. 

Now? After losing tremendous amounts of money on those unsustainable go-fast cars for years, traders are driving Toyota Corollas—sensible sedans that are slow but steady and still on the road.

That risk-off sentiment is also evident from the funding rates, according to FRNT's analysis of BTC perp rates—a measure of how much traders are willing to pay to maintain their long positions. When bitcoin reached a record high of around $42,000 in January 2021, the perp rate was about blistering 185%. Today, at bitcoin near $110,000, the rate is near 20% on crypto options exchange Deribit, meaning the risk appetite isn't completely gone but nowhere near the 2021 frenzy. 

A third point to add is the high number of short positions in the market. 

As CoinDesk's Oliver Knight reported this week, the bitcoin long/short ratio is at its lowest point since the crypto winter in September 2022. This implies that the majority of the traders aren't completely buying into this recent positive momentum and betting on bitcoin moving lower as a hedge for the new bullish rally. 

The impact of such positioning was clear on Friday, when bitcoin swiftly crashed from near $111,000 to $108,000 in a matter of minutes and then bounced right back up to $109,000. The anxiety of a swift volatility is real. 

So in a car-themed analogy, the drivers (in this case, investors) are still taking out their super-modified, unreliable sports cars for a weekend drive on the track. Still, they also have their Corollas following along. Just in case the engine blows on their go-fast cars. 

Given the current macro-risk, it's not entirely surprising that investors are on their toes and risk-averse. But this might just be exactly what your mechanic at the shop prescribed. In fact, this might be an indicator of a sustainable rally in the long term. 

"Periods of low leverage and risk appetite in crypto have often preceded further sustainable gains," according to FRNT. 

"BTC appears to be in such a phase, set against a backdrop of numerous bullish catalysts and narratives," the firm added. 

The bottom line is that the retail Lambos might have been towed away, but big money is stepping in with their everlasting Toyotas. This might start a slow but steady race to the moon, not just a reckless joyride.

Vivek Raman, co-founder of Etherealize and former Wall Street banker, is leading an unprecedented charm offensive. He now presents Ethereum as the “digital oil” destined to revolutionize traditional financial institutions.

Vivek Raman, former banker at Nomura and UBS, launched Etherealize in January 2025 with a clear mission.

This co-founder is leading a charm offensive with financial institutions to convince them to adopt Ethereum. “I still call it digital oil“, he confides.

We believe that with the evolution of the crypto ecosystem, people will want to hold this asset as a reserve.

This analogy is directly inspired by bitcoin, often called “digital gold.” It makes Ethereum accessible to Wall Street newcomers.

The idea is simple: just as oil fuels the global industry, ETH fuels the blockchain network. It serves as fuel for all transactions and smart contracts.

However, fundamental differences emerge. Unlike oil, whose supply remains elastic according to demand, Ethereum has a maximum issuance of 1.5% per year.

“Rather than a fixed total supply cap, there is a fixed annual issuance cap“, clarifies Danny Ryan, co-founder of Etherealize and former researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. This predictability reassures institutional investors used to assets with clear rules.

The most striking advantage of Ethereum lies in its ability to generate income. Unlike oil stored in reserves, ETH “staked” on the network currently yields 3% per year. This passive income naturally attracts institutions seeking regular returns.

The real revolution of Ethereum lies in the tokenization of traditional assets. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have already taken the step by tokenizing several of their funds on this blockchain. This institutional adoption is expected to accelerate under Donald Trump, known to be favorable to cryptocurrencies.

Admittedly, competitors like Solana are nibbling away market share. Kraken has even chosen this blockchain for some of its offerings. But Ethereum maintains a lead thanks to its maturity and proven security.

Raman goes further in his vision. “In this ecosystem where all global assets are tokenized, the only neutral and global asset that connects all these assets is ETH“, he asserts. This perspective turns Ethereum into the backbone of the digital financial system.

Concretely, ETH would serve as a universal exchange currency between different tokenized assets. Stocks, bonds, commodities: all these traditional assets could be traded via Ethereum. This interconnection would create a truly global digital economy.

The “digital oil” analogy finally makes complete sense. Just as oil revolutionized industry in the 20th century, Ethereum could well transform 21st-century finance. Experts anticipate that tokenization of stocks will surpass $1 trillion in the medium term. Wall Street is gradually discovering this infrastructure, which will likely become the backbone of tokenized finance.

The cryptocurrency market faces renewed pressure as Solana (SOL) dropped below its stable $177 trading range, reflecting broader concerns about global economic stability.

The correction coincides with increasing geopolitical tensions that have rattled financial markets worldwide, forcing investors to reassess risk exposure across digital assets. 

Despite the pullback, Solana's ecosystem continues to expand with R3's strategic pivot to integrate with its blockchain, signaling growing institutional interest in the platform's capabilities for tokenizing real-world assets.

 HYPE is echoing Solana's 2021 breakout pattern, with technicals pointing to a potential 240% rally by July. 

Key takeaways:

HYPE is mirroring Solana's 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana's (SOL) early 2021 breakout—one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 

The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line at around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

Fast forward to May 2025, HYPE's daily chart is showing the same bullish structure following its  270% rebound from $10 lows in April, aligning with its 0.0 Fibonacci retracement line.

On May 23, HYPE broke above its 1.0 Fibonacci retracement level (~$35.88), echoing the early stages of SOL's explosive run in 2021.

Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) for HYPE has entered deeply overbought territory (above 84), which, while suggesting caution in the short term, also underscores the strength of the current momentum, much like Solana's RSI profile during its 2021 breakout.

If HYPE continues to follow this fractal, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $51.68 appears to be the next logical target. Beyond that, the 4.618 level at around $128 could mark the peak of this potential rally, a 240% move from its recent breakout zone near $35.

Popular analyst and commentator Ansem highlights that Hyperliquid's vision is very similar to what Solana and FTX aimed to build during their early partnership: a high-performance, low-cost crypto trading experience.

He argues that, unlike FTX's centralized architecture, Hyperliquid is fully onchain.

Nearly 97% of all trading revenue goes directly back to HYPE tokenholders, Ansem noted, adding that such fundamentals will assist the Hyperliquid token to reach “all-time highs soon.”

Psychologically, traders are often drawn to familiar and previously successful patterns. 

In 2017, Ether (ETH) mirrored Bitcoin's (BTC) 2013 arc almost identically, from the parabolic blow-off top to the retracement and range-bound recovery phase.

When traders recognize that HYPE could be repeating Solana's 2021 trajectory visually and fundamentally, it may reinforce bullish conviction and draw in speculators hoping to catch the next “Solana” moment.

Editor's note: Este artículo está traducido al español.

The world's largest bitcoin conference will take place at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center this week, carrying new political significance due to prominent attendance from the Trump administration.

Vice President JD Vance, Trump's two eldest sons, and White House “crypto czar” David Sacks are all scheduled to appear.

At last year's conference in Nashville, Tenn., Trump championed bitcoin — a decentralized digital currency operating on blockchain technology — while criticizing what he considered regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. His remarks drew thunderous applause from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts.

Justin Doochin, head of events at the company that puts on the yearly conference, said Trump's policy on bitcoin has been “a lot more favorable” so far. Trump has reallocated seized bitcoin for a “strategic reserve,” installed friendly regulators and revoked Biden-era policy.

“That's what's getting everyone excited: him tweeting about it, him talking about it, him adding it to his campaign,” Doochin said. “Putting it on the forefront of U.S. policy is extremely bullish for the crypto community.”

Doochin said the event will have a strict policy on sticking to bitcoin, a technology that Elisa Cafferata, who's lobbied for blockchain legislation in Nevada, explained derives its value from its transparency and a cap on how many bitcoins can be created.

“Because it's harder and harder to create new ones, it's, by design, supposed to go up in value,” Cafferata said. “It was meant to hold value. It was meant to be a way to send money around the world without going through intermediaries like banks that charge you a transaction fee.”

With unprecedented government interest, the convention's industry day will feature programming exploring how bitcoin — alongside other emerging sectors like AI and space travel — intersects with public policy under the theme “Code and Country.”

Doochin noted that conference attendees have become far more politically engaged, a shift he traces back to 2023 when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, spoke at that year's convention.

Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency represents a dramatic reversal. In 2021, he dismissed bitcoin as a scam threatening the U.S. dollar.

Hilary Allen, a self-described “crypto critic” and professor of law at American University, said that “in the second administration, (Trump) realized that he could be the one profiting.”

Just days before his second inauguration, the Trump-connected firm World Liberty Financial launched a Trump “meme coin” — a purely speculative category of cryptocurrency that typically has no utility.

And while it wasn't announced until April, this one came with a catch: the top 220 owners get a private dinner with the president. Those who attended the dinner Thursday night spent around $148 million on the coins, according to USA Today.

“When you create most types of crypto, you are creating a digital asset out of thin air,” Allen said. “Any money you receive from them you can pocket. So it really is a way for people to give money for nothing to the Trump family should they so desire.”

Asked Thursday if the White House would release a list of those attending the dinner, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it wasn't a White House event and that Trump is attending on “his personal time.”

“The president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable,” she said later. “It's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency. This president was incredibly successful before giving it all up to serve our country.”

Las Vegas resident Ben Horowitz — half of the partnership behind venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the largest crypto investors in the world — said on a podcast last July with his business partner that “the future of technology” was at stake with the election.

Horowitz's partner, Marc Andreessen, said Trump's platform was a “blanket endorsement” of their industry: ending the “unlawful and un-American crypto crackdown,” defending the “right to mine bitcoin” and opposing a digital currency coming from the Federal Reserve.

The pair donated a combined $67 million to the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC, according to OpenSecrets, though the committee supported both Democratic and Republican candidates last year.

Just under half of all corporate spending in the 2024 election came from the crypto industry, left-leaning consumer rights group Public Citizen found.

Trump has followed through on that agenda Andreessen praised. At the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it's been “night and day” since Trump took office, Allen said

Now, the commission has a crypto task force designed to provide regulatory clarity, something the crypto industry maligned the Biden administration for lacking. But along with that, other regulators backed off their ongoing work.

“There were other things they lost on, but the fundamental issue of whether crypto assets were securities, the SEC just kept on winning” in court before Trump retook office, Allen said. “You get a leadership change at the SEC … and these lawsuits were just dropped, dropped, dropped.”

One of those companies that had its case dropped is Coinbase, a crypto exchange platform in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio which added former Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita to its advisory board in January. Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., also joined.

They're just two examples of what Allen described as a “revolving door” between government and industry lobbying. She also pointed to Summer Mersinger, who recently announced her move from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to CEO of a major Washington crypto trade association.

Despite the ongoing entanglement between crypto and the GOP, not all Democrats are against the new technology.

The Senate this month advanced industry-backed legislation around “stablecoins,” a type of cryptocurrency pegged to another asset, such as gold, or currency. The GENIUS Act, which got the support of 16 Democrats to get past the 60-vote Senate threshold for cloture, would provide some regulatory framework for the coins and create reserve requirements for issuers.

Both of Nevada's Democratic senators voted in favor, with a spokesperson for Sen. Jacky Rosen telling the Sun that “cryptocurrency is an emerging industry that is in need of regulation.”

“Sen. Rosen voted to advance bipartisan legislation to open the door for regulating cryptocurrency. This bill is not the only action Congress should take on crypto regulation, but it is an important step to protect consumers and support America's innovation,” the spokesperson wrote.

Allen doesn't see things the same way. She believes that the legislation only legitimizes a portion of the industry that's been fraught with abuse. World Liberty Financial, too, has its own stablecoin, other Democrats have worried.

“Other than fear of running afoul of the crypto industry's money cannon, I find it hard to see why Democrats are supporting this legislation,” she said. “The legislation essentially blesses stable coins, creating ... a greater market for them.”

The world's largest bitcoin conference will take place at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center this week, carrying new political significance due to prominent attendance from the Trump administration.

Vice President JD Vance, Trump's two eldest sons, and White House “crypto czar” David Sacks are all scheduled to appear.

At last year's conference in Nashville, Tenn., Trump championed bitcoin — a decentralized digital currency operating on blockchain technology — while criticizing what he considered regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. His remarks drew thunderous applause from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts.

Justin Doochin, head of events at the company that puts on the yearly conference, said Trump's policy on bitcoin has been “a lot more favorable” so far. Trump has reallocated seized bitcoin for a “strategic reserve,” installed friendly regulators and revoked Biden-era policy.

“That's what's getting everyone excited: him tweeting about it, him talking about it, him adding it to his campaign,” Doochin said. “Putting it on the forefront of U.S. policy is extremely bullish for the crypto community.”

Doochin said the event will have a strict policy on sticking to bitcoin, a technology that Elisa Cafferata, who's lobbied for blockchain legislation in Nevada, explained derives its value from its transparency and a cap on how many bitcoins can be created.

“Because it's harder and harder to create new ones, it's, by design, supposed to go up in value,” Cafferata said. “It was meant to hold value. It was meant to be a way to send money around the world without going through intermediaries like banks that charge you a transaction fee.”

With unprecedented government interest, the convention's industry day will feature programming exploring how bitcoin — alongside other emerging sectors like AI and space travel — intersects with public policy under the theme “Code and Country.”

Doochin noted that conference attendees have become far more politically engaged, a shift he traces back to 2023 when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, spoke at that year's convention.

Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency represents a dramatic reversal. In 2021, he dismissed bitcoin as a scam threatening the U.S. dollar.

Hilary Allen, a self-described “crypto critic” and professor of law at American University, said that “in the second administration, (Trump) realized that he could be the one profiting.”

Just days before his second inauguration, the Trump-connected firm World Liberty Financial launched a Trump “meme coin” — a purely speculative category of cryptocurrency that typically has no utility.

And while it wasn't announced until April, this one came with a catch: the top 220 owners get a private dinner with the president. Those who attended the dinner Thursday night spent around $148 million on the coins, according to USA Today.

“When you create most types of crypto, you are creating a digital asset out of thin air,” Allen said. “Any money you receive from them you can pocket. So it really is a way for people to give money for nothing to the Trump family should they so desire.”

Asked Thursday if the White House would release a list of those attending the dinner, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it wasn't a White House event and that Trump is attending on “his personal time.”

“The president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable,” she said later. “It's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency. This president was incredibly successful before giving it all up to serve our country.”

Las Vegas resident Ben Horowitz — half of the partnership behind venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the largest crypto investors in the world — said on a podcast last July with his business partner that “the future of technology” was at stake with the election.

Horowitz's partner, Marc Andreessen, said Trump's platform was a “blanket endorsement” of their industry: ending the “unlawful and un-American crypto crackdown,” defending the “right to mine bitcoin” and opposing a digital currency coming from the Federal Reserve.

The pair donated a combined $67 million to the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC, according to OpenSecrets, though the committee supported both Democratic and Republican candidates last year.

Just under half of all corporate spending in the 2024 election came from the crypto industry, left-leaning consumer rights group Public Citizen found.

Trump has followed through on that agenda Andreessen praised. At the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it's been “night and day” since Trump took office, Allen said

Now, the commission has a crypto task force designed to provide regulatory clarity, something the crypto industry maligned the Biden administration for lacking. But along with that, other regulators backed off their ongoing work.

“There were other things they lost on, but the fundamental issue of whether crypto assets were securities, the SEC just kept on winning” in court before Trump retook office, Allen said. “You get a leadership change at the SEC … and these lawsuits were just dropped, dropped, dropped.”

One of those companies that had its case dropped is Coinbase, a crypto exchange platform in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio which added former Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita to its advisory board in January. Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., also joined.

They're just two examples of what Allen described as a “revolving door” between government and industry lobbying. She also pointed to Summer Mersinger, who recently announced her move from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to CEO of a major Washington crypto trade association.

Despite the ongoing entanglement between crypto and the GOP, not all Democrats are against the new technology.

The Senate this month advanced industry-backed legislation around “stablecoins,” a type of cryptocurrency pegged to another asset, such as gold, or currency. The GENIUS Act, which got the support of 16 Democrats to get past the 60-vote Senate threshold for cloture, would provide some regulatory framework for the coins and create reserve requirements for issuers.

Both of Nevada's Democratic senators voted in favor, with a spokesperson for Sen. Jacky Rosen telling the Sun that “cryptocurrency is an emerging industry that is in need of regulation.”

“Sen. Rosen voted to advance bipartisan legislation to open the door for regulating cryptocurrency. This bill is not the only action Congress should take on crypto regulation, but it is an important step to protect consumers and support America's innovation,” the spokesperson wrote.

Allen doesn't see things the same way. She believes that the legislation only legitimizes a portion of the industry that's been fraught with abuse. World Liberty Financial, too, has its own stablecoin, other Democrats have worried.

“Other than fear of running afoul of the crypto industry's money cannon, I find it hard to see why Democrats are supporting this legislation,” she said. “The legislation essentially blesses stable coins, creating ... a greater market for them.”

 A crypto investor in Manhattan is accused of holding an Italian man captive for weeks, allegedly torturing him for access to Bitcoin wallet credentials. 

A Manhattan crypto investor is facing serious charges after allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian man in a disturbing bid to extract access to digital assets.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.

According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.

The attackers are said to have stolen the man's passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

The victim described being beaten, shocked with electricity, assaulted with a firearm and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story building.

He also told police that Woeltz used a saw to cut his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were also reportedly made against his family.

Photographic evidence found inside the property, including Polaroids, appears to support claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and alert authorities, leading to Woeltz's arrest.

Woeltz was charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom, and entered a plea of not guilty. Judge Eric Schumacher ordered him to be held without bail. He is expected back in court on May 28.

A 24-year-old woman was also taken into custody on Friday in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely in New York the next day, and no charges against her were found in the court's online database.

Authorities have yet to clarify the relationship between the suspect and the victim or whether any cryptocurrency was ultimately stolen.

Executives and investors in the crypto industry are increasingly seeking personal security services as kidnapping and ransom cases surge, especially in France.

On May 18, Amsterdam-based private firm Infinite Risks International reported a rise in requests for bodyguards and long-term protection contracts from high-profile figures in the space.

French authorities have responded by introducing enhanced protections for crypto entrepreneurs and their families, including security briefings and priority access to police assistance.

This comes amid a recent surge in kidnappings and ransom attempts. David Balland, the co-founder of hardware wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped in January 2025 and held for ransom for several days before being rescued by French police.

In May 2024, the father of an unnamed crypto entrepreneur was freed from a ransom attempt after French law enforcement officials raided the location in a Paris suburb where the individual was being held hostage by organized criminals.

In the context of smart homes, efficiently managing temperature control while optimizing energy consumption and ensuring data security remains a significant challenge. Traditional thermostat-based systems lack predictive capabilities, and energy consumption often spikes during peak hours, leading to inefficiency. Additionally, the security of sensitive data in smart home environments is a growing concern. This paper presents a novel AI-powered blockchain framework for predictive temperature control in smart homes, leveraging wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and time-shifted analysis. The framework integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms for predictive temperature management, blockchain technology for secure data handling, and edge computing for real-time data processing, resulting in a highly efficient and secure system. Key innovations include the dynamic detection of heating and cooling events, predictive scheduling based on historical data, and blockchain-based decentralized energy trading. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the system accurately detects radiator heat-on events with a 28.5% success rate, while radiator cooling event detection achieves 37.3% accuracy. Scheduled heat-on events were triggered with 68.4% reliability, and the system's machine learning component successfully reduced energy consumption by 15.8% compared to traditional thermostat controls, by adjusting heating based on predictive analysis. Additionally, the time-shifted data processing reduces peak-time computational load by 22%, contributing to overall energy efficiency and system scalability. The integration of blockchain ensures tamper-proof data security, eliminating unauthorized data access, and improving trust in smart home environments. These results illustrate the potential of combining AI, blockchain, and WSNs to create a robust, energy-efficient, and secure smart home temperature control system, offering significant improvements over traditional solutions.

As the adoption of smart homes continues to expand globally, the need for efficient, secure, and autonomous temperature control systems has become increasingly important1. Traditional thermostat-based systems, while effective in basic temperature regulation, lack the sophistication necessary to optimize energy usage and improve user comfort in dynamic environments2. These systems often fail to account for real-time data, external factors, or user behavior patterns, leading to inefficient heating and cooling cycles that contribute to energy waste and increased costs3. Recent advancements in WSNs and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have introduced new opportunities for more precise temperature control4. WSNs enable the continuous monitoring of environmental parameters, such as room temperature and radiator activity, within a smart home5. However, managing and processing the large volume of data generated by these networks, while maintaining data security and minimizing energy consumption, remains a significant challenge6.

Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to address the issues of data security and privacy in IoT systems7. Its decentralized architecture ensures tamper-proof data storage, while smart contracts enable automated decision-making processes, such as adjusting temperature settings based on predefined conditions8. Despite these advantages, blockchain's high computational demands can lead to latency and inefficiency when applied to real-time data processing in smart homes9. To further enhance the capabilities of smart home temperature control, ML techniques have proven effective in predictive analytics, enabling systems to anticipate user needs based on historical data10. By integrating ML models with blockchain and WSNs, it is possible to develop a more responsive and energy-efficient system that adjusts temperature proactively, reducing the need for manual intervention11.

Furthermore, the integration of edge computing offers a viable solution to the problem of latency by processing data locally at the home level12. This reduces the reliance on centralized cloud systems, enhancing real-time response and improving overall system performance13. Additionally, time-shifted data analysis can be employed to reduce computational loads during peak times, ensuring that energy consumption is optimized without compromising the accuracy or responsiveness of the system14. The integration of smart technologies in residential environments has been a rapidly growing field of research over the past decade, driven by the increasing demand for energy-efficient and automated systems in modern homes15. WSNs, IoT devices, and smart thermostats are among the key enablers of intelligent home systems, allowing for real-time monitoring and control of environmental conditions such as temperature, lighting, and security16. The deployment of these systems at scale has brought about new challenges related to data security, computational efficiency, and energy management, which have been the focus of recent research17. WSNs have been extensively studied for their ability to monitor and control environmental parameters in real time18. In the context of smart homes, WSNs enable continuous tracking of room temperature, humidity, and occupancy, providing the data needed for adaptive heating and cooling systems19. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of WSNs in improving energy efficiency in smart homes. For example, research20 showed that sensor-driven temperature control systems could reduce heating energy consumption by up to 20% when compared to traditional thermostat systems.

Blockchain technology has emerged as a robust solution21 for addressing security and privacy concerns in IoT systems22. By decentralizing data storage and securing transactions with cryptographic algorithms, blockchain ensures the immutability of data records and protects against unauthorized access23,24 is among the first to explore the use of blockchain for securing IoT data in smart homes, proposing a lightweight framework that protects user data from external attacks. The use of smart contracts in blockchain further enhances automation by enabling devices to execute predefined actions autonomously, based on specified triggers25. The computational intensity of blockchain, particularly its reliance on consensus mechanisms, can introduce delays that reduce system efficiency for real-time applications26.The integration of blockchain technology and machine learning techniques to enhance the security management of 6G wireless networks is explored in27. The application of blockchain technology to enhance various aspects of smart city infrastructure is examined in28. It highlights how blockchain can improve security, transparency, and efficiency in urban systems such as energy management, transportation, and governance, enabling better data handling and fostering trust among citizens and stakeholders. The article29 explores the integration of blockchain technology to enhance the security and privacy of smart devices in the IoT environment.

The application of ML for predictive temperature control has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for improving system responsiveness and energy efficiency30. ML algorithms can analyze historical temperature data, occupancy patterns, and even external factors such as weather to forecast heating or cooling needs, allowing systems to adjust preemptively31. Studies such as32 demonstrated that machine learning-based systems could reduce energy consumption by up to 18% compared to traditional reactive control systems, by predicting when heating or cooling is required based on user behavior. These predictive systems, however, require robust data33 handling mechanisms to ensure that real-time and historical data are processed securely and efficiently. The integration of edge computing into smart home ecosystems has been proposed as a solution to the latency and bandwidth issues associated with centralized cloud processing34. Edge computing allows data to be processed locally, closer to the source of data generation, which reduces the delays inherent in cloud-based systems35. Research36 highlighted the potential of edge computing in reducing latency and improving real-time decision-making in IoT systems, particularly in scenarios requiring immediate responses, such as smart temperature control. A transformative advancement in37, showcasing significant improvements across several key dimensions of industrial operations. Overall, the synergy between AI and blockchain technologies38 leads to a notable increase in productivity, operational reliability, and data security, setting a new standard for industrial excellence.

The integration of explainable AI with blockchain technology in39 significantly enhances financial decision-making by addressing key issues of transparency and trust.

Despite the significant advancements in smart home temperature control systems, several critical research gaps remain in the integration of emerging technologies such as blockchain, ML, WSNs, and edge computing. Current approaches either focus on isolated aspects of temperature management (e.g., predictive analytics or security) or lack the computational efficiency needed for real-time applications. These gaps are becoming more pronounced as smart home environments grow increasingly complex and demand secure, scalable, and energy-efficient solutions.

Research Gaps:

The second part of the article focuses on Problem Formulation, addressing key components such as Predictive Temperature Control. The third section follows with the Results and Discussion, providing a detailed simulation analysis and comparison of the proposed method, while the fourth section offers the Conclusion for a final summary.

The rapid advancement of smart home technologies has highlighted the need for systems that not only provide comfort but also optimize energy usage and ensure data security. Traditional thermostat systems are limited in their ability to predict and adapt to varying environmental conditions and user behaviors, often resulting in inefficient heating schedules and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the centralized handling of sensitive data in these systems raises concerns about privacy and vulnerability to unauthorized access. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an integrated framework that combines predictive analytics, secure data management, and efficient processing capabilities. Specifically, the problem centers on developing a system that can accurately detect heating and cooling events, reliably trigger scheduled heat-on events, reduce energy consumption through predictive adjustments, and maintain data integrity and security within the smart home environment. This necessitates leveraging advanced technologies such as AI-powered machine learning algorithms, blockchain for secure and transparent data handling, wireless sensor networks for real-time environmental monitoring, and time-shifted analysis to optimize computational efficiency.

Flowchart depicting the problem-solving process.

The AI-Powered Blockchain Framework for Predictive Temperature Control in Smart Homes can be modeled as a holistic system integrating predictive control, energy optimization, and blockchain technology. The architecture can be represented as follows:

The system takes the following inputs:

where \(\:{U}_{\text{user\:}}\) represents user-defined preferences, such as the desired temperature range. The predictive model forecasts future temperature:

with the control law ensuring:

The optimization function minimizes energy consumption:

subject to constraints on temperature stability. Sensor data and control signals are securely stored in a blockchain:

ensuring immutability and transparency in the data. The system detects heating and cooling events dynamically:

and uses historical patterns for scheduling:

The outputs are:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{Optimized\:}}\)​ represents optimized power usage and \(\:{E}_{\text{events\:}}\)​ identifies critical heating/cooling events.

This integrated system provides a robust, secure, and energy-efficient solution for temperature control in smart homes, demonstrating the novelty and practical relevance of the proposed framework.

Let \(\:T\left(t\right)\) represent the indoor temperature at time \(\:t\), measured by the wireless sensors. The goal is to predict the future temperature \(\:T(t+{\Delta\:}t)\) based on historical temperature data, user preferences, and environmental conditions.

To model the temperature dynamics, we can use a simple heat transfer equation:

\(\:C\) is the thermal capacity of the room,\(\:\:P\left(t\right)\) is the power supplied by the heating system at time \(\:{t}_{r}\),\(\:\:U\) is the overall heat transfer coefficient of the building and\(\:\:{T}_{ext}\left(t\right)\) is the external temperature.

The ML model uses historical temperature data \(\:\left\{T\left({t}_{1}\right),T\left({t}_{2}\right),\dots\:,T\left({t}_{n}\right)\right\}\) and corresponding energy consumption \(\:P\left(t\right)\) to predict future temperature changes. The prediction function can be expressed as:

where \(\:f\) is the learned function based on past data using a machine learning algorithm, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

The objective is to minimize the energy consumption \(\:E\), while maintaining user comfort, represented by a set temperature range \(\:\left[{T}_{\text{min\:}},{T}_{\text{max\:}}\right]\).

The energy consumed by the heating system over a period \(\:T\) is:

where \(\:P\left(t\right)\) is the power required to maintain the temperature within the desired range. Using predictive temperature control, the heating system can adjust the power supply based on the forecasted temperature \(\:T(t+\varDelta\:t)\), thereby reducing unnecessary energy use.

The system seeks to minimize \(\:E\) under the constraint:

To reduce peak-time computational load, the system leverages time-shifted analysis, where non-urgent computations, such as data processing or historical analysis, are performed during off-peak times.

Let \(\:{C}_{\text{p}\text{e}\text{a}\text{k}}\) ​be the computational load during peak hours, and \(\:{C}_{\text{o}\text{f}\text{f}}\) ​ be the load during off-peak hours. Time-shifted analysis aims to minimize \(\:{C}_{\text{p}\text{e}\text{a}\text{k}}\)​ by shifting part of the workload to off-peak times. The relationship can be modeled as:

with the goal to reduce \(\:{C}_{\text{p}\text{e}\text{a}\text{k}}\)​, where:

and \(\:\varDelta\:{C}_{\text{s}\text{h}\text{i}\text{f}\text{t}}\) represents the load shifted to off-peak times. This reduces overall peak-time load by a percentage \(\:\varDelta\:{C}_{\text{s}\text{h}\text{i}\text{f}\text{t}}/{C}_{\text{t}\text{o}\text{t}\text{a}\text{l}}\)​.

For data security, blockchain technology is integrated to ensure tamper-proof and transparent data management. Each temperature reading and energy consumption record is stored as a block in the blockchain. Let \(\:D\left(t\right)\) represent the data at time \(\:t\) (e.g., temperature readings, energy consumption). The blockchain ensures that \(\:D\left(t\right)\) cannot be altered once recorded.

The data is secured using a cryptographic hash function \(\:H\), where:

Each new block includes the hash of the previous block \(\:H\left(D\right(t-1\left)\right)\), ensuring data immutability:

This chain of blocks guarantees that any attempt to tamper with historical data will be easily detected, as it would alter the hash values in subsequent blocks.

The final objective is to optimize the system for both energy efficiency and user satisfaction. Let SSS represent customer satisfaction, which depends on maintaining the desired temperature range and minimizing energy costs. The overall optimization problem can be formulated as a multi-objective problem:

subject to the constraints \(\:{T}_{min}\le\:T\left(t\right)\le\:{T}_{max}\)​ and secure data handling through blockchain. The system seeks to balance energy efficiency with user comfort and data security.

The system must dynamically detect heating events (e.g., radiator turning on) and cooling events (e.g., radiator turning off). These events can be modeled as binary occurrences based on the rate of temperature change over time.

Let \(\:\varDelta\:T=T(t+1)-T\left(t\right)\) represent the change in temperature between time intervals. Define \(\:H\left(t\right)\) as a heating event and \(\:C\left(t\right)\) as a cooling event, which are triggered when certain thresholds are crossed:

\(\:H\left(t\right)=1\) if \(\:{\Delta\:}T>{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{heat-on,\:}}\) where \(\:{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{heat-on\:}}\) is the minimum temperature change to trigger a heating event.

\(\:C\left(t\right)=1\) if \(\:{\Delta\:}T<{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{cool-off\:}}\), where \(\:{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{cool-off\:}}\) is the maximum temperature drop to trigger a cooling event.

The framework can further be refined by employing machine learning models that dynamically learn from data to refine these thresholds and account for varying environmental conditions:

where \(\:{f}_{\theta\:}\) is a learned function that dynamically adjusts thresholds based on environmental and system variables.

To optimize energy usage, the system uses predictive scheduling based on historical data. The goal is to anticipate future temperature changes and schedule heating or cooling events accordingly.

Define \(\:\mathcal{H}\left(t\right)=\left\{H\right(t-\tau\:),\dots\:,H(t\left)\right\}\) as the history of heating events over the time period \(\:\tau\:\), and similarly, \(\:\mathcal{C}\left(t\right)=\left\{C\right(t-\tau\:),\dots\:,C(t\left)\right\}\) as the history of cooling events. The system uses these historical patterns to predict future events:

where \(\:P\left(H\right(t+1)=1)\) is the probability of a heating event occurring at time \(\:t+1\), predicted using a machine learning algorithm trained on historical data \(\:\mathcal{H}\) and \(\:\mathcal{C}\).

The system then schedules heating and cooling events based on the predicted probabilities to minimize energy consumption while maintaining user comfort. If \(\:P\left(H\right(t+1)=1)>{P}_{\text{threshold,\:}}\) the system preemptively triggers a heating event, reducing energy spikes.

One of the key innovations is the integration of blockchain for decentralized energy trading. Users within a smart home network can buy or sell surplus energy generated from renewable sources (e.g., solar panels) using blockchain smart contracts.

Let \(\:{E}_{prod}\left(t\right)\) represent the energy produced by a renewable energy source at time \(\:t\), and \(\:{E}_{cons}\left(t\right)\)​ represent the energy consumed by the smart home at time \(\:t\). The surplus energy is given by:

where \(\:{E}_{surplus}\left(t\right)>0\) represents excess energy that can be sold, and \(\:{E}_{surplus}\left(t\right)<0\) represents a deficit that can be compensated by purchasing energy.

Using blockchain smart contracts, energy transactions are automated between smart homes. Let \(\:{p}_{buy}\left(t\right)\) and \(\:{p}_{sell}\left(t\right)\) represent the buying and selling prices at time \(\:t\). The smart contract automates the energy trade when:

Each energy trade is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. The smart contract logic can be formalized as:

The blockchain ledger ensures that energy trades are secured and logged without requiring a central authority, maintaining trust among users in the decentralized energy market.

WSNs play a vital role in real-time monitoring of temperature and environmental conditions in smart homes. However, optimizing the energy efficiency and reliability of the WSN itself is essential.

Let \(\:N\left(t\right)\) represent the number of active sensors at time \(\:t\), and \(\:{P}_{s}\left(t\right)\) represent the power consumption of the WSN at time \(\:t\). The goal is to minimize the power consumption of the WSN while maintaining sufficient sensor coverage.

The optimization problem can be formulated as:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{sensor\:}}\left(i\right)\) is the power consumption of the \(\:i\)-th sensor, and \(\:C\left(t\right)\) represents the coverage of the WSN, which must exceed a minimum threshold \(\:{C}_{\text{m}\text{i}\text{n}}\) for reliable temperature monitoring.

To reduce power consumption, time-shifted data analysis and adaptive sensing can be employed, where only a subset of sensors is active during certain periods, depending on predicted events.

The system can dynamically deactivate sensors when they are not required, using the predicted temperature changes \(\:T(t+{\Delta\:}t)\) from the machine learning model. This reduces sensor power consumption:

The interaction between the edge server and IoMT devices involves a collaborative exchange of data and computational tasks, which ensures efficient operation in the system. Each IoMT device independently collects and processes local data, generating model parameters based on its specific environment and tasks. These parameters are periodically transmitted to the edge server for aggregation.

The edge server plays a pivotal role in this framework by acting as a central coordinator. It aggregates the model parameters received from multiple devices using advanced techniques, such as weighted averaging or federated optimization, depending on the importance and quality of the data from each device. This aggregation process ensures that the global model is continually updated while preserving the privacy of individual devices since raw data is never directly shared.

To manage real-time updates, the edge server employs a systematic communication protocol that prioritizes low-latency and secure data transfer. The server can handle asynchronous updates, allowing devices with varying computational and network capabilities to participate effectively. Additionally, the edge server uses error-checking and version.

To formulate the overall optimization problem, we aim to minimize energy consumption, \(\:E\), and computational load, \(\:{C}_{total}\), while maximizing user satisfaction, \(\:S\), and ensuring secure data handling. This leads to a multi-objective optimization problem:

where \(\:{\alpha\:}_{1},{\alpha\:}_{2}\), and \(\:{\alpha\:}_{3}\) are weights representing the relative importance of energy consumption, computational efficiency, and user satisfaction.

Subject to the constraints:

Blockchain-based data logs enhance system security by providing an immutable and tamper-proof ledger for recording all system transactions and events. Each data log is cryptographically secured, ensuring that once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered without the consensus of the network. This feature prevents unauthorized access and data manipulation. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain eliminates single points of failure, making the system resilient against cyberattacks. By incorporating these secure data logs, the proposed framework ensures the integrity and confidentiality of temperature control data in smart homes, thereby fostering user trust and system reliability.

The previous formulation provided a basic energy optimization model. We can enhance this by incorporating dynamic energy pricing and more granular control over energy usage based on real-time conditions.

Let \(\:P\left(t\right)\) represent the dynamic price of energy at time \(\:t\), which varies based on demand and supply in the energy market. The cost of energy consumption, \(\:{C}_{E}\)​, over a period \(\:T\) can be expressed as:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{cons\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the power consumption at time \(\:t\).

The objective is to minimize the energy cost \(\:{C}_{E}\) while maintaining comfort, subject to dynamic pricing. Therefore, the optimization function becomes:

subject to the constraints:

The dynamic pricing \(\:P\left(t\right)\) can be modeled as a function of market conditions and predicted demand:

where \(\:D\left(t\right)\) is the predicted demand and \(\:S\left(t\right)\) is the available energy supply. Incorporating dynamic pricing incentivizes the system to reduce energy usage during peak periods and shift demand to off-peak times, which leads to cost savings.

Blockchain consensus mechanisms ensure the integrity of data within the system. Given the decentralized nature of smart homes, where each home or node is an independent agent, a consensus algorithm like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is appropriate to validate transactions without high energy costs.

Let \(\:D\left(t\right)\) represent a data block (e.g., sensor readings, energy trades), and let \(\:V\left(t\right)\) represent the set of validators in the network at time \(\:t\). Each validator \(\:{\nu\:}_{i}\in\:V\left(t\right)\:\)proposes a block \(\:{B}_{i}\left(t\right)\), where the block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block and the new data to be added.

The consensus algorithm requires that a majority of validators approve the new block. The total number of validators that approve a block \(\:{B}_{i}\left(t\right)\) is denoted as \(\:{A}_{i}\left(t\right)\). The consensus is reached when:

where \(\:\left|V\left(t\right)\right|\) is the total number of validators. If the block is approved by the majority, it is added to the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.

Step 1: Initialization.

• Define the network nodes N={n1,n2,…,nk}.

• Each node ni​ maintains a local blockchain ledger Li​.

• Initialize consensus threshold T (e.g., 51%).

Step 2: Data Collection.

• Each node collects temperature data Di​ from its associated WSN.

• The data includes room temperature Tr​, radiator temperature Th​, and time-stamped events.

Step 3: Block Proposal.

Node ni​ prepares a candidate block Bi​ with:

Sensor readings.

Predicted temperature control actions.

Previous block hash Hprev​.

Step 4: Validation.

• Broadcast Bi​ to all nodes in the network.

• Each node validates Bi​ by:

Verifying sensor data integrity.

Checking consistency with predicted control actions.

Step 5: Consensus Mechanism.

• Nodes perform a voting process.

• Accept or reject Bi​ based on validation.

• Count the votes V(Bi).

• If V(Bi) ≥ T, Bi is accepted and added to the blockchain.

Step 6: Blockchain Update.

• Update local ledger Li​ to include the new block.

Step 7: Execution of Control Actions.

• Apply the predictive temperature control actions specified in Bi​.

Step 8: Repeat.

• Continue the process for the next data interval.

This algorithm ensures secure and decentralized management of temperature control in smart homes while leveraging blockchain for data integrity and trust.

To encourage energy trading between smart homes, an incentive mechanism can be introduced based on a reward structure for participants who trade energy efficiently. Each user \(\:{u}_{i}\) has a surplus \(\:{E}_{\text{surplus\:}}\left(t\right)\) or deficit \(\:{E}_{\text{deficit\:}}\left(t\right)\) of energy at time \(\:t\), as discussed earlier. The system assigns rewards \(\:{R}_{i}\left(t\right)\) to users based on their contribution to the energy market.

Let \(\:N\left(t\right)\) be the total number of users in the network. The reward for user \(\:{u}_{i}\) at time \(\:t\) is proportional to the energy they contribute to the system and inversely proportional to the overall demand:

where \(\:{R}_{\text{total\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the total reward available at time \(\:t\), which is determined by the blockchain network. This reward system encourages users to contribute surplus energy to the grid, promoting decentralized energy management.

In the proposed system, time-shifted load balancing optimizes computational resources by deferring non-critical computations to off-peak times. This is particularly useful for resource-constrained smart home devices. The framework uses priority-based control to assign priority levels to tasks.

Let \(\:\mathcal{T}\left(t\right)=\left\{{T}_{1}\left(t\right),{T}_{2}\left(t\right),\dots\:,{T}_{n}\left(t\right)\right\}\) represent the set of tasks at time \(\:t\), and let \(\:{P}_{i}\left(t\right)\) be the priority of task \(\:{T}_{i}\left(t\right)\). Tasks with lower priority are deferred to off-peak times, thereby reducing peaktime computational load.

The optimization objective is to minimize the peak computational load \(\:{C}_{peak}\) by shifting lowerpriority tasks. The load is reduced according to the equation:

where \(\:{N}_{\text{high\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the number of high-priority tasks, \(\:C\left({T}_{i}\left(t\right)\right)\) is the computational cost of task \(\:{T}_{i}\left(t\right)\), and \(\:\delta\:\left({T}_{i}\left(t\right)\right)\) is the binary variable indicating whether task \(\:{T}_{i}\left(t\right)\) has been deferred to offpeak times.

In a decentralized smart home network, multi-agent collaboration allows multiple homes to collaborate in managing energy and computational load. Each smart home is treated as an agent \(\:{a}_{i}\)​, and the collaboration aims to minimize total system energy consumption while maintaining comfort across all agents.

Let \(\:{E}_{i}\left(t\right)\) represent the energy consumption of agent \(\:{a}_{i}\) at time \(\:t\). The total energy consumption \(\:{E}_{\text{total\:}}\left(t\right)\) of the network is the sum of energy consumption across all agents:

Each agent shares its load with others, reducing peak demand. The collaborative optimization function is:

where \(\:{w}_{i}\left(t\right)\) is the weight assigned to each agent based on their energy-sharing contribution.

The collaboration ensures that energy is distributed efficiently, and peak demand is reduced by sharing surplus energy between homes in the network.

The proposed system can implement an energy-aware control algorithm to manage heating and cooling based on real-time predictions and sensor data. The control algorithm calculates the optimal heating or cooling schedule by predicting the energy consumption required to maintain the desired temperature.

Define the control signal \(\:u\left(t\right)\) that represents the power adjustment made by the system at time \(\:t\). The control algorithm minimizes energy consumption while maintaining comfort within a defined range \(\:\left[{T}_{\text{m}\text{i}\text{n}},{T}_{\text{m}\text{a}\text{x}}\right]\):

where \(\:\lambda\:\) is a penalty term for deviations from the setpoint temperature \(\:{T}_{\text{set\:}}\).

The control signal is updated based on the following relationship:

where \(\:\eta\:\) is the learning rate and \(\:\nabla\:J\) is the gradient of the objective function with respect to the control signal.

This adaptive control algorithm ensures that the system learns over time, adjusting energy usage to maintain the desired temperature while minimizing cost.

Collect historical temperature data, energy consumption data, weather conditions, and occupancy patterns from IoT sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, occupancy sensors, weather forecasts). Collect the system parameters such as heating and cooling system efficiency, energy consumption rates, and other relevant data.

Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing/standardizing the data. Create additional features based on historical data (e.g., moving averages of temperature, occupancy trends, etc.).

Select an appropriate ML model (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc.). Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the ML model using the historical temperature and energy consumption data, incorporating the weather and occupancy data as input features. Optimize model hyperparameters for better performance.

Use the trained ML model to predict future temperature based on current temperature, weather forecast, and occupancy patterns. Predict the temperature setpoints for future hours or days based on this analysis.

Predict energy consumption for the heating and cooling system using the model based on the predicted temperature and occupancy data. Optimize the energy consumption prediction by adjusting the system's heating/cooling demand to match predicted temperature deviations.

Compare the predicted temperature to the desired temperature setpoint. If the predicted temperature is above or below the target, trigger the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system to adjust. Adjust the heating/cooling system settings to bring the temperature closer to the desired setpoint while minimizing energy consumption.

Apply energy-efficient strategies such as predictive scheduling (heating/cooling during off-peak times), adjusting setpoints based on predicted trends, or controlling HVAC systems based on occupancy data. Use reinforcement learning techniques, if applicable, to adapt and optimize the temperature control and energy usage over time.

Continuously monitor and update predictions using real-time data from IoT sensors, modifying the heating/cooling strategy as needed. Re-train the model periodically with new data to ensure that the system stays accurate.

The system generates optimal heating/cooling schedules and real-time control adjustments. Display energy consumption predictions and provide recommendations for further optimization.

Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing predicted energy consumption and temperature control results against actual outcomes. Use performance metrics like MAE, RMSE, or energy savings percentage to assess the performance of the predictive system.

The algorithm leverages machine learning models such as decision trees, neural networks, or other time-series models, combined with optimization strategies like predictive scheduling and reinforcement learning, to efficiently manage energy in smart homes. By integrating IoT with real-time sensor data and weather forecasting, it predicts temperature and energy consumption trends. This enables optimal HVAC scheduling, minimizing energy usage while maintaining comfort, ultimately achieving intelligent temperature control and energy optimization based on both real-time and historical data.

Additionally, the framework's energy consumption reduction is quantified, demonstrating the impact of predictive scheduling on overall energy efficiency.

Blockchain's role in securing wireless sensor network data and enabling decentralized energy trading is also discussed. The system's tamper-proof nature is examined, along with its ability to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, thereby improving trust and transparency in smart home environments.

Real-time data from WSNs deployed in a simulated smart home environment were collected to evaluate the performance of the system. The simulation models included a combination of environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and energy consumption patterns. The real-time scenarios were designed to mimic typical smart home temperature control situations, with heating and cooling events, predictive scheduling, and energy trading based on historical data.

The integration of real-time data processing with edge computing ensures that the temperature control adjustments occur dynamically based on the collected data. This means that the system can make decisions and update control actions (such as turning the radiator on/off or adjusting the temperature) in real time. Furthermore, the blockchain component allows for secure, tamper-proof data logs in real-time, ensuring system integrity.

To illustrate the real-time performance, a time series of temperature data, event detection, and energy consumption adjustments were continuously monitored and updated during the experiments, reflecting how the system responds to changes in the environment and its effectiveness in optimizing energy consumption.

Algorithmic Procedure: The algorithmic procedure for the proposed system can be described in the following steps:

Step 1: Data Collection - Real-time data from WSNs (temperature, humidity) are collected.

Step 2: Predictive Control - Machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) are used to predict the heating or cooling needs based on historical data.

The system's complexity is influenced by the machine learning models' training time, the number of sensors in the WSNs, and the blockchain's consensus mechanism.

The dataset was collected from a real-world smart home setup, equipped with a WSN and a variety of IoT devices. Data was recorded from January to June 2024 across multiple rooms, including the living room, bedroom, and kitchen, to ensure variability in temperature and energy usage patterns. The dataset includes temperature measurements, energy consumption readings, and radiator operational status (on/off) synchronized with real-time external weather data.

The dataset includes the following key features that are crucial for training and testing the predictive models, performing time-shifted analysis, and optimizing energy consumption in Table 3:

Total records: 25,920 data points (representing one data point every minute for a period of 18 days). Data is structured in time series, with a total of 6 months of data from multiple rooms, offering a rich set of variations in temperature, energy consumption, and heating events.

To ensure the quality and consistency of the data used for the predictive model and optimization algorithms, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

Missing temperature and energy consumption values were interpolated using a linear interpolation technique to fill in any gaps due to sensor failure or communication issues. For example, if the indoor temperature \(\:{\varvec{T}}_{\text{i}\text{n}\text{d}\text{o}\text{o}\text{r}}\:\)for the time 12:30 PM is missing, it is linearly interpolated from the neighboring values 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM.

Outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Any value higher than 3 times the IQR from the upper quartile (e.g., values > 10 kWh in a 2-hour period) was removed to prevent distortion of the analysis and prediction accuracy.

All temperature values were normalized using Min-Max scaling. For instance, if the range of indoor temperatures is from 18 °C to 28 °C, the normalized indoor temperature is calculated as \(\:{T}_{norm}=\frac{{T}_{indoor}-18}{28-18}\).

Temporal features such as time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), weekday/weekend status, and holidays were extracted to enhance the predictive models. These features were used to adjust heating predictions during high-demand periods like weekends or holidays.

The dataset was used for multiple purposes within the framework:

Historical data was employed to train machine learning models (such as LSTM or Random Forest) to predict the indoor temperature and heating durations, providing predictive scheduling for energy-efficient heating control.

Blockchain technology was used to securely log and share data related to temperature and energy usage across decentralized nodes within the smart home network, ensuring tamper-proof and traceable data handling.

The radiator status and event detection were analyzed using the dataset to identify the exact times heating events occur (heat-on, cooling, and heat-off events), which are integral to time-shifted load balancing.

Consider a smart home equipped with a WSN for monitoring temperature and a heating system that responds to temperature changes. The AI-powered framework uses historical temperature data, real-time sensor readings, and predictive machine learning algorithms to control the heating system more efficiently. At the same time, the system leverages blockchain to ensure secure data handling.

Modeling the Temperature Dynamics

First, the room temperature dynamics need to be modeled based on heat transfer principles. The rate of temperature change in the room can be modeled as:

\(\:T\left(t\right)\) is the room temperature at time \(\:{t}_{\:}\),\(\:\:P\left(t\right)\) is the heating power provided by the system at time \(\:{t}_{r}\), \(\:{T}_{\text{outside\:}}\) is the outside temperature,\(\:\:U\) is the heat loss coefficient (related to insulation), and\(\:\:C\) is the heat capacity of the room.

This differential equation governs how the room temperature changes over time based on heating power and heat loss to the environment.

Machine Learning for Predictive Control

To optimize energy use, a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network, RNN) is trained using historical temperature data and heating system responses. The goal is to predict the future temperature \(\:T(t+1)\) based on current and past data, allowing for pre-emptive heating adjustments.

Let the inputs to the model at time \(\:t\) be \(\:X\left(t\right)=\left\{T\left(t\right),P\left(t\right),{T}_{\text{outside\:}}\left(t\right)\right\}\), and the output be the predicted temperature \(\:\hat{T}(t+1)\). The trained model minimizes the prediction error:

where \(\:N\) is the number of time steps in the historical dataset.

The predictive control algorithm then adjusts the heating power \(\:P\left(t\right)\) to maintain the desired temperature \(\:{T}_{\text{set\:}}\) within a predefined comfort range \(\:\left[{T}_{\text{m}\text{i}\text{n}},{T}_{\text{m}\text{a}\text{x}}\right]\). The control signal is updated as:

where \(\:{K}_{p}\) and \(\:{K}_{d}\)​ are proportional and derivative control gains, respectively. This feedback control loop ensures that the heating system responds dynamically to temperature predictions, optimizing energy use.

Blockchain for Data Security

To ensure that all data exchanged between smart home devices (e.g., sensors, heating systems) is secure, the system integrates blockchain. Each temperature reading and heating event is recorded as a transaction in the blockchain.

Let \(\:{D}_{i}\)​ represent the data block for the iii-th transaction, containing temperature data and heating control decisions. A blockchain consensus algorithm (such as Proof of Stake) is used to validate each transaction. The validation condition is:

where \(\:{A}_{i}\left(t\right)\) is the number of validators approving the block, and \(\:\left|V\right(t\left)\right|\) is the total number of validators in the network. Once the consensus is reached, the block is added to the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof and auditable data.

Energy Consumption Optimization

The final step is to optimize energy consumption while maintaining room comfort. The cost function for energy consumption over a period \(\:T\) is:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{price\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the dynamic energy price at time \(\:t\). The optimization problem becomes:

subject to:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{m}\text{a}\text{x}}\) is the maximum power that the heating system can provide.

The AI-powered system adjusts the heating power \(\:P\left(t\right)\) to minimize energy costs by scheduling heating during periods of lower energy prices and leveraging the predictive model to avoid unnecessary heating during peak times.

Performance Metrics and Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the system, key metrics such as energy savings, temperature control accuracy, and system scalability are computed. For example, energy consumption can be reduced by 15.8%, as mentioned in the abstract, by optimizing heating schedules and predictive controls. Additionally, the system can reduce computational load by 22% through time-shifted data processing.

Comparison of temperature regulation and energy efficiency among control methods.

To analyze the algorithm complexity for the proposed AI-powered blockchain framework for predictive temperature control in smart homes, we need to evaluate both the time complexity and space complexity of the key components involved. Here is a general approach to analyzing algorithm complexity for the proposed framework:

Data Collection and Preprocessing.

Time Complexity: Collecting data from WSNs involves reading sensor data periodically, which is typically O(n) for n sensors.

Space Complexity: Storing sensor data requires O(n) space, as data from each sensor must be stored temporarily for processing.

Machine Learning Model for Predictive Temperature Control.

Training the Model: The time complexity for training a machine learning model (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, or neural networks) is usually dependent on the number of data points (m) and features (d). For a model like neural networks, the complexity can be O(m.d.k), where k is the number of epochs. For tree-based models, the complexity is generally O(m.log(m)).

Inference Complexity: The time complexity for real-time predictions is generally O(d), where d is the number of features used in the model. This is the time taken to make predictions after the model has been trained.

Blockchain Integration for Secure Data Logging.

Transaction Processing: Each data transaction to the blockchain (e.g., recording sensor readings or control actions) can be processed in O(1) time for each transaction. However, as the blockchain grows in size, block verification and consensus can introduce additional computational complexity. The time complexity for consensus protocols (e.g., Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake) is typically O(log(n)) where n is the number of nodes in the network.

Space Complexity: The space required for blockchain storage is proportional to the number of blocks and transactions. For a decentralized system, this grows with the number of blocks, making the space complexity O(b) where b is the number of blocks in the chain.

Real-time Event Detection and Adjustments.

Event Detection: Detecting heat-on or cooling events involves analyzing the sensor data in real-time. The complexity of event detection is typically O(n), where n is the number of sensors. If using a more sophisticated model for anomaly detection, the complexity could increase to O(n.d).

Adjustment Calculation: The time required to adjust temperature settings or initiate control actions is generally O(1) for each event.

Energy Consumption and Network Optimization.

Energy Consumption Estimation: Calculating energy consumption reduction involves estimating the energy saved through predictive adjustments. This is typically O(1) for each prediction, as it requires only the current state of the system.

Network Lifetime Analysis: The complexity of analyzing network lifetime depends on the number of edge devices (n) and their energy consumption rates. For systems with multiple devices, the complexity could be O(n) or higher, depending on the communication and processing requirements.

Overall Algorithm Complexity.

Time Complexity: The overall time complexity of the system can be considered a combination of the complexities of the individual components. The overall time complexity is influenced by the sensor data collection (O(n)), real-time machine learning inference (O(d)), blockchain transaction processing (O(1) or O(log(n))), and event detection (O(n)).

Space Complexity: The space complexity primarily depends on the data storage for sensor readings (O(n)) and the size of the blockchain (O(b)), resulting in an overall space complexity of O(n + b).

Overall, the proposed method offers a robust and efficient solution for smart home temperature management, addressing the limitations of conventional systems. By combining advanced AI algorithms, secure blockchain integration, and real-time data processing, this approach sets a new standard in optimizing energy use and improving user comfort in smart homes.

While the proposed AI-powered blockchain framework demonstrates significant potential for predictive temperature control in smart homes, there are several avenues for future research and improvements. One important direction is the enhancement of the framework's scalability, particularly when dealing with larger networks of IoT devices and edge nodes. The system's ability to efficiently handle a growing number of sensors and devices, while maintaining real-time performance and data integrity, will be crucial for large-scale deployments.

Additionally, future work could explore the integration of more advanced machine learning models, such as deep reinforcement learning, to further optimize predictive control and improve energy efficiency. This would allow the system to continuously learn from real-time data and adapt to environmental changes more effectively.

Another area for further investigation is the incorporation of more robust cybersecurity measures. Although blockchain technology provides a secure data logging mechanism, potential vulnerabilities may still exist in other components of the system. Future research could focus on enhancing the security protocols, such as incorporating secure multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive data throughout the network.

Lastly, real-world testing and validation of the framework in diverse smart home environments are essential. While the current results are promising, future work should include experimental validation in various settings to ensure the practical applicability and robustness of the system. This would also involve assessing the system's performance under different energy consumption scenarios, network conditions, and user behaviors.

 Australian Senator Gerard Rennick criticized Bitcoin, saying "you can't eat Bitcoin." A Bitcoiner replied, asking if he feels the same about the internet. 

Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has drawn criticism from the Bitcoin community following his remarks referring to Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme and questioning the asset's value because it can't be eaten.

“You can't eat Bitcoin,” Rennick said in a May 23 X post, responding to an X user who questioned his stance after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.

“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it's a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.

“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.”

Bitcoiners across the world were quick to respond to Rennick's comments. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) said Rennick's remarks about “Bitcoin reveal a deep misunderstanding.” The ABIB added:

Unchained podcast host Laura Shin said, “You also can't eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro said, “This is definitely going to age well. Please enlighten us with more of your deep and nuanced understanding of Bitcoin.”

Rennick responded to the criticism and said he doesn't “need to explain anything.”

“It's pathetic how the Bitcoin community needs reassurance from a politician - the very people they claim they want to be free from,” Rennick said.

The Bitcoin community has frequently spoken out when prominent individuals have expressed anti-Bitcoin views.

Only a few weeks ago, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs experienced backlash from the Bitcoin community after her decision to veto a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves.

Casa co-founder and cypherpunk Jameson Lopp said, “This will age poorly.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.” Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon said, “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.”

The Bitcoin community also pushed back when the US government decided to transfer $1.9 billion of Bitcoin to Coinbase in December 2024.

 Cathie Wood says crypto ETFs will not “lose a lot of their luster” and will stay around for those who just “wanna push a button.” 

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy, regardless of how widespread crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade.

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.

“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don't think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:

Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin (BTC) wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.

Since spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US in January 2024, approximately $44.49 billion in inflows have been recorded, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.

Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise's application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.

However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). 

“So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.

Wood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump's memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.

“Institutions and you're saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said. Just days after its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP slid around 50% after the president made no crypto-related “day one” executive orders.

“I mean, that might scare them,” Wood said. Her comments came in response to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterating the point that Bitcoin is “so easy” to explain to a “boomer or adviser” as being digital gold, but other cryptocurrencies “are tougher.”

Wood said she is still finalizing her Solana price target and will share it once her research is complete.

In April, ARK raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, primarily driven by institutional investors and Bitcoin's increasing acceptance as “digital gold.”

A man was arrested Friday after being accused of kidnapping an Italian tourist and torturing him for weeks inside a Manhattan home in a bid to steal the alleged victim's bitcoin, according to officials, law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation and a criminal complaint.

The victim was able to escape the home and run for help Friday morning, the law enforcement sources said. John Woeltz, 37, was taken into custody that same day and was arraigned Saturday on one count each of second-degree assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, court records show.

Law enforcement sources close to the investigation said Woeltz and the tourist, along with a third person, had been in business together for years. Police are still searching for the third business partner, who has not been publicly identified.

The sources said Woeltz and the other person have allegedly gotten violent with the victim in the past, but never to this extent. They described the relationship between the three as very complex, and said it appears the victim was often picked on by the two men.

An attorney for Woeltz declined to comment Saturday. A judge granted a request to hold Woeltz in custody during Saturday's arraignment. His next court date is Wednesday.

The tourist, a 28-year-old man visiting from Italy, met his alleged kidnapper on May 6, law enforcement sources said. That's when, they said, Woeltz took the younger man to a home he was renting in Nolita, a neighborhood in Manhattan.

According to a criminal complaint, Woeltz and an unidentified, “unapprehended male” kidnapped the victim, took his electronics and passport, and tortured him until he managed to escape weeks later.

The pair tried to get the tourist to give them the password to his bitcoin account so they could steal the electronic currency, and when he refused, they beat him, shocked him with electric wires and hit him in the head with a gun over the course of weeks, the complaint said.

Woeltz and the other man allegedly pointed a gun at the victim's head multiple times, dangled him over the ledge of the top flight of stairs in the home and threatened to kill him if he did not reveal his password, according to the complaint, which also alleged the pair threatened to have his family killed.

The tourist also told officials that the men tied his wrists and bound him to prevent him from moving, according to the complaint.

Law enforcement sources added that the men urinated on the victim and put an Apple AirTag around his neck to ensure he did not escape.

Upon his escape, the 28-year-old ran into a traffic agent who called police to the home on Prince Street. He told the agent he had been taken and held against his will and that he was repeatedly assaulted during his captivity, police said.

The alleged victim was taken to a hospital in stable condition, police said. When he approached officers Friday, he was covered in cuts and bruises, with marks on his wrists where he was bound, law enforcement sources said.

Law enforcement sources said Woeltz is a prominent crypto currency trader from Kentucky, estimated to be worth around $100 million. The victim has an estimated worth of $30 million, they said.

Woeltz had reportedly been renting out the Prince Street residence at a monthly rate of between $30,000 and $40,000, the sources said. An online listing for the home says it was last rented in March for $75,000.

Law enforcement sources said there were cases of alcohol throughout the six-story residence, as well as stripper poles in the basement.

Those sources said officers turned up multiple Polaroid pictures of the victim being tied up and tortured at the home. Investigators also reportedly recovered several torture items.

Inside the residence, investigators on Saturday found a gun, believed to be the same one used to torture the victim, law enforcement sources said.

Jennifer Crawford lives across the street from where the events unfolded Friday morning and saw Woeltz being arrested.

“I watched, like, the SWAT guys get out of the truck with their shields and everything and enter the building, and they were just starting to rope off the area and everyone's yelling. It looked like they were a little bit in a panic,” she told NBC News.

She said she was shocked when she started learning more of the allegations.

“I just stood and froze,” she said. “A lot does go on here in New York. You can imagine, I've seen a lot, but this is the most unusual thing I've seen in 30 years in this neighborhood. I mean, that's just beyond what you can even describe or imagine.”

Crawford said she couldn't imagine the motive of someone with so much wealth committing this type of crime.

“All that money in the world didn't do anything. It's not going to help him,” she said. “Just doesn't make sense, you know?”

On Saturday, hundreds of people passed by the townhome in Manhattan, some whispering about the details of the case. A few even took selfies in front of the home by the iron fence wrapped in police tape.

Police officials and investigators were in and out of the house Saturday, several standing guard in the front and recommending to those passing by to Google the home address to learn more.

As the cryptocurrency world continues to mature, Ripple's XRP token is once again a strong contender for mainstream adoption. Once overshadowed by regulatory uncertainty, XRP is now experiencing a remarkable resurgence driven by global partnerships, growing utility, and growing investor interest. Meanwhile, cloud-based mining platform BlockchainCloudMining is offering crypto enthusiasts, especially XRP holders, a whole new way to benefit from the digital asset ecosystem without actively trading or managing mining hardware.

This article explores the current state of XRP, the importance of its growth to the broader crypto economy, and how BlockchainCloudMining enables passive income generation that fits perfectly with XRP's expanding footprint.

The past few years have been nothing short of an up-and-down journey for XRP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit that began in 2020 cast a shadow over Ripple's development. However, since the court partially ruled in Ripple's favor in mid-2023, the tide has turned. XRP is being relisted on mainstream exchanges such as Coinbase, and global financial institutions are returning to RippleNet and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution.

In recent months, Ripple has consolidated partnerships with large remittance corridors in Asia, South America, and the Middle East. By reducing transaction fees and enabling instant settlement, XRP continues to position itself as a transformative tool for cross-border finance. The latest data from Ripple Labs shows that ODL usage grew by more than 30% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter.

In terms of price, XRP prices have risen significantly, up more than 20% in the past 30 days. Analysts say that if the momentum continues, the psychological barrier of $0.80 may be tested in the short term. But the price itself is not everything – people's renewed confidence in the legitimacy of XRP opens the door to a wider range of applications and innovative use cases.

While XRP itself is not a mineable coin (unlike Bitcoin or Litecoin), investors looking to benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market often seek a diversification strategy. BlockchainCloudMining is here to help – a platform designed to make cryptocurrency mining convenient, profitable, and user-friendly for the average investor.

BlockchainCloudMining is a UK-registered platform that offers cloud-based cryptocurrency mining contracts. Instead of buying expensive mining machines or managing electricity, software, and cooling systems, users simply rent a portion of a global mining operation. These operations mine popular proof-of-work cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. The resulting profits can be withdrawn in the currency of the user's choice, including Ripple.

This structure allows XRP enthusiasts to participate in the wider crypto mining economy and benefit from daily returns – while keeping an eye on XRP's long-term potential.

For many members of the XRP community, passive income is a core strategy. Compared to day trading or constantly monitoring price fluctuations, BlockchainCloudMining offers a hands-free solution with tangible advantages:

Registered users: Sign up and get an instant $12 bonus, which can be used for free mining, earning $0.6 per day.

Daily earnings: Users receive daily payments and have the option to convert earnings directly into XRP.

Low startup costs: Contracts start as low as $100, lowering the barrier to entry for new investors.

Secure and transparent: As a UK-registered platform, BlockchainCloudMining provides regulatory oversight and user security.

No technical skills required: Users do not need to understand hash rate, mining difficulty, or cooling infrastructure – all of which is managed by the platform.



Environmental focus: BlockchainCloudMining utilizes green energy whenever possible, in line with the crypto industry's increasingly important sustainability goals.

This makes the platform an attractive option for both cryptocurrency newcomers and experienced investors looking to optimize portfolio performance.

Moreover, BlockchainCloudMining's interface makes it all seamless. The platform allows users to choose their preferred withdrawal currency, providing flexibility that matches personal investment strategies.

Market Timing: Why It Matters Now

There's a perfect storm brewing for XRP and platforms like BlockchainCloudMining. On one hand, XRP is seeing a return of institutional investors and renewed public interest. On the other hand, cloud mining is gaining traction as a convenient and reliable way to earn crypto without the need for large upfront capital or maintenance headaches.

For those who have been waiting on the sidelines for the “perfect time” to re-enter or diversify into the crypto space, this may be the perfect time. BlockchainCloudMining bridges the gap between passive income and active asset allocation. Investors no longer have to choose between mining, trading, or holding — they can combine all three strategies on one platform.

As the cryptocurrency space grows more complex, so does the need for convenient, reliable income-generating platforms. BlockchainCloudMining stands out not only for its ease of use, but also for its adaptability — allowing users to easily earn across major assets and convert profits into XRP.

As XRP recovers in utility, price, and ecosystem strength, combining it with a reliable income stream like BlockchainCloudMining is not only strategic, but also smart portfolio design.

Have Tom's Hardware readers seen any more disgustingly dusty PCs?

Dust can literally choke your PC, and a level-headed enthusiast will regularly check and clean dust filters, fans, and other parts of their systems. Though it might seem inexcusable to let dust pile up in a PC, it seems to be a pretty common occurrence. This weekend, Germany's PCGH.de highlighted some of the worst “fluffy balls of horror” (machine translation) that have been shared by its readers. If you enjoy a scare, its ~400 picture gallery might shiver your timbers.



The images over at PCGH.de come with a disclaimer of sorts. “Please note: Many of the extremely dirty computers do not belong to community members, but were simply handed over to them for troubleshooting, upgrades, or cleaning, and photographed at the time,” pleads the magazine on its readers' behalf.

As well as the horror of seeing these images, there is some dusty nostalgia to be had, as the PCGH.de user forum thread has been growing since back in 2012, when a guest poster first showed off a be quiet! CPU cooler caked with dust.

There's a lot of old PC coolers, motherboard, graphics cards and more which you might recognize from back in the day – despite their cloaking in dust. See this old Gainward graphics card, for example, or this Asus Maximum III Formula-based system that was owned by a heavy smoker, and here's a dust-caked Abit Fatality FP-IN9 SLI system, too.



In this writer's experience, laptops are even more prone to and more badly affected by dust ingress - due to users often placing them on soft furnishings and the relatively tiny cooling systems they use. However, they don't feature heavily in this PCGH.de gallery.

Last year we reported on a similarly grotty looking PC system from North Carolina. However, we couldn't blame the owner for lax housekeeping, as their Fractal Design Define C housed system was devastated by the terrible Hurricane Helene. That system was too far gone for even a capable electric duster like the Wolfbox MF100, currently 40% off at Amazon, to make a meaningful impact.

Last, but not least, it would be fun for our readers to share some of their 'fluffy balls of horror' (remember, we are talking PCs) alongside this post. Feel free to upload your latest dusty horror images here.

Sources allege a $6,500-$8,000 price tag, undercutting H20s which were $10,000-$12,000.

Following the ban of its Hopper H20 accelerations in China, Nvidia is reportedly planning on launching new Blackwell-based solutions at a lower price this year, per Reuters. With mass production anticipated by June, we can expect these solutions to be widely available in the Chinese market by Q3 or Q4. While technical details are still emerging, we can already discern some important details and specifications.

Due to stringent U.S. export policies targeting China, the Hopper family has largely been a cat-and-mouse chase between U.S. regulators and Nvidia. Even before their official debut, the flagship H100 and H200 accelerators were already subject to export bans. Nvidia introduced the H800 to circumvent these regulations, which eventually faced a similar fate in October 2023. The cut-down H20 served as Nvidia's primary AI solution for the Chinese market in the interim until its recent ban under the current administration last month, which forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in GPU supply.

Reuters reports that Nvidia's follow-up to the H20 will be based on the Blackwell architecture, more specifically, the RTX Pro 6000D. Further clarification by tipster Jukanlosreve at X, citing a report from China's GF Securities, suggests the RTX Pro 6000D will be dubbed B40 (likely a successor to the Ada Lovelace L40). Reuters classifies this as a server-class GPU which uses traditional GDDR7 memory instead of HBM, and notably avoids the use of TSMC's CoWoS packaging technology, likely signaling at its monolithic nature.

There are two possibilities based on the available data. This GPU can either be based on datacenter grade GB1XX Blackwell or consumer-grade GB2XX Blackwell silicon. The former is unlikely, as it only features HBM controllers at the silicon level. If the B40 utilizes GB2XX dies, it would be a derivative of the GB202 chip (found in the RTX 5090 and RTX Pro Blackwell 6000) and would lack NVLink support. The report estimates the price of the B40 between $6,500 and $8,000, which is less than the H20 and comparable to Nvidia's global RTX Pro 6000 workstation models.

The HGX H20 could be configured in an 8-GPU configuration, but without NVLink, the B40 would likely face challenges in multi-GPU setups. Nvidia's latest RTX Pro Blackwell servers employ up to eight RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, connected via ConnectX-8 SuperNICs with integrated PCIe 6.0 switches, for GPU-to-GPU communication. This setup is likely what we'll see for the B40, with scaling beyond eight GPUs expected to be handled by Nvidia's Spectrum-X networking platform. Since details are scarce, this is just speculation on our part, so please don't read it as gospel.

But as firms seek to monetize their AI investments, we expect AI results to lose their cleanness.

Google Search's market share fell below 90% in late 2024, happening for the first time in almost a decade. According to StatCounter, the search giant's share first dropped in the last quarter of 2024, when it hit 89.34%. The company was able to briefly recover to 90.15% in February 2025, then fell back down to 89.71% the following month and has yet to recover.

International Blockchain Consulting Group founder Mario Nawfal first shared this info on his X (formerly Twitter) account, saying, “Why dig through link farms when you can just Grok it and get straight to the point?” Elon Musk then reposted this, adding the caption, “AI will obviate search @grok”.

AI search can indeed be more convenient than sifting through website-based search results. And even though Google sometimes tries to get the best results on the front page of search engine results pages, many “SEO specialists” game the system just to get their websites on top. There's also the issue of sponsored results, which can confuse people who just want the best answer to their queries.

However, AI search isn't perfect — we've already seen several cringeworthy Google AI answers, and AI is also known to hallucinate and give out wrong answers. So, if you're going to rely on that, you cannot take its answers at face value. Instead, you must always ask it for sources so you can ascertain for yourself if the answer it returned is true or false. This might be an issue, though, if a user does not do this verification step and takes AI answers as gospel.

More importantly, nothing in this world is free. AI companies are investing billions into research and development, so they have to some way, somehow, make money from it. So, unless everyone pays for an AI subscription, AI search might eventually be filled with ads, too, to offset operational costs.

And who's to say that AI systems cannot be gamified? We've already seen 'experts' online telling people how to make content 'AI-friendly.' While we cannot blame people for offering services to website owners who want their pages to have a wider reach, would AI tech be smart enough to determine when a certain page is the best answer that a specific person is looking for?

The development of AI has been controversial, especially with the countless number of allegations and lawsuits based on the unlawful use of intellectual property. If AI search takes off and starts to replace traditional search, this will definitely be another can of worms that must be addressed, or else we risk killing the creativity that AI LLMs rely on for their training data and end up with useless results from AI searches based on AI-generated gloop.

In 1976, NASA's Viking mission successfully landed the first spacecraft on Mars. When the mission began sending images from Mars' surface back to Earth, scientists noted long, dark streaks on crater walls and cliff sides. To this day, some researchers suggest that the strange geographical features are the result of water flow—but a recent study says otherwise.

Planetary scientists from Brown University and the University of Bern have used artificial intelligence to reveal that the enigmatic Martian streaks likely result from wind and dust, not water flow. Their results have important implications for future Mars exploration, as well as humanity's continuous search for habitable environments and life beyond Earth.

Some slope streaks are long-lasting, while others—called recurring slope lineae (RSL)—are more ephemeral, continuously appearing in the same places during Mars' hottest times of the year. Although Mars is generally dry and cold (with temperatures as low as -225 degrees Fahrenheit, or -153 degrees Celsius) small amounts of water from potential ice, underground sources, or humidity could conceivably mix with enough salt to become liquid and flow down a slope. Because water is a key ingredient for life on Earth, such formations might represent habitable regions on the Red Planet, too. But some researchers aren't convinced, arguing that dry processes could have created those features instead.

To settle the matter, the researchers trained an algorithm on a dataset of confirmed slope streak sightings, as detailed in a study published Monday in the journal Nature Communications. They then used the algorithm to scan over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images and compose a map of Martian slope streaks.

“Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors,” Valentin Bickel, co-author of the study and a University of Bern Center for Space and Habitability fellow, said in a Brown University statement. “Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.”

Simply put, their results do not link slope streaks and RSLs with features indicating the presence of liquid or even frost. Instead, the researchers discovered that both slope streaks and RSLs tend to develop in areas with high wind speed and dust deposition. In other words, they are likely caused by a dry process in which dust layers abruptly slide down a slope, triggered by external forces.

Rather than seeing these results as yet another failure in our search for extraterrestrial life, the planetary scientists explain that the study still carries weight for future Mars explorations. If their research had confirmed the theory that slope streaks were caused by water, and that as a result the region might host some form of life, NASA would have actually avoided the area for the time being. That's because scientists fear that spacecraft and rovers might still harbor terrestrial life, such as microbes, which could contaminate Martian habitats and interfere with our search for Martian life.

“That's the advantage of this big data approach,” explained Adomas Valantinas, the other co-author of the study and a planetary scientist at Brown University who specializes in Martian geology. “It helps us to rule out some hypotheses from orbit before we send spacecraft to explore.”

In an industry that seems obsessed with finding water on Mars, the study stands as a reminder that not every scientific breakthrough needs to be about extraterrestrial life.

There is nothing inherently wrong with the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung's ultra-thin Android phone. By that, I mean the Edge has a stunning display, excellent performance, and nice cameras. The software experience is rich in features, and it'll get 7 years of updates. I'm not going to delve deep into many of these specs because much of it remains the same as the Galaxy S25 series, which I reviewed early this year.

But it's impossible to review this smartphone without looking at the full picture, and what the $1,100 asking price can get you these days. The S25 Edge's pitch is that it's a supremely thin and lightweight phone with a big screen—hardly the first time a company has attempted this feat. But it makes a crucial sacrifice to get there, one that I think most people will find baffling.

At 5.8 mm thick, it's 2 mm thinner than the iPhone 16 Plus and weighs 36 grams less, despite both screens sitting at 6.7 inches. Compared to Samsung's own Galaxy S25+, which shares the same screen size, the Edge is 1.5 mm thinner and 30 grams lighter. Those are some real savings, and it's hard not to feel impressed when you first pick up the phone. Such a big phone with such a light weight—it feels strange, and perhaps surprisingly, not cheap.

While I appreciate the lighter package, my fingers seem to want a little more substance to hold onto. I have large hands, so the edges of this phone feel a little too thin, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels a little more natural. One thing is for sure: If you frequently put a case on your phone for protection, the S25 Edge will feel even thinner. That's because you expect a case to make your phone feel bulky, but the few cases for the Edge I've tried oddly emphasize its thinness.

I need to point out that while 5.8 millimeters is impressively thin, Samsung isn't shattering any records here. Nearly a decade ago, Motorola made the 5.2 mm Moto Z phone. The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to be roughly 5.5 mm. Even earlier this year, I saw Tecno's 5.75 mm concept phone, which stuffed a massive 5,000-mAh battery inside.

From left to right: Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, S25 Edge, S25.

That last part is the problem with the Edge: It has a paltry 3,900-mAh battery capacity. That's the smallest of the Galaxy S25 series, 100 mAh smaller than the compact Galaxy S25. Samsung has made some smart optimizations to maximize the battery life of this small cell, but there's only so much it can do. The Galaxy S25 Edge's battery life is not good enough for a $1,100 phone.

Over the last week, I've been traveling with the Edge to cover Google I/O, and I've had to remember to charge it in the afternoon on most days. When I was away from a charger, I consciously decided to avoid using the phone so as not to drain the battery. I've often only had 4 hours of screen-on time by the end of the day before the device hits 15 percent. Mind you, with light to average use, this handset can last just about a day. Then again, if your needs are light, you hardly need to spend $1,100 to get a great phone.

In my 10 years of reviewing phones, I've frequently heard grumbles from the people around me when companies introduce thinner phones with smaller batteries. I have also heard complaints that phones are getting too big. The S25 Edge is still big—folks with smaller paws than me will still find it hard to reach the top of the screen—but the bigger size doesn't bring the benefit of a bigger battery. It begs the question, who is this for?

If you've bemoaned the same things, the clear winner for you is a folding flip phone. Devices like the Motorola Razr Ultra and the Galaxy Z Flip6 will match, if not offer slightly better battery life than the Edge, but you can fold them up and stow them in a pocket or purse even more nicely. No need to sacrifice screen size. Or just get the nice and compact Galaxy S25, which will last a smidge longer than the Edge.

Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 Edge as a phone for power users who want many of the capabilities of the Galaxy S25 Ultra without the massive screen and weight. But the Edge has more compromises than just having the worst battery life: it charges more slowly, there's no S Pen stylus, and there's no telephoto zoom camera. It does have a few perks over the cheaper S25 and S25+, though, such as the ability to capture 4K video at 120 frames per second.

The results from the 200-MP primary camera and 12-MP ultrawide cameras are sharp and colorful. You won't find too much to complain about. However, I kept trying to zoom in on a lot of shots, and while the 2x digital zoom has decent quality, things deteriorate quite quickly at further zoom options. It's rare to find a $1,000+ smartphone today without a 3x or 5x optical zoom camera, and it's sorely missed here.

I can't imagine many smartphone shutterbugs being happy with this (I'm not). It's not just about taking pretty photos! You'll have a worse time trying to get a nice shot of your kid on a soccer pitch or receiving their diploma due to the missing zoom lens.

More annoying is the fact that this phone rocks a lot on a table due to the camera bump. You might say it's the same with most phones these days (except Google Pixel phones, where the long camera bar keeps it stable), but even with a case, the Edge won't stop rocking because case-makers want to maintain as much of that thinness as possible.

My other concern was thermal performance, but this didn't turn out to be a big deal. A smaller phone means you likely won't have the same kind of cooling, right? Well, Samsung says the vapor chamber that dissipates heat is thinner but broader, and after an hour in Zenless Zone Zero, I didn't notice any abnormal thermal throttling on the phone. (My benchmark scores also turned out higher than the S25 Ultra.)

It boils down to what you're looking for in a phone, and I recommend heading to a retail store near you to get a feel for the Edge before making a decision. You might find the extra few millimeters of the Ultra or S25+ are manageable if it means a day and a half of battery life. Not to mention, you can find the Galaxy S25 Ultra on sale these days for as little as $1,050, cheaper than the Edge.

The lackluster runtime may not worry you if you spend 99 percent of your day near an outlet. In my eyes, we shouldn't accept a phone with this kind of battery life today. Make a thin phone with a big battery. Or do something interesting, like a phone with a wooden back. Or bring back the 10x optical zoom camera from older Samsung phones. The Edge just doesn't live up to the hype.

Sure you can pressure people to transfer money from banks to you.  But that will be easier to trace and the transactions could just be reversed.  If moving all your wealth the bank is likely to ask some questions, maybe want to see you in person.With crypto the philosophy is “be your own bank”.  It's like keeping your money under the mattress.  So you are a much more promising target.

Keep. Your. Mouth. Shut.Pseudo-anonymity, with the emphasis on the pseudo part, is only as good as you. If you truly believe in Bitcoin and all that implies, it really is in your best interest to be quiet and keep it to yourself, and this knife cuts in more ways than you might expect. You don't have layers of security like at a traditional bank. You are the weakest link wrt private keys and storage.Also, even talking about it amongst folks you think are your friends, like fellow Bitcoin users, isn't wise either. Hypothetically, if you became exceedingly wealthy on paper, it would be in the interest of others to take you out of the equation so you can't cash out. If that means a five dollar (or whatever they cost these days) wrench to the head so you stop moving… now that value is locked up in the blockchain! Could this happen to any given bitcoin users with just a few satoshi or whatnot? Very unlikely, but don't forget that a decade and a half ago, a handful of bitcoins could cost you very little money. Now it has gone up exponentially in value and would make you a big fat target.There are those on /r/bitcoin that think a wrench won't ever break their wills and spirits. That math is invincible. Don't think they've ever been on the wrong side of one before. Math might be bulletproof, but wetware is very fragile.

The interesting thing to me about this is watching how we've changed over the past 40 years. As a kid, it was impressed up on kids to not talk to strangers. You don't tell people where you live. You don't tell people anything more than necessary. Now, people share the most intimate details of their daily lives. People share/invite random strangers to their accounts without any concerns about who they are or what they might do. People just do not think about how the most benign of posts can be used for nefarious purposes by someone else. So we've gone from share nothing to over sharing everything.

During covid some SWEs had pretty sweet gigs due to lowered expectations and a rush on talent. And what do a small fraction of SWEs do? Make “life in the day of” videos that glamorize how cushy and easy-going it is, painting the whole group of SWEs as spoiled and entitled who make too much money. Point is they could've just realized they had it good and kept quiet.But, no, they had to hustle for internet points, even risking their job inadvertently. It's unbelievable to me how fast we flipped from the internet being an accessory to life to it being a surrogate for actual social interaction.

And I think it all boils down to the fact that some humans need to make noise about their successes so they feel validated. Much like the cryptocurrency evangelists, they probably can't help themselves because they want to ensure they defend “the mission” even if it comes at great personal cost in the long run.


reply



It's worth worrying about in the general case, too. There are subtler and much more noxious failure modes here than merely getting beaned with a Swedish nut rounder.

Everything you do to keep keys safe from some risks weakens your posture against other risks. Making sure most people don't know about your holdings is nice and all, but ultimately key management is a really hard problem. It's hard enough for companies, but I'd argue it's even worse for individuals.

Of course it would be easy to say one's never touched crypto, and not so easy to prove, as with any negative. I don't care. If I ever get bounced with a King Dick, it'll far more likely be because I said something someone didn't like - which seems to happen about as often as I open my mouth, these days. Or because I said something someone failed to comprehend and so took insult at. Brains are severely out of fashion this decade, and I can't seem to help having some, so presumably someone will seek to scatter them sooner or later. Why not? I hear it's the last argument of kings, and their time too seems coming 'round again.In any case they better not let me hear them coming. Wiser to spin the block in a car, really. I've never been hit with a wrench before, but it did once take more than a hammer to get me off my feet.

The paper *"Investigating Wrench Attacks: Physical Attacks Targeting Cryptocurrency Users"* presents the first comprehensive study on wrench attacks—real-world physical attacks used to coerce cryptocurrency users into handing over their digital assets.###  Summary of the Paper:#### *Definition & Origin** The term "\$5 wrench attack” originates from a webcomic and refers to using physical coercion (like a wrench) instead of complex hacking to obtain information such as crypto keys.
* The paper defines wrench attacks as *intentional physical attacks to unlawfully obtain cryptocurrencies* via coercion or violence, combining crimes against both persons and property.#### *Methodology** *Data triangulation* from:  * 10 **interviews** with victims and experts
  * 146 **news articles**
  * 37 **online forums** (672 posts analyzed)
* *Crime script analysis* was used to map how such attacks are prepared, executed, and concluded.#### *Key Findings** Attackers range from *organized crime groups* to *friends, family*, and *even corrupt law enforcement*.
* Victims are often *public figures, early adopters*, or participants in *peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transactions*.
* Attacks include *robbery, kidnapping, murder, blackmail*, and a new category: *cryptocurrency-facilitated domestic economic abuse*.
* *No user is immune*, including security-savvy individuals.
* Attacks have *increased over time*, especially during market booms (e.g., 2017, 2021).
* Victims often *do not report attacks*, fearing revictimization or police inaction.#### *Security Insights** Most victims had *used centralized exchanges* and undergone *KYC* processes, potentially exposing their identity and holdings.
* Wrench attacks *bypass digital security*—no software or hardware defense can prevent coercion under threat.
* Victim behaviors (e.g., displaying crypto apps in public, sharing wealth) can unintentionally increase risk.#### *Recommendations** *For Users:*  * Keep a **low profile** about crypto holdings.
  * Use **multi-signature wallets**, **distributed fund storage**, and **plausible deniability mechanisms**.
  * Exercise caution during **P2P transactions** and avoid carrying large amounts of crypto assets.

* *For Industry & Regulators:*  * **Reevaluate KYC policies**—data leaks can serve as “shopping lists” for attackers.
  * Implement **transaction delays** or **alerts** for large withdrawals to thwart coercion.
  * Improve **wallet UI/UX** to prevent exposing sensitive information (e.g., display balance).

#### *Contributions** Introduces the first *formal legal definition* of wrench attacks.
* Identifies *seven forms* of wrench attacks.
* Provides *actionable policy and design recommendations* for reducing risk.---This research highlights the *growing intersection of physical crime and digital assets*, calling for urgent changes in user behavior, system design, and policy to mitigate this underreported but increasingly relevant threat.

To torture the metaphor a bit, crypto is more like an iPhone competitor which markets itself around the supposed benefits of not having anti-theft features like factory reset protection. If you go out of your way to refuse already existing safeguards against your stuff being stolen then you don't really get to be surprised when thieves single you out as an easy mark.

Although the crypto might be relevant being attacked is something that any asset owner has to worry about (even for assets like houses, oddly enough - I suspect big mansions would be something of a thief draw). The attacks are unintended consequences of wealth as opposed to any specific property of crypto - having an equal amount of cash on hand isn't safe either.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

On a quiet pandemic afternoon in 2021, Zhiyuan Wang, then a graduate student at Rice University, was alleviating his boredom by working on a weird mathematical problem. After he found an exotic solution, he started to wonder if the math could be interpreted physically. Eventually, he realized that it seemed to describe a new type of particle: one that's neither a matter particle nor a force-carrying particle. It appeared to be something else altogether.

Wang was eager to develop the accidental discovery into a full theory of this third kind of particle. He brought the idea to Kaden Hazzard, his academic adviser.

“I said, I'm not sure I believe this can be true,” Hazzard recalled, “but if you really think it is, you should put all your time on this and drop everything else you're working on.”

This January, Wang, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany, and Hazzard published their refined result in the journal Nature. They say that a third class of particles, called paraparticles, can indeed exist, and that these particles could produce strange new materials.

When the paper appeared, Markus Müller, a physicist at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna, was already contending with the notion of paraparticles for a different reason. According to quantum mechanics, an object or observer can be in multiple locations at once. Müller was thinking about how you can, on paper, switch between the perspectives of observers in these coexisting “branches” of reality. He realized that this came with new constraints on the possibility of paraparticles, and his team described their results in a preprint in February that's now under review for publication in a journal.

The close timing of the two papers was a coincidence. But taken together, the work is reopening the case of a physics mystery that was believed to be solved decades ago. A basic question is being reevaluated: What kinds of particles does our world allow?

All known elementary particles fall into one of two categories, and the two behave almost as opposites. There are the particles that make up matter, called fermions, and the particles that impart the fundamental forces, called bosons.

The defining characteristic of fermions is that if you switch the positions of two fermions, their quantum state gains a minus sign. The presence of that measly minus sign has enormous ramifications. It means that no two fermions can be in the same place at the same time. When packed together, fermions cannot be compressed past a certain point. This feature prevents matter from collapsing in on itself—it's why the electrons in every atom exist in “shells.” Without this minus sign, we couldn't exist.

Zhiyuan Wang, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany.

Bosons have no such restriction. Groups of bosons will happily all do exactly the same thing. Any number of particles of light, for instance, can be in the same place. This is what makes it possible to build lasers, which emit many identical light particles. This ability comes down to the fact that when two bosons swap places, their quantum state stays the same.

It's not obvious that fermions and bosons should be the only two options.

That's in part due to a fundamental feature of quantum theory: To calculate the probability of measuring a particle in any particular state, you have to take the mathematical description of that state and multiply it by itself. This procedure can erase distinctions. A minus sign, for example, will disappear. If given the number 4, a Jeopardy! contestant would have no way to know if the question was “What is 2 squared?” or “What is negative 2 squared?”—both possibilities are mathematically valid.

It's because of this feature that fermions, despite gaining a minus sign when swapped around, all look the same when measured—the minus sign disappears when quantum states are squared. This indistinguishability is a crucial property of elementary particles; no experiment can tell two of a kind apart.

The Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated his “exclusion principle” in 1925, when he was 25 years old. It says that two indistinguishable fermions can never have identical quantum states.

But a minus sign may not be the only thing that disappears. In theory, quantum particles can also have hidden internal states, mathematical structures not seen in direct measurements, which also go away when squared. A third, more general category of particle, known as a paraparticle, could arise from this internal state changing in a myriad of ways while the particles swap places.

While quantum theory seems to allow it, physicists have had difficulty finding a mathematical description of a paraparticle that works. In the 1950s, the physicist Herbert Green made a few attempts, but further inspection revealed that these paraparticle models were really just mathematical combinations of typical bosons and fermions.

In the 1970s, the mystery of why no one could find a proper model of paraparticles seemed to be solved. A collection of theorems called DHR theory, after the mathematical physicists Sergio Doplicher, Rudolf Haag, and John Roberts, proved that if certain assumptions are true, only bosons and fermions are physically possible. One assumption is “locality,” the rule that objects can only be affected by things in their vicinity. (“If I poke my table, I better not affect the moon instantaneously,” as Hazzard put it.) The DHR proof also assumed that space is (at least) three-dimensional.

The results discouraged new ventures into paraparticles for decades, with one exception. In the early 1980s, the physicist Frank Wilczek came up with a theory of particles called anyons that can't be described as either bosons or fermions. To get around the DHR theorems, anyons come with a big catch: They can only exist in two dimensions.

Physicists now widely study anyons for their potential in quantum computing. Even confined to two dimensions, they could manifest on a flat surface of a material, or in a 2D array of qubits in a quantum computer.

But paraparticles in three dimensions that could form a solid still seemed impossible. That is, until now.

While developing their model, Wang and Hazzard noticed that the assumptions behind DHR theory went beyond typical concerns of locality. “I think people overinterpreted what limitations or constraints were actually imposed by these theorems,” Hazzard said. Paraparticles, they realized, may be theoretically possible after all.

In their model, in addition to the usual properties of a particle like charge and spin, groups of paraparticles share extra hidden properties. As with the minus sign that gets squared away during a measurement, you can't directly measure these hidden properties, but they change how the particles behave.

Kaden Hazzard, a physicist at Rice University.

When you swap two paraparticles, these hidden properties change in tandem. As an analogy, imagine that these properties are colors. Start with two paraparticles, one that's internally red and another that's internally blue. When they swap places, rather than keeping these colors, they both change in corresponding ways, as prescribed by the mathematics of the particular model. Perhaps the swap leaves them green and yellow. This quickly turns into a complex game, where paraparticles affect each other in unseen ways as they move around.

Meanwhile, Müller was also busy rethinking the DHR theorems. “It's not always super transparent what they mean, because it's in a very complicated mathematical framework,” he said.

His team took a new approach to the paraparticle question. The researchers considered the fact that quantum systems can exist in multiple possible states at once—what's called a superposition. They imagined switching between the perspectives of observers who exist in these superposed states, each of whom describes their branch of reality slightly differently. If two particles are truly indistinguishable, they figured, then it won't matter if the particles are swapped in one branch of the superposition and not in the other.

“Maybe if the particles are close by, I swap them, but if they are far away I do nothing,” Müller said. “And if they're in a superposition of both, then I do the swapping in one branch, and nothing in the other branch.” Whether observers across branches label the two particles in the same way should make no difference.

This stricter definition of indistinguishability in the context of superpositions imposes new restrictions on the kinds of particles that can exist. When these assumptions hold, the researchers found that paraparticles are impossible. For a particle to be truly indistinguishable by measurement, as physicists expect elementary particles to be, it must be either a boson or fermion.

Although Wang and Hazzard published their paper first, it's as though they saw Müller's constraints coming. Their paraparticles are possible because their model rejects Müller's starting assumption: The particles are not indistinguishable in the full sense required in the context of quantum superpositions. This comes with a consequence. While swapping two paraparticles has no effect on one person's measurements, two observers, by sharing their data with each other, can determine whether the paraparticles have been swapped. That's because swapping paraparticles can change how two people's measurements relate to each other. In this sense, they could tell the two paraparticles apart.

This means there's a potential for new states of matter. Where bosons can pack an endless number of particles into the same state, and fermions can't share a state at all, paraparticles end up somewhere in the middle. They are able to pack just a few particles into the same state, before getting crowded and forcing others into new states. Exactly how many can be crammed together depends on the details of the paraparticle—the theoretical framework allows for endless options.

“I find their paper really fascinating, and there's absolutely no contradiction with what we do,” Müller said.

If paraparticles exist, they'll most likely be emergent particles, called quasiparticles, that show up as energetic vibrations in certain quantum materials.

“We might get new models of exotic phases, which were difficult to understand before, that you can now solve easily using paraparticles,” said Meng Cheng, a physicist at Yale University who was not involved in the research.

Bryce Gadway, an experimental physicist at Pennsylvania State University who sometimes collaborates with Hazzard, is optimistic that paraparticles will be realized in the lab in the next few years. These experiments would use Rydberg atoms, which are energized atoms with electrons that roam very far from their nuclei. This separation of the positive and negative charge makes Rydberg atoms especially sensitive to electric fields. You can build quantum computers out of interacting Rydberg atoms. They are also the perfect candidates for creating paraparticles.

“For a certain kind of Rydberg quantum simulator, this is kind of just what they would do naturally,” Gadway said about creating paraparticles. “You just prepare them and watch them evolve.”

But for now, the third kingdom of particles remains wholly theoretical.

“Paraparticles might become important,” said Wilczek, the Nobel Prize–winning physicist and inventor of anyons. “But at present they're basically a theoretical curiosity.”

Vikings were formidable Scandinavian warriors and sailors who, from around 800 to 1050 CE, raided, traded, and settled throughout northern Europe, Iceland, Greenland, and even as far as North America. Most of what scholars know about Viking maritime networks, however, has to do with their start and end points. After all, they could have taken any number of routes in between. To shed light on this gap, an archaeologist decided to follow in the Vikings' footsteps—or, more accurately, their wake.

In order to reconstruct their seafaring itineraries, Lund University archaeologist Greer Jarrett sailed functional Viking-like boats along the Norwegian coast in a series of experimental voyages. By experiencing these journeys firsthand, the archaeologist hoped to understand where it would have made most sense for Viking sailors to seek shelter along the way to their destination. In this way, he identified four natural harbors that could have served as pitstops hundreds of years ago.

“A lot of the time, we only know about the starting and ending points of the trade that took place during the Viking Age. Major ports, such as Bergen and Trondheim in Norway, Ribe in Denmark, and Dublin in Ireland. The thing I am interested in is what happened on the journeys between these major trading centres,” Jarrett explained in a statement. “My hypothesis is that this decentralised network of ports, located on small islands and peninsulas, was central to making trade efficient during the Viking Age.”

Between September 2021 and July 2022, Jarrett and his crew undertook 15 sailing trials and two approximately three-week-long trial voyages in seven different Nordic clinker boats: traditional, small, open, wooden sailboats whose use in Nordic regions dates back almost 2,000 years. It wasn't always smooth sailing—once, the pole supporting the mainsail snapped over 15 miles (25 kilometers) from the coast, and they had to tie two oars together to secure the sail until they managed to return to land. Overall, they covered 1,494 nautical miles.

The experimental archaeologist decided that possible “havens” along maritime itineraries should have provided fresh water, shelter from swells and winds, and a good view of the sea. Furthermore, they had to be reachable in low visibility, big enough to host several boats, approachable and exitable from different directions, and located in a “transition zone”: coastal points between exposed regions and inner areas.

Along with these criteria, Jarrett's investigation integrated a digital reconstruction of Viking Age sea levels, pre-established knowledge of large Viking maritime centers, and information about traditional 19th and early 20th century sailboat routes from sailors and fishermen. The archaeologist also clarified that his work regards long-range Viking expeditions rather than voyages for raiding and war purposes.

“This study's emphasis on practical seafaring knowledge and experience seeks to counter the common academic bias towards terrestrial and textual sources and worldviews,” he wrote in the study, published earlier this month in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory.

In this way he claims to have identified four potential Viking havens. These remote locations along the Norwegian coast each have varying degrees of pre-existing archaeological evidence indicating past human presence. Presumably, Jarrett is the first to suggest they may have also been pit stops along Viking maritime journeys.

“The list of possible Viking Age havens,” he explained, indicating a diagram in the study, “is intended as a working document, which can shape and be shaped by future archaeological surveys and excavations.”

It's worth remembering that, even with digital reconstructions of the Viking-era seascape, experimental voyages can never provide evidence of Viking activity to the degree of direct archaeological evidence. Nevertheless, creative and practical approaches such as Jarrett's stand as a reminder that sometimes the solution to a problem requires a different perspective—literally. It remains to be seen whether his work will inspire future archaeological surveys.

Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli refuses to answer when asked about Antonio Conte's return, confirming only they are ‘very happy' with Igor Tudor's work, while intense talks are in progress for the Club World Cup squad.

The trip to Venezia kicks off at the Stadio Penzo at 19.45 UK time (18.45 GMT, 20.45 CET).

You can follow all the build-up and action as it happens from today's six Serie A games on the Liveblog.

The Bianconeri have the upper hand in the fight for fourth place, so will this evening's result ultimately decide how their entire season is judged?

“Outside judgment is always of interest, but we still have clear ideas,” Giuntoli told DAZN.

“We rebooted, knew it would be a complicated campaign by cutting the average age of the team, lowering the salary bill and making many changes. Unfortunately, there was also a remarkable number of injuries, which made it much tougher.

“Being here this evening, we still have it in our hands to qualify for the Champions League despite it all, which would be an extraordinary result. We know that it is a complicated game, but we have clear ideas, feel the squad has a great future ahead of it and with a few additions can be competitive very soon.”

Juventus already confirmed that Tudor will remain at the helm for the Club World Cup in the USA this June and July, but if they qualify for the Champions League, will that mean he stays on the bench for next season too?

“As we said when we presented him, we will evaluate at the end of the season. We are very happy with his work and the impact he had on the team. It is a decision we will make later, but we are very, very happy with his work.”

Sky Sport Italia report today that Conte is leaving Napoli after winning the Scudetto, so could his next destination be a return to Juventus?

“I will just congratulate Napoli for having a great season and that is all,” replied Giuntoli.

The Club World Cup poses a problem for the clubs who have a lot of players on loan, like Juventus, because it runs from mid-June to mid-July, so contracts will expire halfway through.

Giuntoli confirmed he is working hard to bolster the squad with some figures returning and others kept on for a little bit longer.

“Considering the emergency situation, we are thinking of bringing Kostic and Rugani to the Club World Cup, so are discussing it with Fenerbahce and Ajax. We are very advanced in talks with Porto for Francisco Conceicao, also talking to Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea for Kolo Muani and Veiga.

“Seeing as we have so few players at our disposal, we want to keep them for that tournament.”

Gleison Bremer has resumed training after his knee ligament surgery, so will he be at the Club World Cup for Juventus?

“He is doing well, he will train with us, but I don't think he will play.”

It's official—the U.S. government will expedite visa processing for those attending the 2026 World Cup

World Cup is just around the corner, and as you well know, the FIFA World Cup 2026 will take place in our country, and of course, the state's efforts to ensure that supporters from each country can enter the country during the sporting event are titanic.

For that, Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained before the Homeland Security Subcommittee that double shifts and new technologies will be implemented in key embassies. The reason? To guarantee visas for everyone, according to them, their priority is that no one misses this event due to a possible bureaucratic delay.

The context is unprecedented: they hosted the 2024 Copa América and the 2025 FIFA World Cup. Now, with the 2028 Olympic Games on the calendar, the country faces a logistical challenge like never before.

But… meanwhile, the Trump administration is tightening its immigration policies, which makes the visa process more closely monitored than ever (and also more cynical than ever). Even so, the message the U.S. wants to show the world is that it wants to open its doors to the world… as long as the paperwork is in order.

The soccer fever is already starting to be felt in the United States. And with it, a wave of visa applications from every corner of the planet. The government, aware of this, has decided to act before collapse hits.

Rubio explained that double shifts will be implemented in many embassies to reduce wait times. He pointed to the case of Colombia as an example, where, without these measures, many applicants wouldn't arrive in time for the World Cup.

In addition, reinforcement will be prioritized in countries with high ticket demand to avoid the chaos seen in other editions where hundreds of fans were unable to travel.

One of the most striking announcements is the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the processing of renewals. This tool will allow repetitive tasks to be automated and free up human resources for new applications, shortening deadlines without compromising security.

No, the 1994 World Cup was already hosted here, in which, by the way, attendance records were broken and national interest in the sport was sparked. And yes, of course we remember how Roberto Baggio missed the decisive penalty that gave victory to Brazil, earning their fourth star on the jersey.

Now, with a more robust infrastructure and the experience of having hosted other global events, the country is preparing for the biggest World Cup in history: more teams, more venues, more matches… and millions of people trying to cross its borders.

President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino agree on one thing: the image of the country is at stake. A disorganized World Cup or one full of bureaucratic hurdles would be a disaster. That's why legal and controlled access is now a matter of state.

Not everything is celebration. While channels are being opened to facilitate sports tourism, the same Trump government maintains its pressure on irregular immigration. This means that the filter to enter will be more exhaustive than ever, and the processes will be under stricter control.

The United States has sent a clear message to the world: come to the World Cup, but prepare ahead of time. With reinforcement in embassies and the use of AI, everything points to faster procedures. But also more rigorous ones.

So if you want to be there, screaming your team's goal live and in person and not from the couch, the first thing you need to do is move now. Because this time, the World Cup starts at the embassy.

Real Madrid are now fully focused on the FIFA Club World Cup after signing off on the 2024/25 La Liga season.

Huge changes will take place in the coming weeks, as Carlo Ancelotti departs to take charge of the Brazil national team, and Xabi Alnoso steps in as his replacement.

Alonso has agreed a three-year deal back in Madrid to lead the team until the end of the 2027/28 campaign.

His first test comes via the Club World Cup in the USA as Los Blancos look to bounce back from a poor final season under Ancelotti.

Barcelona stormed away to clinch a La Liga, Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup treble with Ancelotti's charges dumped out by Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals.

Jude Bellingham has called on Real Madrid to rescue a 'weak' season at the Club World Cup and Alonso will name a strong travelling squad.

The huge financial bonuses offer - allied with the chance to seal a much-needed instant trophy for Alonso - means Real Madrid will want to hit the ground running.

Bellingham's shoulder surgery has been delayed, to allow him to feature, but Fede Valeverde faces a race to be ready in time.

Valverde completed 90 minutes, as Real Madrid sealed a La Liga campaign finale win over Real Sociedad, but a back issue was immediately flagged up for the 26-year-old.

An official statement confirmed the issue for the Uruguay international with a return date unclear at this stage.

"After tests carried on Fede Valverde by the Real Madrid medical services, he has been diagnosed with lumbosciatalgia. Pending evolution."



Real Madrid will utilise the incoming break to rest their vital No.8 ahead of their flight to the USA at the start of June with indications hinting at a two-week absence.

The tournament kicks off on June 14, but Real Madrid's first game is not until June 18, against Al Hilal in Miami.

Alonso will be hopeful that window gives Valverde sufficient time to recover but he is expected to be excused from international duty with Uruguay.

Marcelo Bielsa's team are closing in on qualification for the 2026 World Cup ahead of CONMEBOL clashes with Paraguay on June 5 and Venezuela on June 10.

 play videoAsamoah Gyan got past Per Mertesacker to put Ghana 2-1 ahead

FIFA have paid glowing tribute to one of the most unforgettable matches in recent World Cup history, Ghana's pulsating 2-2 draw with eventual champions Germany at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

More than a decade later, the clash at Estadio Castelao still resonates as a shining example of drama, quality, and fearless football from the African giants.

In a special throwback feature shared across their official platforms, FIFA hailed the Black Stars for their bold, high-energy display against one of the tournament's heavyweights.

Ghana not only matched Germany stride for stride in Fortaleza's scorching heat, they went toe-to-toe and came within minutes of a famous victory.

The match saw Germany take a 51st-minute lead through Mario Götze, whose awkward header-knee combination just beat goalkeeper Fatau Dauda.

But Ghana responded with ferocious intensity. Just three minutes later, Andre Ayew soared to meet Harrison Afful's pinpoint cross, heading home to send the crowd into raptures.

Nine minutes after that, Asamoah Gyan capitalized on a rare Philipp Lahm error, latching onto a brilliant Sulley Muntari through ball to fire the Black Stars into a 2-1 lead.

Gyan's goal not only gave Ghana the lead but also brought him level with Cameroonian legend Roger Milla as the joint-top African scorer at the World Cup with five goals, a record Gyan would surpass in the next group match against Portugal, making him the continent's all-time leading scorer in the tournament to this day.

But Germany, brimming with talent and led by Joachim Löw, weren't finished. The introduction of veteran Miroslav Klose changed the tide.

With his very first touch, Klose poked home from close range following a flick-on from Benedikt Höwedes in the 71st minute, a goal that made him joint top-scorer in World Cup history alongside Brazil's Ronaldo with 15 goals.

Klose will eventually score against Ronaldo's Brazil in their 7-1 loss against Germany in the semi-finals, to become the leading scorer of the World Cup

The remainder of the match was a fierce end-to-end battle. Toni Kroos and Thomas Müller threatened for Germany, but Ghana held firm. Christian Atsu and Gyan came close to snatching a winner as the Black Stars refused to back down.

The final whistle was met with exhaustion, applause, and respect, neither side deserved to lose, and the football world recognised that something special had unfolded.

There are four Inter Milan players in the Italy squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers, whilst Francesco Acerbi will be in on one condition.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews.

The club season is only just coming to an end.

It has been a dramatic conclusion which saw Inter Milan miss out to the Serie A title to Napoli on the final day of the season.

Meanwhile, the Nerazzurri will face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final next Saturday.

Then, next month, Inter will play in the expanded Club World Cup in the United States. They will be one of two teams representing Serie A in the competition along with Juventus.

However, there is also time for another international break right after the Champions League final.

There will be four players from the Inter Milan squad who shift gears to the national team immediately after the Champions League final.

The Corriere confirm that Italy coach Luciano Spalletti has called up Alessandro Bastoni, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella, and Davide Frattesi.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma will also be in the Azzurri setup.

Then, there is the possibility of a fifth Nerazzurri player being part of the Italy camp.

The Corriere report that Francesco Acerbi is the first name in reserve in defense.

Aside from Bastoni, Spalletti has called up Arsenal's Riccardo Calafiori, Napoli's Alessandro Buongiorno, and Fiorentina's Pietro Comuzzo.

Therefore, if any of those pull out, then Francesco Acerbi will be in the Italy squad.

BAYERN MUNICH have frustrated members of staff with their plans to send the players' Wags to the Club World Cup, according to reports.

The German giants are set to head to the US for the controversially revamped tournament next month.

Harry Kane will head to the States hoping to add further silverware to his collection, having broken his duck by winning the Bundesliga title.

According to Bild, the trip has caused friction behind the scenes at the German champions.

Bayern's Club World Cup campaign will come amid a series of cost-cutting measures.

Several staff members have reportedly been informed that they won't join the team at the tournament.

Despite sporting director Max Eberl's efforts to reduce costs, players families' will be sent to the US at the expense of the club.

This means that Kane's wife Katie Goodland can be sent to the States at Bayern's expense, despite her husband being one of the club's top earners.



Bild's Bayern expert Christian Falk revealed: "The players' families have been invited."

On the German outlet's podcast, Falk went on to add: "You have to say, a few employees were annoyed.

"They're cutting costs everywhere, so only a small group of employees is allowed to go over, but the families are."

The staff members thought to be affected include lower level roles like middle management and matchday stewards.

Bayern boss Vincent Kompany is looking forward to the competition, which could net the winners a £100million prize kitty.

The Belgian said: "I think the closer we get to the tournament, the more you can see the excitement growing. 

"It's been quite a special season anyway so far. You have the new format of the Champions League, and you have the next competition with the Club World Cup.

"You know, I think we're part of a club here with Bayern Munich where every trophy is important, so by the time we get to America, it will be a priority."

Bayern will begin their Club World Cup campaign by facing New Zealand side Auckland City in Cincinnati on June 15, before a trip to Miami to take on iconic Argentine outfit Boca Juniors five days later.

Bayern face Benfica on matchday three in Charlotte on June 24.

Ahead of the tournament, Kane said: "It's going to be unique, playing this type of major tournament with your club is different to what's been done in the past but I think it's going to be a great experience.

"Going out to the US, as well, a year before the World Cup itself will be a great chance to get to know some of the stadiums and get to know the fans out there.



"It's going to be a really great tournament.

"As always, when it's the first of any type of tournament, people are wondering how it's going to go but I'm really excited for it."

The Gunners stunned the Catalans in Saturday's final, with Stina Blackstenius' goal securing a 1-0 win and a first European title since 2007

When Arsenal won the Women's Champions League for the first time in 2007, back when it was still known as the UEFA Women's Cup, they were underdogs. Facing Umea, described by former Gunner Karen Carney as "the Galacticos of women's football" at that time, Vic Akers' side needed to stop Marta, the sport's greatest of all time, in order to taste success, all while they were without their own biggest star, Kelly Smith, who was suspended. On Saturday, when they won the competition for the first time since that triumph 18 years ago, they had to do it against the odds again.

The situations were very different, of course. In 2007, Arsenal were the dominant force at home and the European triumph they would enjoy was part of a quadruple, the first - and still only - completed by an English side. So while they were not the favourites to come out on top in the final against Umea, and it was a remarkable achievement that they did so, it was not a shock for the ages.

Saturday wasn't that, either - but it was almost the opposite situation. Arsenal haven't won a Women's Super League title for six years now, with their only trophies in the time since coming in the form of two League Cups, and yet they had reached a European final. In it, they were again underdogs, coming up against a Barcelona side that had won the last two Champions League titles and reached the final in six of the last seven seasons. And yet, once more, they upset the odds to claim a second continental crown.

What does it mean for Arsenal moving forward? The Gunners continue to live in the shadow of Chelsea in the domestic game, with the Blues winning a treble this season and not losing a single game in the WSL, but could this triumph act as something of a springboard as they look to challenge their London rivals more consistently?

And what does it mean for Barcelona? Is this simply a case of not being able to win them all? After all, they could still secure a domestic treble themselves, with two trophies already in the bag. Or should the club be concerned by some of the underwhelming performances that have cropped up in Pere Romeu's first season in charge?

As FIFA prepares to introduce a 48-team format for the 2026 World Cup, discussions have emerged about an even larger expansion for the tournament's centennial edition in 2030. The proposal would allow 64 nations to compete, marking a significant step in the tournament's evolution.

In an interview with Argentine journalist Andrés Cantor, Infantino was candid about the idea, emphasizing that while it poses challenges, it isn't entirely off the table.

“Right now, we're organizing the first World Cup with 48 teams, which is already a big challenge. After that, we'll see what happens,” Infantino said with a chuckle, as Cantor playfully urged him not to entertain CONMEBOL's suggestion too seriously.

Infantino went on to explain his broader vision for inclusivity in the World Cup. “If it were up to me as FIFA President, I'd organize a World Cup with 200 or 211 countries—let everyone in the world play in it,” he joked before clarifying, “But the World Cup is for the best teams, and they have to qualify, of course”.

The proposal originated from CONMEBOL President Alejandro Domínguez, who advocated for the expansion, emphasizing the symbolic significance of the 2030 World Cup as a global celebration.

“I want us to use all our creativity to ensure the entire world is part of this festival—the biggest and most popular event on planet Earth, the 2030 World Cup. No one should be left out of this celebration,” Domínguez said.

The 2030 World Cup will be the first in history to span three continents. While Spain, Portugal, and Morocco will host the majority of matches, South America will play a special role with Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay each hosting one match to commemorate the tournament's centenary.

The push for 64 teams aims to increase South America's presence in the tournament, allowing Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to host their group-stage matches on home soil. While such an expansion presents logistical challenges, FIFA has not ruled out the possibility of implementing CONMEBOL's ambitious proposal.

PARIS (AP) — Lorenzo Musetti and Aryna Sabalenka eased into the second round of the French Open without dropping a set on Sunday's opening day.The eighth-seeded Musetti won 7-5, 6-2, 6-0 against qualifier Yannick Hanfmann of Germany, after the top-ranked Sabalenka earlier beat Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-0.

Musetti has been in strong form on clay, reaching at least the semifinals in the past three Masters tournaments at Rome, Madrid and Monte Carlo, where he lost in the final to four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz. But he was hampered by a right-leg injury in that match.Musetti did not look troubled on Sunday, however, and cupped his ear to the crowd after making an improbable forehand winner down the line from Hanfmann's drop shot during the third set.After winning his match, Musetti got a huge ovation from the crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier.Was it because Musetti won Italy's first Olympic tennis medal in 100 years with the men's singles bronze at the Paris Games last year? Or perhaps because, as a 19-year-old, Musetti was once up by two sets against Novak Djokovic in the fourth round before losing a five-set thriller in 2021. Unlikely.

The Czech pair are highly motivated to compete at Roland Garros after their first ATP Tour triumph in Morocco.ByFlorian HeerPublished May 25, 2025 copy_link

Published May 25, 2025

Despite receiving little media attention, Petr Nouza and Patrik Rikl quietly emerged last season as one of the most consistent and successful doubles teams on the ATP Challenger Tour. While many tennis fans may not have taken notice of them yet, the Czech duo steadily collected titles and climbed the rankings with remarkable consistency.It was only at the beginning of 2024 that the two 26-year-olds from Prague officially joined forces—but their impact was immediate. In their very first tournament together, they lifted the trophy on hard court in Nottingham, Great Britain. It was the perfect debut, and it didn't stop there: titles followed in Tenerife (also on hard court) and then on clay in San Marino, Sevilla and Bad Waltersdorf.Breakthrough on the ATP TourIn April this year, Nouza and Rikl made another major leap forward by winning their first ATP Tour title at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech. The success not only added another trophy to their cabinet but also propelled both into the highest rankings of their careers. Patrik Rikl holds a career-high of World No. 65 in the ATP Doubles Rankings, while Petr Nouza, who captured six Challenger titles in 2023 with different partners and broke into the Top 100 for the first time, sits just a few places behind at No. 69.

So, what's the secret behind their success?“I don't know if there's a secret to winning,” Rikl says. “The most important thing is that we're friends, not just on court, but off it, too. That's key in doubles. We play the same tournaments, and we stay at the same hotels. You need to get along, or it just won't work.”Nouza echoes the sentiment: “As he said, we get along really well. Our playing styles complement each other nicely, and we both serve pretty strongly. There's still a lot of potential to improve, but we're working every day to get better.”All-in on doublesOriginally, both had set their sights on singles careers, but injuries forced them to pivot. “We both struggled with injuries,” explains Rikl, who has undergone two knee surgeries. Nouza adds, “At this point, probably every body part has taken a hit, especially our wrists. I also had hip issues. Playing doubles is just physically easier.”But it's not just about health, there's a thrill to doubles, too.“There's the adrenaline,” Nouza says. “Doubles matches are often super close, the rallies are exciting. It's fast, it's a completely different game compared to singles. It's fun to play, and hopefully fun to watch, too.”

Their biggest dream? Conquering the Grand Slams together. “Right now, I'm really happy with our partnership,” Nouza said last year. “Hopefully we keep growing and reach the Slams together. That's our biggest goal.” In January, they competed in the main draw of the Australian Open but lost a tight first-round battle to France's Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul. At Roland-Garros, the goal is to go one step further and reach the second round for the first time.After their breakthrough in Morocco, the pair returned to the Challenger Tour to prepare for the clay-court season, with mixed results. They reached the semifinals in Estoril but bowed out in the opening round in Bordeaux.

Away from the court, downtime is limited. “There's often not much time to switch off,” Rikl admits. “If you have a late match, you end up waiting around all day. That makes it tough to really relax outside the tournament venue.”Still, they try to enjoy their time on the road and even share a few interests. “We follow a lot of sports,” says Nouza. “Maybe I follow more than he does. Patrik prefers video games (laughs). I'm a fan of Sparta Prague and Chelsea.” Rikl adds, “I like Sparta and Real Madrid.”Bundesliga rivals?Interestingly, the two could face each other in Germany's prestigious Tennis Channel Bundesliga - at least in theory. Nouza represents TC 1860 Rosenheim: “It's nice to be part of a team in tennis for a change. I always look forward to the Bundesliga season in Germany. We've got a great group of guys. The money's a bonus, but it's mainly just a really good time.”Rikl plays for TC Augsburg, who were relegated last season. Now they're fighting for a quick return to the top flight. Should they succeed, a clash between the Czech duo on opposite sides of the net may not be far off.

 By Shrivathsa Sridhar 

 PARIS, - American men have reduced the gap with European players in the last decade but Grand Slam success will remain the gold standard to measure tennis greatness, United States number two Tommy Paul said at the French Open on Sunday. 

 Paul's compatriot Taylor Fritz had a chance to end his country's wait for a first men's major since Andy Roddick's 2003 U.S. Open triumph, but he was soundly beaten in last year's Flushing Meadows final by Jannik Sinner. 

 That defeat raised fresh questions about the U.S. men, with Italian Sinner and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz now extending European superiority after two decades of dominance by Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. 

 "We haven't closed the gap because none of us have won a Grand Slam. There's still a lot of really good Europeans ranked ahead of us. I wouldn't say the gap has closed. Over the past six years or so, we've definitely made it smaller," Paul said. 

 World number 12 Paul, one of four Americans inside the world's top 20, said Fritz's run to the New York final should give his peers the motivation they need to end the drought. 

 "We've been hearing our whole lives how we haven't had a Grand Slam champion in so long," Paul added. 

 "To have him in the finals there was huge for U.S. tennis, huge for him and for all of us in terms of belief. Seeing him there, we all believe we can be there. I think it's great for the sport." 

 Paul, who reached the semi-finals of the Italian Open earlier this month, beat Elmer Moller 6-7 6-2 6-3 6-1 at the French Open on Sunday to book a clash with Marton Fucsovics.

Victoria Mboko is still just 18, still rather new to the top level of professional tennis, and yet with a big serve, a terrific backhand and enviable court coverage, the Canadian is making the most of her first season on tour, including a victory in her Grand Slam debut on Sunday at the French Open in Paris.

When it was mentioned that her 6-1, 7-6 (4) elimination of 2024 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Lulu Sun meant Mboko has claimed all eight sets she's played over the past week-plus on the red clay at Roland-Garros — including six in a trio of triumphs in the qualifying rounds — the Toronto teen laughed, revealing the braces on her teeth.

"This does, obviously, feel really quick for me. Although it feels quick, I feel like I'm also adapting very quickly. I want to be in this level," said Mboko, represented by talent agency IMG since the age of 12. "To adapt really fast is really important to me. The more I feel like I make it seem normal to me, the more normal it's going to be in these tournaments."

Against the left-handed Sun, Mboko's serve — which she considers her game's greatest strength — played a significant role in the outcome.

With her father and two of her older siblings in the stands at Court 9, a short walk from Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Mboko reached a top speed of 115 mph and delivered seven aces. She won all 10 of her service games, saving all seven break points accumulated by Sun.

"I love to dictate points on my serve, and I love to use that as an opportunity to be more aggressive and be up in the score," said Mboko, who is currently ranked 120th. "Especially in women's tennis, having a good serve and holding all the time is pretty crucial. It helps me get out of a lot of sticky situations."

Her favourite player as a kid — not all that long ago, actually — was Serena Williams, whose 23 Grand Slam titles often came with the help of top-notch serving.

"I always modelled myself on the idea of her game. Of course, not everything I do is the same. But she had such a powerful game, and that's something that I would love to replicate and love to present my game off of that," Mboko said. "It's great to have a role model like that and try to do something like she did."

Mboko began to really get noticed in the world of tennis at the start of this year, when she won 22 matches in a row — all in straight sets — to earn four lower-level International Tennis Federation titles. Her first WTA match arrived at the Miami Open in March, and she won that debut, too.

She's been impressing opponents along the way, including 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff. Mboko pushed the American, who is ranked No. 2 right now, to three sets on clay at the Italian Open this month.

"She's playing top-level tennis," Gauff said after that win. "For sure, on the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that. As far as the other parts of her game, she's obviously a big hitter, can play well, moves pretty well, has a nice backhand, same on the forehand."

Mboko grew up playing mostly on indoor hard courts in Canada and calls that her "favorite surface for my whole life."

That said, she's starting to get used to — and enjoy — the clay used at the French Open.

"In the future? I guess we'll see. You never know. I feel like I've been doing pretty OK on the clay so far, even though it was my least favorite surface and I thought it was my worst surface, too," Mboko said. "But you never know."

Our final fours in France, and more predictions for the clay-court Slam.ByTENNIS.comPublished May 25, 2025 copy_link

It's time, once again, for TENNIS.com's editors and writers to give their predictions for Roland Garros.This time, we asked for the final fours in France, which players would win it all, and a special surprise.

AlcarazChampion: SinnerWho will reach the final four in the women's draw?Sabalenka d. Ostapenko; Gauff d. AndreevaChampion: GauffWhat's the biggest surprise we'll be talking about by the middle of the tournament?Novak Djokovic, the No. 6 seed, is in the second quarter of the draw, which is loaded with players who are not only interesting but attention-generating: Frenchmen Ugo Humbert and wizardly Corentin Moutet, former champion and Djokovic's fellow war dog Stan Wawrinka, as well as Daniil Medvedev. Djokovic is just too good a player (it sounds surreal to say that), and too experienced, not to have a few more shots to fire across the bow of rivals. It would be a mistake to look beyond Mackie McDonald in the first round, especially in light of Djokovic's recent struggles. After that, the hype machine kicks in.

Sinner could face Djokovic in the semifinals, but both will have to get past a slew of in-form opposition in the top half of the men's draw.

In her first clay-court match against Swiatek earlier this year, Ostapenko reminded all of her own pedigree on the dirt.© 2025 Robert Prange

With names like Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula on the women's side and an American-heavy bottom half on the men's side including Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz and Sebastian Korda, we could see U.S. players go deep in both draws, finally exploding the truism that Americans underperform on the terre battue.

Who will reach the final four in the men's draw?Sinner d. Cerundolo; Alcaraz d. MusettiChampion: AlcarazWho will reach the final four in the women's draw?Sabalenka d. Paolini; Andreeva d. GauffChampion: AndreevaWhat's the biggest surprise we'll be talking about by the middle of the tournament?There are truisms in sports: Prevent defenses don't work, free throws win games and U.S. players struggle to win on clay. No American player this century not named Serena Williams has won Roland Garros. Coco Gauff, finalist in 2022, is the betting favorite to end this streak, but after her longshots abound. However, what the U.S. may lack in legitimate threats at this tournament, it will make up for with depth. There very well may not be a winner or finalist in the bunch, but when the draws are whittled down to 32 players (16 on each draw), at least one quarter will be playing with a U.S. flag by their names.

Our final fours in France, and more predictions for the clay-court Slam.ByTENNIS.comPublished May 25, 2025 copy_link

Published May 25, 2025

It's time, once again, for TENNIS.com's editors and writers to give their predictions for Roland Garros.This time, we asked for the final fours in France, which players would win it all, and a special surprise. (For the special Player Edition of Expert Picks, **click here**.)PETE BODOWho will reach the final four in the men's draw?Sinner d. Cerundolo; Musetti d. AlcarazChampion: SinnerWho will reach the final four in the women's draw?Sabalenka d. Ostapenko; Gauff d. AndreevaChampion: GauffWhat's the biggest surprise we'll be talking about by the middle of the tournament?Novak Djokovic, the No. 6 seed, is in the second quarter of the draw, which is loaded with players who are not only interesting but attention-generating: Frenchmen Ugo Humbert and wizardly Corentin Moutet, former champion and Djokovic's fellow war dog Stan Wawrinka, as well as Daniil Medvedev. Djokovic is just too good a player (it sounds surreal to say that), and too experienced, not to have a few more shots to fire across the bow of rivals. It would be a mistake to look beyond Mackie McDonald in the first round, especially in light of Djokovic's recent struggles. After that, the hype machine kicks in.

AndreevaChampion: GauffWhat's the biggest surprise we'll be talking about by the middle of the tournament?Novak Djokovic, the No. 6 seed, is in the second quarter of the draw, which is loaded with players who are not only interesting but attention-generating: Frenchmen Ugo Humbert and wizardly Corentin Moutet, former champion and Djokovic's fellow war dog Stan Wawrinka, as well as Daniil Medvedev. Djokovic is just too good a player (it sounds surreal to say that), and too experienced, not to have a few more shots to fire across the bow of rivals.

Sinner could face Djokovic in the semifinals, but both will have to get past a slew of in-form opposition in the top half of the men's draw.

Who will reach the final four in the men's draw?Sinner d. Zverev; Alcaraz d. MusettiChampion: SinnerWho will reach the final four in the women's draw?Sabalenka d. Ostapenko; Gauff d. AndreevaChampion: SabalenkaWhat's the biggest surprise we'll be talking about by the middle of the tournament?Even though Iga Swiatek hasn't been able to build on her results from the previous year in her last tournaments, as the defending champion she is still one of the favorites. However, I can imagine that Jelena Ostapenko will stop her from achieving her goal in the round of 16, paving the way for herself to go far in Paris. As a former Roland Garros champion (2017), the Latvian has already proven how dangerous she can be in on clay—plus, she often brings her best tennis against top players.

No American player this century not named Serena Williams has won Roland Garros. Coco Gauff, finalist in 2022, is the betting favorite to end this streak, but after her longshots abound. However, what the U.S. may lack in legitimate threats at this tournament, it will make up for with depth. There very well may not be a winner or finalist in the bunch, but when the draws are whittled down to 32 players (16 on each draw), at least one quarter will be playing with a U.S. flag by their names.

Lorenzo Musetti: I'll go with Jasmine Paolini. She's having a tremendous season and she's the Rome champion. And also, she's my friend and my teammate.Ben Shelton: My winner on the women's side, this year I'm gonna go with an American. Coco.Gael Monfils: Hopefully my wife (Elina), 100 percent. She's in great form.Taylor Fritz: I've gotta support Coco.Casper Ruud: That's a tough one, it's very open. I'm gonna go for either Coco or Iga. Coco, she's hungry of course to try and get a title, been really steady this clay season. Looking fit and strong out there. Iga of course three years in a row, she's won. I hope for both that they can do it, but that's tough with tennis. There can only be one winner in the end.

Daniil Medvedev: Not easy. I have my pick, but I don't want to say it out loud. If you see me next tournament, you ask me if that was my pick or not.Tommy Paul: I've got Coco. I think she's playing great, obviously coming off of two finals. I think she's hungry but also confident.Joao Fonseca: I would choose a Brazilian, Bea Haddad Maia. I cheer for her, she's my friend.Jannik Sinner: Iga usually plays good here, moving well on clay. So I would go with her.Jack Draper: I'd say Sabalenka. She's been amazing this year, winning pretty much most tournaments. I think the competition is very strong, the women's. I've been watching obviously at the joint events. It's an exciting place for women's tennis. You've got Paolini who won Rome, Gauff is playing great. But I think Sabalenka is probably the favorite.

Madison Keys: I think Jannik Sinner is gonna win.Jasmine Paolini: I would like to see Sinner or Musetti. But I'm thinking Carlos Alcaraz. But hopefully not! (laughter)Jessica Pegula: Maybe like Jack Draper, or Tommy Paul, or Taylor Fritz. I feel like I would kind of want someone to win that's not notoriously known as a clay-courter to break the mold a little bit.Zheng Qinwen: I would choose Carlitos because he won last year.

Mirra Andreeva: I would choose, maybe, Andrey Rublev, maybe Daniil Medvedev, maybe Karen Khachanov, because I really like their personalities. I feel like Carlos should also defend his title. No pressure, but I just feel like it would be nice to defend a title here in Paris.Alexandra Eala: Carlos. It's so fun to see him play on court. His athleticism and obviously he's always smiling. I think he's a great role model for everybody.Jelena Ostapenko: It's hard to think that Rafa's not playing! Dimitrov, I think he deserves it.Coco Gauff: I would have to go with Carlos for the fact he won in Rome and defending champion here. Dark horse: I'll go with Mensik. I think he's a good competitor.

“I remember asking one of the people on the Wilson team, like, Hey, what does the kit look like for French Open?” Mboko recalled in Paris. “They sent me back a sketch of what it was going to be, and I was like, Oh this is really pretty!"I tried it on for the first time with my mom on the phone, and my sister was there watching too. They both said, that was made for you!”Her look features a rib-knit sleeveless polo and high-rise pleated tennis skirt—both in the “Golden” colorway—as part of Wilson's Roland Garros collection, inspired by “the iconic terre battue en 1999.” Wilson also sponsors Marta Kostyuk, Peyton Stearns, and Alycia Parks. Mboko signed a head-to-toe deal with the brand in January 2024.

I'm so lucky and happy to be a part of it,” Mboko said.“It's kind of a new partnership with me, so we'll see what the future holds. But so far? They've been really stepping up!”After years of battling a persistent knee injury, Mboko looks ready to make her mark on the sport's biggest stages. She'll face 23-year-old German Eva Lys in the second round at Roland Garros.

PARIS (AP) — Tommy Paul was pleased to come back to win his first-round match at the French Open on Sunday, of course, but perhaps not as thrilled as he was to discuss regaining the truck that was repossessed back home in Florida when he accidentally missed some payments.

The 12th-seeded Paul kept on truckin' with his clay-court results at Roland-Garros by eliminating Elmer Moller of Denmark 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 at Court Simonne-Mathieu on a day that alternated a light rain and heavy wind with sunshine.

Afterward, the 2023 Australian Open semifinalist explained that his vehicular adventures that arose while he was reaching the semifinals at the Italian Open earlier this month resulted from changing banks and forgetting to properly adjust the automatic payments for his Ford F-150.

“I missed, I think it was, like three payments. They came and took it. I didn't know it happened like that. I didn't know how quick they would come and grab it — like in the middle of the night,” Paul said. “Now I'm watching all these ‘repo' shows, where they come in and swoop trucks at 1 in the morning. It's definitely a funny experience. To be in Europe while it happened is even crazier. But we did get it back.”

He found out that the truck was gone when his trainer — who was back in Florida — asked Paul to check his security camera footage to see whether there were any packages that had been delivered to the house and needed to be picked up.

To Paul's surprise, he recounted Sunday, “There were no packages — and no truck.”

When he scrolled back through the video, the 28-year-old American who grew up in New Jersey saw what happened.

“I'm like, ‘What the hell is going on? There's a tow truck coming and taking my car!' I thought it was stolen at first,” he said.

When he figured it out, Paul took to social media and posted the black-and-white footage of his property being towed away from his driveway, adding a soundtrack of Celine Dion's “My Heart Will Go On.”

Jannik Sinner went more than three months without match action before returning at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. The results were positive: the 23-year-old made the final at the Foro Italico for the first time. But what did we learn about Sinner's performance beyond wins and losses? 

An Infosys ATP Beyond The Numbers analysis shows that his return performance in Rome will raise the alarm for opponents.

Sinner won more than 39 per cent of his return games across his six matches in the Italian capital, which is well above his career average (27.6%), his average on clay (32.6%) and the 2024 season on clay (33%). More impressively, in his first five matches of the tournament, the four-time ATP Masters 1000 champion won 48 per cent of his return games.

Sinner On Return



But it is critical to perform your best under the brightest spotlight, which for Sinner was in the final against Carlos Alcaraz. With the trophy on the line, he did not break the Spaniard's serve once in 10 return games.

Nevertheless, for his first tournament after a period away from competition, it was a positive sign for the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. To put the effort into context, only one player has won close to the same rate of return games on clay this season and that is Alcaraz, with the exact same 39.3 winning percentage.



In just one tournament, Sinner performed well enough to lead the ATP Tour's 2025 clay leaderboard in first-serve return points won (40.8%) and second-serve return points won (57.8%). 

His second-serve return performance does not necessarily stand out compared to his typical output. Sinner, who has won 54 per cent of second-serve return points in his career, is known for his powerful baseline strokes. The usual second serve — a kick serve that sits up or a slower delivery to avoid a double fault — is like a beach ball for the Italian, who is always ready to pounce and take control.

What was impressive was his first-serve returning. After time away, it would have been understandable if it took time for him to get used to not only putting first deliveries back in play, but doing so well enough to eventually win the point. 

Sinner's Return Performance In Rome

The Rome finalist has won 35 per cent of first-serve return points on clay during his career. That means his first-serve returning success improved by more than 15 per cent in the Italian capital.

In five of his six matches, Sinner won more than 40 per cent of his first-serve return points. Entering the final, his win rate was 44 per cent. No player on record has broken the 40-per cent mark for his career on clay.

That does not mean there is not plenty of room for improvement, though. 

“For sure there are some things like we saw today [that] we have to improve if we want to do good in Paris,” Sinner said. “I am closer than expected in a way [for] everything. But in the other way, it was good. It was a great week for me. Some matches [went] incredibly well, some matches could be better. But this is tennis. It's a lot of ups and downs.”

John McEnroe is a tennis legend, with seven Grand Slam titles to his name, including three Wimbledon championships and four US Open crowns. 

Since retiring from the game, McEnroe has embarked on multiple different career paths, including music, punditry and commentating, but also briefly took a coaching position with a former Wimbledon finalist. 

In 2016, he joined Milos Raonic‘s coaching team for the grass season, but the partnership ended before the US Open due to McEnroe's media commitments with ESPN. 

Ahead of Roland Garros, which is now underway, he recently hinted at a return to coaching when, in an appearance on ‘Inside the NBA', McEnroe indicated there was a player on the ATP tour he could help.

When asked on the show to pick which American has the best chance of winning a Grand Slam title, McEnroe said: “Ben Shelton to me.

“I like his story because he played football as a kid, went to college for a couple of years, won as a sophomore, so he is maturing in a nice way and improving.”

The American legend added: “His Dad coaches him. Maybe he could bring a part-time coach on for 10 weeks a year.

“Maybe he is on the TNT set right now to try and get him over the hump. But he would be the best [hope].”

McEnroe thinks he could help Shelton get over the line at Grand Slams, where the young star has come close before.

Shelton made his main draw debut at a major in 2022, when he appeared in the first round of the US Open.

It didn't take long for him to make a name for himself on the biggest stage, though, as the following season he found his way to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open.

In the same season, Shelton had his best Grand Slam campaign to date, when he made the semi-finals of the 2023 US Open, before ultimately bowing out to Novak Djokovic.

The 22-year-old had a year-long stretch of struggling at the big four events, failing to make it past the fourth round for the entirety of 2024.

He has since returned to form at majors in 2025, reaching the quarter-finals of the Australian Open for the second time in his career.

Shelton will now look to make a deep run at Roland Garros this year, where he is the 13th seed.

The past fortnight has been a whirlwind of emotion for Arthur Rinderknech, and the ride isn't over yet.

Fresh from his wedding to partner Hortense Boscher in Brittany last week, the 29-year-old Frenchman prepares for a pivotal moment at Roland Garros. Rinderknech will take on the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner, in the first round on Monday.

“I feel very good. I got married hardly a week ago, so this is a beautiful part of my private life that is taking place, and I want to continue surfing on this wave,” Rinderknech said in his pre-tournament press conference on Saturday. “Obviously the first round is not going to be easy.

“After all, some people say it's better to play him [Sinner] in the first round than the finals. I would have liked to play him in the finals, but I respect him very well. I managed to beat him once. He's a great player, I'm impatient. I want to enjoy the game on the court, and I will give everything I have, and I believe in my chances.”

Rinderknech will hope to continue that wave against a player he has notched success against in the past. While Sinner leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1, Rinderknech won their first meeting in Lyon in 2021, which was their only battle on clay.
Aiming to forge another memorable win on the surface, Rinderknech will have the backing of a raucous home crowd on his side when they step foot on Court Philippe-Chatrier.
“I love the [crowd], especially the French [crowd],” said Rinderknech. The ‘Blue Tribune' is a little group that has been created that is really supporting the French and animating the whole [crowd].”

Rinderknech first competed against Sinner in 2021 and then played him twice more over the next eight months, so is well placed to comment on the Italian's development.
“I saw him grow. I saw him develop and blossom, and he's a guy I have a lot of respect for,” said Rinderknech. “He is quiet, and that is very important. It's very nice when a player like him says hello to everyone when he comes into the lockers. It's something I really respect. He's a great champion. I believe we have a very good relationship.”
If Rinderknech is successful against Sinner, he will face a second-round meeting with Terence Atmane or Richard Gasquet, who is retiring at the conclusion of the tournament. The 38-year-old Gasquet made his debut in 2002 and notably reached the quarter-finals in 2016.
“I can picture myself there already,” said Rinderknech, who owns a 2-5 record at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “I saw that I was lucky enough to play against Richard here at Roland Garros two years ago. I know what it means. I know the player. I know the person. He's a great guy, and I hope for both of us that we play the second round. It [would] be a great pleasure.”

The second Major of the season gets underway at Roland Garros on Sunday and Express Sport is on the ground to bring you all the latest news. The final round of press conferences will also wrap up, with Novak Djokovic set to face the media following his triumph in Geneva yesterday.

There are no British players in action on day one, where world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka gets proceedings underway on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Rafael Nadal will also be honoured on the main show court where he won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles.

Rafael Nadal said farewell to Court Philippe-Chatrier for the final time with a special guest after being honoured in an emotional tribute ceremony.

The 14-time French Open champion carried his son down from the stands and held him as they both waved goodbye to the 15,000 fans inside the Roland Garros centre court.

Federer, Djokovic and Murray have left Court Philippe-Chatrier but Nadal has been asked to stay behind to receive his own send-off.

"I think it's been a very, very special moment. Perhaps the last time we see those four great champions on the court but I'm sure we're going to see them off the court in the future," Tim Henman said on TNT Sports after the Big Four's emotional reunion.

Rafael Nadal addressed Federer, Djokovic and Murray after they came out for his special celebration on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

"We, all of us, achieved our dreams. We became tennis players, we played in the most important tennis stadiums," he told his rivals in an emotional address.

They remained on the court as Nadal received a special trophy from tournament director Amelie Mauresmo and FFT President Gilles Moretton.

Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have walked onto the court to honour their old rival, Rafael Nadal.

A video montage of Big Four highlights played in the stadium before Federer, Djokovic and Murray shared a video message. But the video cut out and cameras suddenly panned to the three men waiting in the wings.

"They are here!" announcer Marc Maury declared.



Nadal's speech is over and he is being honoured by a group of guests. Some dancers performed in front of him before a group of French Open support staff took to the court, and he started sobbing.

"This is a combination of dancers and ballkids who have come onto the court to form a human 'merci' for Rafael Nadal," commentators said.

"Now they're joined by a collection of people who have helped and supported Rafa Nadal and all the players here at Roland Garros for many, many years. Drivers, physios, locker room managers, player relations."

Rafael Nadal became tearful as he thanked his uncle Toni, who started coaching him when he was a young boy and only left his team at the end of 2017.

But his speech was quickly derailed when he admitted he had lost one of his pages.

"I have to admit I lost one of the pages of my speech, but it'll be okay!" he laughed.

Rafael Nadal is addressing the crowd inside Court Philippe-Chatrier with a speech.

The former world No. 1 recalled his first victory here two decades ago and paid tribute to three of his greatest rivals.

"In 2005 I was finally able to play here for the first time. I was 18 years old. My first major experience was the match that I played against my childhood friend and rival, Richard Gasquet," he said.

"From that day on, I fully understood what Roland Garros meant. I experienced everything over these 20 years.

"I've had incredible rivals like Andy, Novak, and, of course, Roger. And of course, many others who pushed me to my physical and mental limits."



Rafael Nadal's ceremony has only just started and he's already looking teary.

The 14-time champion in Paris is currently watching on as a video plays on the screens inside Court Philippe-Chatrier showing all of his highlights at Roland Garros.

The entire court is orange. Fans are decked out in custom shirts and Merci Rafa signs have been projected across the court.

His uncle Toni is also here along with around 90 members of his friends and family, and he looks just as emotional.

Nadal's wife and son are also watching on.

Rafael Nadal has stepped out onto Court Philippe-Chatrier for a special tribute ceremony.

Everyone in the 15,000-strong stadium is wearing a special, clay-coloured t-shirt saying "merci Rafa".

Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz and Juan Carlos Ferrero are among those in the stands.

Musetti wrapped up the final set to love and says he felt the pressure because of everybody anticipating Nadal.

"It was even tougher to enter on court knowing that after my match was this big tribute to Rafa who had been an inspiration to me," he said.

"King of clay. He needs all the love he's gonna receive. I'm really happy for him. Really looking forward to the ceremony.”



Musetti is a double break ahead in the third set, leading Hanfmann 7-5, 6-2, 3-0.

Fans are starting to get excited for what could be Rafael Nadal's final appearance at Roland Garros for a while.

Emma Raducanu's former coach Philippe Dehaes has shared a sure-fire way for somebody to be sacked while working with the 2021 US Open champion.

Long before that Grand Slam success, the Brit was working with Dehaes, who has also coached Daria Kasatkina, Elise Mertens and Greet Minnen.

And in a new book, he revealed why Raducanu may be so fussy with her mentors.

"You cannot send her to play a match without giving her a lot of information about the opponent,” he said.

“I knew it, because it was in her profile. But if you started the job and you don't know that she loves to know a lot of info, after three weeks you'll be fired, that's for sure.”

No. 11 seed Diana Shnaider received a medical time-out at a crucal stage of her opening match.

The Russian led qualifier Anastasiya Konstantinovna Soboleva 5-0 in the first set when she suffered a huge collapse and lost six games in a row, allowing her opponent to serve for the set.

Shnaider then had three break-back points when she fell and immediately had to stop playing, calling the physio. She had a medical time out and play resumed almost six minutes later.

The 11th seed managed to get the break back. To a tiebreak we go...



Medics have rushed to Court Philippe-Chatrier during Lorenzo Musetti's clash with Yannick Hanfmann.

The match was paused for two minutes while a screaming woman was removed.

They're flying through the matches on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Olympic gold medalist Qinwen Zheng has beaten Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4, 6-3.

We are awaiting the conclusion of Lorenzo Musetti vs Yannick Hanfmann and then Rafael Nadal will make his way on court.



Ahead of Rafael Nadal's planned tribute ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier, organisers have been handing out special t-shirts to those in the stands.

Nadal will be honoured at the conclusion of the match between Lorenzo Musetti and Yannick Hanfmann. By the time he takes to the court, it's hoped that the 15,000-strong crowd will all be wearing their shirts.

Lorenzo Musetti is not a name on many pundits' lips when predicting who will win the French Open title.

But the Italian is confident of challenging Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic.

Musetti reached the Monte-Carlo Masters final, and semi-finals in Madrid and Rome, in the build-up to Roland Garros.

"I arrived Paris with an ambition to win Roland Garros," he said. "I feel I have improved in every aspect of my game, especially my physicality. I'm ready to chase big titles and consider myself a contender for the title.

"I have never felt so confident in my tennis, and I believe I know how to chase the title."

And play has resumed on the outside courts.

It's been a bleak day at Roland Garros weather-wise but the fans aren't letting that stop them from enjoying the action. The rain is letting up and the outside courts are being uncovered, with spectators flocking back to their seats before matches resume.

There's a buzz around the grounds today with 14-time champion Rafael Nadal already back on site ahead of his tribute ceremony later this afternoon. The atmosphere in Court Philippe-Chatrier could be even more electric if the roof stays on, trapping and enhancing the noise from the 15,000 fans.

An absolutely stacked day two schedule has just been released and Carlos Alcaraz, the defending champion, has not been selected for the biggest court.

The Spaniard has been given a daytime slot. He takes on qualifier Giulio Zeppieri second on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.



Maybe it's not going to be as brief as we initially thought.

There will be no play on the outside courts for at least the next 20 minutes.

Play has been suspended on the outside courts and the rain covers have been put to use.

This should only be a brief shower.

Top seed Aryna Sabalenka raced through her opening match at the French Open, but she still believes she needs some extra help.

Ahead of Rafael Nadal's tribute ceremony later today, the world No. 1 said she wanted to seek him out and get some advice to help her finally claim the trophy in Paris.

"Whenever someone asks me about Rafa the first thing which comes to my mind is a really hard worker. Everything he's achieved is through really hard work and he's been an inspiration to me, an inspiration to so many players so I'm really grateful for a great example," she said on court.

"Of course I'll try to stick around and watch this beautiful ceremony and I'll try to catch him somewhere there and ask him, How? How can I win this tournament? Please, give me one or two advice. I don't need more than that!'"

The world No.1 has destroyed Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-0 on Court Philippe-Chatrier

Five aces and 71% of first serve points won sees Aryna Sabalenka cruise into the second round.



Elina Svitolina has made a flying start, beating Zeynep Sonmez 6-1, 6-1.

The first seed has also fallen with Peyton Stearns, seeded No. 28, losing to Eva Lys 6-0, 6-3



Emma Raducanu played a stacked schedule in the lead up to the French Open.

The Brit competed at the Madrid Open, Italian Open and Strasbourg International.

“I love the fact that she has been out on the match court week in, week out and playing a busy schedule. She's doing all the right things and now it's about continuing that for two years, three years and five years," Tim Henman said.

“What is good is that she has invested that commitment and she has been getting the rewards. Sometimes it can take time for success to come. The fact that Emma is such a good player means we are seeing the results and progress come quickly for her.”

Six players have withdrawn from the French Open draw before the first round.

Belinda Bencic is the only women's player to have pulled out of the tournament.

Matteo Berrettini, Kei Nishikori, Emil Rusuvuori, Roberto Carballes Baena and Raphael Collignon also withdrew.

Play is underway on the outside courts but today's weather forecast is looking pretty grim.

There could be prolonged spells of rain meaning action may be limited.



Naomi Osaka dropped down to Challenger level to compete at the WTA 125k Saint-Malo earlier this month - and she won the title.

The Japanese star felt extra pressure competing on the Challenger Tour because of her previous success.

"I would say yes, there was a lot of pressure," she explained.

"I wouldn't really say it was to not lose, but it was more like I had in the back of my head, ‘I wonder what people would say about me if I lost here'.

"Granted, I should never be thinking about that when I'm playing a tennis match, but I got over it during the semis."

We're not on about the iconic daytime TV show here.

Aryna Sabalenka has revealed that she loves being the world No.1 because it puts a huge target on her back.

"Honestly, I just love it so much, knowing there's someone chasing me," she said.

"I take it as a challenge. Every time I go out there, it's like, 'OK, let's see who's ready for the pressure moments'."

Novak Djokovic has claimed that Andy Murray and Roger Federer are planning to join him in honouring Rafael Nadal during the Spaniard's ceremony.

"It will be a very special, very emotional moment for everyone," Djokovic said.

"Along with Federer and Murray, we will be there for the ceremony. It will be a beautiful moment."

Rafael Nadal will be during at a ceremoney on Court Philippe-Chatrier today.

“He will not be playing this year at Roland Garros, but he will be very present by our side for this 2025 edition,” said Ronald Garros tournament director and Olympic silver medallist Amelie Mauresmo.

“Rafa has an important bond with Roland Garros; we want it to be a surprise.”

Alexander Zverev has opened up on the "extreme abuse" that tennis players receive on social media.

The German fell ill at the Hamburg Open this week and crashed out in the second round to Frenchman Alexandre Muller.

"These days, social media is more important than anything else," Zverev explained.

"We get a lot of hate. For us tennis players, the insults we are exposed to daily online and on social media are extreme, because a lot of it happens via hidden messages, direct messages and the like.

"If I had withdrawn (from Hamburg), I would have been accused of many things. I would probably have been accused of just taking the money and leaving after one match. That I wasn't taking the tournament seriously, and so on. But that's not true; I lost because I was sick. Tennis has a strong culture of blame among fans and also on social media."



Novak Djokovic may have won the Geneva Open title yesterday, but Mats Wilander thinks he has a big problem at the French Open.

That's because his rivals now have the belief that they can beat him.

Wilander said: "Once you get to five-set tournaments, where he's won so many of them, I think [his] confidence will come soaring back.

"The only problem is that other players suddenly believe that they can beat Novak Djokovic and that's something that they haven't believed before."



Good morning and welcome back to our coverage of the French Open.

Play gets underway on the outside courts at 10am BST, with the show courts kicking off an hour later.

John McEnroe believes Andy Murray will stop coaching following his split with Novak Djokovic.

The American shared his thoughts on the duo's partnership before arguing that Murray will quit coaching now to spend more time at home instead with his children.

He said: “I can't tell you right now who I think he'd coached, he's got young children, so he was travelling all the time. So I'm guessing he doesn't want to do that.”

It all begins tomorrow at Roland Garros, and we're in for a very exciting fortnight.

Aryna Sabalenka is among the big-name stars getting their French Open campaigns underway tomorrow.

Here is a quick look at some of the biggest matches from tomorrow.

It will be an emotional day as the French Open organisers have planned a special ceremony for the retired Rafael Nadal tomorrow.

And the Grand Slam's X account have stirred up the emotions on social media beforehand.

See you tomorrow, hasta ma\u00f1ana \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/6acUkxepvL

Jasmine Paolini has assessed her chances of glory at the French Open.

Ahead of the tournament getting underway, Paolini has named four rivals who stand in her way at Roland Garros - them being Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Zheng Qinwen and Mirra Andreeva.

She heads into the Grand Slam in fine form, winning the singles and doubles titles at the recent Rome Masters.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has criticised the ceremony Rafael Nadal received at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga in November last year.

His comments come ahead of the planned tribute to the retired Spaniard at the French Open.

In an interview with 'Clay Tennis', he said: "The farewell ceremony in his honor in Malaga was really sad, I have to be honest. I think they had planned that ceremony later in the event and were surprised by the elimination of Spain on Day 1.

"When I saw it, I immediately thought that a legend like Nadal deserved a better celebration. Every tournament in the world should pay tribute to him, including Roland Garros. Rafa has made the history of this tournament more than any other player, which is why it will certainly be a beautiful moment."

Hubert Hurkacz was very gracious in defeat after his final loss to Djokovic.

An emotional Hurkacz was full of praise for his rival, saying: "First of all, congratulations to Novak, his family, his team. One hundred tournaments, it's a lot.

"It's really inspiring how you present yourself on the court and off the court, it's really incredible what you have achieved so congratulations for that and what you are doing for the whole sport of tennis."

After securing an emotional win, Novak Djokovic showed his class by paying tribute to his rival, who was almost brought to tears by his words.

It was a bitter defeat for Hubert Hurkacz to take after he went a set ahead, and Djokovic apologised after claiming victory.

Novak Djokovic has sealed glory in Geneva, coming from a set behind to beat Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2).

It's his 100th singles titles and he becomes just the third ever player to reach that milestone.

Not bad preparation ahead of the French Open...



Flavio Cobolli overcame Andrey Rublev in straight sets to claim the Hamburg Open title.

And afterwards, he said he'll be having some celebratory drinks this evening ahead of his French Open campaign beginning on Monday.

He said during his winning speech on the court: "I just want to hold the trophy and maybe drink a little bit tonight for this amazing day."

Novak Djokovic has stayed alive in the Geneva Open final after claiming the second set in a nail-biting tie-break against Hubert Hurkacz.

All to play for in the final set...

Naomi Osaka has revealed she endured a 'scary' wake-up call at 5am in Paris to be drug tested.

She was targeted by anti-doping control before the French Open.

She told reporters: "I honestly don't know the rules about talking about anti-doping. Am I allowed to say whatever I want?

"I don't know. They're kind of scary. Yeah, for me, anti-doping is like - I don't have a great relationship with them, just because they always come and take blood and urine, which I don't know if that disgusts people to say, but whatever, and my veins are, like, very notoriously hard to find.

"One person once told me it was like a Japanese thing. I don't know if that's accurate. Yeah, so they come at 5am and 'stick' me multiple times.

"Usually they can't find my veins, so they have three attempts to find it. Sometimes they can't find it.

"They're like, 'oops, sorry, let me try this arm, let me try this arm, let me try this arm'. I always have to tell them 'hey, my playing arm is my right arm, I prefer the left, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'.

"And today was kind of scary, because the last year I was here they also came at 5:00am, and the lady couldn't find my veins at all.

"I had huge bruises on my arms for a while. Thankfully it wasn't the same lady. No shade to her. And yeah, today was a success because luckily I had to use the bathroom when they woke me up, so..."

Jacob Fearnley is on a Scottish revenge mission against the Swiss star who beat Andy Murray here last year. But the British No.2 admits he still gets star-struck by meeting tennis superstars.

He said: “We can see it like a Scottish revenge mission. I remember he beat him. I couldn't remember if it was last year or not, but yeah, definitely we could see it like that. Hopefully I can get the revenge for Scotland!”

Hubert Hurkacz has taken the first set against Novak Djokovic!

The Serb delivers a double fault on the first set point and loses the opener 7-5.

What a turn-up for the books this could be.



Daniil Medvedev has warned his French Open rivals that he has never felt in better form on the red dirt.

“On clay I personally feel like I'm playing, honestly, the best level of my life on clay, even considering Rome title [in 2023],” the former world No 1 said.

“A lot of things came together. If we talk about the game, like the movement, the game, the feeling of the game, I do think I play my best season on clay. So it's tough for me to answer.

“On hard courts it's easier for me to answer that, yes, I'm far from the Daniil that I was on hard courts. On clay I feel like I'm even better than before. So that's all I can answer.

“That's good for Roland-Garros because I'll try to show it.”

By Neil McLeman in Paris

Emma Raducanu is fighting her fear of needles to get fit for the French Open.

The former US Open champion admitted she is not “100%” after suffering a back spasm in her defeat in Strasbourg this week.

And the British No.1 is undergoing acupuncture to be ready to face China's world No.42 Wang Xinyu in the first round here.

“It's not feeling 100%,” Raducanu admitted. “I had a spasm in Strasbourg, and just been trying to manage it as best I can doing treatment. I've been on the practice court last night and this morning. Yeah, it felt okay, but obviously it's different playing a match. I'm trying to do everything to get up to speed as fast as possible.

"It is similar to the problem I had in Australia, I would say the one before Australia was worse. I feel like this one I kind of caught before it fully locked up. So I think the treatment is a lot of it with the physios, a lot of it with heat. Been doing some dry needling where they twitch the needle, like they move it.

“At the start of the year I was so scared of needles. It was my biggest phobia. That was the only way I was going to be able to play Australia.

"So since then, I've been kind of dipping my toes into it because I know it helps even though I'm really scared of them. That's how I've kind of been trying to manage it.”

Jodie Burrage has admitted her boyfriend missing out on Lions selection has hit her form in the build-up to the French Open.

 Scotland scrum half Ben White was devastated not to be picked by Andy Farrell in his 38-man squad for the tour to Australia next month.

"I've been a bit preoccupied mentally, just with a few other things, and I think that's taken more out of me than I thought the last few weeks," she said. "Did the Lions affect me?

"To be honest, yes. He's dealt with it very well but he's been different to normal. When you're in a relationship you've got to be there for your other half and he did that a lot for me last year when I spent six months out and it probably took a lot of effort for him to deal with me during that time.

"So I've tried to be there for him the last few weeks, keep him positive and happy and it probably did take more than I thought out of me but at the end of the day there's always going to be things going on off the court, that just happened to be now."

By Neil McLeman in Paris

Katie Boulter said staying British No.1 is “not my goal” before she bids to win her first ever singles match at the French Open.

The Leicester City fan prepared for the claycourt Grand Slam by winning the WTA 125 event in Paris last week. She is now world No.38 with Emma Raducanu (43) and Sonay Kartal (53) close behind.

But Boulter, who has struggled with a foot injury this year, said: “I've been in this space for a long time now. I've not been here for one week. I don't even know now. Almost three years, probably something like this.

“I feel like I have ticked that goal of being British No. 1. If my ranking is going in the right direction, I'll remain there. If not, great. The other girls are doing really well. I want to see Emma and Sonay and anyone else pushing me in the rankings. I want that because ultimately it means I've got to get my ranking up to hold that spot."



Paula Badosa has very low expectations head into the French Open.

The Spaniard has struggled with injuries for the majority of this year and is using the clay Slam to build momentum ahead of Wimbledon.

She said: “I have to be realistic. Of course, I could get excited and excited about being close to another Grand Slam, but this isn't the reality.

"Maybe at Wimbledon the situation will be different, but here I arrive having completed one tennis match in the last two months. The goal in Paris is to play as many matches as possible; every minute on the court will mean a lot to me.

"I approach the tournament without any expectations. If I can play one match, great; if I can play three, phenomenal. I wish the reality were different. You know I love Roland Garros, but I'm coming off an injury, and that's what it is.”

Stefanos Tsitsipas says he is glad that he never had to face Rafael Nadal on the Spaniard's favourite court.

The Greek star said: "I was lucky not to play against him on the Chatrier, because I don't think it would have been a fun experience.

"I played against him on clay, he has a knack for it, a talent, as he has done for years. I have enormous respect for him. He taught me a lot about the game on clay, about determination, about perseverance on a tennis court.

"I always talked about Roger Federer saying that he was the person I admired, but I think it was a bit of both. I never admitted that it was Rafa too, because I felt like I had a game that was closer to Federer's, but maybe if I had a two-handed backhand like him, I might have played as many Roland-Garros as him, 29 Roland-Garros I think, including 14 victories.

"In fact, it's strange to see him stop competing and live a different life than he lived for years."

Novak Djokovic gets his Geneva Open final underway and Hubert Hurkacz in around 90 minutes time.

Ahead of that tie, the Serb explained how he continuously needs to adapt to stay at the top of his game.

He said: “Honestly, I change things all the time when I feel like I'm not at the level I want. I'm looking every day, even at 38, even after more than 20 years at this level. I'm not the same player I was 15, 10, or five years ago. You need that mentality to get in tune with the young players. Looking for things every day, improving your game, your mentality.

“I look for a lot of things every day with my team to change my approach to training and tournaments. The situation wasn't ideal before arriving here. But after the first match, I felt confident. I played well in training, but in matches it's always different, with mental things interfering. So far, everything's going very well.”



Richard Gasquet is ready to embrace his final French Open - 20 years after first appearing at his home Grand Slam.

“I'm feeling, of course, it's my last tournament, so it's a bit particular, a bit emotional,” Gasquet reflected.

“But I try my best of course when I'm going on the court to try to win, so we will see what will happen. I just know I try my best to win the match and we will see what will happen. The match is always different. It's the end, maybe the last match of your career. Hard to say. It's special, but I'm happy to do this, I'm happy to play here one last time. I'm practically 39 years old.

“I never thought I was going to be playing such a long time. So I'm lucky enough to be able to do it here one last time. I know what that represents, to play in a tournament like this. So I'm going to try to enjoy it from beginning to end and give my all. It's sport. You never know what's going to happen. I don't know if I'm calm, but in any case, I want it, and I'm going to enjoy it.”

Nick Kyrgios has withdrawn from the doubles draw.

His partner, Jordan Thompson, will instead compete alongside fellow Australian Jason Kubler.

Iga Swiatek has not won a title since her French Open triumph last year and there are concerns over the Pole's form heading into the clay Slam.

She has dropped to No. 5 in the world rankings but is working to change her mentality in order to bounce back.

"Well for sure after Rome, I had a lot of time to think about how I played and what my attitude was,” Swiatek said.

“So, for sure I focused on changing some stuff and also having more intensity because I feel like I'm not starting the matches well.

“And then obviously I got tight a little bit when I played with Danielle, but yeah, these are things that any athlete needs to work on, I would say."

The schedule for the opening day of the French Open has been released.

World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka kicks things off on Court Philippe-Chatrier against Kamilla Rakhimova.

Ben Shelton headlines the night session when he takes on Lorenzo Sonego at 7.15pm BST.



Kei Nishikori has withdrawn from the French Open meaning Carlos Alcaraz has been given a new first-round opponent.

The defending champion will instead take on 23-year-old Italian Giulio Zeppieri , who is ranked No. 306 in the world.

Jack Draper is planning to talk with Andy Murray ahead of Wimbledon - but he has no plans to hire the three-time Grand Slam champion as his coach.

Murray is a free agent after parting with Novak Djokovic and has long been linked with coaching a British player.

“My team's very set at the moment,” Draper said ahead of the French Open

“I'll definitely pick Andy's brains here and there. I'm yet to speak to Andy about that stuff, but I definitely will, and I know he's always there if I need him.”



Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff were among the players present for showdown talks with Grand Slam chiefs at the French Open. Top-10 stars on the ATP and WTA Tours have made a series of demands, which include increased prize money.

In March, players including Sinner, Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Aryna Sabalenka signed a letter addressed to the four Grand Slams. The letter requested an in-person meeting with tournament bosses to discuss prize money, player welfare, and allowing players a stronger say in key decisions.

Jannik Sinner has been warned he faces a hostile reception when he takes on Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in his opening match at Roland Garros.

Sinner returned from his doping ban at the Italian Open last week and was treated kindly at his home event.

But Andy Roddick fears it won't be the same in Paris.

He said: "I'm just telling you as nice as the reception was for Sinner when he had kind of that soft landing in Rome, where he was getting standing ovations by the press when he speaks to the media.

"It's like two Frenchmen straight out of the gate, that's a guarantee and then Arthur Fils, he is going to hear it from the French crowd in Paris for the first week of his this year's French Open."

Boris Becker says he is "lost for words" over Novak Dokovic's split with Andy Murray.

"I really wanted to see them both at Wimbledon, actually. Andy knows a thing or two about winning Wimbledon, he's very popular there. I thought it would be an advantage for Novak to have Andy in his corner. I'm a little bit lost for words [as to] why they've broken up just before the second Grand Slam," Becker said.

Alexander Zverev opening his press conference on Friday by admitting that his plane was struck by lightning en route to Paris and was forced to make an emergency stop.

"We were supposed to fly yesterday evening at 6.45pm, and we took off from Hamburg," Zverev said.

"We got struck by lightning. We had to do an emergency landing back in Hamburg.

"It made a little noise — no real wobbling or anything. It was a first-time experience."

Emma Raducanu has decided against withdrawing from the French Open after picking up an injury in Strasbourg this week.

The Brit complained about "long and intense" spasms in her back, leading to suggestions that she could pull out of the clay Slam to focus on Wimbledon.

But it is understood that Raducanu will take to court to face Chinese world No42 Wang Xinyu in the opening round.



Good morning and welcome to our live coverage from the French Open.

We'll be building up to the tournament, that gets underway tomorrow.

We'll also have live updates from Novak Djokovic's clash with Hubert Hurkacz in the Geneva Open final from 2pm.

When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory.

And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. That equals the record total of Petra Kvitova and, not insignificantly, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as well.

Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. Sabalenka's earned that confidence because -- by an uncommonly wide margin -- she is the best player in the sport.

On Monday, the World No. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the PIF WTA Rankings. That gap is likely to grow. With Swiatek defending titles in Rome and Paris, she'll also be defending 3,000 points across the next month. And because Sabalenka missed Wimbledon last year, this year's result will be a ranking points windfall.

Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. 2 Madison Keys in the PIF Race to the WTA Finals in Riyadh. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players.

This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. How has her game evolved?

“I feel like she just got a lot better in everything,” Gauff said. “I think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.”

Examine the timeline and you'll find that the catalyst for all of this, oddly enough, was a loss.

Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. She left the Middle East in something of a funk, having lost an unheard of three of four matches.

But then, she rallied and reached four straight finals -- Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart and Madrid -- winning two of them. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances.

A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com:

Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome?

Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. And I think, February I was kind of trying to figure my way. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Kind of explains to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.

Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all … how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments?

Sabalenka: I'm super happy that I was able to bring the level in those key moments. Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. 

Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but … against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points?

Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game.

Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets – their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka … what do you think of that?

Sabalenka: I … don't know. I mean, they are legends. They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them … it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud.

Of all the ups and downs you've experienced, how good do you feel about your game right now?

Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. But I think the key for me was that I was always looking for something to improve. And now, still, I want to get better.

Three Madrid titles … the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?

Sabalenka: [Laughing]. I mean, in my mind, in my dreams, yes I can. But sometimes the reality is different. I will definitely go out there and compete and fight and see if my dream will be the same in real life.

‘It was the only option' – Verstappen explains alternate tyre strategy in Monaco after going from P1 to P4 on final lap

Lewis Hamilton admits that the Monaco Grand Prix was a "miserable" experience as he was left "in no man's land" en route to a fifth-placed result.

The Ferrari driver had shown an up-turn in form prior to Sunday's race, Qualifying fourth for his best Saturday result this season ahead of a Grand Prix.

But the seven-time World Champion was demoted three-places on the grid for impeding Max Verstappen, which dropped him to a seventh-placed start in the Principality.

Well-timed pit stops, with all drivers required to make two in a first for the Monaco race, allowed Hamilton to move ahead of Isack Hadjar and Fernando Alonso come the chequered flag, which he believes was the maximum possible.

Hamilton finished fifth but 51 seconds behind winner Norris

"I think from where I was, a three-place grid penalty moving forwards back to fifth, I think was decent – the best I could do," said Hamilton.

When asked if the experience of racing at Monaco had been enjoyable, Hamilton replied: "No, it was miserable.

"The races here are generally, unless you're first and in the lead, even when you're in the lead, it's not that fun. Just a nice reward at the end but other than that, anything but first is kind of empty."

Despite finishing fifth, Hamilton was 51 second behind race winner Lando Norris as Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc finished just a few seconds in arrears as the runner-up.

Hamilton was left unable to give an answer as to why the gap had been so large, stating "it just happens" to Sky Sports F1.

"For me, I was kind of in the middle of nowhere," Hamilton added.

Hamilton satisfied with ‘decent' result in Monaco after making up two places

"Obviously I started with the penalty I had down in seventh, was obviously behind two cars for some time and then managed to clear them and then I was kind of just in no man's land after that. I think the gap was relatively big and I wasn't racing anyone.

"I needed the Safety Car or something to come into play but it didn't happen so it was just pretty straightforward from there."

Hamilton was also left frustrated by radio communications with his engineer, at one point being told to push, which left the Briton confused.

"The information wasn't exactly that clear, I didn't understand 'this is our race' [comment]," said Hamilton.

"I didn't know what I was fighting for. Was I fighting for the next spot ahead or... but in actual fact when I look at the data, I wasn't anywhere near the other guys up front so I used my tyres a lot in that moment but I was so far away from them."

FACTS AND STATS: Racing Bulls' Hadjar and Lawson both secure career-best results

Leclerc admits he ‘lost the race' in Qualifying but takes positives from competitive Monaco weekend

Lando Norris expertly converted pole position into victory during Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, leading home Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri at the end of an intriguing, strategic race, which saw Max Verstappen hold P1 until the penultimate lap on an alternate strategy.

Norris survived a massive lock-up at the first corner before working through Virtual Safety Car phases, spells of traffic and the mandated two-stop rule to score his second win of the season and slash Piastri's championship lead.

Leclerc applied plenty of pressure at various stages of the race, including that initial run to Sainte Devote and late on when Verstappen backed the pack up, but ultimately had to settle for second, with Piastri – now just three points clear of Norris in the standings – completing the podium.

Verstappen ran an off-set tyre strategy that saw the Red Bull driver go much longer across his stints, giving him the race lead into the very closing stages, but he dropped to fourth after completing his required second stop with a lap to go.

Race results

Lewis Hamilton had a lonely race en route to fifth place, making up a couple of spots following his post-Qualifying penalty for impeding Verstappen, with rookie Isack Hadjar taking a fine sixth over Haas' Esteban Ocon and team mate Liam Lawson.

Williams bagged a double points finish with Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz in P9 and P10, denying the Mercedes of George Russell, who grew frustrated at Albon's defensive driving earlier in the race and picked up a drive-through for an illegal overtake.

Haas driver Ollie Bearman put on a strong recovery from his 10-place grid penalty and some wild moments in the opening stages to take the chequered flag in 12th position, followed by fellow rookies Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber).

Bortoleto hit the barriers at Portier on the opening lap after a scrap with Kimi Antonelli, but bounced back to finish just ahead of Lance Stroll's Aston Martin, experienced team mate Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull.

Antonelli was the final finisher in 18th, having completed his pit stops extremely late in the race, with Fernando Alonso retiring for Aston Martin amid engine trouble and Alpine's Pierre Gasly dropping out via a clash with Tsunoda exiting the tunnel.

Race Highlights: 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

After another classic Monaco Qualifying session topped by Norris, attention soon turned to Sunday's 78-lap race around the Principality, and how the new, mandatory two pit stop rule might shake things up over the course of the afternoon.

In short, every driver would be required to use three different sets of tyres across the race, including two different slick tyre compounds, with F1 supplier Pirelli amusingly declaring that “anything can happen” in their usual pre-race strategy guide.

A couple of drivers looking to take full advantage of that new rule were Bearman and Stroll, who lined up at the back with respective 10-place and four-place grid penalties – earned for various red flag, impeding and clashing incidents throughout practice.

Another man to lose grid spots ahead of the start was Hamilton, who recovered well from an accident at the end of final practice to finish fourth-fastest in Qualifying, only to earn a three-place drop for getting in Verstappen's way during Q1.

As the drivers lined up on the grid, with Bearman's car noted for being in an ‘unsafe condition', it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Verstappen, Alonso, Hamilton, Sainz, Russell, Antonelli, Colapinto and Stroll going for hards, and Tsunoda running softs.

Norris started on pole after a pulsating Qualifying hour on the streets of Monte Carlo

Norris got away cleanly when the lights went out and survived a sizeable double lock-up at Sainte Devote to maintain his pole position advantage over a fast-starting Leclerc, followed closely by Piastri and Verstappen, with the rest of the top 10 positions also remaining unchanged.

However, the Virtual Safety Car was soon deployed when Bortoleto – having gone wheel-to-wheel with Antonelli through the hairpin – went straight on at Portier and hit the wall. The Brazilian backed out of it and headed to the pits for repairs, while Tsunoda, Gasly and Bearman also stopped for fresh rubber.

Lap 4 saw the VSC end and the race resume in earnest – Norris managing the situation well to edge away from Leclerc. Meanwhile, the aforementioned battle between Bortoleto and Antonelli was looked at by the stewards, who decided that no further action would be required.

The drama stepped up a gear on Lap 9 when Gasly ran into Tsunoda's Red Bull under braking for the Nouvelle Chicane, forcing the Frenchman back to the pits and into retirement. ”Is he an idiot? What is he doing?” Tsunoda sighed over the radio.

As drivers navigated the debris, Verstappen saw an opportunity to attack Piastri on the run between the chicane and Tabac, with the McLaren man's firm defence drawing a frustrated radio message from the reigning four-time World Champion. There would be no action from the stewards, though.

Hulkenberg and Colapinto were the next drivers to pit for fresh tyres under green flag conditions, following a brief pit lane closure due to Gasly parking up at Williams, before Hadjar boxed for softs from fifth and rejoined in eighth, just ahead of Racing Bulls team mate Lawson, who had been backing up the cars behind him.

Alonso and Ocon responded to Hadjar's stop next time around, rejoining in seventh and eighth respectively, with the Spaniard shouting that “I can't push now” on his harder rubber. Stroll and Bearman also took on more tyres, meaning the latter had already hit his two-stop requirement.

After being told to push by his engineer, Hamilton pitted on Lap 19 for a set of hard tyres, coming back out ahead of Hadjar, with Norris doing the same from the lead of the race shortly afterwards and returning to the track in fourth – a huge gap of clean air to work with and hammer in some quick times.

Racing Bulls' strategy became crystal clear on Lap 20 when Hadjar pitted for a second time and took on hards, again rejoining in front of team mate Lawson, before Piastri got called in to try and undercut new leader Leclerc, albeit with a slow stop hampering that plan.

Leclerc duly stopped on Lap 22 and, despite Piastri's best efforts, the home favourite slotted back in between the McLaren drivers – Verstappen, having started on hard tyres, sitting 10 seconds clear of Norris and extending his opening stint.

Verstappen worked his way to the front on a different strategy to those around him

“So now what's the plan? Because that didn't work very well,” Piastri lamented over the radio as the race settled back down. While McLaren pondered that, the only drivers yet to stop at all were Verstappen, Lawson, Albon, Sainz, Russell and Antonelli.

At this point, television footage cut to Russell harassing Sainz just outside the top 10 places, with the Williams man seemingly attempting to create a gap for team mate Albon ahead as per Racing Bulls' plan. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff jumped on the radio to give his driver some encouragement.

Verstappen decided that enough was enough on Lap 28 and pitted for medium tyres, dropping him back down to fourth and restoring the original top three of Norris, Leclerc and Piastri. Ocon, Colapinto and Bortoleto also pitted for a second time, with the Sauber rookie intriguingly taking on softs.

While Norris and Leclerc complained about backmarkers not adhering to blue flags, Bearman added a couple more dramatic moments to his difficult weekend thanks to a wheel-to-wheel scrap with Stroll through Rascasse and a bounce over the kerbs exiting the Swimming Pool section – but no lasting damage was done.

At the halfway mark of the race, Norris led Leclerc by around six seconds, with Piastri five seconds further back and Verstappen hovering two more seconds behind the Australian. “Ah, my shifts feel like the Monaco Grand Prix 1972,” Verstappen then chimed over the radio.

Norris was soon back in the lead, but he had home hero Leclerc for company

Stops for Lawson (taking on softs) and Albon (mediums) meant only Sainz, Russell and Antonelli (all still running their starting sets of hards) were yet to complete a tyre change, while Bortoleto made his third pit lane visit of the day to switch to mediums.

Lap 38 brought another incident when Alonso parked his smoking Aston Martin at the exit of Rascasse and retired from the action, ending what had turned into a tough afternoon for the two-time World Champion after he lost places in the pit lane and developed a power unit issue.

Lawson and Albon pitted together again on Lap 41 to hit their required two stops, maintaining their places at the tail-end of the top 10 in the process, with Sainz moving into the points-paying positions thanks to Alonso's aforementioned retirement.

Williams took the team game to the next level when Albon released Sainz into some clean air and backed up the cars behind in a bid to give his team mate a free stop. That added to the frustration for Russell and Antonelli behind – the Briton accusing his rival of driving “dangerously slowly”.

Piastri was the first of the front-runners to stop for a second time on Lap 49, prompting Leclerc to pit and cover him off a lap later, and then leader Norris to come in for new tyres one tour after that. Verstappen, meanwhile, continued on his way and extended once more.

Russell and Albon's battle then turned sour at the Nouvelle Chicane. After avoiding the back of the Williams under braking and skipping over the chicane, Russell ignored Mercedes' advice to hand back the position. “I'll take the penalty… he's driving erratically,” said Russell.

After a swift investigation from the stewards, Russell was hit with a drive-through penalty. “To be honest… I prefer not to speak,” he said in response. Now it was Antonelli's turn to attack Albon, bringing another near-miss at the same spot.

Sainz and Russell both pitted on Lap 55 to fit new tyres, with the latter being told that his penalty would be delayed “as long as possible”. That meant Antonelli was the only driver yet to complete a pit stop with just over 20 laps to go.

As the lap count hit 60, Verstappen remained in the lead – but with that second stop still to be made – from a closing Norris and Leclerc. With no way through for Norris, it in turn allowed Leclerc to edge ever closer and hover only a few tenths back.

The situation continued into the final 10 laps, with Norris coming under more and more pressure from Leclerc. “Where's Oscar? I need him to put Charles under some pressure,” Norris enquired at this point, adding: “Max is just backing me up. He's not even pushing.”

Verstappen gave Norris a late-race headache before pitting on the penultimate lap

Norris did everything he needed to across a tense phase of laps before Verstappen finally made his second stop, releasing his 2024 title rival, Leclerc and Piastri back into the top three positions, which would remain that way to the finish.

In a statement to his rivals, Norris clocked the fastest lap of the race on his way to the chequered flag, before taking in the applause from the fans and celebrating his first triumph since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix with a cry of “Monaco, baby!”.

Verstappen followed the podium finishers home in fourth, with Hamilton the last driver to cross the line on the lead lap in fifth, and Hadjar, Ocon, Lawson, Albon and Sainz rounding out the points over a frustrated Russell.

Bearman turned 20th on the grid into 12th, ahead of Colapinto and Bortoleto, with Stroll, Hulkenberg, Tsunoda and Antonelli bringing up the rear – the latter waiting until the final stages to tick off his two mandatory stops. Alonso and Gasly were left on the sidelines following their respective incidents.

Nobody could stop Norris on the streets of Monte Carlo

“It feels amazing,” said Norris afterwards. “It's a long, gruelling race, but good fun. We could push for quite a lot of the race. [At] the last corner I was a little bit nervous with Charles close behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco. It doesn't matter how you win, I guess. I had an amazing weekend. This is what I dreamed of when I was a kid, so I achieved one of my dreams!”

	Keith Caulfield



Morgan Wallen's latest studio effort, I'm the Problem, debuts atop the Billboard 200 chart (dated May 31) with the year's biggest week for any album — 493,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending May 22, according to Luminate. It also easily lands the largest streaming week for any album in 2025.

	It's the third No. 1 for Wallen on the Billboard 200, following 2023's One Thing at a Time (19 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1) and 2021's Dangerous: The Double Album (10 weeks at No. 1, all consecutive). The latter two titles both debuted at No. 1 and have never left the weekly top 50 of the chart. On the latest chart, One Thing at a Time is a non-mover at No. 4 (making Wallen the only act with two concurrent albums in the weekly top five in 2025), while Dangerous shifts 11-12.

I'm the Problem was officially announced in mid-March, and was preceded by eight charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100 over the past 10 months, all of which reached the top 20 of the ranking, including six top 10s (the most top 10s ever from an album prior to its release). Among them were the No. 1 “Love Somebody,” which debuted atop the list last November, and the album's title track (No. 2 in February).




			Trending on Billboard		







	Also in the latest Billboard 200 top 10, Jin notches his highest-charting effort as Echo launches at No. 3. The BTS member previously hit the top 10 as a soloist with Happy (No. 4) in 2024.


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new May 31, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on May 28, one day later than usual due to the Memorial Day holiday in the U.S. on May 26. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	Of I'm the Problem's 493,000 first-week equivalent album units, SEA units comprise 357,000 (equaling 462.63 million on-demand official streams of the set's 37 tracks; it debuts at No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 133,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 3,000.

	











I'm the Problem is the fifth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2025, of 14 total, to also simultaneously be No. 1 on both Top Album Sales and Top Streaming Albums, following Sleep Token's Even in Arcadia (May 24), Lady Gaga's MAYHEM (March 22), Kendrick Lamar's GNX (Feb. 22) and The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow (Feb. 15).


I'm the Problem captures 2025's biggest week by equivalent album units earned. The last bigger week was the opening frame of Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department over a year ago. It bowed at No. 1 with 2.61 million units on the May 4, 2024-dated chart.


	With 357,000 SEA units equaling 462.63 million on-demand official streams of I'm the Problem's 37 tracks, the set logs the largest streaming week of 2025 for any album, and the biggest since The Tortured Poets Department's first week, which snared 891.37 million. I'm the Problem also tallies the second-biggest streaming week ever for any country album, trailing only the opening week of Wallen's last album, One Thing at a Time, which bowed with 498.28 million clicks.


	Meanwhile, with 133,000 copies sold in its first week, I'm the Problem captures Wallen's biggest sales week ever, the biggest sales week for any country album in 2025 and the fourth-largest sales frame in 2025 among all albums. The last country set to post a bigger sales week was Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter, when it debuted with 168,000 sold (April 13, 2024-dated chart). I'm the Problem's sales were helped by its availability on vinyl in its first week. Wallen's last album, One Thing at a Time, didn't get its vinyl release until its fourth week on sale.


	During its first week, I'm the Problem was available to purchase across five vinyl variants (standard black vinyl, a “first pressing” black vinyl, bone white-colored, coke bottle clear-colored [all exclusively sold in Wallen's webstore] and a Target-exclusive opaque brown-color edition with a collectible insert), four CD variants (standard, a deluxe boxed set containing a branded T-shirt, a signed CD and a Target-exclusive edition with a collectible insert) and a standard digital download. All variations of the album had the same 37 tracks. All told, of I'm the Problem's first-week sales, digital downloads comprise 51,000, vinyl comprise 48,000 (Wallen's best week on vinyl ever, and the largest week for a country album in 2025) and CDs comprise 34,000.

	











SZA's chart-topping SOS rises one spot to No. 2 on the latest Billboard 200, earning 47,000 equivalent album units — down 8%.


	Jin nabs his highest-charting effort on the Billboard 200 as Echo arrives at No. 3. It's the second charting solo set for the BTS member, who previously hit the chart with the No. 4-peaking Happy in November 2024.


Echo debuts with 43,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, album sales comprise 35,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 6,000 (equaling 8.92 million of the album's tracks) and TEA units comprise 2,000. Echo's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across 13 CD variants (all have the standard seven-song tracklist and contain collectible branded paper ephemera) and five download album variants (a standard wide version, a version exclusive to Jin's webstore containing a bonus voice memo track and three widely available deluxe editions each containing two different remixes of the album's “Don't Say You Love Me”).


	Nos. 4-9 on the new Billboard 200 are all former No. 1s. Wallen's One Thing at a Time is steady at No. 4 (42,000 equivalent album units; down 13%); Kendrick Lamar's GNX rises 7-5 (41,000; down 5%); Sleep Token's Even in Arcadia falls 1-6 in its second week (38,000; down 70%); Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet steps 8-7 (just over 37,000; down 6%); PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake's $ome $exy $ongs 4 U drops 5-8 (37,000; down 21%); and Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos climbs 10-9 (nearly 37,000; down 3%).


	Fuerza Regida's 111XPANTIA closes out the top 10, falling 6-10 with 32,000 equivalent album units earned (down 26%).

Pascal plays Reed Richards, aka Mister Fantastic, in the upcoming Marvel film.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Pedro Pascal had some competition for his Reed Richards, aka Mister Fantastic, role.


	During a recent conversation at MCM Comic Con, David Tennant was asked by a fan about which superhero he would like to play in a film, and he revealed that he had his eyes on the role Pascal ultimately landed in Marvel's forthcoming The Fantastic Four: First Steps.




	“In terms of superheroes, I did slightly have my eye on Reed Richards and unfortunately, it looks like they've gone in a different direction,” the Doctor Who star said. “Although if it has to be someone, I'm very happy for it to be Pedro Pascal, frankly.”

The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which hits theaters on July 25, also stars Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm, Julia Garner as the Silver Surfer and Ralph Ineson as Galactus. In the film, the Fantastic Four must defend Earth from a ravenous space god, Galactus, and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer, all while balancing their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond.


	Later during the MCM Comic Con chat, the moderator also asked Tennant if he had seen the viral Vanity Fair lie detector test video, where Pascal calls himself “the bigger daddy” compared to Oscar Isaac. After saying that he had yet to see it, she then said, “I was gonna ask you who's the bigger daddy, you or Pedro Pascal?”


	“What's the criteria?” the Broadchurch actor asked in response before adding, “I mean it will definitely be him, he's Mister Fantastic, so in every sense of the word. I think Pedro Pascal is great. I'm very, very pleased that he exists.”

	Federal judges, worried that the president could withdraw the U.S. marshals protecting them in retaliation for ruling against his administration, are considering managing their own security force as threats to the judiciary are rising.


The Wall Street Journal reports that judges discussed the idea of creating their own security detail behind closed doors at the semiannual meeting of the Judicial Conference, national policymaking body for the federal courts, in early March. Security committee members described increased threats in the wake of Trump's attacks.


	The judiciary's fears of Trump's reprisal are not unfounded. The president has withdrawn security protection in the past from those he perceives as his enemies, including his former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and former national security advisor John Bolton. Trump also recently ended Secret Service protection for former president Joe Biden's adult children.


	Democrats in Congress share the judges' concern. Led by Sen. Cory Booker, they introduced a bill last week that would transfer control of the U.S. Marshals from the executive to the judicial branch, allowing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Judicial Conference to appoint a director.

	











	“President Trump has made it abundantly clear through his words and actions that he does not respect the law, court orders, the safety of our judges, or our institutions,” Booker said in a statement. “Congress must act to move the bureau into the judicial branch. Our U.S. Marshals are critical to protecting the rule of law, and they must be able to do their jobs without political interference.”


	According to a Reuters investigation, at least 11 federal judges' families have dealt with threats of violence or harassment following rulings against the Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth has received several death threats to his house. Someone sent a SWAT team to the home of U.S. District Judge Judge John Coughenour after he overturned one of Trump's executive orders, the Journal reported. An email to Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett's sister claimed a pipe bomb was in her mailbox, although that message turned out to be a hoax. Police said that other households related to Barrett have received attempted pizza deliveries. Many judges and their families have experienced harassment in the form of pizza deliveries to their homes, which they interpret as a message that their detractors know where they live. According to a Reuters investigation, at least 11 federal judges' families have dealt with threats of violence or harassment following rulings against the Trump administration.

	Threats to judges and their families “are ultimately threats to constitutional government. It's as simple as that,” U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan told Reuters.


	Top figures on the far right — including the president, Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, and Republican lawmakers — have openly attacked judges and their families when judges have issued rulings against the administration. 


	The Trump administration has even targeted a judge directly, arresting Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan under the accusation she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested that Dugan is “deranged” and believes herself to be “above the law.”


	A Justice Department official said that federal marshals “will continue to protect the safety and security of federal judges.”


	“Any suggestion to the contrary is not only absurd but wrong,” the official said in a statement to the Journal from the White House.

	Despite rising threats, funding and staffing for the U.S. Marshals has remained stagnant over the last several years. Courthouse security also needs more funding, judges told the Journal. 


	Threats toward prosecutors and judges have been escalating ever since the 2020 presidential election. Death threats, intimidation, doxxing, and harassment are becoming increasingly commonplace. Ronald Davis, a former director of the U.S. Marshals, told ABC News in February that threats against judges have grown at an “alarming rate.” 


	According to data from the U.S. Marshals, the number of judges receiving threats more than doubled between 2019 and 2024. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote of “a significant uptick in identified threats at all levels of the judiciary” in his 2024 year-end report. Since then, Trump and his acolytes have only increased their ire toward the judiciary as judges issue rulings against the administration's immigration policies, attempts to decimate the federal bureaucracy, and more.

	Anti-judicial rhetoric online rose by 327 percent between May 2024 and March 2025, according to a study by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) published earlier this month. The study's findings “suggest that a rise in anti-democratic language from prominent American figures on the far right likely influenced extremists on social media to also attack the judiciary, leading to large increases in violent language and calls for impeachment targeting judges on several platforms.”

	











	Threats against the judiciary on TikTok, GPAHE found in a study published in March, increased by 90 percent in the first two months of this year. Threats on Truth Social, the platform owned by the president, nearly doubled (94 percent increase).

The international box office portion through Sunday is $158.7M.


	With this weekend counted, The Walt Disney Studios global box office has crossed $2B ($2.083B), making it the first studio in 2025 to reach the milestone.


	Meanwhile, the other massive opener this weekend, Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning flew to a franchise best domestically, internationally and globally. The offshore number from 64 markets is $127M through today. On a like-for-like basis, the overseas result is 7% ahead of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning.

	MORE…


PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Big weekend at the global and international box office as Disney's Lilo & Stitch and Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning take center stage. 


Lilo & Stitch, the live-action take on 2002's animated adventure, started rollout on Wednesday and is now playing in 50 material offshore markets, grossing $56.3M through the first three days overseas. 


	Included in that bunch are the biggest opening days of the year in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Mexico and Spain. That's great news, especially as this is a family property with no offshore holidays, and ahead of the key Saturday and Sunday plays.


	Internationally, the full opening frame is expected to come in ahead of pre-weekend projections. Along with domestic, the global opening has already exceeded $100M with $111.3M through yesterday. 


	The little blue alien's top markets through Friday are Mexico ($9.4M), UK ($4.2M), France ($4.1M), Italy ($3.8M), Brazil ($3.7M), Germany ($2.5M), Central America ($2.2M), China ($2M/$5.7M through Saturday – not reflected in totals above), Spain ($2M).


	The other mega movie in the mix this frame, Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, is at $75.9M through Friday in 64 offshore markets (80% of the footprint). The Christopher McQuarrie-directed actioner has had extensive previews that began last weekend, as we noted in our global preview, and through Friday, it's running 8% ahead of the 2023 installment, which had similar previews, at the same point. 

	











	Along with domestic, the global total through Friday is $100.7M.


	The top markets are as follows, all are including previews: Korea ($8.9M), Japan ($6.5M), Australia ($5.4M), UK ($5.M/No. 2), France ($3.9M), Germany ($3.6M), Mexico ($1.9M), Brazil ($1.5M), Spain ($570K).Important to note that this is not a race between the two movies. Rather, it's a terrific energizer for cinemas around the world. Both Lilo and Mission are scoring with critics and with audiences; it's a wonderful way to kick off summer moviegoing.

	After first strutting into the ‘Werk Room' four years ago, Tina Burner is pulling back the wig to share her mental health journey.


	The RuPaul's Drag Race Season 13 alum, who is currently competing on Season 10 of All Stars, recently thanked the show's therapy resource, Queen Care, for helping her discover her autism and ADHD diagnoses after facing “hate” and “negativity” from fans the first time around.


	“Tomorrow I am back on your screens. Although exciting it also feels like I am bracing for a storm,” started Burner (real name Kristian Seeber) in an Instagram post. “The first time around on Season 13, I have to say, I wasn't fully prepared for what would follow. The darkness, the hate, the confusion.”

	Burner said she's “grown so much as a person” since her debut on the competition series in 2021. “I've pushed myself to actually find out who I really was,” she added.


	“Not only in my physical drag transformation, but more so on the inside,” wrote Burner. “My whole life there have been so many things I never understood. Why I am who I am. Why I act certain ways in social settings, in relationships, in friendships and just life in general. My overwhelming focus on things and certain patterns. For years I tried to ‘quiet the creative' inside me.”

	After turning to “overworking and alcohol” to “silence or slow down what I felt inside” during her debut season, Burner was introduced to Queen Care, which is “therapy at your disposal provided by RuPaul's Drag Race.”


	“For the first time in my life therapy didn't feel like a stigma but rather a tool to help,” wrote Burner, noting that Queen Care referred her to Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City, where she was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD.


	“I finally had answers to so many questions,” she wrote. “If you know me you know I love a project. For the first time in my life, THE PROJECT IS ME!!! SO I wanna say thank you Thank you for the hate. Thank you for the negativity. Without it I would have never found myself.”

The latest film from the Chilean director ('A Fantastic Woman,' 'The Wonder') is a musical drama inspired by a protest movement that swept Chile in 2018. 


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


	In 2019, a year after swells of protests swept through universities in Chile, a group of women, many of them blindfolded, took over the streets of Valparaiso, a coastal city in the country, to dance and sing a song that would go on to become an anthem. The performance was organized by LASTESIS, an interdisciplinary and trans-inclusive feminist collective, and it was their way of joining the global reach of the #MeToo movement. The lyrics to the song translated roughly to “A Rapist in Your Path” and even if you can't understand the words, the demonstration is powerful.

	There are similarly affecting scenes in Sebastián Lelio's The Wave, a spirited musical film about the 2018 university protests. The feature, which premiered at Cannes outside the main competition, chronicles the fictional experiences of a student named Julia (Daniela López), who wrestles with the realities of a recent sexual assault within the context of this burgeoning movement.

The Bottom Line

	
	A catchy anthem that at times rings hollow.
	



Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Cannes Premiere)Cast: Daniela López, Lola Bravo, Avril Aurora, Paulina CortésDirector: Sebastián LelioScreenwriters: Sebastián Lelio, Manuela Infante, Josefina Fernández, Paloma Salas

								2 hours 9 minutes			






The Wave is an ambitious spectacle, with Lelio (A Fantastic Woman, The Wonder) combining energetic songs and dance sequences with surrealist touches to tell a story of women's empowerment. Aesthetic flourishes abound, which make it an entertaining viewing experience, but one does wish that the narrative was a touch more complex. Lelio embeds some compelling meta-textual moments — ones that mostly address that fact that he's a man tackling this subject — but the actual story of Julia can feel secondary to the melodic pageantry.


	Still, with the stateside popularity of Emilia Perez, which premiered at Cannes last year, The Wave could find a meaningful audience in the U.S. should it get distribution. Lelio's film is more coherent in its politics than it is dramatically, and could resonate on that level with younger arthouse viewers. 


	When we meet Julia, she's going home with her TA, Max (Lucas Sáez Collins). How their evening ends remains a mystery (Lelio films the couple stumbling into Max's apartment and the door closing to us), but it haunts Julia. The following day at school, the women and nonbinary students marshal their peers to join a demonstration condemning how the university handles sexual assault cases. The protests takes the school by storm, and soon more women feel empowered to speak up about their experiences.

	











	Julia, somewhat reluctantly, joins the organizing efforts and becomes a member of a working group tasked with collecting survivor testimonies. Hearing all of these testimonies, which Lelio stitches together with the help of editor Soledad Salfate, compels Julia to come forward with her own story. 


The Wave, which was written by Lelio, Manuela Infante, Josefina Fernández and Paloma Sala, tackles many aspects of the #MeToo movement — and dynamics within organizing communities more broadly — with good intentions. That said, the results can be shaky. Part of the issue stems from the fact that Julia isn't a sturdy enough anchor; her character at times feels flat. 


	The university student initially struggles to speak up because she's working-class and on scholarship, while her assaulter comes from relative wealth. There's a compelling thread concerning these class differences, as well as the fact that Max considers himself to be a good guy. This complicates the otherwise straightforward narrative by imbuing it with higher stakes. One wishes that The Wave further embraced this type of gray area and the challenges that crop up in real-world cases involving sexual violence. 


	Unfortunately, for the most part, especially early on, The Wave sticks to the surface, offering a story that can feel like Feminism 101. There's also an overplayed metaphor about using one's voice that tips into cliché over the course of this 2-hour-plus film. To his credit, Lelio does take more risks in the second half of The Wave, when he breaks the fourth wall and adds surrealist touches that effectively blur the lines between Julia's reality and her memories. 

	











	In an exciting turn, the director also focuses on tensions that form within organizing communities because of competing goals or comfort levels with certain actions. Julia eventually falls into a sororal relationship with Rafa (Lola Bravo), Luna (Avril Aurora) and Tamara (Paulina Cortés), three other women who encourage her to confront her memories and report Max to university administrators. 


	Even when it falls short, The Wave boasts a commitment to its entrancing maximalist aesthetics (Benjamín Echazarreta serves as DP, Estefanía Larraín is the production designer and Muriel Parra does costumes). Lelio gathers an ensemble of more than 100 performers to stage dramatic dances (with choreography by Ryan Heffington) to rousing musical selections (music is by Matthew Herbert) about the difficulty of speaking up as a survivor, the manipulative tactics used by assailants, as well as the violent ineptitude of university administrators. The big numbers are anthemic, and just as affecting as LASTESIS' enduring protest song.

	The second week of Sean Combs' criminal trial brought another celebrity witness to the stand: Kid Cudi, who testified Combs stood posed like a “Marvel supervillain” when he confronted the jealous hip-hop mogul over his car being firebombed in 2012. 


	The alleged arson is central to the Southern District of New York's racketeering charge against Combs. It also helps bolster their claim that Combs kept his longtime girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, trapped in a decade-long abusive relationship through fear, coercion, and physical violence.


	Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution charges against him. His lawyers previously claimed no evidence directly connects Combs to a Molotov cocktail winding up in Kid Cudi's charred Porsche. 


	Nearly a dozen men and women took the stand this week to testify against Combs. Many had not seen Combs in years, while a few admitted they had sent sporadic messages to the music executive in recent years. Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard returned to the witness box following a brief appearance in the first week, as well as Ventura's mother, Regina, Ventura's former best friend of 17 years, Kerry Morgan, and Sharay Hayes, a male exotic dancer known as “The Punisher.”

	Combs seemed to be in good spirits despite most of his family's absence in court this week. He greeted his former personal assistant, George Kaplan, with a genuine smile. He laughed along with the court as another ex-personal assistant, David James, admitted he was “Diddy-bopping all around” Combs' New Year's Eve party after swiping a dose of MDMA from Combs' drug stash. 


	But Combs sat stone-faced when Kid Cudi — real name Scott Mescudi — detailed how his short-lived romance with Ventura went down in flames after he discovered that the R&B singer was dating Mescudi. 


	Combs also appeared to stew in silence as a Homeland Security Investigations special agent detailed the surplus of drugs, baby oil, and firearms seized from his Miami home and when clinical and forensic psychologist Dr. Dawn Hughes explained why victims remain in abusive relationships.

	Ventura isn't the only alleged victim in the case. An ex-girlfriend identified by the pseudonym “Jane” aka Victim-2 and a former employee referred to as “Mia” — Victim-4 — are also expected to testify against Combs. But there's a looming question mark over if another one of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Gina, will be called to the witness stand. (According to CNN, Gina is referred to in the indictment as Victim-3 and is not expected to testify.) 

	











	Already, Gina's name has popped up multiple times during the trial. Ventura and Morgan said Gina was a “problem” in Ventura's relationship with Combs, and Kaplan said he once saw Combs hurl decorative apples at Gina during a prolonged fight. This week, Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said Gina “is out of the case,” while the government shot back that she “is very much a part of this case.”


	Here are the key moments from the trial's second week: 


	Dressed casually in light wash jeans and a leather jacket, Kid Cudi strolled into the packed courtroom on Thursday morning. The 41-year-old appeared relaxed, seen smoking a cigarette as he pulled up to the federal courthouse in Manhattan. 


	Mescudi testified he had fallen in love with Ventura before their brief fling ended when Combs discovered the relationship in December 2011. In the early morning hours, Mescudi said he received a frantic call from Ventura, who sounded “really stressed on the phone, nervous, scared” after fleeing a furious Combs.

	Later that day, Mescudi said he received another distressed phone call, this time from Capricorn Clark, Ventura's friend and Combs' employee, who informed Mescudi that Combs was inside his house. Mescudi said he raced back to his home, calling Combs while on the way. 


	“I'm going to be very candid,” Mescudi told the courtroom. “I was like, ‘Motherfucker, are you in my house?' And he said, ‘I just want to talk to you.' I was like, ‘I'm on my way over right now.' He was like, ‘I'm here.'” But Combs was nowhere to be found once Mescudi arrived. Instead, Mescudi said he found presents from Chanel ripped open and his dog enclosed in a bathroom. 


	Mescudi refused to take Combs' repeated attempts to hash things out. “I told him, specifically told him: you broke into my house. You messed with my dog,” Mescudi said. “Like, I don't want to talk to you.” But Ventura and Mescudi's relationship fizzled out in the immediate aftermath of the break-in. “The drama, it was just getting out of hand,” Mescudi testified. “I kind of wanted to give her some space … for my safety, for her safety…”


	Still, the situation escalated on Jan. 9, 2012, when Mescudi learned a Molotov cocktail had been thrown inside his convertible Porsche, charring the inside of the luxury vehicle. Mescudi said he then decided to call Combs “because I knew he had something to do with” the car being firebombed. 


	Upon arrival at the members-only club, Mescudi said he saw Combs “staring out the window with his hands behind his back like a Marvel supervillain.” The meeting ended with the two shaking hands, but Mescudi asking about his car. “I don't know what you're talking about,” Combs responded. 

	











	The men left it at that. But Mescudi testified that he walked away thinking that Combs “was lying.” 


	During testimony from Combs' former personal assistants and a hotel manager, a number of Combs' strange personal habits came up — including his fondness of slathering Mott's applesauce on cheeseburgers and allegedly popping President Barack Obama-shaped Ecstasy pills. 


	David James, who worked for Combs from 2007 to 2009, said he was responsible for anticipating Combs' needs and whims, and would stock the mogul's hotel rooms with a variety of foods and toiletries. “He didn't always use these items, but I was always taught to provide everything just in case he needed something,” James explained. “That way he wouldn't need to call you later on.” 


	Among the items on Combs' preference sheet while traveling were Heinz ketchup, XXX-flavored Vitaminwater, Jello, Fiji water bottles, Ciroc vodka and Simply Lemonade. James said that Combs also kept his toiletry bag stocked with around 40 different products, including ointments and Just For Men hair and beard dye.


	On Thursday, L'Ermitage Beverly Hills general manager Fredric Zemmour pulled up what he testified was a hotel profile for Combs. Records indicate that Combs frequented the luxury hotel starting in 2008, with the bookings often being made under his and Ventura's various aliases. 


	Zemmour said the hotel kept an internal log of his preferences and housekeeping notes, including a mandate that the room required a deep cleaning after Combs checked out. “Always spill candle wax on everything and uses excessive amounts of oil,” the hotel note read. “Place the room out of order upon departure for deep cleaning. Please authorize an extra $1,000 when guest stays with us to cover any room damages.” 


	Another internal note read: “Please monitor outside his room. Down the hall to spray air freshener. Likes the room hot. Set thermostat to 75. Place a portable heater in the room prior to arrival.” 


	Sharay Hayes, an exotic male dancer known as “The Punisher,” gave more insight into what occurred during freak-offs with Ventura and Combs. Hayes estimated that he participated in up to a dozen sexual encounters with the celebrity couple between 2012 and early 2015. 


	The first time Hayes said he met Combs during a freak-off, the music executive entered the room fully nude, with his face hidden. “I could not see his face,” Hayes explained. “There was, like — I don't know it was called, it was like, what the Muslim women wear, where the face is covered completely in the veil and you can only see the eyes.” 

	











	Hayes said Combs would often give Ventura directions throughout the sexual encounter. “I don't have a thought process to her enjoyment level,” Hayes added. “It was my understanding was we were creating a sexy scene that was enjoyable for her partner.” 


Regina Ventura took the stand on Tuesday to testify that Combs “demanded” $20,000 from her in December 2011 after the hip-hop mogul became furious that Ventura was having a secret relationship with Kid Cudi. 


	Around the time of the demand, Regina said she received an alarming email from Ventura, who claimed that Combs was threatening to release sexually explicit videos of the R&B singer. “I was physically sick, Regina said. “I did not understand a lot of it,” she said. “The sex tapes threw me. I did not know the other person in it, but I knew that he was going to try to hurt my daughter.”        


	Regina said that an “angry” Combs contacted her, saying he needed to “recoup money that he had spent on [Ventura].” She rushed to take out a home equity loan for $20,000. She wired the money to one of Combs' bank accounts because, she said, “I was scared for my daughter's safety.” Regina said that the money was eventually returned with no explanation a few days later.   


	Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Gerard Gannon testified this week that an armored vehicle was used to ram through the iron front gate at Combs' Star Island mansion in a surprise raid last March. Dozens of officials searched the $48 million property for items that related to their sex trafficking and racketeering investigation, leaving the home with boxes of baby oil, firearms, platform exotic dancer heels, and a stash of narcotics.  


	Two de-serialized semi-automatic AR-15-style rifles were found in one of the closets in Combs' home, Gannon said. The lower part of the weapons were stored in a cardboard box, and the upper receivers were bundled up in a white towel. Gannon testified that because both guns had their serial numbers “cut out,” it made the process of identifying the weapon's owner “a lot more difficult or impossible.”


	During Combs' bail hearings last year, Combs' attorneys claimed the guns belonged to members of his security team. “He has nothing to do with how guns are kept in his house,”  Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said. “He has a professional security company that keeps firearms in the house.” However, as prosecutors pointed out during the same hearing, “it would be “absurd” that an “armed security in a professional security company would use defaced AR-15s and store them in pieces in the defendant's personal closet.” 

	











	Also stashed in the home's closets were several items that Ventura testified were routinely used in freak-offs. At least a dozen pairs of seven-inch platform heels were found in boxes and drawers; sex toys including “love cuffs,” rope, and oral sex candies; and packaged lingerie and sexy costumes were found, Gannon said. He said there were several dozen bottles of Astroglide and baby oil in a single closet. 


	A black Gucci bag was found in Combs' closet, which contained a surplus of powders and different-colored pills — including an orange triangle-shaped tablet that had a Tesla symbol on it — that later tested positive for ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, and an active ingredient that is found in Xanax. Some of the pills contained a mixture of ketamine and MDMA. Prosecutors said they also found a Lumify eye drop bottle in the pouch, and the liquid tested positive for ketamine and MDMA. 


	Four people this week testified they were present when Combs physically beat Ventura, all admitting they did not call law enforcement nor interfere with the rage-fueled attack because they were scared for their safety.


	Ventura's former best friend Kerry Morgan said she panicked during a Jamaica vacation in 2013 when she allegedly saw Combs drag Ventura by her hair down a long hallway before he violently pushed her to the ground, causing Ventura to knock her head on the brick pavement. Morgan said she chased after Ventura, who fled barefoot from Combs into a nearby wooded area. Together, they hid from Combs by crouching in a ditch for what “felt like hours,” Morgan said.


	Kaplan, who worked as Combs' assistant from 2013 to 2015, said once, during a private plane ride to Las Vegas in 2015, he heard the sound of glass shattering and a “tremendous commotion” coming from where Combs and Ventura were on the back of the plane. 


	He turned and allegedly saw an irate Combs standing over a distressed Ventura, with Combs holding a whiskey rock glass in his hand. “Isn't anybody seeing this?” Ventura cried out, Kaplan testified. He admitted that he looked the other way and didn't get involved because he was worried about jeopardizing his career. “I could not believe my good fortune would be working for such an icon,” he explained. “And the last way that I thought that I would be successful in that career would be to compromise his well-being in any way.” 

	











	Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money singer Dawn Richard testified she was shocked and scared when she allegedly saw Combs pick up a skillet and attempt to strike Ventura in the head with the pan in 2009. “He was beating her up in front of us,” Richard said of why she didn't try to stop the attack. “I was scared if I intervened or did anything, that it might get worse.”


	Celebrity makeup artist Mylah Morales said although she tried to encourage Ventura to seek medical treatment after Combs allegedly left Ventura with a black eye, a busted lip, and knots on her head in 2010, she was terrified of Combs. “I feared for my life because if he could do that to her…” Morales began, before Combs' defense team objected to her answer. When asked why she didn't report the alleged assault to police, Morales stayed firm. “I feared for my life,” she said. 


	Due to Memorial Day, the third week of the trial begins on Tuesday. Combs' former employee Capricorn Clark is expected to testify first, followed by two law enforcement officials.

	Ventura, Morgan, and Mescudi all mentioned Clark during their testimony. On Thursday, Mescudi said Clark alerted him that Combs had broken into his Hollywood Hills home in December 2011. 


	Before breaking for the long weekend, Assistant United States Attorney Maurene Comey told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian that the government was on track for the trial to be finished before the July 4th holiday weekend. Comey said prosecutors expect to take another four weeks, with the defense needing a week to present their case.

Right after winning season 23 of “American Idol” on May 18, 2025, Jamal Roberts was whisked from Los Angeles to New York to make media appearances, including performing on “Good Morning America” and appearing “Live with Kelly & Mark.”

Although he shared on social media how exciting that trip was, Roberts also told multiple reporters how pumped he was to go home to Meridian, Mississippi, eager to see family and friends including his two young daughters — Harmoni, 6, and Lyrik, 4 — and newborn daughter Gianna Grace. 

But Roberts also couldn't wait to make time for the staff and students at Meridian's Crestwood Elementary, where he works as a physical education teacher. Within days of his big win, the man known as “Coach Jamal” was back at the school on “bus duty,” as seen in a Facebook Live video posted to the school's Facebook feed.

With his star on the rise and his single “Heal” topping the iTunes charts, Roberts likely won't be returning to his full-time role at Crestwood Elementary anytime soon. But he plans to pitch in whenever he can. Even before “American Idol,” he worked there because he loved it while regularly performing gigs.

The 27-year-old told USA Today right after his win, “I wasn't really doing the teaching thing for the money. It was really the kids, (who are) just my inspiration. So even if I could go back every now and then, just show up and be a part of something, I plan to do that.”

That's exactly what he did during his first week as the season 23 winner, hanging out with staff who were thrilled to see him back, and running outside with a walkie talkie on “bus duty,” helping to get the kids where they needed to go after school. 

“He loves his Crestwood family,” the staffer filming the video sang while filming Roberts shaking his head and smiling at her as he sat atop a lunchroom table, surrounded by teachers happy to see him. “He came back home to be his authentic self! And he's on bus duty, he sure is.” 

“He's back for a little while,” she continued. “Don't rush off neither!”

A whopping 20,000 supporters gathered to see the mini-concert Roberts gave at City Hall as part of his hometown visit on “American Idol,” the show reported. On May 30, it's possible even more will show up there for a free “Celebration for Jamal Roberts” concert the city has planned at 7 p.m., per WTOK. 

Fans can bring lawn chairs to the event or pay $50 for a VIP ticket closer to the stage, according to materials about the event. 

Roberts has been enjoying some downtime at home, bonding with his newborn Gianna — born in early May — and even stopped by Exclusive Cuts for a trim, as shared on Facebook by local hairdresser Dermaine Johnson on May 22. 

Roberts will be in Nashville for CMA Fest on June 4, but has a couple of other Mississippi concerts planned in future months, according to Super Talk Mississippi. On August 8, he's scheduled to perform at Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero Blues Club in Biloxi — a gig planned before his “Idol” run that's already sold out. 

Meanwhile, on September 19, Roberts will headline a fundraising concert at the Jackson Convention Complex titled “A Night of Soul, Celebration, & Support for Alcorn State Athletics.” General admission is $110, with VIP tables available for $1500.

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


Thierry Frémaux, the Delegate Général of the Cannes Film Festival, is propping up the Majestic Beach's main bar. The joint's buzzing, the victors being lionized after what has been acknowledged as a strong competition and selection, and I have the temerity to wonder idly when he'll retire.


	“I don't know,” he murmurs. “You know, in France the social contract is something different.”


	“Even if I'm fired, I stay,” he finishes defiantly.


	He laughs, then turns the tables and cheekily asks when I will retire.


	“I don't want you to retire,” he says caressing my arm. ”Stay with us.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Fremaux first visited Cannes in 1979, driving from Lyon in a truck. Every day that year he remained on the Croisette without watching any movies “because I couldn't attend any film. Each evening I used to go back to the highway and sleep in the car in the gas station.”


	Today (it now being the early hours of Sunday) he says, he will pick up his car at the Carlton ”and go back to Lyon like I was 19 again,” he says wistfully.


	“It's in my tradition to come by car… we need to feel, I don't want to say forever young, but it is something like that. When you, me, whoever, are in the screening room there is no age. No young people, no old people.” 


	Together we marvel over the diversity of the winners. There's Jafar Panahi, the Iranian-born director of Palme d'or winner It Was Just An Accident, and Norwegian Joachim Trier who took the Grand Prix prize for Sentimental Value. Oliver Laxe, director of Sirât, born in Paris to Galician emigrants, was joint Jury Prize winner with Berlin-born Mascha Schilinski the director of Sound of Falling, and so on all the way to Nigerian-born Akinola Davies Jr. who was garlanded with a Special Mention by the Caméra d'or jury for My Father's Shadow which was shown in Un Certain Regard.


	I note that Nadia Melliti who is French-Algerian heritage was named best actress for her beautifully captured performance as a young woman discovering her attraction for other women in Hafsia Herzi's The Little Sister, while it seemed that the the Cannes bubble was cheering for Jennifer Lawrence to win for Die, My Love – Lynne Ramsay's incendiary study of the disintegration of a marriage. Melliti tells me that Herzi's casting director discovered her “walking along the street.” She'd never acted before. Her background was in sport. Now it's in acting.  

	











	I tell Frémaux that it angers me that people forget that Cannes represents the whole world, not just the white western bit of it, and that cinema isn't just the shiny and splashy stuff from Hollywood.


	Nodding in agreement, Frémaux remarks that since the origin of Cannes “we are universal,” and remembers John Ford's comment, “Be local, you will be universal.”


	“We are not in France,” says Frémaux. ”Cannes is not a French film festival. It's a film festival in France and it's an international film festival,” he says reminding me that its official name is Festival International du Film.


	“We have for the first time Nigeria in Un Certain Regard. We have Czech, Iran… Cannes is a journey. We make that journey in the selection process.”


	He observes that in the past Asia meant films only from Japan. “And then in the beginning of the new century, Korea, China, Singapore, Thailand. And now it's Africa and not only ex-French Africa,” while conceding that “maybe not enough” attention had been paid to Africa: “Again, it's a frustration of the festival” but “we pay attention on what is going on everywhere …”


	He looks me in the eye because he knows I'm about to ask about America and the orangutan in the White House, and I mean no offence to the great apes. However, he cuts me off at the chase. “Regarding, of course, the US and what is going on in the world, in cinema not only in Cannes, there is no border. The language is cinema, the emotion is cinema or cinema is emotion. And the emotion is the same wherever you were born.”


	I wonder if others will second my emotion that Ari Aster's Eddington is a masterpiece about the sad decline of the United States?


	Frémaux and I warmly embrace and I scoot over to Renate Reinsve who's so darn good in Trier's Sentimental Value. The actress is taking a break, she tells me, ahead of starring in Alexander Payne's already announced movie Somewhere Out There. “Not one person has a bad word to say about Alexander and I'm looking forward to working with him,” says Reinsve, although she refuses to say what the film's about, except that “it's a remarkable script.”


	Filming, she says, begins in February on locations in Denmark and Ireland.


	Stellan Skarsgård plays Reinsve's father, a film director, in Sentimental Value. I tell him that the character reminds me, in part, of Lear, except that his filmmaker overcomes his madness.


	Later, I chat briefly to Elle Fanning who, as I noted in a previous column, excels in Sentimental Value, just as she did in James Mangold's A Complete Unknown.


	Fanning plays a Hollywood “type actress” in Trier's movie, but says, that she and the director tried not to make her a caricature. Whatever they did, it's some of her best work.  She says that her performance was aided by the fact that she went from shooting Predator: Badlands in New Zealand directly to filming a beach scene with Skarsgård in Deauville. “It was the kind of role my character might have played, so it was very meta,” says Fanning.


	Before he goes, I snap a few photos of Trier and his editor Oliver Bugge Coutté. They've been friends for years and, back in the day, shared an apartment with three others in St. John's Wood, NW London, while they were students at  the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield.

	











	The flat was ideally situated, he says, because it was close to Marylebone train station, “just a few stops to the school,” where the late agent Jenne Casarotto first saw his work and signed him. He's still with the Casarotto Ramsay & Associates agency, represented by Elinor Burns.


	Akinola Davies Jr. shows the same devotion to his longtime agent Roxana Adle at LARK management. The My Father's Shadow director has been inundated since the film was shown at the festival. But he's staying firm with both Adle and Element's Rachel Dargavel.


	“To get to me, they'll have to go through Roxana,” says Davies who was on a hike outside Marseilles when he received a message suggesting he return to Cannes in time for the closing ceremony.


	He was dressed in shorts, T-shirt and boots and his black-tie clobber was in a car miles away in Marseilles. Somehow, he and Nicholas Hayes,his producing partner at Red Clay Pictures, made it back to the Palais in time.


	I felt sad that Akinola's brother Wale, with whom he wrote the film, was not with him.


	However, I shall never forget when Davies's name was called and he stood up – and stood out due to his blond-dyed hair – and the world of cinema applauded him.


	I couldn't make out what he was saying; was it to the crowd or to himself, I asked? “I have a little motto I repeat to myself when I'm nervous,” he responds, about not being alone and to be kind to yourself and others.


	Davies spent most of the night hanging out with Hayes, Dargavel, the BFI's Ama Ampadu, as well as Element's Emma Norton and producer Lee Groombridge who were producers on Pillion.


Pillion's director Harry Lighton won the best screenplay honour in Un Certain Regard and he was on the Majestic Beach too and there was something touching about seeing them engaging and being supportive of each other.


	Spotting Jafar Panahi, I went over to pay my respects and to point out that his winning the Palme d'or had brought tears to Cate Blanchett's eyes.


	“I saw that,” he acknowledges softly behind dark glasses he's still sporting at one in the morning.


	I play the room and the pier one last time. Then I hear the beat of Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now). I look over to the dance floor and it sinks in that the world Frémaux was talking about is on that floor letting its collective hair down.


	The beat that brings us together must never stop.

	The one person who actually went to prison for the 2021 shooting death of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins is free just weeks after the tragedy suffused Alec Baldwin starring indie Western premiered and then promptly disappeared in a cloud of box office dust earlier this month.


	According to the New Mexico Department of Corrections, the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was granted parole earlier this week and released on May 23. Having served the state statute required 85% of her 18-month sentence and received extra marks for good behavior and the completion of a drug rehab program, records show Gutierrez-Reed having signed out of the Western New Mexico Correctional Facility on Friday morning. She quickly headed to her home in Bullhead City, Arizona where she will serve out her parole.

	A very situation specific part of that parole is that Gutierrez-Reed cannot have contact with Hutchins' widower, child or any other member of the filmmaker's family.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The stepdaughter of famed movie gun coach Thell Reed, the relatively inexperienced Gutierrez-Reed was charged with involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering out of Hutchins' death from a gun in Baldwin's hand going off.  Even before Gurierrez-Reed was charged in January 2023, the prosecution claimed the armorer was responsible for live rounds ending up on the Rust set. In a production under intense budget and time crunches, and film crews quitting, those live rounds got into Baldwin's 1880s Colt .45 replica that that fired during rehearsals on the Bonanza Creek set, striking Hutchins and director Joel Souza. 


	With her parole stretching from May 23, 2025 to May 23, 2026, the twentysomething Gutierrez-Reed has to get a job, as well as submit to a curfew, and mental health assessment as some of the conditions of her parole. She also can't own guns, has to meet regularly with a parole officer and agree to electronic monitoring. In point of fact, Gutierrez-Reed is under what's called dual supervision. That shakes down as a year for her involuntary manslaughter convictions and a year and a half for a different charge of “unlawfully” entering a firearm banning Santa Fe bar before Rust went into production with a gun on her.

	











On March 6, 2024, a Sante Fe jury found the Rust armorer guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal October 21, 2021 shooting. Despite the state's best effort, the jurors' decision was split as they decided the defendant was not guilty of evidence tampering. Six weeks later, Gutierrez-Reed was sentenced to 18 months bars.


	Baldwin never ended up spending a second in prison, nor even a full week before a jury in his own case last summer. The media frenzy matter was tossed out four days in by the judge due to evidence suppression by the prosecution and local cops. All appeals have been dropped, though the 30 Rock actor and now reality star in January filed paperwork to pursue a civil rights violations lawsuit against the special prosecutors.


	Gutierrez-Reed continues to have appeal of her conviction moving through the New Mexico courts. Her defense lawyer Jason Bowles did not respond Saturday to request for comment from Deadline on his client's release from prison.


	Finding a new cinematographer in Bianca Cline, the eventually finished Rust debuted at a Polish film festival in December 2024. The movie finally found U.S. distribution via Falling Forward Films, with a short lived domestic theatrical run starting on May 2.

The two films fueled the biggest Memorial Day weekend in history, while 'Lilo' supplanted Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' as the holiday's top opener of all time (he's also the mainstay star of the 'M:I' series). 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The Memorial Day box office is on fire. 


	Disney's live-action redo of Lilo & Stitch and Tom Cruise‘s final Mission: Impossible movie, from Paramount and Skydance, fueled the biggest start-of-summer holiday weekend of all time, based on Sunday estimates. Lilo & Stitch blew away all expectations with a record-smashing domestic debut of $183 million and a jaw-dropping $341.7 million globally, while Mission: Impossible —  The Final Reckoning opened to a series-best $77 million domestically and $190 million worldwide.

	Female-fueled Lilo was always expected to beat the latest M:I title, but no one imagined it would hit these heights and, in an ironic twist, see Lilo & Stitch supplant Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick ($160 million) to rank as the biggest Memorial Day opener of all time, not adjusted for inflation. That's not the only irony: Cruise-starrer Minority Report barely beat the original animated Lilo & Stitch when they opened opposite each other in June 2002.

	Three weeks ago, Lilo & Stitch was tracking to open to $120 million. On Thursday, that number had grown to $165 million. But it came in even higher. The reason?


Stitch isn't just drawing interest from families; it's interest exploded among teenage girls and younger women adults — i.e., Gen Z and younger Millennials — who grew up on the first movie and resulting TV show about a Hawaiian girl with a fraught family life who adopts an adorable, albeit trouble-making, dog-like alien. Box office pundits say the nostalgic factor is running high, just as it did among Millennials and Gen Z'ers for Disney's live-action Aladdin, which made $1.1 billion in global ticket sales after getting families, teens and younger adults. Rideback produced both Lilo and 2019's Aladdin.


	For a minute, the live-action Lilo & Stitch was originally intended to go straight to Disney+, helping to explain its modest $100 million production budget. 


	Both films benefited from strong critics scores and glowing audience exits, including five-out-of-five stars from moviegoers polled by industry-leading service PostTrak. Lilo has a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 70 percent and nabbed an A CinemaScore from audiences.


Lilo & Stitch began its historic run by grossing a huge $55 million on Friday from 4,410 theaters, including a record $14.5 million in Thursday previews, the largest preview gross of the year to date and a Memorial Day record for Disney's live-action studio after besting The Little Mermaid ($10.3 million) and Aladdin ($7 million), not adjusted for inflation. Regarding Disney's larger film empire, Thursday's previews also beat Memorial Day entry Solo: A Star Wars Story ($14.1 million). Overall, it repped the seventh-biggest preview gross of any PG title, including Disney's recent animated blockbuster Moana 2 ($13.8 million).

	











Final Reckoning — which had a lock on Imax screens — more than made up for the lackluster $54.7 million bow of Dead Reckoning, as well as supplanting the $61.2 million three-day launch of Fallout to set a new franchise opening record with a three-day gross of roughly $63 million. M:I movies have never been big openers since diehard fans are usually older adults. Ticket buyers over the age of 55 made up the largest chunk of Friday's audience, followed by the coveted 18 to 25 demo. It boasts a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 80 percent and earned an A- CinemaScore.


	Cruise's film, directed by his go-to partner Christopher McQuarrie, began its run with a Friday gross of $24.8 million from 3,857 theaters, including Thursday previews. The film set its own preview record in earning a franchise-best $8.3 million, ahead of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One ($7 million) and Mission: Impossible — Fallout ($6 million).


	A major challenge in terms of Final Reckoning‘s financial success is its $400 million net budget before marketing — making it one of the most expensive films ever made — although Paramount insiders note that each new installment increases the value of the entire library, including a spike in home entertainment sales and rentals of previous titles.


	Thanks to the might of the two films, overall ticket sales for the holiday weekend will come in north of $325 million. The previous Memorial Day revenue crown belonged to the $306 million in ticket sales collected in 2013 when Fast & Furious 6 zoomed to $117 million, followed by The Hangover Part III with $50 million. It would also mark the best showing for two Memorial Day titles going up against each other. In 2007, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End opened to $140 million over the holiday frame, followed by Shrek the Third with $67 million.

	











	While the mash-up isn't expected to be quite the same cultural phenomenon that Barbenheimer was in July 2023, the potent combo of the two movies can't be ignored (as for a moniker, how about “Stitchin: Impossible”?)


	Overseas, Lilo & Stitch likewise went up against Final Reckoning, although the M:I movie began rolling in a handful of major markets last weekend via aggressive previews.


Lilo is reporting an international opening of $158.7 million, likewise ahead of expectations. In a number of territories, it has scored the highest opening day of the year so far, including in China, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France and Italy.


Final Reckoning is reporting an international start of $127 million through Sunday. Both its domestic and international openings were in line with expectations. The movie doesn't open in China until May 30. 


	Also stocking the Memorial Day blaze was the second weekend of New Line and Warner Bros.' Final Destination: Bloodlines, which placed third with an estimated $24 million for the four days for an early domestic cume of $94.6 million and $187.1 million globally. Marvel and Disney's Thunderbolts* came in fourth with an estimated $12 million in its fourth weekend for a domestic cume hovering around $174 million, followed by Ryan Coogler and Warners' sleeper sensation Sinners, which earned another $11.2 million in its sixth weekend. Sinners will finish Monday with an estimated domestic cume of $259 million and $341 million worldwide.

	











	Estimates will be updated Monday morning.

Weekend Editor


	Renowned comedian and actor Dick Van Dyke revealed that he and longtime friend, the late great Ed Asner, were set to team for a remake of classic comedy The Odd Couple prior to the latter's death in 2021.


	“That would've been such fun, and we lost it. I've lost a lot of friends,” Van Dyke said during a Q&A at a Dick & Arlene Van Dyke Present Vandy Camp event held in Malibu, Calif. today, per People.


	Wife Arlene Van Dyke chimed in, adding, “He's outlived everybody. That's the curse of living to almost 100.” (Van Dyke is 99, and Asner was 91 when he died.) Despite this, she maintained that the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang star is “still so positive” in the face of grief.“Well, life's been good to me. I can't complain,” Dick answered as to how he stays upbeat. He added later of why he continues to perform and entertain, “I'm a ham. I love it. I get a jolt of energy from an audience.”

	











The Odd Couple — about two recently divorced men, neurotic neat-freak Felix and carefree slob Oscar, who decide to live together — was created by Neil Simon in 1965 as a play, before he translated it for the silver screen three years later with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in the roles. A box office and critical success, the comedy was later adapted into sitcom format for ABC, featuring Tony Randall as Felix and Jack Klugman as Oscar, running for five seasons beginning in 1970 and winning three Emmys. A sequel to the original film was released exactly three decades later, exploring the titular duo's road trip to their son and daughter's wedding, but it was a critical and commercial bust.

[Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.']

Mid-way through his conversation with IndieWire, Richard Harmon paused for a passing truck. Already on location for his next movie, the “Final Destination Bloodlines” actor stepped offset in sunny British Columbia to pick apart his performance as Erik Campbell in Warner Bros.' hit reboot. 

Directed by Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky, the sixth installment in New Line's beloved freak accident franchise is the best movie of its kind. It also has one of the funniest and most relatable characters in the series: a magnetic fan favorite Harmon was destined to play but who the actor calls “misunderstood.”

“I'm not bad, just drawn that way,” he quipped on behalf of them both. A testament to Harmon's kaleidoscopic talent — and a fitting ode to the friendly 2000s faces genre fans once had to loiter in Hot Topic to meet — the hilarious alt sweetheart is a great excuse to quote Jessica Rabbit. Promoting the vicious summer blockbuster, which opens on a high-res restaurant collapse set in the '60s that feels very “Looney Tunes,” Harmon has readily defended his complex performance to the press.

“Obviously, I wanted him to be likable,” the actor told IndieWire. “The amount of interviews I've done where people are like, ‘So, Richard, you play a bit of a dick!' And I have to keep fighting back on that.” An accomplished Canadian actor, who made his debut in the cult classic “Trick ‘r Treat,” Harmon has spent his career haunting across genres with memorable indie appearances (including 2013's “If I Had Wings”) and a slew of horror TV performances, from “The 100” to “Bates Motel.”

Sacrificed to a second triumphant weekend at the box office, Erik Campbell doesn't survive “Bloodlines,” but the impact of Harmon's tragicomic arc suggests a “Final Destination” legacy all its own. From a surprise reunion with former school classmate Max Lloyd-Jones to several alternative Jerry Fenbury reactions left on the cutting room floor, read on for lifelong franchise fan Richard Harmon's complete post-mortem account of the dreamiest nightmare in his filmography so far. 

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
 










You love these movies, famously. Tell me about your history with “Final Destination.”

Well, I was 11 when the second one came out, and I remember me and a few of my elementary school friends were having a sleepover. I forget whose parents' house it was, but they didn't look at the rating of the film that they rented for us. Our request was the second “Final Destination,” so that was the first one I saw actually. And we were just howling. We loved it. Well, some people couldn't watch it. But I could watch it and I loved it. Then, I went back and watched the first one, and then I watched the third, fourth, fifth, and now I'm in the sixth. I've watched them over and over and over and over again. The one that I've seen the least is mine, but I'm sure that I'll eventually have seen it the most. 

What do you like about them as a comfort watch?

I'm just a real horror movie fan. “Comfort watch” is the right way to put it. It's very soothing to make light of death, which I don't think we get the opportunity to do very often in our real lives, because it's obviously the thing we fear the most. But for an hour and a half when you're watching a “Final Destination” movie, you get to kind of root for death, which is rare. That's pretty fun and kind of takes away from the constant fear we all have.

 










Take me back to your debut with “Trick ‘r Treat” and your first credit as Vampire Kid. 

When I was 15, I was thinking about quitting acting, you know? I was a teenager, so I didn't take it very seriously back then. I just knew that I loved being on set, but I hadn't booked any big roles or anything up to that point. I kept having to spend time doing auditions that I never booked, and, you know, poor 15-year-old me, I guess, he was frustrated. 

Then, I got an audition for “Trick ‘r Treat,” and I said, “OK, fine, this is my last audition. I'll give it a chance.” Got a callback. Got another callback. Got to meet Mike Dougherty, who directed it and wrote it. He's an amazing, amazing filmmaker, and I ended up getting the role. But even then, I was saying, “Well, I'll leave the business this way after this.” 

It was a two-month shoot, which at that point was the longest I'd ever done. And of course, I just fell in love with it and suddenly thought, “There's no way I can quit this. I need to make this work!” I started working a lot harder than I had before, and said to myself, “If you're really going to do this, take it seriously.” I was already in love with Halloween and horror but with “Trick ‘r Treat,” it was even more so.

How did you end up auditioning for “Final Destination Bloodlines”? 
 










It was funny! My agent sent it to me over an email that said, “You have an audition for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.'” And I just thought, “No way, they're bringing back the franchise? I gotta be a part of this!” I auditioned for Erik. I thought I did really well. Then, I didn't hear back for eight months. I knew when they were supposed to start shooting it, so I was like, ‘I didn't get that.' I even auditioned to play my grandfather in the '60s, but I'm so much more Erik. I'm not this all-American heartthrob like Max Lloyd-Jones. We went to high school together, oddly enough.

Really? That's crazy. 

Same grade. We were the two actors. Now, he's playing my granddad. [Laughter.] But I knew I was never going to book that — and I didn't. Eight months went by and the strikes happened. When production came back, they said again, “You have an audition for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.'” And I got a little pissy about it and was like, “I already auditioned for Erik. I already did this role. They can just see my old tape.” 

That's a very Erik reaction.

[Laughter.] Yeah, but my agent was like, “Richard, please. Just do the audition.” So, I did it and the very next day, I'm getting off this red-eye flight into New York City. I had barely slept, and suddenly they're asking, “Can you be available to do a Zoom with the directors tomorrow?” I was still in New York, staying on my friend's couch, and I told my friend, “You got to leave.” 

 










So, I did it with them and I thought it went well. I kept saying to myself, “God, I would love to be a part of this.” They took a week and I knew it was coming down to me and a couple other guys. I'm hoping. I'm praying. Then, I got the call from my agents that I had booked it, and I bawled my eyes out. I cried on my kitchen floor. It was like the greatest thing that's ever happened. I sit here on this bench now, and I still believe it might be the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. Other than meeting my girlfriend and all that, of course. But this is up there! 

When were you able to chat with your former peer/eventual grandfather about both getting cast in “Bloodlines”? What was Max's reaction? 

We were on set, actually. I came to the first day, when they were shooting some of the stuff in the '60s. I just wanted to get the vibe of the production because every film and TV set brings its own. So even though I wasn't working, I wanted to show up, hang out, see how our wonderful directors Adam and Zach worked, and figure out how to best prepare myself. That's where I saw Max. We had a big hug, and it was pretty wild! We couldn't believe we were both in this(*). 

(*) In an email to IndieWire, Lloyd-Jones reacted to Harmon's performance and wrote, “I've been so impressed watching Richard's rise since we first met in Mr. Grenier's 8th grade drama class at Sentinel Secondary School.” He continued, “I felt very lucky to share the stage with my boy. His screen presence is magnetic and it made me very happy to watch him get the biggest laughs and in my opinion the gnarliest death of the franchise.” 

 










Richard, you, Max, and Zach, you're all Canadian, right? I feel like a lot of people don't know the country's history with the franchise.

Yeah, a lot of it was shot in Vancouver. All of them except for the fourth one, really. That was Atlanta and New Orleans. But other than that, it's been a Vancouver franchise. Most of the leads aren't from Canada, but in this one, we have me, we have Max, and we have Kaitlyn Santa Juana as Stefani, who's our wonderful number one and my character's cousin. We're all locals, which is rare to book a big budget film in Vancouver as one of the locals. You rarely ever get that opportunity. We were finally able to break that door down, I guess.

Do you think that's part of why you had such great chemistry with your cast? Anna Lore's not from there, but she was saying what an amazing time she had.

It was so special for all of us. It didn't matter where any of us were from. Anna's in Los Angeles now. Owen Patrick Joyner's from Oklahoma. Rya Kihlstedt is in Los Angeles, too. But it was just sheer luck that every single person on this cast was so nice. We fell in love with each other so much and became a family. I've been texting them this morning. We're on a group chat that hasn't stopped since we were filming the movie.

 










Does it have a name?

Final Dipshits.

You've got two major scenes in “Bloodlines,” including the rare “Final Destination” fake-out. Let's start with Erik getting strung up by his nose ring at the tattoo shop. How was that? 

It was only the second week of shooting, and it was just amazing to film. I was on wires. There was real fire underneath me. I'm literally being hung by my nose. They built that whole set inside of a studio so they could have wire tracks all along the ceiling. No acting was needed, really. 

How did that work from a practical perspective? 

There was something inside of my nose. Do you know those things that sort of open your nostrils? They're for people that can't breathe through their noses when they're sleeping. They had that, but they reversed it, almost. It was able to spread pressure across my nose so it wasn't too heavy on any one area of my nostril. That was great because then I wasn't in so much pain. Then, they put me up on the wires, which kind of went through the chain that you see attached to my nose. They hid them up through that, and when I moved, they were able to follow me and hold me so I didn't fall flat on my ass. But, yeah, they basically just lit the fire and let me go. It was incredible.

 










And you truly had a good time doing all of that? It wasn't—

It was some of the most fun I have ever had. Seriously. 

Let's keep going in order. Your next scene isn't Erik's biggest but you play a critical part setting up Julia/Anna's moment with the garbage truck. That's also the first real kill in the Campbell family. How did you feel about approaching that scene and teeing up your sister's demise? 

That's the thing. We're all so excited to meet our dooms in these films. That's what these movies do to you. Like, I wanted to die. I wanted to die horribly! To set that scene up, we actually had a little bit of an issue that day because the dump truck stopped working. It just stopped picking things up, which is obviously a problem when you're putting a stunt actor inside and legitimately throwing her into a pile of blankets and pillows. We had to move it to another day because, as a rule, you have to make a stunt work like a hundred times without fail before you can even think about putting a performer in there. 

When we came back to redo it, I thought it worked beautifully. What I love about that scene is that the whole thing takes place in soft focus in the background while Erik is talking, but you still see everything that's happening to Julia. You see her get hit in the head with that ball and then just flip right into the trash. It might be my favorite death in the movie. It's absolutely hilarious.

 










It's so effective and snaps the focus onto Erik just as the emotional side of “Bloodlines” is really starting to hit. Chatting with Adam and Zach, they went on and on about how much improv you did for the film. Was Jerry Fenbury in the script? How did we get there?

Ah, Jerry Fenbury. [Laughter.] I'm hoping there's a bonus feature on the DVD that includes the like 35 different takes we did for that scene. Jerry Fenbury was in the script, but how I reacted to it was not. I knew I was supposed to be heartbroken, go to leave, and then my mom, April Telek, would follow me out. But Zach and Adam were like, “Hey, if you wanna throw something in when you leave, like a little button, just do it.” I've got plenty of those. So, that's where we found, “Is that why he always wants to play catch?” We had a lot of takes, but I did a different one every single time. That was the only time I ever said that. 

Can you give me some alts? 

One we couldn't use because we had to call cut when Kaitlyn and the rest of them broke down laughing. As I left the room, I had a tear in my eye, and I turned around and I was like, “Oh, God, is that why he always calls me Buckaroo?“

Another one was like, “Is that why he always hands me hard candies?” Or, “Is that why he came to every single one of my swim meets?” I'm trying to remember all of them now. There were more than 30 of them. “Is that why he always follows me into the park?” “Is that why he sends me Christmas cards every year?” 

 










There was one where he wasn't a loser. The whole impression you get of Jerry Fenbury from their reaction to it, especially Owen's reaction as my brother, is that he's a fucking loser. When Bobby hears it, he's like, “Oh, God. Not him.” So, for one of the takes, I switched it up to Jerry not being a loser. I heard the cue, looked at April, and went, “Fuck, mom. Fenbury got you too?!“

We had a lot, a lot, a lot of takes that I hope one day I get to see(*). 

(*) Speaking with IndieWire, “Final Destination Bloodlines” editor Sabrina Pitre said she'd be happy to take on the project — adding, “I was completely spoiled with choices because of Richard.” 

You also had options for props. How did you choose the Show Me Your Kitties mug?

We had five different mugs, and I chose the Show Me Your Kitties mug, which in fact now lives at my house. I fully took it. I forget what the other options were because that had to be it. I don't even use that mug. It's on my mantle. One of our prop guys snuck it to me at the end of the day. I was like, “Dude, I want this mug.” He looked at me, then he looked around, and then he shoved it into my hand and said, “Walk away. Now.” And I went, “OK, yep!”

In the history of “Final Destination,” “Bloodlines” is the first film to really capture the feel of the franchise's overall legacy. Erik is one of the more sympathetic victims of Death's Design, if only because the Jerry Fenbury reveal tells us he's in a situation that he could have walked away from. What can you share about getting Erik to that hospital? And who do you think he is at his core? 
 










That was maybe my favorite thing about playing this character, that he looks like a horror trope. When people see the way I look as Erik, and see the tattoos and piercings that they put on me, they make an assumption about every other alt-looking emo, punk-rock character that we've seen played in the genre since the '80s, you know? I feel like that trope came around then and we haven't left it. First and foremost because it's a trope that works. 

I'm not shitting on any actor that has done that trope and done that trope well. But what I loved about doing Erik was that, when I read the script and saw in the tattoo scene that it says that he opens his phone to see a photo of him and his dad, it informed me. I knew then that he cared about his family more than anything. That's actually Erik's driving force, which I don't know if it originally was supposed to be. But to me the number one thing about him is that he cares about his family. He doesn't have to follow Bobby, but he's like, “I'll be damned, that's still my brother.” Even if Fenbury-wise, he's not exactly. That's still his little brother and he won't let him die.

And it's such an emotional scene! I'm telling you, I cried. 

Yay! I don't know why I'm saying, “Yay!” But, yay! I'm so glad you cried.

 










Erik seems like someone horror fans will really relate to. He's countercultural and independent, but he also does the right thing — and he does the hard thing — only to get screwed for it. That's tragic. 

Totally. Even when he doesn't believe Kaitlyn's character, Stefani, because why would he at that point, he sees that she's making his mom cry and is confrontational about it. Critics have said to me, “Why was he so rude to her on the way out of the door?” When he's like, “Fuckin' stop.” With that, I keep saying it's because he's telling her to back off. Like, “I'm the man of the house now. My dad is dead. I'm not gonna fucking stand here and let you break my family's heart again and again. So fuckin' stop it right now.” Erik dies next, and he says that to Stefani because he's starting to realize that she's going down a path that will hurt his family. Erik would never just allow that to happen. 

Please, take me inside the MRI machine. What was it like shooting Erik and Bobby's deaths and the comedy beats leading up to that? The moment with the nursery is great. 

Oh, we love that. So much of that was ad lib. In the script, the line was like, “No, no, we could never.” But then me and Owen just kept looking back at the babies and riffing. My favorite line in the entire movie is actually Owen's in that scene. Erik looks back at the nursery an obnoxious amount of times and Bobby just goes, “Don't hurt those babies.” It's so good. 

 










Owen gave one of my favorite performances in the movie just by being so genuine. He was another one that could have been a horror trope. People shorthand Bobby as a himbo or jock, which is kind of originally what that character was. I remember in the script at one point, he was introduced by handing Stefani a beer. He was going to have a football with him all the time too, stuff like that. But Owen played Bobby as the most genuine sweetheart you could ever find — and that made it so easy for me. Owen is stronger than me. He is bigger than man. But Erik and Bobby still have that brotherly dynamic where it doesn't matter how big the little brother gets, big brother's still big brother.

How did you keep that focus while managing everything on the practical side?

Going into the MRI machine was incredible, but with characters, it's about the details. It was maybe the third scene that Owen and I shot, all during our first week. We knew it was going to be funny, but it was also important emotionally that you could see Erik being cocksure about his plan and also scared of it, because he really doesn't know that it's going to work. He just wants to save Bobby

I give so much credit to our directors. I think it was Zach who said, “On the next take, when you say, ‘I'm not gonna let you die,' you are gonna let him die. So realize that and say it.” That works in the scene because it's funny but also heartfelt. You have that and you have the tears in my eyes, while I'm looking at him like, “Technically, I'm going to let you die — but I am bringing you back!” That's where the family love comes in and our chemistry as actors, which came together right when we first met, comes in to help really convey, “He's my brother.” 

 










There's a sense of affection in that scene and the rest of the movie that is just so infectious. I'm thinking about the garbage truck moment with Julia again, when she notices that heart-shaped burn on your arm next to the “DAD” tattoo. What does she call you there? 

Oh, my God, Kiki. She calls me Kiki! Anna threw that in on the first take, and I was like, “Did she just call me fuckin' Kiki?” It's weirdly perfect. Erik. Kiki. Somehow it makes sense.

Knowing how much you enjoy the other “Final Destination” movies, I have to ask you about working with the late great Tony Todd. What do you remember about meeting him?

I mean, you have a legend like Tony Todd, who I've been watching since I was a kid. I saw “Candyman” when I was probably 13 or 14. The voice and all that, it sticks with you. Then, you have him come to set and you can see he's not well when he gets there, but you never would've been able to tell by his face — because all he did was smile. All he did was remind us to have fun. He just kept asking, “Are you having fun?” And I said, “I am, Mr. Todd.” And he said, “It shows.” 

 










He also said, “Never forget these are the best times.” And he was right. He was so welcoming and kind, particularly for a man who has played all sorts of evil in his career. He was everything you could ever hope him to be. That ending bit with him when he leaves, that wasn't in the script either. The directors just said, “Say whatever you'd like on the way out, say goodbye to the fans.” 

To me, it was pretty clear that he wasn't just saying goodbye to the fans. He was saying goodbye to everything. It was beautiful to see. I was crying on the other side of the camera, for sure. It was the perfect goodbye. Not just to the “Final Destination” fandom, but to everyone that's ever loved Tony Todd and watched him on screen. 

It breaks my heart that Erik can't come back for another “Final Destination,” but you definitely made your mark on the franchise. Are you walking away with any ink for the movie? Are you a tattoo guy?

I have 12, actually. I'm going to get a little skull somewhere, and I think Owen is going to get one as well. It's the perfect tribute. This movie changed my life. Whatever I book next is going to be because of “Final Destination.” I don't know what it'll do for me. I have no idea. But it changed my life. I got to knock-off not just a bucket list thing, but something that meant so much to me that I feel lucky to be part of its family. 

 










From Warner Bros. and New Line, “Final Destination Bloodlines” is now in theaters.

Britney Spears has admitted to lighting a cigarette while on a plane. On May 22, while on a charter plane flight, Spears lit a cigarette mid-flight. She reportedly put it out at the request of flight attendants and authorities issued a warning to the pop star at the airport once the plane landed.


	On Friday, Spears addressed the incident on Instagram, confirming that what had been reported was true. Calling it “incredibly funny,” she wrote, “Some planes I've been on you can't smoke mostly but this one was different because the drink holders were on outside of seat.”


	In an accompanying video to her Instagram post, Spears looks happy as she holds a wine bottle split. The drink holder is indeed outside of the seat, though it's unclear why that made Spears think it was OK to smoke on this particular plane. That said, while it is a violation of federal aviation regulations to smoke on commercial flights, it can be permissible on private charter planes, depending on if the owner or operater permits it and that the jet complies with FAA rules regarding passenger and crew compartment interiors.

	After drinking vodka for the first time, she wrote that she wanted a cigarette. A friend then placed a cigarette in her mouth and lit it. “I was like OH SO THIS IS A PLANE WHERE YOU CAN SMOKE !!!,” she wrote.


	Turns out that was not the case. “I do so apologize to anyone I offended but the flight attendants always make sure I'm way at the back of plane anyways,” she added. When authorities met her at the airport, she thought that they were greeting her “as support and I was like WOW I feel special.”


	She finally put together that authorities were there because a flight attendant had alerted officials about the incident. Spears also claimed one particular flight attendant had tried to “embarrass” her and made sure she sat down when no one was on the plane yet, among other allegations.

	“Nobody was on the plane for first 20 minutes and she wouldn't let me get out of my seat I wanted to stand up !!!,” the pop star wrote. “She acted so weird about making sure I sat down and it was weird !!! I didn't like the way she put the seatbelt on me and invaded my space !!!”

	











	Spears is gearing up for a biopic based on her memoir, The Woman in Me, with Jon M. Chu tapped to direct the Universal Pictures movie, though he told Billboard in January that he couldn't say much yet about the film. He did reveal that he's a fan of the singer and said, “I want to do her justice and tell her story right. But we'll see. We're developing it now and it's a long road ahead.”

David Tennant would probably have liked to use the TARDIS to nab the lead role in Walt Disney Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps.


	During a panel conversation at MCM Comic Con in London, the Doctor Who alum was asked by a fan if there were any villains or superheroes he would like to portray that he hasn't gotten the chance to yet. Though Tennant acknowledged he struck gold with the mind-controlling abusive antagonist Killgrave in Jessica Jones, there's another MCU role he would have also liked to nab. 


	“In terms of superheroes, I don't know, I did slightly have my eye on Reed Richards, and unfortunately, it looks like they've gone in a different direction,” he said tongue-in-cheek, “although if it has to be someone, I'm happy for it to be Pedro Pascal, frankly.”

	As the audience whooped upon the mention of Mister Fantastic himself, Tennant agreed, exclaiming a resounding “yes!”


	He continued, “I would have quite liked to be Reed Richards, I'd quite like to be able to do all that,” reaching out in front of him and making a sound effect to demonstrate the character's elasticity power. “So I'll stick with that even though it's gone, even though it's gonna be a while before there's another go at that, I think, unfortunately.”


	He concluded, “I think Pedro Pascal is great. I'm very, very pleased that he exists.”


	Tennant is in good company, as last year, The Fall of the House of Usher actor Rahul Kohli also said he lost out on the coveted role. Rounding out the fictional quartet is Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm (aka the Invisible Woman), Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm (aka the Human Torch) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm (aka the Thing). Additional cast members include Julia Garner as Silver Surfer, Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Ralph Ineson and Natasha Lyonne.


	For the Invincible Man himself, Pascal recently noted that embodying the de-facto leader of the familial superhero clan and fan-favorite franchise character was “really intimidating.” He told Entertainment Weekly, in part, “You really want to make people happy, especially if it's something that's widely known with particular expectations around it because you want those expectations to be met. You also want to be authentic to yourself so that it can be the best that it can be for anybody who wants to be entertained by a story and travel with us into this world.”

	











	Due in theaters July 25 and helmed by three-time Emmy nominee Matt Shakman, First Steps marks the fourth attempt to translate the original comic book characters to the silver screen. This time, the action will take place in an alternate history/parallel universe set in the '60s, offering a retrofuturistic environment for audiences.

Theresa Wolters steps in as interim executive director, Billboard has learned.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Laura Segura, executive director of MusiCares, has departed the organization after five years as executive director, according to an email sent to staff by Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy and MusiCares.


	The memo announced a “key leadership transition” heading into Memorial Day weekend, revealing that Segura is “no longer with MusiCares” — and that Theresa Wolters, who's been serving as MusiCares' head of health and human services, “is stepping into the role of interim executive director.” 


	No reason or details regarding Segura's departure were given. Billboard reached out to the Recording Academy and MusiCares on Saturday (May 24) for comment. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The leadership and staff directory on MusiCares' website no longer includes Segura's name and lists Wolters as interim executive director.


	Segura was named executive director at MusiCares in 2020, after serving as vp of membership and industry relations at the Recording Academy.


	She was honored at Billboard‘s Women in Music, which recognizes top executives in the industry, in both 2022 and 2023.


	Segura and Wolters, who is now MusiCares' interim executive director, co-penned a guest column for Billboard, “Health Insurance Isn't Enough — Music Also Needs a Financial Safety Net,” published in March.


	MusiCares, founded by the Recording Academy in 1989, provides a safety net of critical health and welfare services to the music community. The U.S. based, independent 501(c)(3) charity offers financial grant programs, support resources and crisis relief.


	Earlier this month, MusiCares reported that nearly $10 million raised for Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts during the 2025 Grammy Awards was distributed to recipients across the region. As of May 2, $6,125,000 was disbursed to more than 3,100 music professionals across L.A, and $3,969,005 had been directed to the community-based organizations California Community Foundation, Direct Relief and Pasadena Community Foundation.


	An additional $16 million was raised by MusiCares and the Recording Academy during Grammy weekend with the MusiCares Fire Relief campaign and its annual Persons of the Year gala. $6 million of that amount was allocated to longterm fire relief efforts, and $10 million will go toward the organization's year-round mission delivery.


	“What moved us most in the days following the Grammy telecast wasn't just the scale of support, it was the spirit behind it, Segura said in a statement on May 2. “Thousands of people gave what they could, and together, their generosity became a lifeline for those in crisis, which reached far beyond our industry. That's why we partnered with trusted community organizations who are helping Angelenos across the region access the care, resources and support they need to rebuild.”

Chrissy Teigen is opening up about her latest cosmetic procedure after fans were left concerned by a recent hospital photo.

On May 23, the model, successful cookbook author, and mom of four shared on her Instagram Stories that she had undergone a “hairline lowering procedure.” The update followed an earlier post in which Teigen appeared in a hospital bed with a bandaged forehead, prompting widespread speculation online.

The post read, “Hi friends! [A] lot of you have been wondering about my hospital pic which is very understandable as I gave no explanation lol,” Teigen, 39, wrote in her Instagram post. “I had a hairline lowering procedure.”

Teigen, known for her candidness with fans, explained that the decision came after years of feeling self-conscious about extensive hair loss at her hairline. “Lost a lot in the front from babies and it's just very thin up there,” she revealed. “When you see it on a carpet, it's ALWAYS extensions.”

Per Johns Hopkins Medicine, “Postpartum hair thinning or hair loss, known as telogen effluvium, is a common condition that occurs when hormone levels drop back to their regular levels after childbirth.”

Teigen and her husband, singer and The Voice coach John Legend, 46, share four children: Luna Simone, born in 2016; Miles Theodore, born in 2018; and Esti Maxine and Wren Alexander, both welcomed in 2023, with Wren arriving via surrogate, Per People.

While the TV personality did not offer extensive details in her latest update, Teigen promised fans she would “share more later” if they were “interested” in hearing about the procedure, describing it as “a journey.”

Teigen is no stranger to publicly discussing her cosmetic treatments on social media. In 2021, she shared on Instagram that she had undergone an eyebrow transplant procedure, where hairs from the back of the head are grafted onto the face to create fuller brows.

Teigen later posted an update of her post-surgery brows, calling the results “crazy” and noting, “They look so cool,” while pointing out how the procedure evened out her brow line.

While Teigen has been open about cosmetic enhancements, she maintains a humorous and grounded approach, often sharing the realities behind the polished red carpet looks. As fans wait for more details about her latest procedure, Teigen's willingness to share her beauty journey continues to resonate.

 Scientists are currently studying a mysterious sphere that they believe to be an unidentified flying object (UFO).


 The metal item was initially spotted flying over Buga, Colombia, on March 2, before later being recovered in the area, according to a video from scientists that was shared online.


 Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers studying the sphere, said the mysterious object appears to have "no welds or joints” — both of which would typically indicate human manufacturing. The sphere also appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface, he added.


 Velazquez and his team said they used an X-ray on the object and found that it consists of three layers of metal, along with nine “microspheres” in the interior.


 “It is a very rare piece … I've never seen a piece like this,” Velazquez said.

 Julia Mossbridge — a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics, and the founder of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT) — told Fox News that she is skeptical of the sphere's origins.


 "It looks to me like a really cool art project," she told the outlet.


 "Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," Mossbridge continued, referring to the international research project founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to vet and study potential extraterrestrial artifacts through rigorous scientific research. 


 The researcher added that similar findings might say more about the current state of humanity than about the universe at large.


 “We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had," she told Fox News. “If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us.”


 And while Mossbridge is skeptical of the recent find in Colombia, she doesn't necessarily believe that all UFO sightings or artifacts are a hoax.


 “Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them,” she said.


 Mossbridge also stressed the importance of using non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP studies.


 “They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things,” she said. 


 “Because, for instance, the sphere in Colombia is in a different country. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?” added Mossbridge.


 In a statement to PEOPLE, Mossbridge also said: "The natural human response to the unknown is fear. But we need to start noticing that fear doesn't actually keep us safe; what keeps us safe is the willingness to understand and explore what is really going on — and to react appropriately to what we discover."


 "That willingness is supported by self-transcendence, the ability to look beyond ourselves and recognize that there are things that are bigger than us," she continued.

The speed of light is the fastest anything can travel. What happens to a photon from a galaxy 25 million light years away on its journey toward Earth?

My telescope, set up for astrophotography in my light-polluted San Diego backyard, was pointed at a galaxy unfathomably far from Earth. My wife, Cristina, walked up just as the first space photo streamed to my tablet. It sparkled on the screen in front of us.

"That's the Pinwheel galaxy," I said. The name is derived from its shape – albeit this pinwheel contains about a trillion stars.

The light from the Pinwheel traveled for 25 million years across the universe – about 150 quintillion miles – to get to my telescope.

My wife wondered: "Doesn't light get tired during such a long journey?"

Her curiosity triggered a thought-provoking conversation about light. Ultimately, why doesn't light wear out and lose energy over time?

I am an astrophysicist, and one of the first things I learned in my studies is how light often behaves in ways that defy our intuitions.

Light is electromagnetic radiation: basically, an electric wave and a magnetic wave coupled together and traveling through space-time. It has no mass. That point is critical because the mass of an object, whether a speck of dust or a spaceship, limits the top speed it can travel through space.

But because light is massless, it's able to reach the maximum speed limit in a vacuum – about 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, or almost 6 trillion miles per year (9.6 trillion kilometers). Nothing traveling through space is faster. To put that into perspective: In the time it takes you to blink your eyes, a particle of light travels around the circumference of the Earth more than twice.

As incredibly fast as that is, space is incredibly spread out. Light from the Sun, which is 93 million miles (about 150 million kilometers) from Earth, takes just over eight minutes to reach us. In other words, the sunlight you see is eight minutes old.

Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to us after the Sun, is 26 trillion miles away (about 41 trillion kilometers). So by the time you see it in the night sky, its light is just over four years old. Or, as astronomers say, it's four light years away.

With those enormous distances in mind, consider Cristina's question: How can light travel across the universe and not slowly lose energy?

Actually, some light does lose energy. This happens when it bounces off something, such as interstellar dust, and is scattered about.

But most light just goes and goes, without colliding with anything. This is almost always the case because space is mostly empty – nothingness. So there's nothing in the way.

When light travels unimpeded, it loses no energy. It can maintain that 186,000-mile-per-second speed forever.

Here's another concept: Picture yourself as an astronaut on board the International Space Station. You're orbiting at 17,000 miles (about 27,000 kilometers) per hour. Compared with someone on Earth, your wristwatch will tick 0.01 seconds slower over one year.

That's an example of time dilation – time moving at different speeds under different conditions. If you're moving really fast, or close to a large gravitational field, your clock will tick more slowly than someone moving slower than you, or who is further from a large gravitational field. To say it succinctly, time is relative.



Now consider that light is inextricably connected to time. Picture sitting on a photon, a fundamental particle of light; here, you'd experience maximum time dilation. Everyone on Earth would clock you at the speed of light, but from your reference frame, time would completely stop.

That's because the "clocks" measuring time are in two different places going vastly different speeds: the photon moving at the speed of light, and the comparatively slowpoke speed of Earth going around the Sun.

What's more, when you're traveling at or close to the speed of light, the distance between where you are and where you're going gets shorter. That is, space itself becomes more compact in the direction of motion – so the faster you can go, the shorter your journey has to be. In other words, for the photon, space gets squished.

—New theory could finally make 'quantum gravity' a reality — and prove Einstein wrong

—Black hole paradox that stumped Stephen Hawking may have a solution, new paper claims

—In a first, physicists spot elusive 'free-range' atoms — confirming a century-old theory about quantum mechanics

Which brings us back to my picture of the Pinwheel galaxy. From the photon's perspective, a star within the galaxy emitted it, and then a single pixel in my backyard camera absorbed it, at exactly the same time. Because space is squished, to the photon the journey was infinitely fast and infinitely short, a tiny fraction of a second.

But from our perspective on Earth, the photon left the galaxy 25 million years ago and traveled 25 million light years across space until it landed on my tablet in my backyard.

And there, on a cool spring night, its stunning image inspired a delightful conversation between a nerdy scientist and his curious wife.

A haunted doll collector who houses 54 'spirits' has weighed in on the debate surrounding the allegedly paranormal Annabelle doll being taken on 'tour.'

The Raggedy Anne doll was made famous back in the 1970s when paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren looked into alleged attacks made by the infamous toy.

While they warned that she should never be moved, Annabelle is now currently touring the US alongside other items from the Warrens Occult Museum collection – leaving people online up in arms.

Now, haunted doll collector Teej, who has over 50 paranormal items in her possession, has weighed in on the controversial Annabelle tour. 

She insisted, however, that we shouldn't be so quick to make snap judgements about the toy, and said that she believes the haunted doll is misunderstood.

'Do I believe that Annabelle is responsible for all of the tragedy that she is being blamed for right now? Absolutely not,' the US-based woman told What's The Jam recently.

'Most of the stories tied to her are unverified and don't have any evidence to back them up.

'Honestly, I believe that Annabelle deserves a fresh investigation with an unbiased investigation team, to figure out what is actually going on with her.'

The Raggedy Anne doll was made famous back in the 1970s when paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren looked into alleged attacks made by the infamous toy

While they warned that she should never be moved, Annabelle is now currently touring the US alongside other items from the Warrens Occult Museum collection. The Warrens are pictured

Teej said she believes the doll's narrative was 'created' by the Warrens following their initial investigation.

She added: 'This was a very long time ago and, since then, she has been sensationalized in Hollywood.

'We don't even know Annabelle's true story. We owe it not only to her, but to all spirits, to start asking the real questions and getting evidence on who they are and what happened to them.

'People keep saying "bring Annabelle home," but the truth is – Annabelle doesn't have a home.

'The Warrens Occult Museum has been closed to the public since 2019, so she [was] not at home – she was in storage. Locked away, not honored, not protected, not valued.'

Teej pointed out that the doll has spent her entire 'afterlife' on display in a museum being 'gawked at, disrespected, and sensationalized for money' – without any way to 'defend' herself from the claims.

'Imagine being the center of basically an entire country's fear without any voice of your own, and no one to look out for and defend you,' she continued. 'Spirits like Annabelle are not props – no spirit is.'

Teej explained that all purported spirits should be treated with 'dignity, respect and kindness' – no matter the rumors that have dogged them over the years.

Now, haunted doll collector Teej, who has over 50 paranormal items in her possession, has issued a stark warning about the Annabelle tour

Teej said she believes the doll's narrative was 'created' by the Warrens following their initial investigation

In Annabelle's case, the doll dates back to 1970 when she was gifted to a nursing student, who was told by a psychic medium that the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a deceased girl named Annabelle.

'We don't even know Annabelle's true story,' Teej said. 'We owe it not only to her, but to all spirits, to start asking the real questions and getting evidence on what happened to them'

The student and her roommate reported 'malicious and frightening' behaviors from the doll.

Annabelle reportedly moved on her own and at one point attacked the fiancé of one of its owners.

That's when the Warrens stepped in to investigate, deemed it to be demonic, and moved it to their museum.

Annabelle then became one of the most well-known haunted items following the Conjuring and Annabelle movie franchises. 

The doll is now on tour across the globe through the Devils on the Run Tour, which takes items, including Annabelle, from the Warrens Occult Museum collection in Monroe to various cities to display them to horror buffs. 

Teej started connecting with the paranormal in childhood, encouraged by her family who took her on ghost hunts, and had her first encounter at the age of six.

She said: 'We were in a parking lot using an Ovilus, which is a device that turns environmental energy into words that appear on a screen – a common spirit communication tool still used by investigators to this day.

Teej explained that all purported spirits should be treated with 'dignity, respect and kindness' – no matter the rumors that have dogged them over the years

Teej started collecting haunted dolls in 2020 – but will only house ones with positive intentions

'Out of nowhere, the Ovilus said, "Get out of the way, fast." We didn't wait, we moved immediately.

'Right after we cleared the area, a car whipped around the corner. It was really dark, and if we hadn't moved, there's a good chance we could've been hit.

'That moment stuck with me, not just because it was my first clear experience, but because it felt like a spirit was trying to help us.

'That was the first time I felt like a spirit interaction was actually positive, and that's something I've kept in mind ever since.

'It's a big part of why I'm now interested in haunted dolls, specifically ones with positive energy. That early experience shaped the way I look at the paranormal today.'

She started collecting haunted dolls in 2020 – but will only house ones with positive intentions.

'What pulled me in were the stories behind them, specifically the personal accounts, the unexplained experiences, and the history behind some of the more well-known cases,' she continued.

'I spent a lot of time researching and reading about them, trying to understand what made each case unique.

'I choose to work only with positive spirits in my home because of the relationships that naturally develop over time.

'Many of these spirits have a genuine desire to communicate and be acknowledged, and that opens the door to meaningful and respectful connections.

She said: 'We treat them with respect, and in return, they do the same. Our interactions are often lighthearted and much of the paranormal activity in our home is playful'

'What pulled me in were the stories behind them, specifically the unexplained experiences, and the history behind some of the more well-known cases,' she continued

'We treat them with respect, and in return, they do the same. Our interactions are often lighthearted and much of the paranormal activity in our home is playful, sometimes even meant to make us laugh.

'Just as importantly, I'm mindful of safety. When I investigate haunted locations, I always have the option to leave.

'But my home is my safe space, and I won't risk inviting in any spirit that could bring harm or disruption to me or my family.

'By setting clear boundaries, I'm able to stay open to paranormal experiences while still protecting the comfort and peace of our home.'

She added of the recent news about Annabelle: 'While I know Annabelle is currently on tour and it's easy to fall into the trap of assuming all haunted dolls behave like the famous ones, it's important to remember that every spirit is unique

'No two spirits are exactly alike, and many are actually positive or neutral in nature.

'Making broad generalizations that all haunted dolls are dangerous or negative can be harmful and misleading.

'It's essential to take the time to get to know each spirit individually before jumping to conclusions about their behavior or intentions.'

   08:42 EDT 25 May 2025, updated  11:49 EDT 25 May 2025    By STACY LIBERATORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

A 'UFO base' mentioned in a declassified CIA document has fueled a surge in sightings, turning Mount Hayes into one of America's top alien hotspots.

Rising over 8,000 feet, Mount Hayes sits within the so-called Alaska Triangle, a region notorious for unexplained disappearances and paranormal activity.

However, the CIA has never confirmed the alien base and the US government's stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. 

Locals have reported streaks of colored lights, orbs traveling at high speed, and mysterious vanishing people. 

One report came from Jared Augustin, a former security officer, who claimed he saw a glowing orb hovering in the night sky near Mount Hayes before it suddenly split into three.

'It was a UFO, of extraterrestrial origin,' Augustin told DMAX UK, adding that he stood frozen, shaking as the bizarre sight unfolded.

Theories about alien activity have led the public to scour Google Maps for signs of the secret base.

Some conspiracy theorists claim there's missing satellite data over Mount Hayes, allegedly to hide the base's location.

'Wow, that's a big coincidence, in a very specific shape,' one Reddit user commented, pointing to a rectangular patch seemingly missing from the mountain on Google Maps.

Mount Hayes is located within an area known for unexplained disappearances and paranormal activity.

Locals have aimed trail cameras at Mount Hayes, hoping to capture proof that the area is a UFO hotspot.

In an episode of History Channel's Missing in Alaska, a local resident named Wilbur shared footage he believed showed an alien craft.

The video captured a glowing green light hovering over Mount Hayes. Within seconds, it appeared to vanish behind the mountain.

Investigators said the object had 'hovering capabilities like a helicopter, but could also reverse direction instantly' — something no known aircraft can do.

Based on its position and movement, the team estimated the object's drop speed to be just over Mach 1 (the speed of sound).

In addition to mysterious airborne sightings, more than 2,000 people have vanished in the area since the 1970s.

Notable incidents include the 1972 disappearance of a plane carrying US House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, which vanished en route from Anchorage to Juneau. 

Despite an extensive 39-day search covering 325,000 square miles, no wreckage or remains were ever found.

In December 2023, Brian Erickson was reported missing after departing the village of Healy Lake on a green Polaris Ranger side-by-side vehicle.

He was last seen on December 2, 2023, at 4pm.

Search efforts were initiated, and the operation transitioned from a Search and Rescue to a Search and Recovery mission on December 6, 2023.

The Alaska State Troopers have been actively seeking assistance in locating Erickson.

Locals have suggested that these disappearances and many more are due to UFO activity near the mountain. 

However, Mount Hayes is situated within an area stretching between Anchorage, Juneau and Utqiagvik.

The combination of challenging terrain, unpredictable weather, and sparse population contributes to the difficulties in search and rescue operations. 

While UFOs have been reported in the area for decades, the sightings gained more attention when the CIA declassified its experiment in 2000. 

The report, titled 'Description of Personnel Associated 'ET' Bases,' detailed a session in which a remote viewer was given unknown targets and asked to describe what they perceived. 

The remote viewing session was part of the CIA's top-secret STARGATE program, which recruited individuals believed to have psychic abilities for military and intelligence purposes during the Cold War.

The program began in the early 1970s and officially shut down in 1995 after being deemed scientifically unreliable and operationally ineffective for intelligence gathering.

During a remote viewing session, participants typically sketched what they 'saw' and jotted down brief notes about their perceptions.

The 12-page document includes several drawings believed to depict the locations of these ET bases—one sketch appears to resemble a rocky mountain.

That drawing has been interpreted as Mount Hayes in Alaska, which stands roughly 8,000 feet tall.

According to the remote viewer, he found himself mentally inside a facility beneath Mount Hayes, where he observed 'two types of entities' associated with the site. 

He described seeing two beings standing outside one of the bases, 'accomplishing some sort of routine task.'

Inside the base, they perceived two more entities. One was seated at a circular console with a round, screen-like object, according to the session notes.

The second figure was performing another task in the background.

The decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will continue, probably for many years to come.

Around the U.S., about 90,000 tons of nuclear waste is stored at over 100 sites in 39 states, in a range of different structures and containers.

For decades, the nation has been trying to send it all to one secure location.

A 1987 federal law named Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, as a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste — but political and legal challenges led to construction delays. Work on the site had barely started before Congress ended the project's funding altogether in 2011.

The 94 nuclear reactors currently operating at 54 power plants continue to generate more radioactive waste. Public and commercial interest in nuclear power is rising because of concerns regarding emissions from fossil fuel power plants and the possibility of new applications for smaller-scale nuclear plants to power data centers and manufacturing. This renewed interest gives new urgency to the effort to find a place to put the waste.

In March 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments related to the effort to find a temporary storage location for the nation's nuclear waste — a ruling is expected by late June. No matter the outcome, the decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will probably continue for many years to come.

I am a scholar who specializes in corrosion; one focus of my work has been containing nuclear waste during temporary storage and permanent disposal. There are generally two forms of significantly radioactive waste in the U.S.: waste from making nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and waste from generating electricity at nuclear power plants. There are also small amounts of other radioactive waste, such as that associated with medical treatments.

Related: How do you decontaminate objects exposed to radioactivity?

Remnants of the chemical processing of radioactive material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, often called "defense waste," will eventually be melted along with glass, with the resulting material poured into stainless steel containers. These canisters are 10 feet tall and 2 feet in diameter, weighing approximately 5,000 pounds when filled.

For now, though, most of it is stored in underground steel tanks, primarily at Hanford, Washington, and Savannah River, South Carolina, key sites in U.S. nuclear weapons development. At Savannah River, some of the waste has already been processed with glass, but much of it remains untreated.

At both of those locations, some of the radioactive waste has already leaked into the soil beneath the tanks, though officials have said there is no danger to human health. Most of the current efforts to contain the waste focus on protecting the tanks from corrosion and cracking to prevent further leakage.

The vast majority of nuclear waste in the U.S. is spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants.

Before it is used, nuclear fuel exists as uranium oxide pellets that are sealed within zirconium tubes, which are themselves bundled together. These bundles of fuel rods are about 12 to 16 feet long and about 5 to 8 inches in diameter. In a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions fueled by the uranium in those rods emit heat that is used to create hot water or steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.

After about three to five years, the fission reactions in a given bundle of fuel slow down significantly, even though the material remains highly radioactive. The spent fuel bundles are removed from the reactor and moved elsewhere on the power plant's property, where they are placed into a massive pool of water to cool them down.

After about five years, the fuel bundles are removed, dried and sealed in welded stainless steel canisters. These canisters are still radioactive and thermally hot, so they are stored outdoors in concrete vaults that sit on concrete pads, also on the power plant's property. These vaults have vents to ensure air flows past the canisters to continue cooling them.

As of December 2024, there were over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in the U.S., and over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground, located at current and former power plants across the country.

Even reactors that have been decommissioned and demolished still have concrete vaults storing radioactive waste, which must be secured and maintained by the power company that owned the nuclear plant.



One threat to these storage methods is corrosion.

Because they need water to both transfer nuclear energy into electricity and to cool the reactor, nuclear power plants are always located alongside sources of water.

In the U.S., nine are within two miles of the ocean, which poses a particular threat to the waste containers. As waves break on the coastline, saltwater is sprayed into the air as particles. When those salt and water particles settle on metal surfaces, they can cause corrosion, which is why it's common to see heavily corroded structures near the ocean.

At nuclear waste storage locations near the ocean, that salt spray can settle on the steel canisters. Generally, stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, which you can see in the shiny pots and pans in many Americans' kitchens. But in certain circumstances, localized pits and cracks can form on stainless steel surfaces.

In recent years, the U.S. Department of Energy has funded research, including my own, into the potential dangers of this type of corrosion. The general findings are that stainless steel canisters could pit or crack when stored near a seashore. But a radioactive leak would require not only corrosion of the container but also of the zirconium rods and of the fuel inside them. So it is unlikely that this type of corrosion would result in the release of radioactivity.

A more permanent solution is likely years, or decades, away.

—China's 'artificial sun' shatters nuclear fusion record by generating steady loop of plasma for 1,000 seconds

—Nuclear fusion could be the clean energy of the future — but these 'tough' challenges stand in the way

Not only must a long-term site be geologically suitable to store nuclear waste for thousands of years, but it must also be politically palatable to the American people. In addition, there will be many challenges associated with transporting the waste, in its containers, by road or rail, from reactors across the country to wherever that permanent site ultimately is.

Perhaps there will be a temporary site whose location passes muster with the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, the waste will stay where it is.

The patio at Joe T. Garcia's in Fort Worth is a popular celebrity hot spot. The most recent guest to stop by the popular restaurant is Jared Padalecki, the native Texan (and current Austin resident) famous for his stints on “Supernatural,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Walker” and “Fire Country.”

Padalecki was spotted on the patio, and Joe T.'s posted the photo on Facebook on Saturday, May 24.

“You never know who you might run into at Joe T's … even a Texas heartthrob like Jared Padalecki,” the Joe T. Garcia's Facebook post reads. “From iconic margaritas to Hollywood moments, there's always something special in the air on our patio.

“Thanks for stopping by, Jared, come back anytime!”

Padalecki's ties to Texas run deep — he was born and raised in San Antonio, owns a home in Austin and co-owns several Austin businesses. He also supported Beto O'Rourke for the 2018 Senate election in Texas, as did his “Supernatural” co-stars Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins. You can currently see Padalecki as SoCal firefighter Camden Casey in season 3 of “Fire Country” on CBS.

Padalecki is in talks to star in a “Fire Country” spinoff, tentatively called “Fire Country: Surfside.”

Padalecki is teaming up with his “Walker” executive producer/showrunner Anna Fricke to develop an untitled, hour-long medical drama about rural medicine, set in Texas, according to Deadline. Padalecki will star as “a headstrong, devoted country doctor who practices his unique style of improvisational medicine alongside his new protégé, a young doctor running from her past, as they operate a mobile clinic and heal the bodies and souls of their underserved community in the medical desert of rural Texas,” according to the description.

Speculation began in 2023 when Foxx suffered a medical emergency which was later revealed to be a stroke

Jamie Foxx has shut down conspiracy theories that say Sean ‘Diddy' Combs tried to kill him.

Speculation began in 2023 when Foxx suffered a medical emergency, later revealed to be a stroke. While his illness still remained a mystery, some internet commentators suggested that Diddy had been involved.

Now, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Foxx has dismissed the rumours. “I'm in fucking perfect shape,” he told the publication. “[I saw things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me.' No, Puffy didn't try to kill me. When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These bitch-ass motherfuckers are trying to clone me?'”

The Oscar-winning actor admitted that he was heavily sedated with drugs during his hospital stay and doesn't remember weeks of that period. During that time, he says he snuck a cell phone in and began indulging in the multiple rumours surrounding his health.

“I was doing so many jokes in the hospital,” he continued. “That's the only way I could get through it. I'm a comic, so even when I was heavily sedated, and they gave me OxyContin, Dilantin and morphine at the same time.”

Foxx had previously addressed the Diddy speculation late last year, during his Netflix show What Had Happened Was…. The special saw him discuss his 2023 health emergency for the first time and take a sly shot at Diddy, referencing the infamous parties the former rap mogul would host for high-profile entertainment figures.

Speaking about the rumours around his health, Foxx said: “The internet was trying to kill me, though. The internet said Puffy tried to kill me. I know what you're thinking, did he?”

“Hell no!” he continued. “I left those parties early, I was out by 9pm. Because something don't look right, it's slippery in here.”

Foxx appeared to be referencing the fact that during police raids of Diddy's home in March, authorities recovered items including AR-15s, narcotics and “more than 1000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant”.

He also revealed in the special that his unspecified medical emergency was actually a bleed on the brain that led to a stroke. He was told that if doctors did not operate on him as soon as possible, he would die.

The actor said it “was kind of oddly peaceful” being unconscious, adding: “I saw the tunnel. I didn't see the light.” He then joked: “It was hot in that tunnel. Shit, am I going to the wrong place in this motherfucker? Because I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the Devil like, ‘C'mon.' Or is that Puffy [Sean Combs]?”

After the procedure, Foxx explained that the doctor told his sister Deidra Dixon that he “may be able to make a full recovery, but it's going to be the worst year of his life”. He added: “That's what it was.”

He continued: “I lost everything, but the only thing I could hold onto was my sense of humour. If I could stay funny, I could stay alive.”

Diddy's sex trafficking and racketeering trial began this month and has so far seen his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, testify against him in court, alleging that he had spent years subjecting her to brutal sexual violence and abuse.

Over a year ago, Ventura filed a lawsuit against the Bad Boy Records founder for physical assault and rape, and the case was settled the following day despite Diddy denying the claims.

Months later, CNN obtained CCTV footage of Diddy dragging, kicking and hitting Ventura in an LA hotel, lending credence to her allegations. Diddy was later arrested and charged with crimes including sexual trafficking and racketeering, the trial for which began earlier this month.

Diddy has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, and has denied all other allegations of misconduct levelled against him. He has also pleaded not guilty to five criminal counts, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has consistently denied all allegations against him and has asserted that all sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual.

Justin Bieber also recently shut down rumours that he was one of Diddy's alleged victims, with a representative for the singer saying: “Although Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims, there are individuals who were genuinely harmed by him,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

“Shifting focus away from this reality detracts from the justice these victims rightfully deserve.”

The infamous Annabelle doll, known from horror stories and movies, has once again caused a stir on social media. Recently, many people claimed that the doll had disappeared during a paranormal tour in Louisiana. Some even said the doll was ‘missing'. This panic came just days after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Plantation, now called Nottoway Resort, in White Castle, Louisiana. Although no one was hurt, some social media users started rumours and conspiracy theories linking the fire to Annabelle being displayed nearby.

The Annabelle doll is actually a Raggedy Ann doll kept at the Warrens Occult Museum in Connecticut. It has been part of a paranormal tour across America. Locals in Louisiana said they were not able to see the doll during the tour and began to worry that it had gone missing.

One person wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), “I just saw a post on Facebook that they LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL? I'm fleeing the country goodbye.” Another user reacted, “THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL?? LIKE?? THE HAUNTED ANNABELLE DOLL?? They take her on a tour around America...... AND THEN THEY LOOSE HER? BRAH?” A third tweet read, “wdym the annabelle doll is missing??? who tf lost her??? i was already not able to sleep 😭😭😭”

However, these rumours were quickly proven false. Dan Rivera from NESPR, a paranormal research group, posted a video from inside the Warrens Occult Museum showing the Annabelle doll safe and sound. As one person wrote after sharing the video, “Some wild and crazy internet rumors this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost and here's Dan Rivera with NESPR proving she is back home inside the museum in Connecticut.. for now. And no, Annabelle is not supposed to be in Chicago.”

Officials have confirmed that there is no connection between the recent fires and the doll. The Annabelle doll remains locked away at the museum, far from the fires and the social media panic.

The story of Annabelle began in the 1970s, when paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren said the doll was possessed by a spirit. Since then, Annabelle has become one of the most famous haunted objects, inspiring films and countless tales of terror. Despite the fear she inspires, the real doll is a simple Raggedy Ann kept safe under glass in the museum.

As paranormal researcher Dan Rivera said, “Annabelle may be scary, but she isn't going anywhere — at least, not without the Warrens' permission.”

If there's one thing Stephen King is undeniably skilled at writing, it's horror, for obvious reasons. Much of the time, that horror is supernatural in nature, and that's good and all, but King's written dozens of novels, and for him to solely rely on supernatural threats 100% of the time would eventually make his stories stale.

Also, that kind of heightened horror can be scarier when it exists alongside terrifying individuals who behave in alarming yet more everyday ways. The following characters hopefully demonstrate King's knack for writing strong villains who don't have fantastical abilities or supernatural powers. Some exist in stories that do feature such fantastical things, while others are villainous in stories that don't feature fantasy and/or supernatural elements. In the end, though, none of them needed otherworldly abilities to be effective antagonists or secondary villains.

The first novel of Stephen King's that was published (in 1974), and the first to get a major film adaptation (in 1976), Carrie is a supernatural horror story, in a way, but it's also got some comparatively mundane villains. Well, mundane might be the wrong word. But it's the titular character who has the supernatural powers, and they're unleashed in a devastating way after she deals with abuse both at school and at home.

Chris is the one who orchestrates much of Carrie's misery at school, while her mother makes her life hell at home. It's the prank Chris pulls at prom that makes Carrie snap, though the more prolonged abuse Margaret White subjects her to makes her eligible for a dishonorable mention here. Carrie herself causes the widespread death and destruction, but ultimately feels like a victim, given how these two treat her.

11/22/63 is one of the best Stephen King novels to not be a work of horror, even though it's pretty intense and occasionally unsettling in places. It's instead a time travel story that has its protagonist be a man who is able to travel back to 1958 and affect the future, so he decides to use such a unique opportunity to thwart Lee Harvey Oswald before he can assassinate John F. Kennedy.

But he has to make sure Oswald was really behind the killing, and that involves monitoring him without impacting how he acted on the titular day in 1963. And the story does not paint Oswald in a positive light by any means, since he takes out so much of his anger on his wife, physically, and then does prove to be the lone gunman behind the JFK assassination.

The main villain in The Stand, Randall Flagg, has his fair share of otherworldly abilities (and that's putting it mildly), but this is a massive book, and certainly has room for other villainous characters. In fact, Flagg builds up a massive gang of followers that end up being on the side of evil in a whole massive good vs. evil conflict waged in the aftermath of a viral outbreak that kills most of the world's population.

So, the people who serve Flagg might be assisted by Flagg's abilities, but are ultimately just normal people, Harold included. He's worth mentioning here, though, since he starts on the side of good and flips, lashing out against the people he'd be better off allying with and coming close to destroying the Boulder community in the process.

In The Dead Zone, it's the protagonist, Johnny Smith, who has supernatural powers, and the antagonist, Greg Stillson, is just an all-around awful human being, but a human being nonetheless. Smith can see flashes of the future when he comes into contact with people, and much of The Dead Zone revolves around him trying to take Stillson, an aspiring politician, down, since one vision of the future seemed to show Stillson becoming President and starting a nuclear war.

The villain here stands to wield an extraordinary amount of power, and has a chance of ending the world, but in a rather mundane way, compared to some other supernaturally gifted Stephen King antagonists.

So, the villain here stands to wield an extraordinary amount of power, and has a chance of ending the world, but in a rather mundane (and thereby arguably more unnerving) way, compared to some other supernaturally gifted Stephen King antagonists. It might all sound a bit far-fetched, but King makes it work, with The Dead Zone being an engaging read and, like 11/22/63, has a high-concept premise executed well.

The Green Mile is not lacking in characters who've done terrible things, since it's set on Death Row and the prisoners who aren't John Coffey are said to have committed genuinely horrific crimes. Also, Percy Wetmore is a guard who abuses his power and causes more suffering than needed, making him stand as one of many noteworthy bullies King has written about.

But the character who's done the most evil within the story is William "Wild Bill" Wharton, who's on Death Row for murdering three people and, as it turns out, also committed the horrific crime for which Coffey is condemned to die. He does all his evil as an uneasily mundane sadist, as in he doesn't have any powers, nor is he possessed by some kind of otherworldly evil force. He's just a horrific person.

Like The Green Mile, The Mist had a film adaptation directed by Frank Darabont, and it was also a Stephen King story that had more than one villain. The titular mist does bring with it a ton of supernatural horrors, but within the supermarket that all the characters find themselves confined to, the religiously fanatical Mrs. Carmody is arguably just as much of a threat.

She builds up a decent following within the store, and is one of those quintessential “maybe humans are the real monsters” kind of characters. Neither the story nor the character of Mrs. Carmody is particularly nuanced, but the former is well-told, and the latter is undeniably easy to hate (much in the same way that Carrie's similarly fanatical mom was in Carrie).

There's a lot more than just the titular antagonist (that often takes the appearance of a clown) to fear in It, since this one, like The Stand, ends up being an epic novel with plenty of room for multiple villains. In typical King fashion, many of these are bullies, with Henry Bowers ultimately serving as the secondary antagonist of the story. He doesn't upstage IT itself, but no one really could.

To be fair, Henry is under the influence of IT for at least some of the novel, but the stuff he does isn't necessarily supernatural or anything more damaging than what a bully could feasibly do. He's someone who's already villainous, but becomes more so because of the central antagonist here, but he's still such a definitive bully within King's body of work that he's worthy of mention regardless.

The Body was the short story upon which Stand by Me was based. It's no exaggeration to call the latter one of the best coming-of-age movies of all time, and it's also one of the best Stephen King adaptations generally speaking. It's a simple film about four boys going on a journey to find a dead body, and dealing with the struggles of being young all the while.

Said struggles include encounters with bullies, with Ace Merrill being the leader of the main antagonistic gang. The Body and Stand by Me are about as far from horror/fantasy as Stephen King ever got, but Ace is still a completely monstrous character who comes close to feeling over-the-top, but never crosses that line, staying effectively menacing and wholly intimidating, as a result.

There might exist people who don't like The Shawshank Redemption, but good luck finding them. This is considered not just a great Stephen King film adaptation, but one of the greatest movies of all time in a more general sense, and perhaps the definitive prison film, too. It's about two prisoners – one who's lost hope, and one who maintains his innocence and wants to escape – and the bond that forms between them within the titular Shawshank State Penitentiary.

The main antagonist here is the prison's warden, and he's terrible, more so in the movie than he was in the original short story (which also had a different title: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption). Warden Norton abuses his power and often relishes the opportunities to cause misery in an already miserable place, and is immensely hateable in the process. Oh, and speaking of misery…

Stephen King's 1987 novel, Misery, is one of his most uncomfortable and intense works, and was adapted into a similarly grueling (but engaging) film in 1990. The premise here is simple, and the number of key characters is low, seeing as most of Misery is centered on an author who's confined to an isolated cabin, held prisoner by Annie Wilkes, who's a lonely nurse and the author's self-appointed number 1 fan.

Wilkes is a constant source of, you know, misery, and might well do the most psychological damage of any Stephen King antagonist who doesn't have supernatural powers. Hell, even compared to the ones who do, few put a Stephen King protagonist through anywhere near as much living hell as author Paul Sheldon goes through. It really has to be seen (or read) to be believed.

You write some mean ones, Mr. King.

Hats off to you if you have heard of them, though. 

Death always has the last laugh.

If we must have Disney live-action movies, let's at least get the perfect cast.

Academy, what were you thinking? 

We know the Middle Ages didn't actually have magic, but let's just act like they did.
