                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamilton brands his Monaco race 'miserable' after being left 'in no man's land' INSIGHT: What it feels like to complete a high-speed lap around Monaco's famous streets Piastri says Monaco podium is ‘not all bad' as he reflects on ‘tricky' weekend Leclerc admits he ‘lost the race' in Qualifying but takes positives from competitive Monaco weekend Lando Norris expertly converted pole position into victory during Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, leading home Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri at the end of an intriguing, strategic race, which saw Max Verstappen hold P1 until the penultimate lap on an alternate strategy. Verstappen ran an off-set tyre strategy that saw the Red Bull driver go much longer across his stints, giving him the race lead into the very closing stages, but he dropped to fourth after completing his required second stop with a lap to go. Lewis Hamilton had a lonely race en route to fifth place, making up a couple of spots following his post-Qualifying penalty for impeding Verstappen, with rookie Isack Hadjar taking a fine sixth over Haas' Esteban Ocon and team mate Liam Lawson. Williams bagged a double points finish with Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz in P9 and P10, denying the Mercedes of George Russell, who grew frustrated at Albon's defensive driving earlier in the race and picked up a drive-through for an illegal overtake. Haas driver Ollie Bearman put on a strong recovery from his 10-place grid penalty and some wild moments in the opening stages to take the chequered flag in 12th position, followed by fellow rookies Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber). Bortoleto hit the barriers at Portier on the opening lap after a scrap with Kimi Antonelli, but bounced back to finish just ahead of Lance Stroll's Aston Martin, experienced team mate Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull. In short, every driver would be required to use three different sets of tyres across the race, including two different slick tyre compounds, with F1 supplier Pirelli amusingly declaring that “anything can happen” in their usual pre-race strategy guide. Another man to lose grid spots ahead of the start was Hamilton, who recovered well from an accident at the end of final practice to finish fourth-fastest in Qualifying, only to earn a three-place drop for getting in Verstappen's way during Q1. Norris got away cleanly when the lights went out and survived a sizeable double lock-up at Sainte Devote to maintain his pole position advantage over a fast-starting Leclerc, followed closely by Piastri and Verstappen, with the rest of the top 10 positions also remaining unchanged. Hulkenberg and Colapinto were the next drivers to pit for fresh tyres under green flag conditions, following a brief pit lane closure due to Gasly parking up at Williams, before Hadjar boxed for softs from fifth and rejoined in eighth, just ahead of Racing Bulls team mate Lawson, who had been backing up the cars behind him. Alonso and Ocon responded to Hadjar's stop next time around, rejoining in seventh and eighth respectively, with the Spaniard shouting that “I can't push now” on his harder rubber. Stroll and Bearman also took on more tyres, meaning the latter had already hit his two-stop requirement. After being told to push by his engineer, Hamilton pitted on Lap 19 for a set of hard tyres, coming back out ahead of Hadjar, with Norris doing the same from the lead of the race shortly afterwards and returning to the track in fourth – a huge gap of clean air to work with and hammer in some quick times. Racing Bulls' strategy became crystal clear on Lap 20 when Hadjar pitted for a second time and took on hards, again rejoining in front of team mate Lawson, before Piastri got called in to try and undercut new leader Leclerc, albeit with a slow stop hampering that plan. Leclerc duly stopped on Lap 22 and, despite Piastri's best efforts, the home favourite slotted back in between the McLaren drivers – Verstappen, having started on hard tyres, sitting 10 seconds clear of Norris and extending his opening stint. While McLaren pondered that, the only drivers yet to stop at all were Verstappen, Lawson, Albon, Sainz, Russell and Antonelli. At this point, television footage cut to Russell harassing Sainz just outside the top 10 places, with the Williams man seemingly attempting to create a gap for team mate Albon ahead as per Racing Bulls' plan. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff jumped on the radio to give his driver some encouragement. Ocon, Colapinto and Bortoleto also pitted for a second time, with the Sauber rookie intriguingly taking on softs. While Norris and Leclerc complained about backmarkers not adhering to blue flags, Bearman added a couple more dramatic moments to his difficult weekend thanks to a wheel-to-wheel scrap with Stroll through Rascasse and a bounce over the kerbs exiting the Swimming Pool section – but no lasting damage was done. Norris was soon back in the lead, but he had home hero Leclerc for company Stops for Lawson (taking on softs) and Albon (mediums) meant only Sainz, Russell and Antonelli (all still running their starting sets of hards) were yet to complete a tyre change, while Bortoleto made his third pit lane visit of the day to switch to mediums. Piastri was the first of the front-runners to stop for a second time on Lap 49, prompting Leclerc to pit and cover him off a lap later, and then leader Norris to come in for new tyres one tour after that. Verstappen, meanwhile, continued on his way and extended once more. 2025 Monaco Grand Prix: Gasly out of the race after crashing into Tsunoda Russell and Albon's battle then turned sour at the Nouvelle Chicane. Now it was Antonelli's turn to attack Albon, bringing another near-miss at the same spot. Sainz and Russell both pitted on Lap 55 to fit new tyres, with the latter being told that his penalty would be delayed “as long as possible”. As the lap count hit 60, Verstappen remained in the lead – but with that second stop still to be made – from a closing Norris and Leclerc. With no way through for Norris, it in turn allowed Leclerc to edge ever closer and hover only a few tenths back. I need him to put Charles under some pressure,” Norris enquired at this point, adding: “Max is just backing me up. Verstappen gave Norris a late-race headache before pitting on the penultimate lap Norris did everything he needed to across a tense phase of laps before Verstappen finally made his second stop, releasing his 2024 title rival, Leclerc and Piastri back into the top three positions, which would remain that way to the finish. Alonso and Gasly were left on the sidelines following their respective incidents. Nobody could stop Norris on the streets of Monte Carlo [At] the last corner I was a little bit nervous with Charles close behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco. ‘It all went out the window' – Russell explains ‘game over' moment as Mercedes duo suffer early Monaco Qualifying exits Hamilton brands his Monaco race 'miserable' after being left 'in no man's land' HIGHLIGHTS: Relive Norris' first Monaco Grand Prix victory after holding off Leclerc in closing stages Leclerc admits he ‘lost the race' in Qualifying but takes positives from competitive Monaco weekend</p>
