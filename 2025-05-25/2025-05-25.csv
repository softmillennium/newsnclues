            The bodies of five skiers have been found on a glacier near the Swiss mountain of Rimpfischhorn, police announced on Sunday.
    


            The bodies were found after two other skiers raised the alarm on Saturday, saying that they had seen skis at the foot of the summit of the mountain, but had not come across the owners of them, the police statement said.
    


            A rescue helicopter with medical professionals on board immediately flew over the area and the five bodies were “quickly discovered,” the statement continued.
    


            Three of the bodies were found some 500 meters (roughly 1640 ft) from where the skis were located, Swiss broadcaster Radio Télévision Suisse (RTS) reported. Air Zermatt, the helicopter company that carried out the search flight, said that the three bodies were found on an avalanche cone.
    


            The two other bodies were found nearly 200 meters (roughly 656 ft) higher, on a small, snow-covered area, Air Zermatt added.
    


            Formal identification of the victims is ongoing. The Attorney General has opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances of the accident, police said.

            It's been described as the world's most dangerous race, and it's certainly one of the most ridiculous – a 200-yard dash after a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese.
    


            To win, all you have to do is chase it down a grassy hill and cross the finish line before anyone else; however, that's much easier said than done. The hill is so steep that it could give you vertigo on the start line and there is absolutely no guarantee that you will make it down to the bottom in one piece.
    


            “You've just got to have a disregard for your own safety,” Chris Anderson explained to CNN Sports. Anderson won his first of his record 23 races in 2005 and broke his ankle in the celebrations, but the excruciating pain and eight weeks in a cast didn't put him off.
    


            The next year he won again, but he doesn't remember much about his third victory in 2007, when he crossed the finish line unconscious. “That was a bit of a blur,” he noted, recalling that he'd banged his head on the way down.
    


            Nobody seems to know for sure how long they've been chasing cheese wheels down Cooper's Hill in the village of Brockworth in southwest England, but it first appeared in written records in 1826. It might have started as a pagan ritual to bless the farmers' crops, or perhaps they were originally rolling barrels down to test their integrity – a cooper is, after all, a barrel maker.
    


            But it's a tradition that the locals have fought to preserve and it's one they are intensely proud of. And now, with the advent of the internet age, it's an event which has become truly international; thousands of people flock to the event on the last bank holiday in May, and winners have hailed from as far afield as New Zealand and Australia, Egypt and the United States.
    


            But the ultimate champions are the people who know the hill best: the locals. “I used to go up there camping with my friends,” Anderson said. “We used to get drunk and throw each other down.”
    


            The hill is absurdly steep: an initial drop of 60 degrees with an average of 45 degree incline. Looking down from the top, it initially seems like a sheer drop and many runners have changed their minds at the last minute when they realize what they're in for.
    


            “The first 10 meters are, like, near vertical,” Anderson explained to CNN. “You've just got to almost dive into it and try to stay on your feet.
    


            “As soon as you go, there's no stopping, you've just got the let momentum take over. Just try and keep on your feet as long as possible, and if you fall, get up as quick as you can.”
    


            Ideally, Anderson prefers the ground to be soft, but not wet. The drier it is, the better the traction, the harder the terrain, the greater the potential for injuries.
    


            Video footage of any cheese rolling race depicts a scene of utter chaos. Few competitors are able to remain upright for very long, some are anxiously trying to maintain control by sliding on their bottoms, while others have lost all dignity, careening down in various states of distress.
    


            Still images captured by photographers at the bottom present a confusing tableau, as if a giant has tipped a box of action figures out onto the hillside, bodies are upside down, or airborne sideways, and limbs are flailing everywhere.
    


            Anderson first attended the cheese rolling when he was around 10 years old, and he remembers seeing the mass of humanity flashing past him on the hill.
    


            “It was so fun to watch people flying and falling,” he reminisced, adding that it wasn't all fun and games. “One of the most standout things was someone breaking their leg, his studs got stuck in the ground and the momentum just pushed him forward. He was sat in the middle of the hill with his leg just dangling, it was pretty disgusting!”
    


            Serious injuries are practically guaranteed, one year Anderson witnessed three broken ankles, two of which belonged to international runners who missed their flights home because of emergency surgery.
    


            Ankle injuries are common – some have witnessed feet out of alignment by 180 degrees – as are concussions; 2023 women's champion Delaney Irving was knocked out just before the finish line and only learned of her triumph when she was told about it in the medical enclosure.
    


            On the Netflix docuseries “We Are the Champions,” women's record holder and four-time winner Flo Early revealed a protrusion of her right shoulder, a permanent disfigurement, caused by a collar bone that was broken on the hill.
    


            It's therefore no surprise that many runners might need a splash of alcohol in order to run. Anderson said that the races used to start at 6:30 p.m. in the evening, but the start time was moved earlier because too many people were intoxicated. Now, runners in need of some Dutch courage just start drinking earlier.
    


            Anderson told CNN Sports he prepares in moderation by drinking a single can of lager on the walk up. “I always saw that if you were drunk and you broke something, there's not a great deal they can give you for the pain, so I always try to do it as sober as possible,” he said.
    


            Signs posted all over the hill make it clear that runners are participating at their own risk, the local enthusiasts who stage the event say they are not official organizers – in case of injury, there is nobody to sue, and the event is uninsured.
    


            Nevertheless, the BBC reported in 2013 that the Gloucestershire police force advised 86-year-old cheesemaker Diana Smart – who makes the 6.6-pound (three-kilogram) wheel of Double Gloucester cheese used in the race – that she could be held liable because anyone who facilitates the event could be deemed an organizer by default.
    


            Anderson told CNN that he never had any intention of breaking the record of 21 cheese wins, which was set in 1991, but once he got to 13, he decided to keep going. In 2011 and 2017, he won three races in a single day and he broke the record with two more wins in 2018.
    


            At the age of 37, he's recovering from a long-term hip injury – and he is “supposed to be retired” – but if his 16-year-old son decides to compete then he could be tempted back onto the hill, partly to make sure he does it right.
    


            “I'd be happy for him to run,” he said, “but I've told him if you're not gonna commit, there's no point in even doing it.” The veteran cheese-chaser knows that there are many ways to be hurt on the hill. “The most dangerous thing is going slow and getting hit from behind. I'd like him to be quick enough to get away from the carnage.”
    


            And if he ever decides to run again, he said it won't be for the cheese: “I actually don't like it. It's got quite a strong aftertaste to it.”

Follow:


            From day to day, Donald Trump's second term often seems like a roman candle of grievance, with the administration spraying attacks in all directions on institutions and individuals the president considers hostile.
    


            Hardly a day goes by without Trump pressuring some new target: escalating his campaign against Harvard by trying to bar the university from enrolling foreign students; deriding musicians Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift on social media; and issuing barely veiled threats against Walmart and Apple around the companies' responses to his tariffs.
    


            Trump's panoramic belligerence may appear as to lack a more powerful unifying theme than lashing out at anything, or anyone, who has caught his eye. But to many experts, the confrontations Trump has instigated since returning to the White House are all directed toward a common, and audacious, goal: undermining the separation of powers that represents a foundational principle of the Constitution.
    


            While debates about the proper boundaries of presidential authority have persisted for generations, many historians and constitutional experts believe Trump's attempt to centralize power over American life differs from his predecessors' not only in degree, but in kind.
    


            At various points in our history, presidents have pursued individual aspects of Trump's blueprint for maximizing presidential clout. But none have combined Trump's determination to sideline Congress; circumvent the courts; enforce untrammeled control over the executive branch; and mobilize the full might of the federal government against all those he considers impediments to his plans: state and local governments and elements of civil society such as law firms, universities and nonprofit groups, and even private individuals.
    


            “The sheer level of aggression and the speed at which (the administration has) moved  ” is unprecedented, said Paul Pierson, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. “They are engaging in a whole range of behaviors that I think are clearly breaking through conventional understandings of what the law says, and of what the Constitution says.”
    


            Yuval Levin, director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, also believes that Trump is pursuing the most expansive vision of presidential power since Woodrow Wilson over a century ago.
    


            But Levin believes Trump's campaign will backfire by compelling the Supreme Court to resist his excesses and more explicitly limit presidential authority. “I think it is likely that the presidency as an institution will emerge from these four years weaker and not stronger,” Levin wrote in an email. “The reaction that Trump's excessive assertiveness will draw from the Court will backfire against the executive branch in the long run.”
    


            Other analysts, to put it mildly, are less optimistic that this Supreme Court, with its six-member Republican-appointed majority, will stop Trump from augmenting his power to the point of destabilizing the constitutional system. It remains uncertain whether any institution in the intricate political system that the nation's founders devised can do so.
    


            One defining characteristic of Trump's second term is that he's moving simultaneously against all of the checks and balances the Constitution established to constrain the arbitrary exercise of presidential power.
    


            He's marginalized Congress by virtually dismantling agencies authorized by statute, claiming the right to impound funds Congress has authorized; openly announcing he won't enforce laws he opposes (like the statute barring American companies from bribing foreign officials); and pursuing huge changes in policy (as on tariffs and immigration) through emergency orders rather than legislation.
    


            He's asserted absolute control over the executive branch through mass layoffs; an erosion of civil service protections for federal workers; the wholesale dismissal of inspectors general; and the firing of commissioners at independent regulatory agencies (a move that doubles as an assault on the authority of Congress, which structured those agencies to insulate them from direct presidential control).
    


            He's arguably already crossed the line into open defiance of lower federal courts through his resistance to orders to restore government grants and spending, and his refusal to pursue the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the undocumented immigrant the administration has acknowledged was wrongly deported to El Salvador. And while Trump so far has stopped short of directly flouting a Supreme Court order, no one could say he's done much to follow its command to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return.
    


            Trump has trampled traditional notions of federalism (especially as championed by conservatives) by systematically attempting to impose red state priorities, particularly on cultural issues, onto blue states. His administration has arrested a judge in Wisconsin and a mayor in New Jersey over immigration-related disputes. (Last week, the administration dropped the case against the Newark mayor and instead filed an assault charge against Democratic US Rep. LaMonica McIver.)
    


            Most unprecedented have been Trump's actions to pressure civil society. He has sought to punish law firms who have represented Democrats or other causes he dislikes; cut off federal research grants and threatened the tax exempt status of universities that pursue policies he opposes; directed the Justice Department to investigate ActBlue, the principal grassroots fundraising arm for Democrats, and even ordered the DOJ to investigate individual critics from his first term. Courts have already rejected some of these actions as violations of such basic constitutional rights as free speech and due process.
    


            It's difficult to imagine almost any  previous president doing any of those things, much less all of them. “This ability to just deter other actors from exercising their core rights and responsibilities at this kind of scope is something we haven't had before,” said Eric Schickler, co-author with Pierson of the 2024 book “Partisan Nation” and also a UC Berkeley political scientist.
    


            For Trump's supporters, the breadth of this campaign against the separation of powers is a feature, not a bug. Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget and one of the principal intellectual architects of Trump's second term, has argued that centralizing more power in the presidency will actually restore the Constitution's vision of checks and balances.
    


In Vought's telling, liberals “radically perverted” the founders' plan by diminishing both the president and Congress to shift influence toward “all-empowered career ‘experts'” in federal agencies. To restore proper balance to the system, Vought argued, “The Right needs to” unshackle the presidency by “throw(ing) off the precedents and legal paradigms that have wrongly developed over the last two hundred years.”
    


            Trump summarized this view more succinctly during his first term, when he memorably declared, “I have an Article II (of the Constitution), where I have  to the right to do whatever I want as president.”
    


            Whatever else can be said about the first months of Trump's second term, no one would accuse him of faltering in that belief.
    


            Earlier this year, Trump signed a proclamation honoring the 250th anniversary of the famous “give me liberty or give me death” speech by Patrick Henry, the Revolutionary War era political leader.
    


            Trump's proclamation did not note the speech Henry delivered 13 years later to the Virginia convention considering whether to endorse the newly drafted US Constitution. Henry opposed ratification, mostly because he believed the Constitution provided too little protection against a malign or corrupt president.
    


            “If your American chief, be a man of ambition, and abilities, how easy is it for him to render himself absolute!” Henry declared. If a president sought to misuse the vast authorities placed at his disposal, Henry warned, “what have you to oppose this force? What will then become of you and your rights? Will not absolute despotism ensue?”
    


            Brown University political scientist Corey Brettschneider, who highlighted that speech in his recent book “The Presidents and the People,” wrote that Henry was among the founders who most clearly recognized that the “presidency was a loaded gun and its ostensibly benign powers might be used for ill.”
    


            Even those who supported the Constitution shared some of Henry's misgivings. Preventing a descent into tyranny was a major theme throughout the Federalist Papers, the essays written primarily by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton to encourage states to adopt the Constitution.
    


            To Madison, one of the document's chief virtues was that it divided power in a manner that made it difficult for any single individual or political faction to assume absolute power. A core idea in the Constitution's design was that executive, legislative and judicial branch officials would zealously guard the prerogatives of their institution and push back when either of the others encroached on it. “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition,” Madison wrote in one of the Federalist Papers' most famous sentences. “The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place.”
    


            Madison thought the Constitution created a second line of defense against despotism. Not only would power be diffused across the three branches of the federal government, it would also be apportioned “between two distinct governments” at the national and state level. That federalism would create what Madison called “a double security (for) the rights of the people.”
    


            The Constitution always had faults, most glaringly its tolerance of slavery. And its protections wobbled and cracked at times when presidents threatened basic rights – often in, or immediately after, war time.
    


            But as Pierson and Schickler argued in “Partisan Nation,” the separation of powers generally worked as intended through most of US history. “For almost a quarter of a millennium,” they wrote, “the operation of American government tended to frustrate the efforts of a particular coalition or individual to consolidate power, dispersing political authority and encouraging pluralism.”
    


            The founders' strategy, though, was showing signs of strain even before Trump emerged as a national figure. In recent decades, Pierson and Schickler argue, the increasingly polarized and nationalized nature of our political parties has attenuated the Constitution's system of checks and balances and separation of powers (a structure often described as the Madisonian system). While Madison and his contemporaries thought that other officials would focus primarily on defending their institutional prerogatives, in modern politics, state and federal officials, and even judicial appointees, appear to prioritize their partisan identity on the Democratic or Republican team.
    


            That's steadily diminished the willingness of other power centers to push back in the way Madison expected against a president from their own side overstepping his boundaries. Trump is both building on that process and escalating it to an entirely new level of ambition.
    


            Will Trump succeed in overwhelming the separation of powers and concentrating power in the presidency – potentially to the point of undermining American freedom and democracy itself?
    


            Even to pose those questions is to contemplate possibilities that Americans have rarely needed to imagine.
    


            Brettschneider's book traces the history of public resistance to presidents who threatened civil liberties and the rule of law, including John Adams, Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. He says those precedents offer reason for optimism, but not excessive confidence, that the system will survive Trump's offensive. “We have these past victories to draw on,” Brettschneider said. “But we shouldn't be naïve: The system is fragile. We just don't know if American democracy will survive.”
    


            Levin, the author of “American Covenant,” an insightful 2024 book on the Constitution, doesn't see Trump presenting such an existential challenge. He agrees Congress is unlikely to muster much resistance to Trump's claims of unbounded authority: “The weakness of Congress, and the vacuum that weakness creates, is the deepest challenge confronting our constitutional system, even now,” Levin wrote. But he believes the Supreme Court ultimately will constrain Trump.
    


            Levin believes the court will distinguish between what he calls the “unitary executive” theory – which posits the president should exert more authority over the executive branch – and the “unitary government” theory, which would expand the president's power over other branches and civil society. “So this court will simultaneously strengthen the president's command of the executive branch … and restrain the president's attempts to violate the separation of powers,” Levin predicts. That expectation underpins his belief that Trump's power grabs ultimately are more likely to weaken than strengthen the presidency.
    


            Analysts to Levin's left are much less confident the same Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority that voted to virtually immunize Trump from criminal prosecution for official actions will consistently restrain him – or that it is guaranteed Trump will comply if it does. They tend to see Trump's second term as presenting an almost unparalleled stress test for the Constitution's interlocked mechanisms to preserve freedom and democracy.
    


            The fact that the Madisonian system of checks and balances, separation of powers and federalism has “sustained itself for 235 years can give you a lot of confidence” that it will endure, Schickler said. “What I would say is: We shouldn't be too confident. It broke once before in the Civil War. It's not going to break in the same way, but the possibility of it breaking is real.”
    


            The first months of Trump's return have revealed his determination to shatter the defenses  that system has constructed against the misuse of presidential power. Less certain is whether officials from the other branches of government, leaders in civil society, and even ordinary Americans, will show the same determination to defend them.

The German economy could lose up to €200 billion by the end of 2028 if tariffs of 50% remain in place until the end of US President Donald Trump's term in office, according to a German Economic Institute (IW) report published on Friday.

The US is Germany's main trading partner, with total goods exchange valued at €253 billion ($287 billion) in 2024, according to official data. At €17.7 billion, Germany's export surplus in the trade of goods with the US was the highest among all of its trading partners in the first quarter of 2025.

The Federal Statistical Office also reported that exports to the US exceeded imports by almost 75%.

From 2025 to 2028, German economic output would on average be 1.1% lower than without the increased tariffs, the IW report said. If the EU retaliates with similar countermeasures, the total damage could increase to €250 billion by 2028.

In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump claimed that the EU was originally formed “for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the US on trade.” He went on to say that the bloc is “very difficult to deal with.”

He accused the EU of imposing harmful economic policies, taxes, and regulations, as well as launching “unfair and unjustified lawsuits against American companies,” which he said have contributed to a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit.

According to the US Trade Representative's office, the deficit currently stands at around $240 billion per year. Trump went on to announce that, due to stalled negotiations, he is recommending a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU, effective June 1, 2025.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the criticism later that day on Fox News, saying he believes the president views the EU's proposals as falling short of the standards set by other major trading partners.

“I'm not going to negotiate on TV, but I hope this serves as a wake-up call for the EU,” he said.

The EU is committed to securing a trade agreement with the US based on mutual respect rather than threats, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic wrote on X on Friday. He added that “EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect,” but that the bloc is ready to defend its interests.

Western European leaders are looking into the possibility of purchasing American weapons and giving them to Ukraine once the arms transfers approved by the previous administration of US President Joe Biden run out, Bloomberg has reported on Saturday.

US President Donald Trump reiterated earlier this week that Washington could “walk away” from the Ukraine conflict if the American-brokered talks between Moscow and Kiev do not deliver any meaningful results. “This is a European situation. It should have remained a European situation,” he said.

A proposal to buy arms from the US for Ukraine so that it could continue fighting Russia is currently “gaining more credence” in the EU and UK amid concerns that American deliveries would cease in summer, Bloomberg reports.

“The idea is that if Trump refuses to send US weapons to Ukraine, Europe will,” people familiar with the matter explained to the agency.

The heads of the European NATO member-states believe that if they will also be able to persuade Trump to continue providing intelligence to Kiev then “Vladimir Zelensky may be able to hang on,” the sources said.

Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged that France had reached the limits of its capacity to supply domestically-produced weapons to Ukraine. “We cannot give what we do not have, and we cannot pluck our own army. We gave everything we could, tripled production,” he stated.

In March 2024, then-Vice President of the European Commission Josep Borrell described the strain on the EU's weapons stockpiles, noting that after two years of military support to Kiev, “existing stocks are depleted and the conflict has evolved from a war of stocks to a war of production.” He also pointed out that the European defense industry meets only around 40% of its own needs, meaning that member states import the majority of their military equipment.

Since returning to office in January 2025, President Trump has not announced any new US-funded military aid packages to Ukraine.

Moscow has repeatedly warned that Western arms deliveries to Ukraine will not stop its military objectives but will prolong the conflict and raise the risk of NATO confrontation. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier said the Trump administration “wants peace,” unlike Western Europe, which seeks to prolong the fighting. On Saturday, the Foreign Ministry reaffirmed Moscow's commitment to a peaceful resolution despite increased Ukrainian drone strikes.

Romanian presidential candidate George Simion has called on supporters to engage in peaceful protest against what he claims was a fraudulent election, warning that the country narrowly avoided a “bloodbath” caused by “demonic plans” allegedly orchestrated by his Western-backed political opponents.

The conservative EU critic lost a run-off vote last Sunday to pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Simion has contested the outcome, alleging “external interferences by state and non-state actors,” but Romania's Constitutional Court rejected his petition.

In a video message to supporters streamed on social media Friday night, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) described Dan as a “puppet of France” who won the election through manipulation and fearmongering after “mobilizing the entire Soros network, all the NGOs” to undermine his campaign.

“This fight is not lost,” Simion told supporters, claiming that “the right of Romanians to take to the streets” must be exercised – while stressing that any demonstrations must remain peaceful.

“Make it peaceful. I will say this every time, because they want to put us in prison,” he said, alleging that his political opponents were attempting to provoke violence in order to justify a crackdown on the opposition.

“That's what they wanted on election night,” he said, claiming that the opposing camp planned to manipulate his supporters into a “bloodbath” akin to Ukraine's 2014 coup – and allegedly had “some people who participated in the Euromaidan in Kiev.”

They had the crowd prepared – to have Romanians turn against each other again and for a civil war to erupt in Romania.

“Bloodbath. This was bound to happen. We were supposed to take to the streets… And I am glad about the decision made to avoid bloodshed. We were one step away from the country being torn apart due to the demonic plans they had,” he added.

Simion said he has stayed away from protests and would continue to do so to avoid escalating tensions, but urged supporters to “fight in the name of truth, democracy, freedom, peace, and in the name of God.”

“We are not getting anywhere. I advise you to join the AUR party or another sovereignist party, to participate with organizations, unions, your civic groups to hold protests, get involved, take to the streets, and demonstrate. Fight for Romania, because they are truly afraid of us,” he said.

The contested election followed the annulment of the previous vote, in which independent candidate Calin Georgescu led the first round with 23% of the vote. Romania's Constitutional Court overturned the results, citing electoral irregularities and allegations of foreign interference – including claims of Russian involvement, which Moscow has denied.

The Kremlin described Romania's election as “strange, at the very least,” noting that the declared winner did not secure victory until the second attempt, after the frontrunner was disqualified. Telegram founder Pavel Durov claimed on Sunday that Nicolas Lerner, the head of French foreign intelligence, personally urged him to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of the election.

MOSCOW, May 25. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was at the epicenter of repelling a large-scale attack by Ukrainian drones during his visit to the Kursk Region on May 20, air defense division commander Yuri Dashkin said.

""[Helicopter of Russian President] was virtually at the epicenter of repelling a large-scale attack by the enemy's drones. <…> The intensity of the attack during the flight of the aircraft with the Commander-in-Chief over the territory of the Kursk Region increased significantly. Therefore, we simultaneously conducted an air defense battle and ensured the safety of the presidential helicopter's flight in the air,"" Dashkin said in an interview broadcast by the Rossiya-24 TV channel.

The task was fulfilled, ""the attack by the enemy's drones was repelled, all airspace targets were destroyed,"" he added.

Putin visited the Kursk Region on May 20. In particular, he met with volunteers, as well as heads of municipalities, and acting Governor Alexander Khinshtein. The visit was the first since the bordering Russian region was liberated on April 26.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

There were several explosions in Kiev this night.

Leslie O'Neal of Georgia pulled over college student who then spent more than two weeks in federal immigration jail

A Georgia police officer has resigned from his job after erroneously pulling over a teenager, causing her to spend more than two weeks in a federal immigration jail, and leaving her facing deportation.

The officer, Leslie O'Neal, was employed at the police department in Dalton, a small city more than an hour north of Atlanta.

Though no reason for O'Neal's resignation was provided, his arrest of college student Ximena Arias-Cristobal not only led to a domino effect that could lead to her deportation – it also engendered anger and criticism, especially given the circumstances of her immigration-related detention.

On 5 May, O'Neal pulled Arias-Cristobal over in Dalton. The officer accused her of improperly making a false turn – but those charges were later dropped after the police force admitted to mistaking her car for another.

The damage, though, was done by the time Arias-Cristobal's charges were dismissed. The 19-year-old – who is undocumented and was driving with a Mexican license – was brought to the US from Mexico in 2007, when she was just four.

The timing of her having been taken to the US barely missed the deadline for her to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program initiated during Barack Obama's presidency that provided children in her situation some protections from deportation.

After O'Neal arrested her, local authorities contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the federal agency that detains and deports immigrants. Ice agents then transferred her to an immigration jail in the state.

“I cannot go to jail,” Arias-Cristobal said during the arrest, according to dash-cam footage. “I have my finals next week. My family depends on this.”

Arias-Cristobal's plight captured national attention, with many supporting her and calling for her release. Others – including the far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – agitated for Arias-Cristobal to be deported.

“In Mexico, today, there's over 1.6 million United States of America citizens, living and thriving in Mexico, and I'm sure she and her family will be able to do the same,” Greene said during an interview with Georgia's Local 3 News. “But it's important for our nation, for our sovereignty, for us to uphold the law. And this is what we have to do.”

The White House's attempts to engage in “mass deportations” during Donald Trump's second presidency has led to an increase in arrests throughout the country. Immigration enforcement operations have been aided by local jurisdictions that partner with Ice, under what are known as 287(g) contracts. These contracts deputize local officials to carry out immigration enforcement arrests, collaborating closely with Ice.

The Whitfield county sheriff's office, which runs the local jail for people arrested in Dalton, has a 287(g) contract with Ice.

Additionally, a law signed last year by Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, requires local law enforcement, in the entire state, to apply to enter into 287(g) contracts with Ice. Immigration advocacy organizations have called that law “disastrous”.

The Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, for instance, said it would lead to “racial profiling, terrorize immigrant communities and waste local resources”.

Arias-Cristobal's father, José Arias-Tovar, had also been detained by Ice weeks earlier after another traffic stop for speeding. He bonded out of Ice detention on 16 May. Five days later, Arias-Cristobal paid a $1,500 bond, leading to her release. She was home with her family by Thursday evening.

“We're going to keep working on her case to try to keep her here permanently,” Arias-Cristobal's attorney, Dustin Baxter, told local TV station WSB-TV.

Arias-Cristobal's arrest has prompted some to rally for her release, whether in person or online. Her advocates have criticized Ice and the local police department for how they have handled her case.

A GoFundMe campaign launched for her legal defense has raised more than $90,000.

The jail where Arias-Cristobal was detained before she bonded out is known as the Stewart detention center. It is a run privately in Lumpkin, Georgia, by CoreCivic under a contract with Ice and for years has been accused of violating rights and maintaining horrific conditions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Assailant in Carmel tried to punch 13-year-old in face before she threw him to the ground and broke his ankle

A 13-year-old California girl is reminding the public that knowing self-defense can save one's life after she reportedly used her martial arts training to fend off a stranger who tried to assault her – breaking the grown man's ankle in the process.

The girl, whose name has not been widely shared, recently had to fight to protect herself three years since she began attending jiu-jitsu classes in Carmel, California, about 75 miles (120km) from San Jose, the local news station KSBW reported.

Her jiu-jitsu instructor, Michael Blackburn, told the outlet that the teen was walking home from school on 6 May when a man she did not know stepped out from between two parked cars and tried “to punch her in the face”.

The girl immediately turned to her training to defend herself, as Blackburn put it.

“She punched him, she … got him in a headlock, kneed him a couple of times, spun him around, threw him on the ground,” said Blackburn, who teaches jiu-jitsu at the Carmel Youth Center. “And she had stepped on his foot doing all this – and when she threw him to the ground, she broke his ankle.”

The girl managed to run home safely. Meanwhile, her assailant fled. Police were not immediately able to identify a suspect in the foiled attack – and asked anyone in the quaint beach community with a population of about 3,100 to come forward if they had potentially helpful information.

“We're doing everything we can to figure out who this person [is who] is responsible for what happened,” the local police department commander, Todd Trayer, told KSBW.

Trayer added that investigators surmise the man may have been under the influence of an intoxicant or “dealing with some other personal issues”.

Blackburn, for his part, said it broke his heart that his student was forced to face down such danger. However, he said to KSBW, he was grateful his student had mastered how to protect herself with jiu-jitsu, a Japanese style of weaponless fighting that emphasizes subduing opponents with holds, throws and paralyzing strikes.

“We're proud of her, and she did exactly what she was supposed to do,” Blackburn said. “You have to fight in class like you're going to protect yourself on the street.”

The girl said she hopes her story inspires others to learn self-defense, according to KSBW.

Meanwhile, though they were shocked that one of their own could endure such frightening circumstances, residents said they indeed found inspiration in the girl's bravery.

“I think it was amazing what she did,” longtime Carmel resident Richard Cushman said to KION, another local news outlet. “It's fantastic, but it's horrible what happened.”

The Carmel Youth Center's chief executive officer, Keith Padgett, added to KION that the girl had authored “a great story of survival”.

“A young person taking charge of their life and not letting anything happen to them – it's a sad story but a great ending,” Padgett remarked.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

After boasting he would end the war within 24 hours, the question now is whether US president has disengaged



The noises in Kyiv in the early hours of Sunday morning went like this. First was the staccato sound of the air defences booming on the edge of the city. As those guns stopped, the sound of drone motors approaching was audible, getting quickly louder before the briefest moment of silence and then a sudden detonation.

But, after two days of heavy Russian air raids that hit civilian buildings across Ukraine, the response has been silence from Donald Trump.

In the space of just over a week, since the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since March 2022 broke up inconclusively with no sign of a ceasefire, the failure of his intervention has become clear.

Boasting before his inauguration as US president that he could end the war in 24 hours, he has instead emboldened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by declining to impose pressure for an immediate ceasefire – backed by Europe – or meaningful sanctions.

Since Trump's two-hour call with Putin last Monday, the Russian leader has made clear his disdain even as Trump's own Defense Intelligence Agency predicted that Moscow would continue fighting through this year.

In the aftermath of the call, Putin has ordered the creation of a “security buffer zone” along Ukraine's eastern border. Strikes on civilian targets only seem to be accelerating, culminating in two straight days of air raids, including Saturday night's – the heaviest aerial bombardment of the war so far, with almost 300 drones and nearly 70 missiles.

Ukrainian and western officials anticipate that Russia will once again attempt a large-scale offensive during the summer, even if they are highly sceptical that it will be effective given Moscow's punishing losses.

The reality is that with deadlock on the ground, the escalating long-range drone war on both sides is becoming ever more significant, even if it cannot conquer territory.

As it has become ever larger, with Russian and Ukrainian factories turning out thousands of new drones, it has become more sophisticated with Moscow's employment of big numbers of decoys and systems designed to fool air defence systems.

While Ukraine has targeted bases and factories, including those producing fibre optic cable for a new generation of small combat zones, the purpose on Russia's side appears aimed solely at undermining morale on the home front. In recent days, drones and missiles have hit apartment blocks, homes and a student dormitory.

On Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, angrily denounced “the silence of America … encouraging Putin”. His words raised a more critical question: whether Trump, as he has long threatened, has already walked away from his perfunctory efforts to end the war.

When a US official did stir themselves to condemn the strikes, what was missing – any suggestion that Putin and Moscow were responsible- was as significant as what was said.

Posting on X, Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, condemned the attacks under an image of fires in the Ukrainian capital. “This is Kyiv,” he wrote. “The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.”

Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, has suggested in his newsletter on the war that, far from the recent talks heralding any hopes of a breakthrough, they had in fact removed any pretence that the US-mediated talks were going anywhere.

“On Monday the great charade we have been seeing for months came to an end,” wrote O'Brien this weekend. “The charade was that Trump was trying to negotiate a deal between Ukraine and Russia that would work for both states. The reality was always that Trump was trying to bludgeon Ukraine into making major concessions to Russia and help Putin achieve many of his strategic goals.”

If Trump has already disengaged, that raises a number of difficult questions for Kyiv: will the US continue supplying military aid in sufficient quantities? More crucially, can Europe step into the diplomatic and military void provoked by that disengagement?

What is clear to Ukrainians, despite the several weeks of headlines over the potential for a breakthrough in peace talks, is that without pressure from Washington, or hugely accelerated aid from Europe, the war will grind on. And there will be more nights like Saturday's in their future.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwanese table tennis players Lin Yun-ju (林昀儒) and Kao Cheng-jui (高承睿) yesterday secured a silver medal in the men's doubles at the ITTF World Table Tennis Championships in Doha, losing to their Japanese opponents in the final.

After ousting the world No. 1 pair, the French Lebrun brothers, a day earlier, the Taiwanese duo, the sixth-seeded men's doubles team in the tournament, were defeated by the Japanese world No. 2 pairing of Hiroto Shinozuka and Shunsuke Togami 2-3 in the title match.

Lin and Kao, who were appearing at only their second international event as a doubles pairing, took an early lead by winning the first game 11-6.

However, the Japanese team bounced straight back to win the second game 5-11 and draw level.

In the third game, the Taiwanese pair again ran out winners with an 11-7 victory to bring the match to a 2-1 lead.

In the fourth game, Lin and Kao failed to take their chances, with their Japanese opponents winning 6-11 to take the match to a 2-2 tie.

In the deciding game, Lin and Kao were unable to rally, losing by 11 points to six, with the Japanese duo taking a hard-fought 3-2 victory and the gold medal.

This was the first time in 12 years a men's table tennis duo from Taiwan has won a medal at the ITTF World Championships.

Taiwan had its best performance in the tournament when the men's doubles team of Chuang Chih-yuan (莊智淵) and Chen Chien-an (陳建安) won the country's first gold medal in 2013.

With bitcoin reaching a new record, it shows more investors are getting swept up in the dream of “being their own bank” via tokens that can be transferred instantly and anonymously outside the traditional financial system. Yet at the same time, there seems to be too little awareness of the cost of being your own bank security guard in a cashless world. 

A recent double-digit rise in crypto-exchange hacks and a wave of brazen crypto-executive kidnapping attempts — with the latest taking place in broad daylight on the streets of Paris — has put the industry on edge and ramped up interest in security,  with 23 such attacks recorded this year by one database (up from six over the same period last year), Bloomberg News said. They have resulted in grisly mutilations, such as severed fingers, and have pressured the French government to do more to stop them, even if statistically, France scores relatively well on crimes such as homicide.

This goes way beyond one country; crime is changing everywhere. Banks are no longer easy or juicy targets for robbers, with heists down more than 80 percent since the 1990s, as branches close and piles of cash hoarded in safes become a rarity. We are also all carrying less cash in a payments world driven by taps and swipes. Personal safety was one reason put forward by ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus a decade ago for making Sweden a cashless economy.

Meanwhile, other forms of criminality have become more prevalent as technological and social upheaval sees bandits adapt. The spread of digital wallets on platforms such as Coinbase Global Inc is attracting hackers, most recently to obtain client data.

Exchange hacks rose 17 percent last year, compliance firm TRM said. High-value muggings such as watch theft have become more lucrative, with the total value of lost and stolen timepieces in the UK now at ￡1.6 billion (US$2.17 billion), Watch Register said. Home-jackings are also on the rise; celebrity Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in a Paris hotel in 2016.

The rise of physical attacks on crypto holders and their families is the grimly logical next step, a symbolic return to the pre-banking days of highway robber Dick Turpin. The downside of high capital mobility is high physical vulnerability: Extorting crypto face-to-face is known as a “wrench attack,” because of its simplicity, brutality and potential high return. One social media slip-up can reveal your whereabouts to criminals, who themselves are also becoming more tech-savvy and able to organize a heist through digital channels.

Deterrence is going to be key in tackling this kind of crime, and it is heartening that police are doing a good job tracking down gangs and seizing ransom payments. What is less encouraging in France is prison overcrowding and its knock-on impact on sentencing. 

Yet the debate about how to balance security and liberty is also brushing up against crypto's libertarian ethos. Some industry entrepreneurs think the best way to avoid being targeted is more anonymity — and the right to bear arms, which is tightly regulated in France. 

Without sounding too squeamish and European, I am not convinced. 

“Carrying a weapon is a serious step requiring serious training,” said Bruno Pomart, a former member of elite police unit RAID. “Nor does it solve the problem of vulnerable family members based elsewhere.”

The more likely outcome would be demand for private security firms and better protection. 

Security specialist Topaz Group CEO Salvatore Furnari said he is increasingly in touch with crypto-industry figures and advising them on a top-to-bottom rethink of how to protect themselves and their associates. 

“The crypto world is going through the same things banks used to,” he said.

However, this all comes at a cost — and it might be that some types of investors decide that owning crypto is not worth it. 

One tech executive said he simply sold his portfolio for peace of mind. 

Regulators might also eventually decide that crypto needs to be more centralized, not less, to help combat crime. 

After Italy was hit with a wave of shocking abductions during the “years of lead,” the government eventually moved to dissuade extortion by freezing victims' financial assets and those of their families. 

This would be clearly anathema to crypto owners. However, if we are all going to end up being our own bank, it might be another type of alarm to consider.

Although the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, Trump's language struck a raw nerve in Taiwan given his open siding with Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression seeking to “reunify” Ukraine and Russia. On earlier occasions, Trump has criticized Taiwan for “stealing” the US' chip industry and for relying too much on the US for defense, ominously presaging a weakening of US support for Taiwan. However, further examination of Trump's remarks in                                    



                                                                                It is being said every second day: The ongoing recall campaign in Taiwan — where citizens are trying to collect enough signatures to trigger re-elections for a number of Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) legislators — is orchestrated by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), or even President William Lai (賴清德) himself. The KMT makes the claim, and foreign media and analysts repeat it.
However, they never show any proof — because there is not any.
It is alarming how easily academics, journalists and experts toss around claims that amount to accusing a democratic government of conspiracy — without a shred of evidence. These                                    



                                                                                China on May 23, 1951, imposed the so-called “17-Point Agreement” to formally annex Tibet. In March, China in its 18th White Paper misleadingly said it laid “firm foundations for the region's human rights cause.” 
The agreement is invalid in international law, because it was signed under threat. Ngapo Ngawang Jigme, head of the Tibetan delegation sent to China for peace negotiations, was not authorized to sign the agreement on behalf of the Tibetan government and the delegation was made to sign it under duress.
After seven decades, Tibet remains intact and there is global outpouring of sympathy for Tibetans. This realization                                    



                                                                                Taiwan is confronting escalating threats from its behemoth neighbor. Last month, the Chinese People's Liberation Army conducted live-fire drills in the East China Sea, practicing blockades and precision strikes on simulated targets, while its escalating cyberattacks targeting government, financial and telecommunication systems threaten to disrupt Taiwan's digital infrastructure.

At a calligraphy class in Hanoi, Hoang Thi Thanh Huyen slides her brush across the page to form the letters and tonal marks of Vietnam's unique modern script, in part a legacy of French colonial rule.

The history of romanized Vietnamese, or Quoc Ngu, links the arrival of the first Christian missionaries, colonization by the French and the rise to power of the Communist Party of Vietnam.

It is now reflected in the country's “bamboo diplomacy” approach of seeking strength through flexibility, or looking to stay on good terms with the world's major powers.

A month after Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) visited, French President Emmanuel Macron arrived yesterday.

Huyen, 35, takes weekly calligraphy classes alongside six others at her teacher's tiny home as “a way to relax after work.”

“When I do calligraphy, I feel like I'm talking to my inner self,” she said, her head bent in concentration.

Macron is today to visit Hanoi's star attraction, the Temple of Literature, whose walls and explanatory panels are decorated with calligraphy in both traditional Chinese-influenced characters and Quoc Ngu.

Colonization led to the widespread use of Quoc Ngu — which uses accents and signs to reflect the consonants, vowels and tones of Vietnamese — but it was created two centuries earlier on the initiative of Catholic priests. When the Avignon-born Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes published the first Portuguese-Vietnamese-Latin dictionary under his own name in 1651, it was primarily intended for missionaries wishing to spread their religion in what was then called Dai Viet. 

The French then spread the Latin alphabet while training the civil servants who helped them govern Indochina, said Khanh-Minh Bui, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in 19th and 20th-century Vietnamese history.

Another motive was “severing connections with an older civilization, which has greatly influenced the elites,” in this case China, she added.

Compared with the characters that had been in use for centuries, Quoc Ngu was far easier to learn. Its adoption fueled an explosion in newspapers and publishing which helped spread anti-colonial ideas that ultimately led to the rise of the Communist Party of Vietnam.

“Quoc Ngu carried the promise of a new education, a new way of thinking,” Minh said.

When Ho Chi Minh proclaimed independence in 1945, it was “unthinkable” to turn back the clock, she added. 

Today, a Western tourist lost in the alleys of Hanoi can read the street names, but would have a hard time pronouncing them correctly without understanding the diacritics used to transcribe the six tones of Vietnamese.

Calligraphy teacher Nguyen Thanh Tung, who has several young students in his class, said he has noticed rising interest in traditional Vietnamese culture.

“I believe that it's in our blood, a gene that flows in every Vietnamese person, to love their traditional culture,” he said.

Calligraphy in Quoc Ngu offers more artistic freedom “in terms of color, shape, idea” than that using characters, he believes.

“Culture is not the property of one country, it's an exchange between regions,” added Tung, 38. “English and French borrow words from other languages, and it's the same for Vietnamese.”


BACKLASH: 
                                        The National Party quit its decades-long partnership with the Liberal Party after their election loss to center-left Labor, which won a historic third term                                        Australia's National Party has split from its conservative coalition partner of more than 60 years, the Liberal Party, citing policy differences over renewable energy and after a resounding loss at a national election this month.
“Its time to have a break,” Nationals leader David Littleproud told reporters yesterday.
The split shows the pressure on Australia's conservative parties after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left Labor party won a historic second term in the May 3 election, powered by a voter backlash against US President Donald Trump's policies.
Under the long-standing partnership in state and federal politics, the Liberal and National coalition had shared power                                    


NO EXCUSES: 
                                        Marcos said his administration was acting on voters' demands, but an academic said the move was emotionally motivated after a poor midterm showing                                        Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr yesterday sought the resignation of all his Cabinet secretaries, in a move seen as an attempt to reset the political agenda and assert his authority over the second half of his single six-year term.
The order came after the president's allies failed to win a majority of Senate seats contested in the 12 polls on Monday last week, leaving Marcos facing a divided political and legislative landscape that could thwart his attempts to have an ally succeed him in 2028.
“He's talking to the people, trying to salvage whatever political capital he has left. I think it's

During a head-to-head debate lasting two hours, centrist Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's governing pro-European coalition, faced the Eurosceptic historian Karol Nawrocki, backed by the right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS).
The two candidates, who qualified for the second round after coming in the top two places in the first vote on Sunday last week, clashed over Poland's relations with Ukraine, EU policy and the track records of their

Ukraine brought home 303 prisoners of war on May 25 in the final phase of a 1000-for-1000 prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. 

The prisoner exchange took place in three phases carried out over three days and was agreed on during peace talks held in Turkey on May 16, the first direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in three years. 

""I thank the team that worked around the clock to successfully carry out this exchange. We will definitely bring back every single one of our people from Russian captivity,"" Zelensky wrote in a post on X. 

The returning prisoners included members of Ukraine's Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Guard Service, and State Special Transport Service, Zelensky stated. 

Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of POWs said that the released prisoners included 70 men who had defended Mariupol during the Russian siege of the port city in 2022. 

The coordination headquarters added that 5,757 Ukrainian prisoners had been returned through negotiations and exchanges since March 2022, while another 536 Ukrainians had returned through other means. 

The prisoner exchange was the only concrete agreement to arise out of the direct talks held last week. 

Ukraine and the United States have been pushing for Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire, but Russia ""categorically"" rejected the appeal in Turkey, according to First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Serhiy Kyslytsia, who attended the talks as a member of the Ukrainian delegation.

Russia's military advantage against Ukraine is declining, the Washington Post (WP) reported on May 24, citing U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials and military experts. 

While Russia's military difficulties could be an opportunity for Ukraine's allies to mount pressure against Moscow in hopes of securing a ceasefire, U.S. President Donald Trump has backed away from international sanctions efforts and appears increasingly unwilling to challenge Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Moscow faces critical shortages of weapons and manpower, making the time ripe for escalated pressure, multiple officials told the WP, many speaking on the condition of anonymity.

""Russia is very gradually taking bits of territory still, but at an unsustainably high cost,"" said Richard Barrons, the former head of the United Kingdom's Joint Forces Command.

A Ukrainian security official told the WP that Russia was not able to gain ground despite its significant personnel advantages and that the slowed advance may be partly a result of Ukraine's incursion in Kursk Oblast, which aimed to divert Russia's military resources from the front lines. 

""Russia is not able to take any ground, and this is the situation pretty much since the end of the Ukrainian counteroffensive,"" the official said, referring to Ukraine's attempt to retake Russian-occupied territories in 2023. 

""Despite the fact that they still have three-to-one superiority in number of troops — and maybe even bigger in terms of (weapons) systems — it's still not enough.""

Western experts also calculate that Russia's arsenal of tanks is likely to run out in the next few months, the WP reported. 

""The Russians can continue fighting, but … the force will become more and more de-mechanized over time, and that does put a timeline on how long they can sustain the current way they operate,"" Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the WP. 

Barrons also said Russia was running out of opportunities to conduct major offensives in Ukraine. 

""It is very unlikely now that the Russian military have the equipment, the people, and the training and logistics to mount an offensive that would break the Ukrainian line and — even if they did — to exploit it immediately,"" he said. 

In light of these obstacles, coordinated pressure against Russia could be more effective now than any point since the eary days of the full-scale war, officials said. 

According to a May report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Putin still remains confident in Russia's ability to secure ""ultimate victory"" in Ukraine, including the full occupation of four Ukrainian regions. 

This confidence is reflected in Russia's strategy of dragging out peace talks while escalating deadly attacks against Ukraine. Trump even admitted, just days after holding a two-hour phone conversation with the Russian leader, that Putin is not interested in peace because he believes he is winning the war. 

""Putin believes that time is on his side, and Ukraine is bleeding faster than Russia,"" a senior European official told the WP. 

But some officials suggested that Putin may be basing his confidence on reports from subordinates that understate Russia's increasing difficulties. 

""I think they overestimate the current success of Russia,"" one senior European official said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called Putin's continued delays in the peace process ""a mockery of the whole world"" in remarks on May 23. 

""And it's definitely time to put more pressure on Russia,"" he said.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

Russia's large-scale attack on May 25 killed three people in Kyiv Oblast and injured 10 others, including two children, according to regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk. 

Russia barraged Ukraine with missiles and drones throughout the night, threatening every region in the country. The attacks marked the second night in a row Russia launched a mass aerial assault on Kyiv and other cities. 

The wave of attacks left three people dead in Kyiv Oblast, Kalashnyk said. 

The bodies of two victims were found when first responders extinguished a fire in the Obukhiv district, he said. Another person was killed in the Bucha district. 

Two other people in the Bucha district were wounded. 

Six people were also injured in the Bila Tserkva district, Kalashnyk reported. Two of the victims were children. 

In the Fastiv district, the attacks injured two women, the governor said. 

Emergency services are at work at the attack sites. 

Across Ukraine, attacks continued throughout the night and into the morning as Russia fired relentless waves of drones and missiles. Explosions were in Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Sumy, Konotop, Chernihiv, and Kharkiv.

The night before, three civilians outside the capital in Kyiv Oblast were injured amid another large-scale Russian aerial attack.

Golf carts line Spanish Springs Town Square in the Villages, a retirement community in Sumter County, Fla., June 30, 2019. Some 60,000 carts ply the neighborhoods, which are laid out so the roughly 120,000 residents can meet all their shopping, medical and entertainment needs without a full-size vehicle.EVE EDELHEIT/The New York Times News Service

Where is it legal to drive a golf cart on the road? Having a vehicle like that would make it easier to run some errands and pick up my kids or times when the trip is short and the minivan seems like way too much car. I know there are large e-bikes that can carry kids, but I'm not super keen about that option. – Katherine, Dundas, Ont. 

Ontario is taking a swing at letting golf carts on public roads – but only in three small lakeside towns.

As part of a 10-year pilot program that started in 2021, the province allows golf carts on roads with speed limits of 50 kilometres an hour or less on Pelee Island in Lake Erie, in Huron-Kinloss on Lake Huron and in the Lighthouse Cove community in Lakeshore, about 325 kilometres southwest of Toronto.

Everywhere else in Ontario, golf carts are only allowed on private property.

In 2024, there were 186 golf carts in the pilot program, including rental carts for tourists.

They're only allowed on roads from April 1 to Nov. 30. To drive one, you need a valid driver's licence – and you're not allowed to ride with kids under eight years old. 

The carts can't be capable of going faster than 32 kilometres an hour, can only be driven in the right-most lane and must have a slow-moving vehicle sign.

How do I sign up?

So, if you don't live in a tiny tourist town, what are the chances of your town or city joining the pilot so you can take a golf cart to Costco? 

Ontario's Ministry of Transportation (MTO) said the pilot isn't open for general applications. 

“[We] may review new requests where there is demonstrated municipal interest,” MTO spokeswoman Julia Caslin said in an e-mail.

The province rejected a 2023 request from the town of Amherstburg, about 30 kilometres south of Windsor, to allow golf carts on Bois Blanc Island in the Detroit River. 

The city of Hamilton, which includes Dundas, said it's not considering joining the pilot “at this time.”

“[The pilot] makes sense for those communities who are currently participating since they are relatively self-contained and recreational [or] seasonal-oriented,” Steve Molloy, acting director of transportation planning for the city of Hamilton, said in an e-mail.

The golf cart pilot is separate from a pilot allowing low-speed vehicles (LSVs) – small EVs not capable of going faster than 40 kilometres an hour – on roads with speed limits of 50 kilometres an hour or less. The LSV pilot, which is running in Toronto, Ottawa, Lambton Shores and Haldimand County, doesn't include golf carts. 

At the forefront?

Although MTO is tracking all collisions involving golf carts in the pilot, it's not releasing the numbers publicly.

Golf carts in the pilot don't need insurance or licence plates, but drivers have to follow the rules of the road and local bylaws. Golf cart drivers impaired by alcohol or drugs could face charges under the Criminal Code of Canada. 

Golf carts are banned from public roads across Canada, although some provinces allow them to cross certain public roads briefly to get from one part of a golf course to another. 

But three provinces – Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia – also have pilots allowing golf carts on public roads in some towns. 

Unlike in Ontario, they only allow golf carts to be driven on public roads during the day. 

In Alberta, golf carts are allowed in 18 rural towns under a five-year pilot that started last fall. Drivers must be 14 or older but don't need a driver's licence.

So far, the province hasn't received any reports of injuries, collisions or complaints, Alberta's Transportation Ministry said in an e-mail. 

Curtis Schoepp, the mayor of Whispering Hills, a lakeside summer village about 165 kilometres north of Edmonton, said last year that residents were already using golf carts before the pilot made them legal on the road.

“All they're doing is just driving to their neighbour's 100 feet away or to the beach or whatever, right?” Schoepp told The Canadian Press. “So this just makes it more convenient.”

To drive a golf cart on public roads in the pilots in Saskatchewan and B.C., you need a valid driver's licence and liability insurance. 

In B.C., golf carts are only allowed in the village of Chase, about 60 kilometres northeast of Kamloops. They've been allowed on some streets there since 2016, despite some initial pushback from locals. 

In the U.S., a number of states including Arizona, Florida and Hawaii, allow golf carts on public roads with lower speed limits.

Drivers are reminded to watch for people using “low-speed vehicles” in the Villages, a retirement community in Sumter County, Fla., June 30, 2019.EVE EDELHEIT/The New York Times News Service

I don't use social media much anymore, but, just like every other personal trainer in search of an audience, every now and then I'll share videos offering technique tips for various exercises. These videos typically end with me in my body's default state of repose: a deep, butt-to-heels squat or seated on the floor with my legs crossed in a quasi lotus pose, where I'd recap some key takeaways. These positions come naturally to me – still, in the comments for these videos, people would chime in with praise for my ability to simply sit.

This feedback on my sitting form proved to be the catalyst that led to my eureka moment. It hit me, then and there, that strong muscles are nearly useless unless you can move your body in a graceful, pain-free manner.

At 79 years old, fitness influencer Joan MacDonald is the strongest she's ever been

Now, I know when it comes to grand revelations, this one isn't quite up there with Archimedes figuring out the principle of water displacement, but simple ideas can still have a profound impact. Ever since I started prioritizing movement and mobility over the pursuit of muscle mass, all of my clients have reported seeing greater results. Training injuries have all but disappeared. Same goes for the typical aches and pains that tend to plague people over 40. Just as important, our training sessions became more fun. 

Developing high-quality mobility doesn't have to be a complicated process, nor does it have to be a separate entity removed from strength training. In fact, when done properly, strength training can be mobility training, and vice versa. My approach involves taking two basic positions – the A-frame and the squat – and spicing them up with some added movements. Here are two of my favourite variations on these familiar standards.

The A-frame is essentially the same as the downward dog, only we're taking it out of the context of yoga class. Whatever you want to call it, the basic setup is the same. Begin on all fours – hand under the shoulder, knees under the hips. Lift your butt towards the ceiling as you push through the floor with your arms and extend your legs, putting your body into an inverted “V” shape. 

Now for the magic. Take one hand and reach back toward the opposite foot, allowing your torso to twist from the shoulders to the hip in the process. Repeat the movement with the other hand, and continue to alternate hand to foot for 30-45 seconds. To make this a little easier, try reaching for your knee instead of your foot. To make the movement more intense, reach for the outside edge of your heel.

For the most benefit, your grounded arm needs to push deep into the floor, and your hips need to remain as high in the air as possible. The combination of these actions – reaching and twisting with hips high – allows the spine to decompress, while also strengthening the shoulders, hands and wrists. You'll feel a nice stretch in the hamstrings and calves, too.

Settling into a deep squat is a great way to improve hip, knee and ankle mobility. Add in some thoracic rotation and an overhead reach, and you've got one of the most productive, total-body movements. Don't worry if your squat isn't picture perfect. Work within the range of motion that's comfortable for you, making use of props for extra support if needed. 

Once you've found a suitable depth, reach one arm toward the ceiling while rotating your torso in the same direction. Keeping the opposite arm on the ground (or your prop) will help to generate some leverage and will also keep you balanced. Now switch sides and keep repeating the sequence for 30-45 seconds. 

You'll likely notice right away that reaching directly overhead from this position is a tall order. That's pretty much the point of the exercise. Try not to force things into place; if you hit a sticky spot, stop, switch sides, and then see if you can go a little deeper on the next repetition. 

Each of these exercises can be performed as part of a warm-up before any activity, or they can be the very foundation of your entire training plan. You can even toss them into your weight training routine as a form of active rest between lifts. It all depends on your goals, and your willingness to explore new avenues.

Canada's Victoria Mboko celebrates beating New Zealand's Lulu Sun during their first round match of the French Tennis Open, at the Roland-Garros stadium, in Paris, May 25.Christophe Ena/The Associated Press

Victoria Mboko is still just 18, still rather new to the top level of professional tennis, and yet with a big serve, a terrific backhand and enviable court coverage, the Canadian is making the most of her first season on tour, including a victory in her Grand Slam debut on Sunday at the French Open.

When it was mentioned that her 6-1, 7-6 (4) elimination of 2024 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Lulu Sun meant Mboko has claimed all eight sets she's played over the past week-plus on the red clay at Roland-Garros – including six in a trio of triumphs in the qualifying rounds – the teen laughed, revealing the braces on her teeth.

“This does, obviously, feel really quick for me. Although it feels quick, I feel like I'm also adapting very quickly. I want to be in this level,” said Mboko, represented by talent agency IMG since the age of 12. “To adapt really fast is really important to me. The more I feel like I make it seem normal to me, the more normal it's going to be in these tournaments.”

Against the left-handed Sun, Mboko's serve – which she considers her game's greatest strength – played a significant role in the outcome.

With her father and two of her older siblings in the stands at Court 9, a short walk from Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Mboko reached a top speed of 115 mph and delivered seven aces. She won all 10 of her service games, saving all seven break points accumulated by Sun.

“I love to dictate points on my serve, and I love to use that as an opportunity to be more aggressive and be up in the score,” said Mboko, who is currently ranked 120th. “Especially in women's tennis, having a good serve and holding all the time is pretty crucial. It helps me get out of a lot of sticky situations.”

Her favourite player as a kid – not all that long ago, actually – was Serena Williams, whose 23 Grand Slam titles often came with the help of top-notch serving.

“I always modelled myself on the idea of her game. Of course, not everything I do is the same. But she had such a powerful game, and that's something that I would love to replicate and love to present my game off of that,” Mboko said. “It's great to have a role model like that and try to do something like she did.”

Mboko began to really get noticed in the world of tennis at the start of this year, when she won 22 matches in a row – all in straight sets – to earn four lower-level International Tennis Federation titles. Her first WTA match arrived at the Miami Open in March, and she won that debut, too.

She's been impressing opponents along the way, including 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff. Mboko pushed the American, who is ranked No. 2 right now, to three sets on clay at the Italian Open this month.

“She's playing top-level tennis,” Gauff said after that win. “For sure, on the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that. As far as the other parts of her game, she's obviously a big hitter, can play well, moves pretty well, has a nice backhand, same on the forehand.”

Mboko grew up playing mostly on indoor hard courts in Canada and calls that her “favourite surface for my whole life.”

That said, she's starting to get used to – and enjoy – the clay used at the French Open.

“In the future? I guess we'll see. You never know. I feel like I've been doing pretty OK on the clay so far, even though it was my least favourite surface and I thought it was my worst surface, too,” Mboko said. “But you never know.”

Xabi Alonso will take over as Real Madrid coach from June 1, the Spanish club has confirmed. The former midfield star returns after leading Bayer Leverkusen to a historic domestic treble.

Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid has confirmed Bayer Leverkusen coachXabi Alonso as its new coach from June 1.

Former midfielder Alonso had confirmed earlier this month he would leave Leverkusen, having last season led the club to its first Bundesliga title to end Bayern Munich's 11-year domination of the league.

""Xabi Alonso will be the Real Madrid coach for the next three seasons, from June 1, 2025 until June 30, 2028,"" the Spanish club said in a statement. The move had been widely expected.

Basque trainer Alonso had an agreement allowing him to leave if one of his former clubs — Real Madrid, Liverpool, or Bayern Munich — wanted to hire him.

His achievement of going domestically unbeaten during Leverkusen's surprise run had made him a top target for European clubs.

As well as winning the league with Leverkusen last season, Alonso also completed a historic domestic treble by steering them to German Cup and German Super Cup victories.

The 43-year-old takes over at the Spanish club from Italian Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to become Brazil's national team coach ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Despite having a year left on his contract, Ancelotti has reportedly agreed to part ways with the club after an underwhelming season and his interest in the Brazil job.

Alonso is set to join Real ahead of the expanded Club World Cup, set to take place in the United States from June 14 to July 14.

He began his coaching career with Real Madrid's youth academy, managing the Under-14 team during the 2018–19 season.

Alonso played for the club from 2009 to 2014, making 236 appearances and winning multiple titles, including the Champions League, La Liga, and Copa del Rey. 

As a player at Liverpool, Alonso won the 2005 UEFA Champions League with a crucial goal in the final. At Bayern Munich, he secured three consecutive Bundesliga titles and the 2016 German Cup.

A power outage hit the glitzy resort on the French Riviera as the Cannes Film Festival was drawing to a close. Officials have said the outage came after a substation and an electricity pylon were vandalized.

A major power outage hit the area around the French Riviera resort of Cannes on Saturday, the final day of the Cannes Film Festival.

The power cut began just after 10:00 a.m. local time (8:00 a.m. GMT) due to a fire that broke out overnight in a substation in the nearby village of Tanneron. The fire has since been extinguished.

Cannes mayor David Lisnard had said officials believe it was ""targeted in a criminal act.""

In Villeneuve–Louet, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) northeast of Cannes, three pillars of an electricity pylon holding up a high-voltage power line were cut, prosecutors from the Alpes-Maritimes department said.

""The Prosecutor's Office of Alpes-Maritimes condemns in the strongest possible terms these acts against the integrity of our infrastructures,"" a statement said. 

It added that power supplies were being ""progressively"" restored.

According to grid operator RTE, the power outage affected 160,000 homes in Cannes and the surrounding area.

The outage caused traffic lights to fail and led to traffic jams in the glitzy holiday resort. Shops were closed on one of the main streets.

Teams from RTE and supplier Enedis were working to restore the network. 

The Cannes Film Festival organizers said the closing ceremony would not be affected by the power outage.

The festival announced it had ""switched to an alternative electricity power supply, which enables us to maintain the events and screenings planned for today in normal conditions, including the closing ceremony."" 

However, morning screenings at the festival's cinemas were briefly interrupted while the supply switched to generators.

At the closing ceremony, scheduled to start at 16:40 GMT, French actress Juliette Binoche and her jury will announce the winners of the festival's top prizes. Twenty-two films are competing for the Palme d'Or this year.

Battered and bruised by a week of revelations about his health, Joe Biden took comfort in a familiar routine and attended evening mass on Saturday.

His slimmed-down motorcade – just two black SUVs – drove up just as the bells at St Joseph's on the Brandywine, near his Delaware home, finished tolling.

Just as he has done for decades, as senator, vice president and president, he attended five o'clock mass, arriving with just his security detail.

He wore a blue blazer and slip-on trainers for his visit, walking past gravestones on his way to the church entrance, offering a cheque for the collection and a hug to a church official.

Afterwards he emerged with his sister Valerie, and spent 20 minutes greeting and talking with parishioners, who said he appeared strong and was finding comfort in his faith.

Mgr John Hopkins said: “He's been part of this community for what... 40, 50 years. This is a place where he can be at peace.”

A week earlier Mr Biden, 82, revealed that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.

During the past week, a book was also published that contains extraordinary allegations that he had struggled to recognise friends or aides at times during his four years in office, while his top officials battled to keep him in power.

The details threaten to derail post-presidential plans to build his legacy with a library and to cash in with a memoir and lucrative speaking engagements.

Donors are reportedly lukewarm on supporting his library and a slew of strategists told The Telegraph that Mr Biden has become a political liability ahead of crucial midterm elections next year.

In the meantime, he has been adjusting to civilian life by returning to a routine well-known to residents around his home in Greenville, an upmarket neighbourhood outside Wilmington, where he built a family home in the 1990s on four acres of land.

He has become a regular sight at the railway station, travelling back and forth to Washington, DC. He has posed for selfies at a nearby cafe, shopped at a drugstore, collected takeout from his favourite diner and browsed the rails at a menswear store where he is famous for rarely making purchases.

He visited a JoS A Banks store about three weeks ago, according to Johnnie Morrison, the store's manager. Mr Morrison said staff had gotten used to seeing Secret Service agents turn up minutes before the former president.

Mr Biden browsed the shirts, suits, socks and underpants before leaving empty-handed.

Mr Morrison said: “It's what he always does. It's like a habit.

“It's like he does it to get out of the house and get a bit of peace and quiet.”

He did the same while he was president. His press pool, waiting outside on a bus, often reported that he had visited the store and left without having bought anything.

Mr Morrison added that the man who visited the store bore little resemblance to the “old man” he saw on television.

He said: “I'm not seeing that doddery old man. I'm seeing a very sharp individual.”

Residents have closed ranks around one of their own. But Mr Biden's mental acuity and fitness for office have been under intense scrutiny.

Original Sin, by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, was published last week and it claims to lay out exactly who knew what about Mr Biden's growing frailty, as well as the truth about the former president's delayed decision to drop out of the election last year.

It revealed that Mr Biden did not recognise George Clooney, someone he had known for decades, at a fundraiser that the actor was throwing in the then president's honour.

And staff even discussed the possibility that Mr Biden might have to use a wheelchair during a second term.

The book said: “Given Biden's age, [his physician Dr Kevin] O'Connor also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery.”

The former president is now seen as a liability in his own party.

A slew of strategists and donors told The Telegraph that he should stay out of the limelight as Democrats prepare for midterm elections next year.

One strategist said: “The best thing he can do is stay home and let a new generation move forward.”

This has put a dent in Mr Biden's plans to raise money for a library, which some now fear may not open in his lifetime.

For now, it means that he is spending more time in Greenville, where he remains a beloved figure, even among those who wish he had admitted his shortcomings earlier and never run for re-election.

“He's a local hero,” said Peggy Barker, a retired marketing executive, who described running into Mr Biden at restaurants for decades.

But she said she felt sadness for a man whose health was clearly in decline.

She stopped to talk outside a Walgreens drugstore, which is about a seven-minute drive from Mr Biden's home and where he is often seen.

A cashier said: “He was in a couple of weeks ago.”

Another member of staff said he was a regular.

She said: “He'll buy anything, a pack of paper plates, a drink, just normal stuff like anyone would buy. It's like he does it to feel normal.”

He returned to political life last month, giving a speech in Chicago, during which he accused the Trump administration of taking a “hatchet” to the social security system.

Prior to Original Sin's publication, he conducted a handful of prebuttal interviews

He told ABC's The View: “They are wrong. There's nothing to sustain that.”

Yet, most of his time has been spent with family.

On Thursday, the former president travelled to Connecticut for the graduation of one of his grandchildren.

His staff laid out some details of his post-presidential life, describing how he has been taking the train back and forth to Washington for meetings.

Evidence of his travel can be found easily enough at Wilmington's Joseph R Biden Jr railway station.

A member of train cleaning staff waiting to board the next Amtrak service south said: “Look, look, I have a selfie.”

He scrolled through the images on his phone to show Mr Biden – nicknamed “Amtrak Joe” because he would ride the train back and forth to Delaware every day when he was a senator – all smiles in a navy suit.

In a video, dated March 31, he walks down the platform surrounded by Secret Service agents, carrying his own briefcase.

“To me he looked great,” said the Amtrak worker, who declined to give his name for fear of getting into trouble.

However, he spent most of the past weekend, which included Memorial Day, at home.

None of his regular Greenville haunts reported a sighting.

He was last seen in Brewhaha, a coffee shop, two weeks ago.

And staff at the Charcoal Pit, where he has dined for decades, said he had picked up a takeaway on the Wednesday before last – his usual is a cheesesteak sandwich and its famous black and white triple malted shake.

Chris, a 17-year-old student, sitting with a friend in one of the diner's booths beneath a photograph of Mr Biden with the restaurant's manager said: “I just don't understand how he could have had cancer for so long.”

And then he voiced the question that is on everybody's mind: Were the Bidens keeping his illness a secret?

“That may be why he dropped out,” he said, before returning his attention to the sort of giant sandwiches for which the place is famous.

While the Heritage Foundation document focuses on the Palestine solidarity movement, its ultimate target is far broader.

While the Heritage Foundation document focuses on the Palestine solidarity movement, its ultimate target is far broader.

Project Esther isn't just about Palestine. Crafted by the Heritage Foundation — the same far right organization behind Project 2025 — the playbook purports to provide a “national strategy to combat antisemitism.” First published and reported on last year, the document has seen new life in recent days following a New York Times investigation into Trump administration policies that mirror the plan. But Project Esther's authors make clear that their war on the Gaza solidarity movement is just a Trojan horse for a far more ambitious project: destroying the American left.

Mainstream coverage of Project Esther has largely framed the document as an effort to crush the pro-Palestinian movement. It's important to emphasize, however, that the threat Project Esther poses to the left more broadly is not a byproduct — it's part of the plan's core design. The text lays bare the McCarthyist nature of this political moment and underscores the urgent need for the left to mount a multipronged, coalitional defense.

At the center of Project Esther's crosshairs are the people and organizations it dubs the “Hamas Support Network,” or HSN, though there's no evidence that the entities it's targeting actually support Hamas, or that they are even organized in any sort of a network. The playbook proposes a slew of recommendations for dismantling this fictional network, including deporting international students, purging pro-Palestine faculty from educational institutions, defunding organizations, increasing criminalization and promoting social ostracization of people that speak out in support of Palestinian rights. “Within the United States, the HSN receives the indispensable support of a vast network of activists and funders with a much more ambitious, insidious goal — the destruction of capitalism and democracy,” Project Esther claims.

This is, of course, pure projection. There is no “vast network” of funders behind the grassroots uprising for Palestine — unlike Project 2025, which was crafted by 100 conservative organizations and, as DeSmog reported, bankrolled by six billionaire families. By attempting to frame the Gaza solidarity movement as a well-funded and cohesive network, Project Esther clearly aims to implicate any and all organizations on the left — a target that includes, but is not limited to, people and organizations that have spoken out in defense of Palestine.

That goal is demonstrated in Project Esther's repeated claim that the so-called HSN is seeking to destroy capitalism, which carries clear echoes of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch hunts of the 1950s. The project goes so far as to ludicrously equate Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto, Soviet agitprop and Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. (The Soviets, you might recall, fought against the Nazis in World War II.)

The proposals offered up by Project Esther can also be traced back to these witch hunts. One of Project Esther's suggested tools for quashing pro-Palestine activism is the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law enacted in 1938 to combat Nazi propaganda, which requires that agents of foreign countries register with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and periodically disclose their political activities, and creates criminal and civil penalties for noncompliance. Although FARA was intended to provide transparency around foreign lobbying, it was coopted for McCarthyist suppression in the ‘50s to paint left activists as agents of communist regimes. In one egregious abuse of power, the DOJ used FARA to prosecute renowned civil rights leader and historian W.E.B. Du Bois for his perceived communist sympathies. That case was dismissed, but Project Esther is now urging federal leadership to pull from the same playbook, painting leftist activists and groups as “Hamas supporters” to tee up its own weaponization of FARA.

And Republicans have already expanded their use of the “foreign agent” rhetoric beyond Hamas: Last month, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) accused The People's Forum, a New York-based community center, and CODEPINK, an antiwar group, of ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and urged the DOJ to investigate the groups for FARA violations. The Trump administration levied similar allegations against Harvard University in a May 22 post on X, claiming that the school has coordinated with the CCP and fostered antisemitism on campus. Citing a “pro-Hamas” campus environment, an accompanying letter from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the administration is barring Harvard from enrolling international students.

Many on the left have highlighted how the government's crackdown on pro-Palestine groups is itself in service of the Israeli state and its foreign lobbyists in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. But pointing out Project Esther's hypocrisy does little to undermine its mission, which hinges on equating anti-Zionism with anti-Americanism. This sleight of hand is how Project Esther widens its scope of attack. Pointing out that Zionist lobbyists are the “real” foreign agents ultimately obfuscates the deeper root of the problem — the deployment of money and imperial power, regardless of where they originate, in support of policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing — while also capitulating to Project Esther's framing of Palestinian liberation as having anything to do with being pro- or anti-American.

Even more concerning than FARA, however, is Project Esther's recommendation that the government use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to prosecute activists. By weaponizing RICO against the pro-Palestine movement, the Trump administration could ensnare people and groups across the left in a massive policing dragnet, attempting to paint everyone from anti-capitalists to Black Lives Matter activists as Hamas supporters. We have already seen RICO weaponized in Georgia against the Defend the Atlanta Forest movement, where Attorney General Chris Carr indicted 61 protesters on flimsy racketeering charges. Prosecutors claimed in legal filings that the fight to stop a massive police training center began during the nationwide protests against George Floyd's murder by police in 2020. Project Esther's authors also invoke George Floyd's name, making clear they perceive all mass mobilizations against injustice as threats: The document claims that the pro-Palestine movement is using Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel as a “George Floyd-style event to spring onto center stage and grab a giant microphone.”

Crucially, while Project Esther claims to be about combating antisemitism, no major Jewish organizations participated in its drafting, and the blueprint targets progressive Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. Only one of the four people on the project's leadership task force is Jewish, while two are evangelical Christian Zionists, and the document, notably, does not make any mention of right-wing antisemitism. Ironically, Project Esther claims that the pro-Palestine movement is “a threat to the foundations of the United States and the fabric of our society.” But the glaring lack of Jewish voices that went into crafting the document, coupled with the draconian, far-reaching tactics it proposes, should dispel any lingering doubt about the project's true aims: an assault on democracy and the overall suppression of the left.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Reporters are prohibited from entering Pentagon locations unless they're accompanied by Trump administration personnel.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has pledged to do his part in making the Trump administration the most transparent in history, issued a memo Friday imposing tight restrictions on reporters' movements at the Pentagon in an apparent bid to crack down on leaks.

Under the new policy, which takes effect immediately, journalists are prohibited from entering many locations across the Pentagon building unless they're accompanied by Trump administration personnel — restrictions that Hegseth claims are necessary to protect national security.

“If press require access to other areas/offices within the Pentagon for ‘in-person' interviews (or other engagements), they are required to be formally escorted to and from those respective offices by authorized DoD personnel from those specific offices/Agencies/Military Departments,” Hegseth's two-page memo states.

Reporters covering the Pentagon will also be “required to complete an updated in-briefing form explaining their responsibilities to protect” classified and “sensitive” information.

“Failure by any member of the resident or visiting press to comply with these control measures will result in further restrictions and possibly revocation of press credentials,” reads the memo.

The restrictions come in the wake of several scandals that have personally implicated Hegseth, including the revelation that he used a private group chat that included members of his family and his personal attorney to discuss plans for a U.S. attack on Yemen. They also come amid a broader Trump administration assault on press freedom.

The Pentagon Press Association (PPA), which represents journalists covering the U.S. military, said in a statement that Hegseth's memo “appears to be a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America's right to know what the military is doing.”

Kevin Baron, a founding officer of the PPA, said he is “angry and frustrated — but not surprised — that MAGA propaganda-loving conspiracy theorists like SecDef Hegseth and his team have dropped this JDAM-sized attack on the press.”

“It's un-American,” Baron added. “It's dangerous.”

National Press Club president Mike Balsamo echoed the PPA's criticism of the new policy, which he said represents a “stark departure from longstanding norms that balanced operational security with meaningful press access.”

“By blocking access to common areas, restricting movement without escorts, and complicating basic reporting functions,” said Balsamo, “the Pentagon is making it harder for journalists to do their jobs and easier for power to go unchecked.”

Hegseth announced the press policy changes as the U.S. military is poised to receive a $1 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year despite mountains of evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars to line the pockets of military contractors. Late last year, the Pentagon failed its seventh consecutive audit.

The American military is involved in conflicts around the world, and the Trump administration — with Hegseth's vocal support — has eased restrictions on U.S. airstrikes and raids outside of “conventional war zones.”

The Freedom of the Press Foundation notified company executives that a settlement  “could amount to a bribe.”

If Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, settles a $20 billion lawsuit brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, it could face another lawsuit from a leading press freedom organization.

The Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF), a Paramount shareholder, notified company executives in a letter on Friday that a settlement with Trump “could amount to a bribe” to the president and his administration “for their approving and not impeding” a merger of Paramount and the entertainment company Skydance.

FPF addressed its letter to Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder. In recent weeks, Redstone — who stands to profit from federal approval of the merger — has come under fire for advocating a settlement with Trump and keeping tabs on CBS coverage of the president, who claims the outlet deceptively edited an interview it conducted with Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election.

Paramount's leadership has reportedly discussed settling the Trump lawsuit for up to $20 million. Redstone has privately pushed for a settlement in hopes that it will “clear the way for the merger's approval,” The Wall Street Journal reported last month.

“I am writing to demand that you institute an immediate litigation hold, as FPF plans to file a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of Paramount in the event of a settlement by Paramount,” wrote Seth Stern, FPF's director of advocacy. “We expect that other long-term shareholders will join the suit.”

FPF notes that a derivative lawsuit “is a procedure that allows shareholders of a company to recover damages incurred due to impropriety by executives and directors.”

“Any damages award would go to Paramount, not FPF,” the group added.

“I'm proud that @freedom.press is doing what CBS's corporate owners won't — standing up for press freedom and against authoritarian shakedowns. People who aren't willing to defend the First Amendment should not be in the news business,” says @johncusack.bsky.social freedom.press/issues/we-pl…

The lawsuit warning comes after a trio of U.S. senators cautioned that Paramount “may be engaging in potentially illegal conduct” by pursuing a settlement with Trump in exchange for approval of the Skydance merger.

“Paramount appears to be attempting to appease the administration in order to secure merger approval,” wrote Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in a May 19 letter to Redstone.

Internally, Paramount executives have acknowledged that settling the Trump suit “could expose directors and officers to liability in potential future shareholder litigation or criminal charges for bribing a public official,” the Journal reported in February.

In a statement on Friday, Stern said that “corporations that own news outlets should not be in the business of settling baseless lawsuits that clearly violate the First Amendment and put other media outlets at risk.”

“A settlement of Trump's meritless lawsuit may well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system,” said Stern. “Not only would it tank CBS's reputation but, as three U.S. senators recently explained, it could put Paramount executives at risk of breaking the law.”

“Our mission as a press freedom organization is to defend the rights of journalists and the public, not the financial interests of corporate higher-ups who turn their backs on them. When you run a news organization, you have the responsibility to protect First Amendment rights, not abandon them to line your own pockets,” Stern added. “We hope Paramount will reconsider the dangerous path it appears to be contemplating but, if not, we are prepared to pursue our rights as shareholders. And we hope other Paramount shareholders will join us.”

NEW YORK—An explosion on a boat carrying raw sewage that was docked on the Hudson River in New York City killed a longtime city employee Saturday, authorities said.

Another worker on the city-owned Hunts Point vessel was injured and taken to the hospital after the blast around 10:30 a.m. near the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, according to city Fire Department Deputy Assistant Chief David Simms. A third worker refused medical treatment.

The cause of the explosion was under investigation, but New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in statement that criminal intent was not suspected. The men on the boat, which takes raw sewage from the city to be treated, were doing work involving a flame or sparks when the explosion occurred, the U.S. Coast Guard said on social media.

First responders found a 59-year-old man unconscious in the river, New York police said, and he was declared dead at the scene.

The man had been a longtime employee of the city's Department of Environmental Protection. His name has not been released, but the mayor said he was “a devoted public servant who gave 33 years of service to the New York City, and our hearts go out to his family, friends, and colleagues during this painful time.”

The blast spread raw sewage over the deck of the boat, and firefighters and other first responders had to be decontaminated, Simms said. DEP said there did not appear to be any environmental impacts following the explosion.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

They were Dr. Najjar's own children, killed in an Israeli airstrike on her family's home, Gaza Civil Defense said. The bodies of two others – a 7-month-old and a two-year-old – were trapped under the rubble.
    


            Only one of her ten children, 11-year-old Adam, survived. Dr. Najjar's husband Hamdi, himself a doctor, was also badly injured in the strike.
    


            Civil defense and the health ministry say that the family's home, in a neighborhood of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, was targeted by an Israeli airstrike.
    


            In response to a CNN request for comment, the Israeli military said aircraft had “struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis.” It said it was reviewing the claim civilians had been killed.
    


            Israel's military chief Eyal Zamir went to Khan Younis on Sunday, according to a statement from the IDF.
    


            “Hamas is under immense pressure—it has lost most of its assets and its command and control. We will deploy every tool at our disposal to bring the hostages home, dismantle Hamas, and dismantle its rule,” Zamir told troops, adding that the the military needs to now take down Hamas' Khan Younis brigade.
    


            Gaza Civil Defense published graphic video from the scene of the strike. It showed medics lifting an injured man onto a stretcher as other first responders try to extinguish a fire engulfing the house. They recover the charred remains of several children from the debris and wrap them in white sheets.
    


            Dr. Sahar al-Najjar, a niece, told CNN that Hamdi, 38, had dropped his wife at the hospital and gone to get food for his children. When he returned, he witnessed a missile strike on their home that failed to detonate. He rushed inside to rescue his children but was hit by a second Israeli strike.
    


            “My father went to rescue Uncle Hamdi but found Adam on the street and took him to the hospital. Uncle Hamdi was taken by civil defense, and the rest of the children were all charred,” she said.
    


            Sahar said Dr. Alaa broke down when she showed the last bottle of breast milk she had expressed for her infant daughter, Sidra, whose body remains under the rubble.
    


            “She told me today that her chest aches so much as she was breastfeeding,” Sahar said on Sunday. “Every day at work, Dr. Alaa pumped milk to provide for Sidra, and today she showed me the last bottle she prepared for her.”
    


            “Dr. Alaa can barely speak. If you could see her face, you would understand her pain. She is only praying for her son and husband to recover.”
    


            When Adam, the sole surviving child, came out of the operating room, he called out for his sister Eve, saying, “There's blood on the tree.” One of Adam's arms is severely injured, and he will need another surgery in a few days. His father, Hamdi, remains in critical condition.
    


            In a condolence message to Dr. Najjar, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the Israeli-occupied West Bank said she will always be remembered as “the steadfast Palestinian woman and the noble doctor who heals the wounds of others while bearing her own pain in silence.”
    


            “This horrific crime is not an isolated incident, but part of a systematic targeting of medical personnel and institutions, aimed at breaking the will of those standing steadfast in Gaza,” it said.
    


            Munir al-Boursh, Director-General of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said that Dr. Najjar's husband had just returned home when the home was struck.
    


            “Nine of their children were killed: Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman, and Sidra,” Boursh posted on X.
    


            “This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. Words fall short in describing the pain. In Gaza, it is not only healthcare workers who are targeted—Israel's aggression goes further, wiping out entire families,” Boursh said.

            Ahmad al-Farra, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex, told CNN that Dr. Najjar continued to work despite losing her children, while periodically checking on the condition of her husband and Adam.
    


            Youssef Abu al-Reesh, a senior official at the Health Ministry, said Dr. Najjar had left her children at home to “fulfill her duty and her calling toward all those sick children who have no place but Nasser Hospital.”
    


            Reesh said that when he arrived at the hospital, he had seen her “standing tall, calm, patient, composed, with eyes full of acceptance. You could hear nothing from her but quiet murmurs of (glorification of God) and (seeking forgiveness).”
    


            Dr. Najjar, 38, is a pediatrician, but like most doctors in Gaza, she has been working in the emergency room during Israel's onslaught on the territory.
    


            As southern Gaza comes under renewed attack, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Sunday that two of its team members were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis on Saturday. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike.
    


            “Their killing points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza,” the ICRC said in a statement posted to X.

Follow:


            Francisco Ayala and his wife have canceled the cruise they planned to take to see the Northern Lights this year. The reasons are complicated.
    


            Ayala is a natural-born US citizen, and his wife is a naturalized citizen. But given reports of people — even with legal status — being detained and questioned at US borders, Ayala said taking a trip out of the country for fun doesn't seem worth the potential risk.
    


            Ayala also sees another problem: the economy. “The writing is on the wall … The moment I saw the market volatility, I'm like, ‘Yep, this is not going to be good.'”
    


            Travel advisers are seeing the impact of that uncertainty. More than 80% of the 460 advisers surveyed recently by TravelAge West were “very” or “somewhat” concerned about the impact of a possible economic downturn on their business, and more than half were “very” concerned about the impact of government policies.
    


            Their clients' top concern was economic uncertainty, followed by worries about the treatment of Americans abroad, safety and security, fears of cost increases due to tariffs, immigration and border policies, and travel restrictions.
    


            “You can't just take one angle and say, ‘Oh, the economy is having an issue. So let's find something less expensive,'” said Beci Mahnken, CEO of MEI-Travel. Other clients say, “‘I don't want to travel to the United States,' or ‘I don't want to travel outside the United States.' … It's like a rock tunnel, going and going.”
    


            One shaft of light at the end of that tunnel could be savings on last-minute summer trips as travelers increasingly take a wait-and-see stance with their plans.
    


            Mahnken first saw signs of trouble in early April, when US stocks plunged over fears of a chaotic trade war.
    


            Mahnken and her travel agency staff started getting phone calls from clients, calling to cancel vacations they had booked or seeking refundable trips. She said they were fearful because their 401(k)s and other investments had taken a dive. That uncertainty, she says, made them pause on discretionary spending like a summer trip.
    


            Until that moment, Mahnken said, the frenzy of heightened “revenge travel” activity that started after pandemic restrictions lifted had not slowed over the course of four years.
    


            “We were still on this incredible high,” Mahnken said. “And then … it almost hit a brick wall.”
    


            Flight analytics firm Cirium pulled flight booking data from online travel agencies from the end of January through early May, when people typically book summer trips. That data, which Cirium shared with CNN, indicates that bookings for travel in June, July and August are down nearly 10% when looking at flights from major US airports to favorite European destinations, compared to the same period last year.
    


            Flights booked in the opposite direction from Europe to the US are down 12% in the same period. That substantial drop is unusual, according to Jeremy Bowen, CEO of Cirium.
    


            “We don't often see it as wholesale as this and over such a short period of time. Really, that Q1 booking is really quite substantially lower since the beginning of the year,” said Bowen.

            Data on US travelers booking summer trips to Asia is a bit more mixed, with increased bookings to destinations like Hong Kong and Tokyo, but decreases in flights booked to other major cities in the region.
    


            Domestic travel in the US also seems to be down by about 5%, using the same search parameters.
    


            “Potentially people are waiting to see,” Bowen said.
    


            The drop hasn't been steady. Mahnken said once the stock market stabilized, her clients started feeling a little bit more comfortable with spending more. But it's what Mahnken calls a “bouncing ball” that could change again tomorrow.
    


            Mahnken, who has been in the travel industry since before 9/11, remembers how travelers behaved after terrorist attacks, during the 2008 recession and post-Covid. But the challenge this time, she says, is a combination of those experiences, including economic unpredictability and geopolitical forces.
    


            Deloitte's 2025 summer travel survey shows Americans still plan to travel this season. In fact, Deloitte data released on May 20 shows a 5% increase in Americans planning to take leisure trips this summer, but they may be taking cheaper trips than ones planned just months ago.
    


            That could mean more road trips, rather than dealing with flights that would have to be canceled in case the whole trip is scrapped, Mahnken said.
    


            That's especially true for anyone concerned about their job stability, or people worried they might have to scale back on discretionary spending if markets take another tumble.
    


            “We have people (who) are tending to now book closer in, rather than booking farther out, because … they feel more comfortable with their situation over the next four to six months, as opposed to the next eight to 12, which is a normal booking window for big vacations,” she said.
    


            For Ayala, this environment means being strategic about which trips are worth taking.
    


            “I actually don't believe that we're going to have a full-blown recession,” Ayala said. “But we are definitely going to have a slowing down of the economy, at least … If you can save yourself a hassle and save yourself the money, this would be the year to do it.”
    


            He and his wife canceled their cruise to Alaska, departing from a Canadian port, after seeing several European nations issue warnings to their citizens about potential problems entering the United States.
    


            But they still plan to attend two weddings in Mexico this year because they are important family events.
    


            Still, Ayala said he fears being profiled coming back from those trips just because of his name, even if there is no malice on the side of the border agent. He said he feels that on paper, agents could see a Hispanic name and become overzealous in questioning him.
    


            “I do dread the return. I do think that there is a non-zero chance that I will have to call my employer and say, ‘Hey, guess what? I'm not coming into work because I couldn't get back,'” he said. “But it is an important life event. This one is worth the risk, whereas just traveling for pleasure is not.”
    


            The difference in the way people are booking summer travel, and where they're going, could create opportunities for people looking for a last-minute deal.
    


            Tiffany Funk, co-founder of point.me, a travel points optimization site, said people with loyalty points should use them, because they're worth more now than they will be in the future. Funk said people can be surprised at how much farther points will take them internationally than on domestic trips.
    


            But she said there are some interesting trends domestically, partly because some Canadians have canceled their trips.
    


            “There's actually some deals to be had in places like New England and the coast of Maine, where typically you would have had to book in some cases years ago, in order to secure availability there. But we're seeing some good deals there,” Funk said.
    


            “Florida, you have the Gulf Coast, where you can get some pretty decent pricing on very popular family-friendly destinations that are usually just horrifically expensive for summer vacations,” she said.
    


            Mahnken said as cruise lines continue to launch megaships that were in production long before the current economic turbulence, they will need to fill rooms. She also points out the unusual number of theme park discounts out this season.
    


            “I am seeing a lot of cruise lines do incredibly good sales for their closer-in [dates],” she said. “Theme parks … we're seeing them put out a lot of marketing and a lot of monetary offers during what's usually a high-season time.”

            The American penny isn't going anywhere anytime soon.
    


            The US Treasury Department announced Thursday that it plans to start winding down production of the one-cent coin it has been minting for more than 230 years. But the penny will still remain legal tender, and will still be in use at thousands of retailers around the country for sometime to come.
    


            “If we look at the experience in Canada, for the first year after they stopped making pennies, there's really no change in transactions,” Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores, told CNN. Convenience stores do more cash transactions than any other group, about 32 million a day, or about 20% of the total number of purchases by their customers, Lenard said.
    


            The National Retail Federation, which represents most major US store chains as well as thousands of small retailers, also said it anticipates its members will use pennies even after production stops at some point early next year, although it does anticipate that many will round cash transactions to the nearest nickel once the supply of pennies at banks starts to run short.
    


            “Retailers' primary goal is serving customers and making this transition as seamless as possible,” said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations for NRF.

The Treasury unveils its plan to kill the penny



            There are an estimated 114 billion pennies currently in circulation, but they are “severely underutilized” according to the Treasury department. Many are at home in coin jars or junk drawers, or some other forgotten location gathering dust.
    


            The math says that all those pennies could fill a cube roughly 13 stories high. Many people don't even take them as change, tossing them into the leave-a-penny-take-a-penny dishes at store checkouts.
    


            Lenard said the large number of pennies in circulation means that retailers won't necessary run out of them for a while. But eventually stores won't be able to get new rolls of pennies from their banks and will start rounding transactions up or down to the nearest nickel. The decision when to do that will rest with each retailer, not official government policy.
    


            Electronic transactions such as credit and debit card purchases, will continue to be down to the penny, Lenard said, with only cash transactions being rounded.
    


            Even in countries like Canada, where penny production has been discontinued, the penny remains legal tender today. Canada's finance ministry said pennies retain their value for transactions “indefinitely” despite the fact that it stopped making the coin in 2012. If a customer wants to use pennies to complete a transaction, most retailers are likely to allow them, Lenard said.
    


            “There's a saying in retail, ‘Never lose a customer over a penny,'” he said. “I never really thought of it in these terms, but it applies even more here. I think if someone wants to pay with pennies, most retailers will err on the side of making those customers happy.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","This is how loved ones want us to remember George Floyd","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/25/us/loved-ones-george-floyd-legacy","Sun, 25 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


EDITOR'S NOTE:  A version of this story was originally published in 2020 in the wake of George Floyd's death. It has been republished as Minneapolis is set to mark his passing, five years later.



George Floyd moved to Minnesota for a fresh start — an opportunity to better himself and to be a better father.
    


            And while so many now know the Houston native by his full name, those who knew him best called him Floyd.
    


            He worked security at a restaurant where he developed a reputation as someone who had your back and was there for you when you were down.
    


            “Knowing my brother is to love my brother,” Philonise Floyd, George's brother, told CNN in 2020.
    


            “He's a gentle giant, he don't hurt anybody.”
    


            Floyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, in the city he moved to for a better life. While being detained, Floyd was held down by a Minneapolis police officer's knee. A video of the encounter, shows Floyd pleading that he is in pain and can't breathe. Then, his eyes shut and the pleas stop. He was pronounced dead shortly after.
    


            The video of Floyd's last moments painted a stark picture of the ways Black people have long said the American criminal justice system dehumanizes them. Floyd's death ignited widespread protests around the world, lasting for weeks in 2020.
    


            The following statements were made in the wake of Floyd's death and in the years since. CNN is reflecting on them five years later as Minneapolis is set to mark the anniversary with vigils and gatherings.
    


            Floyd grew up in Houston's Third Ward neighborhood and graduated from Jack Yates High School where he played football and basketball, according to CNN affiliate KPRC.
    


            After high school, head basketball coach George Walker recruited Floyd to play for him at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida. Floyd was a student there from 1993 to 1995, Walker told CNN.
    


            “He didn't give me too much trouble as a basketball coach,” Walker said. “He was a pretty good athlete, averaged 12 to 14 points a game.”
    


George Floyd's family members remember the man and what he stood for



            Floyd was a coachable kid with a big heart, according to Walker's wife, Gloria.
    


            Of all the college athletes on the school's team, she said Floyd had her attention the most “because he was just a fun person to be around.”
    


            “He was never one that tried to blame others for his own mistakes,” she said. “He always owned up to them and always tried to do better.”
    


Philonise Floyd remembers the banana mayonnaise sandwiches and syrup sandwiches his brother would make the siblings.
    


            “He was so much of a leader to us in the household, he would always make sure we had our clothes for school, make sure we would get to school on time,” Philonise Floyd said in the 2021 trial of one of the former police officers involved in his brother's death. “He just was like a person that everybody loved around the community. He just knew how to make people feel better.”
    


            Floyd moved to Minnesota for work and to drive trucks, according to friend and former NBA player, Stephen Jackson.
    


            Jackson, a Houston native also, calls Floyd his twin.
    


            “I've heard George in the last couple days more than I've heard my whole life, and we had a 21-plus (year) relationship,” Jackson told CNN. “His name was always Floyd, my twin.”
    


            Floyd was known in the community as a protector and a provider who didn't have a hateful bone in his body, according to Jackson. He got along with everybody and seldom wanted anything in return for helping someone out, Jackson said.
    


            “The difference between me and bro was I had more opportunity than he did,” wrote Jackson, who won a championship with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003. “2 things we have in common both from the bottom and both of our names will live forever.”
    


            Once Floyd moved to Minnesota, Jackson said Floyd talked at great length about his journey to create better opportunities for himself.
    


            “The last time I talked to him was about a year ago and every conversation we had in that year was about bettering ourselves and being better fathers,” Jackson said. “That's all he talked about.”
    


            Floyd was the father to two daughters, according to Jackson.
    


            “I want justice for his kids,” he said. “I want his kids to be taken care of. Their father is not here.”
    


            Jackson vowed to support his friend's children and “fill in for Floyd” and said he wanted to make sure they are provided for.
    


            In Houston, Rose Hudson, who dated Floyd more than 20 years ago, told CNN affiliate KTRK that Floyd was a grandfather, but he never got to meet his granddaughter.
    


            “I will just let her know what a great guy he was,” Hudson said. “He was a good father to his girls. I just have memories, that's all I can give her, memories of her grandfather.”
    


            Floyd worked security at Conga Latin Bistro, a restaurant serving Spanish and Latin food in Minneapolis, for five years, according to its owner, Jovanni Thunstrom.
    


            Even though he was Thunstrom's employee, the pair were also friends.
    


            “He was loved by all my employees and my customers,” Thunstrom told CNN.
    


            “I was looking at the video and I said that can't be Floyd, but later it just blew out. It was Floyd. And that's when it hit me, it hit me hard,” Thunstrom told CNN affiliate WCCO.
    


            Floyd would help clean up after the bar had closed and was a “very nice guy and really good with customers,” according to Thunstrom.
    


            “He stood up for people, he was there for people when they were down, he loved people that were thrown away,” Courteney Ross, Floyd's girlfriend, told WCCO. “We prayed over every meal, we prayed if we were having a hard time, we prayed if we were having a good time.”
    


            Anger over Floyd's death went beyond his family and friends. A number of celebrities reacted to the incident on social media.
    


            NBA player LeBron James shared a side-by-side photo on Instagram. On one side you can see a screen grab from the encounter between Floyd and police. In the photo on the left a Minnesota police officer's knee can be seen on Floyd's neck. In the photo on the right is the image of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling in protest during the national anthem for a preseason football game in 2016.
    


Police tactics at campus protests reveal disparities in approaches to public order and lessons learned post-George Floyd



            At the time, Kaepernick had said he would not honor a song nor “show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”
    


            James' post is accompanied by the caption, “Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you?? #StayWoke”
    


            Others sports figures like Formula One star Lewis Hamilton, NBA legend Michael Jordan and Kaepernick voiced their outrage over Floyd's killing and paid respects to his memory.
    


            Three days after Floyd's death, rapper and songwriter Ice Cube even canceled an on-air appearance with Good Morning America saying, “After the events in Minnesota with George Floyd I'm in no mood to tell America, good morning.”
    


            From London to Sydney and Los Angeles to Philadelphia, tens of thousands of people marched in cities and small towns. They poured into busy streets, occupying popular landmarks, chanting, waving handmade signs and rekindling the Black Lives Matter movement.
    


            Some of the protests were peaceful, while others were destructive.
    


            In Minnesota, more than 500 members of the state's national guard were sent to St. Paul, Minneapolis, and surrounding communities because of the increase in demonstrations in the area, officials said at the time.
    


            Floyd's family was out front calling for justice, saying the firing of the police officers involved in Floyd's death was not enough. Over the years they've become vocal about police reform legislation, bonding with other families impacted by police brutality and racial injustice.
    


            “They were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn't see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life. Not one of them tried to do anything to help him,” Tera Brown, Floyd's cousin, told CNN in 2020.
    


            The four former police officers involved in Floyd's death were convicted on both state and federal crimes.  Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who killed Floyd, is serving two sentences of more than 20 years in prison for a federal charge of depriving Floyd of his civil rights, and state charges of unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.
    


            Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd, and Tou Thao, who held a crowd of bystanders, were found guilty in federal court of violating Floyd's civil rights and of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin during the restraint. They received sentences between two and a half and nearly four years in prison for those crimes.
    


            The three officers were also given sentences of three to more than four years each for state charges of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
    


            “Real justice in America will be (when) Black men and Black women, and people of color will not have the fear (of) being killed by the police just because (of) the color of their skin,” Floyd family attorney Ben Crump said said in 2021.

            When Floyd's family learned of the verdict in Chauvin's case for the state charges, they described the moment as being “able to breathe again” and “monumental.”



            “I will salute him every day of my life,” Terrence Floyd said in 2021. “He showed me how to be strong. He showed me how to be respectful. He showed me how to speak my mind. I'm going to miss him, but now I know he's in history. What a day to be a Floyd, man.”
    


            And while the verdict brought some closure, Philonise Floyd said at the time the fight against social injustice now goes beyond his brother.
    


            “I'm not just fighting for George anymore,” he said at the time. “I'm fighting for everyone around the world.”

As the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in federal funding to scientific research, thousands of scientists in the U.S. lost their jobs or grants — and governments and universities around the world spotted an opportunity.

The “Canada Leads” program, launched in April, hopes to foster the next generation of innovators by bringing early-career biomedical researchers north of the border.

Aix-Marseille University in France started the “Safe Place for Science” program in March — pledging to “welcome” U.S.-based scientists who “may feel threatened or hindered in their research.”

Australia's “Global Talent Attraction Program,” announced in April, promises competitive salaries and relocation packages.

“In response to what is happening in the U.S.,” said Anna-Maria Arabia, head of the Australian Academy of Sciences, “we see an unparalleled opportunity to attract some of the smartest minds here.”

Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world's leading scientific power — and has led to the invention of cell phones and the internet as well as new ways to treat cancer, heart disease and strokes, noted Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the journal Science.

But today that system is being shaken.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.




The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation's by 55%. 

“The Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration's projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people's priorities and continue our innovative dominance,” said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.

Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold. 

Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. — but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.

“There are threats to science ... south of the border,” said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada's leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the “Canada Leads” recruitment drive. “There's a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.”

Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends “to enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.” She spoke at the launch of the bloc's “Choose Europe for Science” — which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.

Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution's “Safe Place for Science” program.

“Our American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,” he said of applicants. “What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.”

It's too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.

Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous — and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world's leading funder of R&D — including government, university and private investment — for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world's R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to “Safe Place for Science” — 139 out of 300 total — came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.

U.S.-based applicants in this year's recruitment round for France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.

At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program — aimed at young female researchers — drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.

Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.

Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., “we are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.”

Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.

Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he's applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.

“I've never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,” said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

But it's not easy to pick up and move a scientific career — let alone a life.

Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. She said it felt like “America as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.”

Still, she wasn't sure of her next move. “It's no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,” she said.

The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide “Choose Europe” initiative.

But it's unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.

Even as universities and institutes think about recruiting talent from the U.S., there's more apprehension than glee at the funding cuts.

“Science is a global endeavor,” said Patrick Cramer, head of the Max Planck Society, noting that datasets and discoveries are often shared among international collaborators.

One aim of recruitment drives is to “to help prevent the loss of talent to the global scientific community,” he said.

Researchers worldwide will suffer if collaborations are shut down and databases taken offline, scientists say.

“The U.S. was always an example, in both science and education,” said Patrick Schultz, president of France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology. So the cuts and policies were “very frightening also for us because it was an example for the whole world.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas would require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a Republican proposal that cleared a major vote Saturday and would make the state the nation's largest to impose such a mandate. 

If passed as expected, the measure is likely to draw a legal challenge from critics who consider it a constitutional violation of the separation of church and state.

The Republican-controlled House gave its preliminary approval with a final vote expected in the next few days. That would send the bill to the desk of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has indicated he will sign it into law. 

“The focus of this bill is to look at what is historically important to our nation educationally and judicially,” said Republican state representative Candy Noble, a co-sponsor of the bill.

Two other states, Louisiana and Arkansas, have similar laws, but Louisiana's is on hold after a federal judge found that it was “ unconstitutional on its face.”

Those measures are among efforts, mainly in conservative-led states, to insert religion into public schools. The vote in Texas came after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively ended a publicly funded Catholic charter school in Oklahoma on Thursday with a 4-4 tie following a string of high court decisions in recent years that have allowed public funds to flow to religious entities. 

Texas lawmakers also have passed and sent to Abbott a measure that allows school districts to provide students and staff a daily voluntary period of prayer or time to read a religious text during school hours. Abbott is expected to sign it.




“We should be encouraging our students to read and study their Bible every day,” Republican state Rep. Brent Money said. “Our kids in our public schools need prayer, need Bible reading, more now than they ever have.”

Supporters of requiring the Ten Commandments in classrooms say they are part of the foundation of the United States' judicial and educational systems and should be displayed.

But critics, including some Christian and other faith leaders, say the Ten Commandments and prayer measures would infringe on the religious freedom of others.

The Ten Commandments bill requires public schools to post in classrooms a 16-by-20-inch (41-by-51-centimeter) poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, even though translations and interpretations vary across denominations, faiths and languages and may differ in homes and houses of worship. 

Democratic lawmakers made several failed attempts Saturday to amend the bill to require schools display other religious texts or provide multiple translations of the commandments.

A letter signed this year by dozens of Christian and Jewish faith leaders opposing the bill noted that Texas has thousands of students of other faiths who might have no connection to the Ten Commandments. Texas has nearly 6 million students in about 9,100 public schools.

In 2005, Abbott, who was state attorney general at the time, successfully argued before the Supreme Court that Texas could keep a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of its Capitol.

The U.K. is considering mandating the use of chemical castration for sex offenders under an overhaul of the justice system aimed at freeing up more space in its overcrowded prisons, Reuters reported. (Credit: Reuters.)

A British government minister says she's ""not squeamish"" about the idea of chemical castration for male sex offenders, and wants to make it mandatory. 

The UK is considering a range of options from a new report, which aims to cut the country's prison population by 10,000 inmates to help alleviate chronic overcrowding.

""Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offense under certain circumstances,"" the new report states.

Prisons in the south-west of England have been involved in a pilot program of chemical castrations since 2002, and Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood from the ruling Labour Party told lawmakers in parliament on Thursday that the program would expand to 20 more prisons in two other regions of England.

Prisoners would be given two drugs as part of the treatment: one limits sexual thoughts, while the other reduces testosterone and ""problematic sexual arousal."" Inmates would also have ongoing counseling to treat their psychological issues, such as a desire for sexual power and control. One recent study found that reoffending rates were up to 60% lower for prisoners who had received the treatment. 

""For some, offending relates to power, but for another subset of offenders, the combination of chemical suppressants and psychological interventions can, we believe, have a big and positive impact,"" Minister Mahmood told parliament. 

Initially, the option for chemical castration treatment would be only voluntary, and medical ethicists say it could be a problem to force doctors to treat an inmate who doesn't want to have it done. In Britain, there is a strict tradition of informed medical consent where a patient can refuse medical treatment, and a doctor can't ordinarily be forced to carry it out.

(Photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images)

Sex offenders make up a significant percentage of the prison population in England, and at the end of March, more than 20% of inmates were incarcerated on sex crimes charges. The new report cautions that chemical castration ""should never be used as a risk management tool or standalone rehabilitative offer, and it is only appropriate for a limited number of sex offenders"".

Chemical castration is already being used in some other European prisons to treat sex offenders. Authorities in Sweden have been carrying out limited clinical trials on volunteers at a Stockholm prison, while in Germany and Denmark it is more widely used but still on a voluntary basis. In Poland, courts can pass a sentence of mandatory chemical castration for some categories of sex-offense prisoners. 

Thursday's report, written by a former government minister from the Conservative Party, also made four dozen recommendations to try and ease prison overcrowding. 

These include giving fewer people jail sentences under 12 months and encouraging other types of punishment instead, such as community service or fines; developing new policies for early release with good behavior for inmates, and tagging all offenders who committed crimes of abuse against women and girls.

The opposition Conservative Party has criticized the new report, saying that by scrapping shorter prison sentences the government ""is effectively decriminalizing crimes like burglary, theft and assault."" 

""This is a gift to criminals, who will be free to offend with impunity,"" the party's justice spokesman Robert Jenrick told reporters. 

However, the report has been broadly welcomed by the Howard League for Penal Reform, the world's oldest prison charity.

""The government is taking an important step forward by accepting most of the recommendations from this important review,"" says Chief Executive Andrea Coomber, but she cautioned that ""the prisons crisis will not be solved by half-measures."" 

Senior police officers have cautioned that if there will be fewer prisoners behind bars, they need more resources to manage the risk that offenders pose outside of jail.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera has the latest on the legal dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard University over foreign enrollment on ‘Fox Report.'

President Donald Trump on Sunday criticized foreign countries for paying ""nothing"" toward the education of their citizens who are attending college at Harvard and other U.S. institutions.

This comes amid the fight between the Trump administration and Harvard for its plans to revoke the university's ability to enroll foreign students.

""Why isn't Harvard saying that almost 31% of their students are from FOREIGN LANDS, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay NOTHING toward their student's education, nor do they ever intend to,"" Trump wrote early Sunday morning on Truth Social. ""Nobody told us that!""

""We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, but Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming,"" he continued. ""We want those names and countries. Harvard has $52,000,000, use it, and stop asking for the Federal Government to continue GRANTING money to you!""

On Friday, a judge temporarily blocked the administration from canceling Harvard's student visa program after the university filed a lawsuit against the federal government.

Harvard argued that the policy would affect more than 7,000 visa holders — nearly a quarter of the student body — and that the administration's effort is a ""blatant violation of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act,"" according to its court filing.

""It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" Harvard wrote in its complaint.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM TERMINATING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS' LEGAL STATUS 

The Department of Homeland Security moved to terminate Harvard's visa program after the university allegedly failed to provide extensive behavioral records of student visa holders the agency had requested.

The records sought include any footage of protest activity involving student visa holders, even if it's not criminal, and the disciplinary records of all student visa holders in the past five years. 

Requested records also include footage or documentation of illegal, dangerous or violent activity by student visa holders, any records of threats or the deprivation of rights of other students or university personnel.

Harvard called the new policy ""pernicious"" and accused the administration of departing from ""decades of settled practice"" and coming ""without rational explanation."" The university also said the policy was ""carried out abruptly without any of the robust procedures the government has established to prevent just this type of upheaval to thousands of students' lives.""

At least a dozen Harvard students have had their student visas revoked over campus protest activity. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said before Congress on Tuesday that the administration has probably revoked thousands already and would ""proudly"" revoke more.

The administration has already frozen close to $3 billion in federal funding to the university, largely dedicated to research, over claims that Harvard has not adequately responded to alleged campus antisemitism in protests and has not moved to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion practices.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the Trump administration's hopes to change birthright citizenship amid some pushback, on 'America Reports.'

The Supreme Court heard a case this month centered on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end so-called birthright citizenship, in one of the most closely watched and potentially impactful cases heard by the court in recent years.  

Though the case itself was used largely as a means of challenging lower court powers to issue so-called universal or nationwide injunctions, justices on the high court did inquire about the merits of the order itself, ""Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,"" which Trump signed on the first day of his second White House term.

The order, which was slated to take force Feb. 20, directed all U.S. agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to children born to illegal immigrants or children born to mothers living in the country on a temporary visa, if the father is not a permanent resident or U.S. citizen.

Despite the Supreme Court's focus on universal injunctions in hearing the case, deep and unyielding concerns persist about Trump's attempt to undo more than 100 years of legal precedent.

The ACLU included in its lawsuit the story of one couple from Indonesia but living in New Hampshire whom they said would be affected by the order.

""They arrived in 2023, applied for asylum, and their application awaits review,"" ACLU attorneys said of the couple. ""The mom-to-be is in her third trimester. 

""Under this executive order, their baby would be considered an undocumented noncitizen and could be denied basic health care and nutrition, putting the newborn at grave risk at such a vulnerable stage of life,"" they added.

And such problems would persist throughout their lives, lawyers for the group noted. These persons would not be able to obtain necessary identification, such as drivers' licenses, and would not be able to vote, hold some jobs or serve on juries.

Though Trump had spoken in detail in his first term and on the campaign trail about wanting to end birthright citizenship, his executive order sent shockwaves through the nation. It was met by a wave of lawsuits from Democrat-led states and immigrants' rights groups.

One lawsuit, brought by 18 Democratic attorneys general, warned that ending birthright citizenship would strip hundreds of thousands of U.S.-born children of their citizenship as the result of a circumstance completely outside a child's control.

Statistics also bear this out. Roughly 150,000 children are born annually in the U.S. to parents of noncitizens.  If the order were to take force as Trump envisioned, experts warned the impact would be catastrophic.

​​""President Trump's attempt to unilaterally end birthright citizenship is a flagrant violation of our Constitution,"" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who joined 17 other Democrat-led states in suing to block the order, said earlier this year.

More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship prior to the Supreme Court's decision to take up the case, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and ""unprecedented.""

To date, no court has sided with the Trump administration in upholding the executive order.

Fox News Digital spoke with Julia Mossbridge, the founder and board chair of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT), about a mysterious metal sphere that was discovered in Buga, Colombia.

Scientists have made a remarkable discovery of a sphere that some believe to be an unidentified flying object (UFO).

The sphere, according to social media page @Truthpolex, was spotted March 2 flying over the town of Buga, Colombia, before it landed. Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers studying the three-layered sphere, noted that it shows ""no welds or joints,"" characteristics normally indicative of human manufacture, which further bolstered his belief in its extraterrestrial origin.

Julia Mossbridge, the founder and board chair of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT), and a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics, told Fox News Digital she remains skeptical of its extraterrestrial origins.

""It looks to me like a really cool art project,"" she said, urging caution in drawing immediate conclusions.

Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a ""bigger picture"" in which humanity must confront its own limitations.

""We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had,"" she said, noting that prior ""grandiose"" beliefs in total mastery blind us when ""something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world.

""If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies, what's in our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us,"" she said.

She says sightings of unexplained objects have been around for decades.

""Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them,"" she said.

Mossbridge said the coalition of individuals working to find answers, such as the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies, the UAP Disclosure Fund and the Galileo Project, are made of people of ""all political persuasions.""

""They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things,"" she said. ""Because, for instance, the sphere in Colombia is in a different country. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?""

Mossbridge urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries.

""Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project,"" she said. 

She said experts can determine if the material is ""clearly non-human-made.""

Despite her misgivings about the discovery in Buga, she said it doesn't ""discount all the other objects that are of extraterrestrial origin.""

A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.

Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they've become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well). 

Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it's still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:

""Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?""

I get what you're saying, Frank. You'd think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn't be bypassed. But you'd be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they're not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.

A smartphone on a table   (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)

There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods. 

Hackers exploit the concept of ""masterprints,"" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at NYU Tandon developed ""DeepMasterPrints"" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.  

Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you've touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.

On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn't crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn't necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn't work on them.

19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF

Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone's secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work. 

PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.

Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.

TOP 20 APPS TRACKING YOU EVERY DAY

Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don't need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.

Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.

10 SIMPLE STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR SMARTPHONE'S SECURITY AND PRIVACY

Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.

1. Choose trusted phone brands: If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.

2. Keep your phone updated: Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don't have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.

3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage. Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

4. Don't rely only on your fingerprint: Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn't be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your iPhone and Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.

5. Be careful about who handles your phone: If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don't know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It's rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.

6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps: Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It's safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it's better to skip it and use your password instead.

7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE

Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they're compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don't need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn't work, so both systems often go hand in hand.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called for Senate Republicans to quickly pass President Donald Trump‘s “one big, beautiful bill,” arguing it will unleash an “economic boom of historic proportions.”

Gingrich made the appeal in a Fox News appearance on Friday night, warning Senate Republicans that voting against the bill, which passed the House of Representatives on Thursday, would make it “very difficult” for Trump to achieve his policy goals and would “go against the wishes” of Republican voters who elected them.

“I would simply say to all the senators, when you're done amending and you're done arguing, you have to vote yes, because to vote no is voting for a giant tax increase. It's voting to cripple the government. It's voting to make it very difficult for President Trump to create the kind of America that he was voted to create. And frankly, it goes against the wishes of virtually every Republican who put the senators in office,” the former House speaker said.

Gingrich, while acknowledging that the bill is “not perfect,” still urged Republicans to “keep moving” to get the bill on Trump's desk by July 4.

“It's not perfect. Look, we balanced the budget for four straight years for the only time in the last century, but we didn't do it overnight. We didn't do it the first or second year. You have to chip away at these things, get the best you can, plan to come back again next year or come back this fall on the appropriations bills. But keep moving. The Senate, I think, has to pass this bill early enough to go to conference. … And then they've got to come out of conference and I hope they'll schedule getting it out by the Fourth of July,” he added.

Gingrich also underscored that the United States is “right at the edge of a Trump economic boom of historic proportions,” pointing to the president's recent trip to the Middle East that saw billion-dollar deals struck with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. But the former House speaker added that passing the “big, beautiful bill” is a “major key” to this potential economic prosperity.

The massive spending and tax cut bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday morning, 215-214. It is now headed to the Senate for consideration, with amendments likely.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), for example, has already indicated he wants more spending reductions in the bill, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has expressed concern over a potential debt ceiling hike. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) are also potential holdouts on the bill.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) can only afford to lose three Republican votes to still be able to pass the bill along the party line, which would then require a tiebreaking vote from Vice President JD Vance.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Debate That American Conservationists Should Be Having","https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/05/endangered-species-harm-ecosystems/682883/","Sun, 25 May 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

What if the U.S. protected ecosystems directly?

The Endangered Species Act always had a hole in it. It was intended to protect ecosystems as well as individual species—it says so right in the original 1973 text—but it has no provisions to do so directly. For decades, conservationists successfully plugged that hole by arguing in court that the ESA's prohibition of harm to individual species includes destroying a species' habitat. Now the Trump administration wants to negate that argument by asserting that to harm an endangered species means only to injure or kill it directly: to rip it out by the roots or blow it away with a shotgun.



Habitat destruction has been the most common threat to endangered species in the U.S. since 1975. If the administration succeeds in redefining harm to exclude it, the Endangered Species Act won't be able to effectively protect most endangered species.



That much of the act's power can be destroyed by tweaking its definition of one phrase reveals its central weakness. Preserving old-growth forest for a single owl species (to give a classic example) means the forest—and everything living there—suddenly loses protection if that owl goes extinct anyway (as the northern spotted owl very well could). And the law requires that the government undertake heroic and expensive measures to save the most imperiled species, rather than using habitat protection to shore up populations before they truly crash. “The act has no concept of preventive medicine,” the conservation advocate and author Suzanne Winckler wrote in these pages in 1992. “On the contrary, it attempts to save the hardest cases, the equivalent of the terminally ill and the brain-dead.”



Conservationists haven't really wanted to talk about this, though, on the theory that opening debate about the law would risk losing it all. The ESA passed during a unique moment in the early 1970s, when a Republican president could talk about the nation's “environmental awakening,” and for all its flaws, the act is still considered one of the strongest and most effective biodiversity-protection laws in the world. But the Trump administration has now opened that debate—forcing a conversation about how we protect species and ecosystems that some conservationists say is long overdue.





Many conservationists have a long-standing dream solution to the ESA's circuitous mechanism for protecting places: What if we just protected ecosystems directly? Forty-one percent of terrestrial American ecosystems are at risk of collapse, according to a 2023 report by NatureServe, a nonprofit that collects and analyzes data on biodiversity. Most of them are largely unprotected.



Jay Odenbaugh, an environmental philosopher at Lewis & Clark College, in Portland, Oregon, told me that shifting to protecting ecosystems would obviate the need to “chase down every last little species.” It would be more efficient. “We can't save everything,” Odenbaugh said. “What we are trying to do is protect larger structural features.”



Reed Noss, a conservationist based at the University of Florida and the Southeastern Grasslands Institute, does still want to try to save every species. But he argues that only a few—large carnivores that face persecution and orchids collected for illegal trading, for example—need special, individual protections. Meanwhile, Noss estimates that 85 percent of species could be saved by simply protecting a sufficiently large chunk of each type of American ecosystem. He has therefore been one of the most vocal advocates for what he calls a “native ecosystem–protection act” to supplement the ESA since the 1990s.



The U.S. already has multiple systems that categorize lands and fresh water into ecosystem types. The U.S. National Vegetation Classification, for instance, describes natural systems at a series of scales from very broad types, such as “Forest & Woodland,” to hyper-specific descriptors, such as “Eastern White Pine-Eastern Hemlock Lower New England-Northern Piedmont Forest.” An ecosystem-protection act would direct the government to choose (or develop) one such classification system, then ensure that each type of ecosystem had sufficient area protected.



Making that decision would surely involve ecologists arguing over how to categorize ecosystems. Philosophers might argue about whether ecosystems even exist—if they are more than the sum of the organisms that comprise them. But, for the purposes of policy, more important than arriving at essential truths would be creating categories that make sense to the public and describe the things the public cares about: old-growth forest, tallgrass prairie, the Everglades, Great Basin sagebrush steppe, the deciduous forests of the Northeast, and so on. Something like this was tried with Pacific Northwest old-growth forest in the 1990s; known as the Northwest Forest Plan, it is meant to protect not just the owl but old growth more broadly—but the plan, which is still in use, covers only one ecosystem type.



Part of the appeal of a system that directly protects ecosystems is that it recognizes that they're dynamic. Species have always moved and evolved, shifting the composition and relationships within systems through time. And today, climate change is prompting many species to move. But Odenbaugh and Noss see ecosystems as entities that will remain coherent enough to protect. Florida, for instance, has sandhill ecosystems (sandy hills that support longleaf pine and oaks with wire grass) and wet flatwoods (which are seasonally inundated)—and “a sandhill and a flatwoods are going to remain a sandhill and a flatwoods even if their species composition changes due to climate change,” Noss told me. A robust network of many different kinds of ecosystems—especially one well connected by corridors so species can move—would support and protect most of America's species without the government having to develop a separate plan for each flower and bee.





Many who fight on conservation's front lines still hesitate to advocate for such a law. The Environmental Species Act, as it is, achieves similar purposes, they argue—and it could be pushed in the opposite direction that the Trump administration wants to pull it.



When I spoke with Kierán Suckling, executive director for the Center for Biological Diversity, which is dedicated to forcing the federal government to abide by its own environmental laws, he described his vision of a conservation-minded president who could, like Donald Trump, use executive power quickly and aggressively, only to conserve nature. “The secretary of the interior and the head of Fish and Wildlife, they have, already, the power under the ESA to do basically anything they want, as long as it is supported by the best available science,” he said. So, in theory, they could translocate species to help them survive climate change, or broaden the boundaries of “critical habitat,” which is protected from destruction by actions taken, permitted, or funded by the federal government (unless exceptions are granted).



Daniel Rohlf, a law professor at Lewis & Clark College who has studied the ESA for more than three decades, agrees that decisive leadership could do more to protect ecosystems by skillfully wielding the current ESA: “Critical habitat” could be treated as sacrosanct. Federal actions could be assessed not just for direct harm to species but for the harm they would cause via greenhouse-gas emissions. The “range” of a species could be defined as its historic or possible range, not just the scraps of territory it clings to in the present. “You could do all that tomorrow under the current version of the act,” Rohlf told me. And he believes that, unlike many of the actions Trump is taking, a lot of these stronger interpretations would likely hold up in court.



The political prospects for an entirely new ecosystem-protection act are low, even in a Democratic administration: Although 60 percent of Americans tell pollsters that “stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost,” these days politicians of all stripes seem to want to cut red tape and build stuff. And Suckling believes that his organization and others like it will be able to block or undo Trump's proposed changes to the ESA's definition of harm. “We overturned all his first-term ESA regulation changes and are confident we'll overturn this one as well,” he said. The U.S. may well just keep conserving the way we have been, through the ESA, and often in court.



But an ecosystem-protection act could also be a unifying cause. Love for American landscapes is bipartisan, and protecting ecosystems would not necessarily mean outlawing all human use inside them. Ranching and recreation are compatible with many ecosystems. Tribal management could protect biodiversity and support traditional use. Caring for these ecosystems takes work, and that means jobs—physical, outdoor jobs, many of which can be filled by people without college degrees. Farmers and ranchers can also be compensated for tending to ecosystems in addition to growing food, buffering their income from the vagaries of extreme weather and trade wars.



The United States is an idea, but it is also a place, a beautiful quilt of ecosystems that are not valuable just because they contain “biodiversity” or even because they filter our water, produce fish and game, and store carbon. Our forests, prairies, mountains, coastlines, and swamps are knit into our sense of who we are, both individually and as a people. We love them, and we have the power to protect them, if we choose to.

Culture and entertainment musts from Serena Dai

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what's keeping them entertained. Today's special guest is Serena Dai, a senior editor who has written about the easiest way to keep your friends, the art of the restaurateur, and the endless hunt to make meaning of marriage.

Serena was surprised by how much she enjoyed The Rehearsal, the comedian Nathan Fielder's latest pseudo-reality series. She's also an avid romance-novel reader, a newly minted Jonas Brothers fan, and a longtime admirer of Kathryn Hahn's work.

The Culture Survey: Serena Dai

The television show I'm most enjoying right now: I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I could not bear to watch Nathan for You, a beloved show where the comedian Nathan Fielder suggests outlandish plans to help small businesses. Every person I trusted assured me that Fielder was a genius, and I got the sense that I must lack some sort of sophistication for not enjoying it. The entrepreneurs he was trying to “help” with suggestions such as poop-flavored frozen yogurt were real people; I felt too badly for them to find the show entertaining. So I was surprised to discover that I loved his new series, The Rehearsal—and now, a few episodes into the second season, I finally understand the “genius” moniker that my buddies have bequeathed him.

Similar to Nathan for You, the show pairs Fielder's monotonous tone with outrageous conceits, but this time, the premise is staging “rehearsals” to help people prepare for difficult moments. Though he's still cringey (and still allegedly misleading real people), he also poses questions about how comedy can effect real-life change, and reveals some insights about his own role in the entertainment industry's worst impulses. His critiques feel organic instead of forced, something that is not easy. By the second episode of the new season, I found myself not only in awe of the lengths he would go for a bit but also laughing out loud at the results. [Related: Nathan Fielder is his own worst enemy.]

The upcoming entertainment event I'm most looking forward to: The return of Lena Dunham's work to our TV screens, with her upcoming Netflix show, Too Much. I recently rewatched the first season of Girls, and seeing it in my 30s (long after the heated discourse about Millennials and nepo babies that surrounded the show's debut), I had a deeper appreciation for Dunham's talent for writing sharply drawn characters—ones who, even when they're infuriating, you can't help but love. When she hits, she hits! The new show, which debuts on July 10, stars one of my favorite internet personalities, the comedian Megan Stalter. She has an intensity in her facial expressions that makes me laugh before she even says a word, and I am eager to see how Dunham works with her talents. [Related: Eight perfect episodes of TV]

An actor I would watch in anything: Kathryn Hahn. She's funny and moving in so much that she does, but I really fell for her in I Love Dick, an adaptation of the Chris Kraus novel where she excels at playing a woman who wants and wants and wants.

My favorite way of wasting time on my phone: This year, I finally did something that I've been thinking about for years: I started pulling up the Kindle app to read a book when I had the instinct to refresh my Instagram feed. I read an essay a long time ago recommending it as a way both to read more books and to make phone time feel less terrible, but I hadn't done it. For years, I still felt that any extended time I spent on my phone meant something bad about me, and frankly, I was also just easily distracted. But I decided I didn't need to read Proust, only stay off social media; as a result, I have probably tripled my intake of romance novels, which are breezy yet still require an attention span longer than 30 seconds. I recently dipped my toe into historical romance and have been loving the Ravenels series, by Lisa Kleypas, which you may also enjoy if you're a fan of Bridgerton. I do still spend plenty of time on Instagram trying to remind myself to not pay too much attention to parenting or fitness influencers, but I promise it's less. Much, much less.

An author I will read anything by: Jasmine Guillory. I love romance, I love love, and I love her characters.

An online creator whom I'm a fan of: I've been finding small ways to incorporate more Mandarin into my life because I'm trying to speak it more to my toddler, and a friend recommended following her Chinese teacher, Neruda Ling, on Instagram. He blends internet humor with Mandarin lessons, which is exactly what I need after a lifetime of associating the language with textbooks and long Sunday mornings in suburban community-college classrooms. Crucially, he also explains curse words and gay slang, something my immigrant mother would never have done in depth.

To be honest, I'm not sure if I remember any of the phrases he's taught, and even if I did, I doubt that I would have the guts to deploy them in casual conversation. Mostly, these videos remind me that the language doesn't have to feel inherently stiff like it did when I was growing up, and that Mandarin can, in fact, be a source of joy.

A good recommendation I recently received: I can't believe I'm saying this, but have you heard the latest Jonas Brothers single? It's called “Love Me to Heaven,” and my husband stopped everything in our apartment one busy Saturday to make me listen to it. If you, like me, had kind of written them off as Disney Channel heartthrobs or tabloid fodder or reality-show jokesters, you too might be delighted to hear this pop-rock bop. I want to drive a convertible to the beach with the roof down and blast this song the whole way there.

The Week Ahead

Essay

The Pedestrians Who Abetted a Hawk's Deadly Attack

By Katherine J. Wu

In November of 2021, Vladimir Dinets was driving his daughter to school when he first noticed a hawk using a pedestrian crosswalk.

The bird—a young Cooper's hawk, to be exact—wasn't using the crosswalk, in the sense of treading on the painted white stripes to reach the other side of the road in West Orange, New Jersey. But it was using the crosswalk—more specifically, the pedestrian-crossing signal that people activate to keep traffic out of said crosswalk—to ambush prey.

A seemingly wonky debate about the “abundance agenda” is really about power.

A civil war has broken out among the Democratic wonks. The casus belli is a new set of ideas known as the abundance agenda. Its supporters herald it as the key to prosperity for the American people and to enduring power for the liberal coalition. Its critics decry it as a scheme to infiltrate the Democratic Party by “corporate-aligned interests”; “a gambit by center-right think tank & its libertarian donors”; “an anti-government manifesto for the MAGA Right”; and the historical and moral equivalent of the “Rockefellers and Carnegies grinding workers into dust.”

The factional disputes that tear apart the left tend to involve wrenching, dramatic issues where the human stakes are clear: Gaza, policing, immigration. And so it is more than a little odd that progressive activists, columnists, and academics are now ripping one another to shreds over such seemingly arcane and technical matters as zoning rules, permitting, and the Paperwork Reduction Act.

The intensity of the argument suggests that the participants are debating not merely the mechanical details of policy, but the very nature and purpose of the Democratic Party. And in fact, if you look closely beneath the squabbling, that is exactly what they are fighting over.

The abundance agenda is a collection of policy reforms designed to make it easier to build housing and infrastructure and for government bureaucracy to work. Despite its cheerful name and earnest intention to find win-win solutions, the abundance agenda contains a radical critique of the past half century of American government. On top of that—and this is what has set off clanging alarms on the left—it is a direct attack on the constellation of activist organizations, often called “the groups,” that control progressive politics and have significant influence over the Democratic Party.

In recent years, the party's internal divides have been defined almost entirely in relation to the issue positions taken by the groups. The most progressive Democrats have been the ones who advocated the groups' positions most forcefully; moderate Democrats have been defined more by their relative lack of enthusiasm for the groups' agenda than by any causes of their own. The Democratic Party's flavors have been “progressive” and “progressive lite.” The abundance agenda promises to supply moderate Democrats with a positive identity, rather than merely a negative one.

That dynamic has only raised the stakes of the abundance agenda within the party. Its ideas are ambitious enough, but its political implications have set off a schismatic conflict not just over a collection of proposals and the Democratic Party's direction—but over who should have the standing to direct it.

After percolating for years among policy wonks, the abundance agenda—a term coined by my colleague Derek Thompson in a 2022 essay—ascended suddenly in response to the deflating failure of the Biden administration's policy program.

“We have to prove democracy still works,” Joe Biden said in his first speech to Congress. “That our government still works—and can deliver for the people.” That summer, after the Senate had approved a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, Biden declared the mission accomplished. “Today,” he announced at the White House, “we proved that democracy can still work.”

But in the months and years that followed, an unsettling realization began to creep in. A massive law had been enacted, yet Americans did not notice any difference, because indeed, very little had changed. Biden had anticipated, after quickly signing his infrastructure bill and then two more big laws pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into manufacturing and energy, that he would spend the rest of his presidency cutting ribbons at gleaming new bridges and plants. But only a fraction of the funds Biden had authorized were spent before he began his reelection campaign, and of those, hardly any yielded concrete results.

More than two years after signing the infrastructure law, Biden was “expressing deep frustration that he can't show off physical construction of many projects that his signature legislative accomplishments will fund,” CNN reported. The nationwide network of electric-vehicle-charging stations amounted to just 58 new stations by the time Biden left office. The average completion date for road projects, according to the nonprofit news site NOTUS, was mid-2027. The effort to bring broadband access to rural America, a centerpiece of Biden's plan to show that he would work to help the entire country and not just the parts that had voted for him, had connected zero customers.

Rather than prove democracy still works, Biden's experience proved the opposite.

The odd thing about this deflating record is that a very similar thing happened the previous time Democrats held the presidency. Barack Obama came into office facing a catastrophic recession that he believed he could resolve with a gigantic new program of public works. Obama harkened back to the New Deal, when millions of Americans had been employed constructing roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, but quickly learned that, as he bitterly put it, “there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects.” The lesson sat there, mostly unexamined, for a dozen years, inspiring no efforts to understand or change it, until Biden came into office. A Democratic president again hoped to follow FDR's model, and again discovered it had somehow become impossible.

This time, the failure inspired a little more introspection. Policy wonks, mostly liberal ones, began to ask why public tasks that used to be doable no longer were. How could a government that once constructed miracles of engineering—the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge—ahead of schedule and under budget now find itself incapable of executing routine functions? Why was Medicare available less than a year after the enabling legislation passed, when the Affordable Care Act's individual-insurance exchange took nearly four years to come online (and had to survive a failed website)? And, more disturbing, why was everything slower, more expensive, and more dysfunctional in states and cities controlled by Democrats?

Finding answers to these questions began as a series of disparate inquiries into such neglected topics as restrictive zoning ordinances, federal and state permitting regulations, and the federal government's administrative procedures. But many who pursued these separate lines of inquiry experienced similar epiphanies, as if a switch had suddenly been flipped in their heads. They concluded that the government has tied itself in knots, and that enormous amounts of prosperity could be unleashed by simply untying them.

The closest thing to an institutional home for the abundance agenda is the Niskanen Center, formerly a heterodox libertarian think tank, which became a haven for Never Trump Republicans before veering, in recent years, toward promoting abundance. Some journalists, including several at this magazine, have also championed these ideas. Three new books have expressed abundance-agenda themes: Abundance, by Thompson and Ezra Klein; Stuck, by my colleague Yoni Appelbaum; and Why Nothing Works, by the Brown University scholar Marc Dunkelman. The proliferation of such works is a sign of the excitement these ideas have generated. And the abundance libs are rapidly winning over Democratic politicians, especially moderate ones.

From the March 2025 issue: How progressives froze the American dream

The movement is still working out precisely what is, and is not, included in its program. But the canonical abundance agenda consists of three primary domains.

The first, and most familiar, is the need to expand the supply of housing by removing zoning rules and other legal barriers that prevent supply from meeting demand. Over the past 90 years or so, and especially since World War II, American cities have thrown up a series of restrictions on new housing. Some 40 percent of the existing structures in Manhattan, for instance, would be illegal to build today, and where the rules don't ban new construction outright, they make it prohibitively time-consuming and costly. The same dynamic has strangled housing in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington, and other places where people want to live but can't afford to.

The second focus of abundance is to cut back the web of laws and regulations that turns any attempt to build public infrastructure into an expensive, agonizing nightmare. The cost of building a mile of interstate highway tripled in a generation. California approved a plan to build high-speed rail from Los Angeles to San Francisco 17 years ago and, despite having spent billions, still has no usable track. Permitting requirements, which have slowed the green-energy build-out to a crawl, are a special focus.

The third domain, and the one that has received the least attention from commentators, is freeing up the government, especially the federal government, to be able to function. Policy wonks call this issue “state capacity.” The government itself is hamstrung by a thicket of rules that makes taking action difficult and makes tying up the government in lawsuits easy. The abundance agenda wants to deregulate the government itself, in order to enable it to do things.

Revealingly, when the government does act swiftly, it frequently does so by suspending or ignoring its standard procedures. In January 2020, researchers in Seattle spent weeks trying and failing to get government permission to test the flu samples they had gathered for coronavirus, which was spreading rapidly elsewhere. Eventually, the researchers just ignored the rules and ran the tests, creating the first measure of the spread of COVID in the U.S. Similarly, Operation Warp Speed, Trump's greatest and arguably only triumph, involved an end run around normal vaccine-development protocol. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro got an overpass on I-95 rebuilt quickly and safely, but only by suspending normal highway-construction bureaucratic requirements. The fact that the government has to ignore its rules if it wants to do something important ought to raise the question of why those rules have to be followed the rest of the time.

All of these policies sound so obvious and unobjectionable that one might understandably grow a bit suspicious. Who would favor keeping a bunch of pointless rules? Why would anybody oppose abundance?

You might think Democrats, in particular, would uniformly embrace plans to allow Democratic-run states and cities to expand, to build more zero-carbon energy, and to restore the bureaucratic confidence of the New Deal heyday. But this turns out to be a highly controversial proposition, because the limitations on building and the government were largely imposed by the left itself. What's more, these limits remain a core part of the interest-group politics that has dominated the Democratic Party for more than half a century.

In the years after World War II, the New Deal seemed to have permanently triumphed, and the legitimacy and power of government were beyond contestation. Many liberals now believed they could direct their energies in new directions. The task was to prevent the government machine, powered by its unstoppable alliance of Big Business and Big Labor, from subordinating the needs of the citizens. A new vision took hold, shared by writers and activists such as Rachel Carson, Jane Jacobs, and Ralph Nader. In his 2021 book, Public Citizens, the historian Paul Sabin describes this citizen-activist movement as “a legal attack, led by liberals, on the post–World War II administrative state.”

Unlike the Roosevelt generation that had preceded them, these liberals saw their task as restraining the power of government, rather than establishing it. “The fundamental wrong,” Carson said in a 1963 speech, “is the authoritarian control that has been vested in the agricultural agencies.”

This new, anti-statist form of liberalism had two hallmarks. One was its reliance on lawyers and lawsuits. This reflected the influence of Nader, who rocketed to fame as a consumer advocate and became the most admired man in America by articulating a distrust of the system that defined public sentiment in the age of Vietnam and Watergate. “We are creating a new professional citizen role,” he boasted to Time magazine. Those citizens were lawyers, or were represented by lawyers, who would devote their power to prying open the works of the state and holding it accountable.

The second was its faith in groups of citizens outside of government who could serve as a check on its power. The Port Huron Statement, the 1962 New Left manifesto by Students for a Democratic Society, envisioned a huge network of citizen-activist groups: “Private in nature, these should be organized around single issues (medical care, transportation systems reform, etc.), concrete interest (labor and minority group organizations), multiple issues or general issues.”

Paul Sabin: The liberal attack on government

These visionaries believed the future of activism would revolve around a collection of specialized citizen-activist groups. And they were correct. By 1971, The Washington Post reported that Nader had created a “bewildering network of organizations, all devoted to a staggering array of public issues” and bearing Nader's imprint, many of which still operate today. They pushed for the passage of laws, then fought in court to expand their reach, creating tools to slow down or block government action.

They achieved some genuinely laudable results, including laws regulating pollution and consumer safety, and those protecting poor communities from being steamrolled by the likes of Robert Moses. But their emphasis on litigation and cumbersome legal requirements (what the law professor Nicholas Bagley calls “the procedure fetish”), combined with the empowerment of interest groups, has over time inverted Roosevelt's preference for results over legalism. The Naderites sought to prevent the government from doing harm, but in too many cases, they ended up preventing it from doing anything at all.

The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, provides the clearest example. Passed in 1969, at the zenith of the environmental movement's influence, the law required the government to undertake environmental-impact studies before authorizing major projects and created elaborate legal hurdles to navigate.

Activist groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund saw NEPA as a potent tool to stop Washington (and, through state-level copycat laws, state and local governments) from building harmful projects. They pursued an energetic legal strategy to expand the law's reach, turning it into a suffocating weapon against development. Over time, the environmental-impact statements required to start a project have ballooned from about 10 pages to hundreds; the process now takes more than four years on average to complete.

Most perversely, NEPA and similar laws have become a way to stop efforts to address climate change. The environmental movement was created during an era when activists saw their highest priority as preserving nature by stopping construction. In the era of global warming, however, preserving nature requires building new infrastructure: green-energy sources, pipelines to transmit the energy, and new housing and transportation in cities where density allows for a less carbon-intensive lifestyle. But environmental groups have not, for the most part, altered their desire to stop building, nor have they reconsidered their support for laws that freeze the built environment in place.

Joe Biden learned this the hard way.

After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden's signature climate law, Democrats began to realize that, thanks to a maze of legal impediments, the hundreds of billions of dollars in green-energy infrastructure they had authorized would not materialize any time soon, if at all.

Democratic moderates, with support from the Biden administration, set out to negotiate a permitting-reform bill that would impose a two-year cap on environmental-review statements and allow the federal government to plan the transmission lines needed to connect the new green-energy sources. Many Republicans, suspicious of infringing on states' rights, opposed it. More striking, so did hundreds of environmental groups. They objected to legislation that would, in the words of one letter to Democratic leadership, “truncate and hollow-out the environmental review process, weaken Tribal consultations, and make it far harder for frontline communities to have their voices heard.”

And because climate activists opposed the bill, many progressives did too. “This is a good day for the climate and the environment,” Senator Bernie Sanders said after the permitting-reform bill died in Congress. Two years later, in the waning days of the Biden administration, a second effort to pass permitting reform failed again, and while moderate Democrats expressed dismay, progressives celebrated. “Thanks to the hard-fought persistence and vocal opposition of environmental justice communities all across the country, the Dirty Deal has finally been laid to rest,” then–House Natural Resources Chair Raúl Grijalva boasted.

Last year, Biden prevailed upon Congress to suspend environmental review for new factories that would produce computer chips, under the bipartisan CHIPS Act. He did so by relying on a coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats, over strident objections from environmental activists and progressive Democrats.

Progressives are not indifferent to building green-energy infrastructure or manufacturing computer chips, but they place greater value on defending the prerogatives of local activists. The New Left model of citizen-activist groups empowered by litigation remains the core of the progressive movement's theory of change.

“Meaningful community engagement is the key to unlocking our clean-energy future,” Christy Goldfuss, the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said by way of explaining the group's opposition to permitting reform. Some housing activists likewise oppose zoning reform because they see the key to housing justice as giving local activists the power to block new housing. The New York Times columnist Tressie McMillan Cottom has held up the tenant-union movement as a way to solve the housing crisis. “Its strongest political strategy at the moment,” she writes, “is pushing for local ordinances that give community members the authority to assess new housing developments that use city resources to determine whether they would displace residents or reduce a neighborhood's affordability.”

The driving insight of the abundance agenda is that the organized citizen-activist groups descended from the Nader movement are not merely overly idealistic or ineffective, but often counterproductive. This is a diametric conflict: The progressive-activist network believes that local activists should have more legal power to block new housing and energy infrastructure. The abundance agenda is premised on taking that power away.

Jerusalem Demsas: Not everyone should have a say

This helps explain why much of the progressive left rejects the abundance agenda, not merely as insufficient or naive, but as directionally wrong. Anthony Rogers-Wright, then the director of environmental justice at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, told my colleague Jerusalem Demsas a few years ago that permitting reform means “taking away the ability for all communities, but especially environmental-justice communities, from self-determination and using the courts as a way to get relief if a project is found to be harmful.” A policy brief on solar power from the progressive Roosevelt Institute last year proposed that the government should provide subsidies for community groups fighting new solar plants.

The theory underlying this position is that Nader-style citizen engagement is an important component of democracy, and that building up activist groups engaging in these litigation strategies creates powerful constituencies for the left. David Dayen, the editor of the progressive magazine The American Prospect, wrote an essay in 2023 critiquing the abundance agenda as an attack on basic democratic rights. Dayen, approvingly quoting the economist Marshall Steinbaum, argued that the effort to sideline community activists “boils down to the idea that people can't be trusted.” A better policy, Dayen proposed, was “a liberalism that builds power,” which means “the government actively supporting the very groups that have been left out of past economic transitions, building the necessary coalition for long-term transformation.”

Whether or not this strategy has actually built power—the evidence from Biden's presidency is discouraging—it remains foundational to the party's activist superstructure. The progressive movement seeks to maintain solidarity among its component groups, expecting each to endorse the positions taken by the others.

Much of the most vociferous opposition to the abundance agenda has zeroed in on its betrayal of this principle. The Roosevelt Institute's Todd Tucker attacked Ezra Klein on X for his “survivor island approach to coalitions—first unions and Dems team up to vote enviros off the island, and then Dems turn on labor.” David Sirota, a left-wing journalist, complained, “Abundance Libs are insisting the big problem isn't corporate power & oligarchs, it's zoning laws & The Groups? Come on.” Austin Ahlman, a researcher at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly advocacy organization, mused, “You have to wonder whether the Abundance faction stuff would have landed better if the proponents had not laid the groundwork for it by first broadsiding every other organized constituency in the democratic tent.”

This angry response is not merely a knee-jerk reaction to criticism, but the logical outgrowth of a well-developed belief system. Since the Obama era, many of the component groups in the progressive coalition have drifted further left on their core demands. (Single-issue lobbies are naturally incentivized to grow more extreme over time—what organization is going to decide its pet cause is too unpopular or costly to merit a strident defense?)

At the same time, they have grown more purposeful about their belief that each group must stand behind all the positions outlined by the others. That is why civil-rights groups will demand student-debt relief, abortion-rights groups endorse abolishing the police, or trans-rights groups insist that Palestine should be liberated. Leah Hunt-Hendrix, an heir to the Hunt oil fortune who became a full-time progressive organizer, and who has raised and donated millions to causes such as the Sunrise Movement, the Debt Collective, and Black Lives Matter, articulated the principle of cross-endorsements in her book, Solidarity. She argues for “the necessity of working in coalition with progressive social movements,” and of resisting the opposition's efforts “to weaponize a movement's fault lines.”

Such progressives are not wrong to see the abundance agenda as a broader attack on their movement. Their theory of American politics depends on empowering the very groups the abundance agenda identifies as the architects of failure and barriers to progress.

But that dynamic also explains why the abundance agenda is likely to become the tentpole of the party's moderate wing, even for politicians who have mixed feelings about its particulars. As the Niskanen Center's Steven Teles and Robert Saldin have pointed out, the factional division between group-aligned progressive Democrats and the abundance Democrats opposed to them is already playing out in several cities. (San Francisco, where the failures of progressive urban governance are most pronounced, has the most organized abundance faction.)

In the 2020 Democratic primary, candidates competed for the groups' favor by endorsing their most far-reaching and politically toxic demands, such as decriminalizing illegal border crossings and abolishing private health insurance. Abundance may provide an escape from that dynamic in 2028. Democrats who reject the demand to maintain solidarity with the groups at all costs will find themselves free to endorse policies that the majority of the country supports.

The first fissures are already beginning to appear at the national level. Some elements of the abundance agenda have appeal to the left. (There are, in particular, left-wing YIMBYs.) But most of the elected officials who have identified with it come from the party's mainstream and moderate wings, such as Pete Buttigieg; Governors Kathy Hochul, Wes Moore, and Josh Shapiro; and House members Jake Auchincloss, Scott Peters, George Whitesides, and Ritchie Torres. Torres offers the most instructive example: Having previously carved out an identity as a gleeful antagonist to the party's left wing on Israel and other divisive issues, he announced in January, “I feel like the abundance agenda is the best framework that I've heard for reimagining Democratic governance.”

By contrast, the progressive icon Elizabeth Warren told The Bulwark in April that she hasn't read Abundance and plans to steer clear of the debate around it—a strange decision for a proudly detail-oriented wonk, but one that makes sense given the divides the issue has opened up on the left.

The formation of ideological factions within political parties is a staple of American history. The divide over slavery ruptured the Whigs; the progressive movement began within both the Democratic and Republican Parties, before migrating entirely into the Democratic camp. A faction can reorganize a party's priorities, generating new alliances and rivalries, and pull new constituencies into a party while driving others out. Many factions start among intellectuals and writers, eventually developing followings among politicians.

Because the abundance agenda has developed out of the work of policy wonks, rather than political operatives, it was not cooked up to help Democrats in elections. It is far from a complete response to the party's dilemma. The abundance agenda says nothing about social issues; an abundance lib could be for or against Medicare for All, the participation of trans women in college sports, or any number of issues that split the party. It is not a theory of everything.

It does, however, meet several political needs of the moment. It addresses the lack of faith in public services, which plunged after COVID. It promises to bring down consumer costs, which remain the public's top concern. It provides a direct response to Elon Musk's assault on state capacity. And it offers a plausible route to improving living standards at a time when high inflation and elevated interest rates and debt make promising big new social benefits harder.

Brian Deese: The next front in the war against climate change

Perhaps most important, the abundance agenda supplies Democrats with a vision of the future that contrasts sharply and clearly with Donald Trump's. The president has lectured the country about the need to make do with less in the service of his self-destructive tariff regime. He has attacked plans to build denser cities as an assault on suburbs, defunded scientific research, sought to shut down the green-energy transition, and paralyzed the bureaucracy with arbitrary restrictions. The abundance agenda creates a unified program to reverse all these retrograde ideas, along with a practical understanding of the impediments that must be overcome to do so.

What has drawn many Americans to Trump is his claim that the system is so broken that, as he promised, “I alone can fix it.” The last time they held power, Democrats did little to rebut that claim. Now they must decide if they will abandon their legalistic commitment to fragmentary proceduralism or allow Trump's boast to be vindicated.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Why has “baby Botox” become so popular?

by  Noel King

Botox injections used to be a secret for (largely) women in their 40s and 50s. But growing numbers of (largely) women in their 20s and 30s are turning to “baby Botox,” or smaller doses that are intended to prevent aging rather than combat it.

Baby Botox is just one intervention that doctors say younger people now frequently seek, and some view the trend with concern. Dr. Michelle Hure, a physician specializing in dermatology and dermatopathology, says younger patients aren't considering the cost of procedures that require lifetime maintenance, and are expressing dissatisfaction with their looks to a degree that borders on the absurd.

Hure traces the demand for “baby Botox” and other procedures to the start of the pandemic.

“Everyone was basically chronically online,” she told Vox. “They were on Zoom, they were looking at themselves, and there was the rise of of TikTok and the filters and people were really seeing these perceived flaws that either aren't there or are so minimal and just normal anatomy. And they have really made it front and center where it affects them. It affects their daily life and I really feel that it has become more of a pathological thing.”

Hure spoke to Today, Explained co-host Noel King about the rise of “baby Botox” and her concerns with the cosmetic dermatology industry. An excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

You told us about a patient that you saw yesterday, and you said you probably wouldn't keep her on because her mentality really worried you. Would you tell me about that young woman?

I had this patient who was mid-20s, and really a beautiful girl. I [didn't] see a lot of signs of aging on her face, but she was coming in for Botox. 

There wasn't a lot for me to treat. And at the end of the session she was asking me, “So what do you think about my nasolabial folds?”

Basically, it's the fold that goes from the corner of your nose down to the corner of your mouth. It's the barrier between the upper lip and your cheek, and when you smile it kind of folds. Of course, the more you age, the more of the line will be left behind when you're not smiling. And she was pointing to her cheek as if there was something there, but there was nothing there. And so I had to tell her, “Well, I don't see that, you're perfect.” It's a phantom nasolabial fold. It didn't exist.

That sort of mentality where someone is perceiving a flaw that is absolutely not there — providers need to say no. Unfortunately, they're incentivized not to. Especially if you have a cosmetic office, if you're a med spa, if you have a cosmetic derm or plastic surgery office, of course you're incentivized to do what the patient wants. Well, I'm not going to do that. That's not what I do.

That means you may get paid for seeing her in that visit, but you're not getting paid for putting filler in her face. I think what I hear you saying is other doctors would have done that.

Absolutely. One hundred percent. I know this for a fact because many times those patients will come to my office to get that filler dissolved because they don't like it. In the larger practices or practices that are private equity-owned, which is a huge problem in medicine, you are absolutely meant to sell as many products, as many procedures as possible. Oftentimes I was told to sell as much filler as possible, because every syringe is several hundred dollars. And then if they're there, talk them into a laser. Talk them into this, talk them into that. Then you become a salesman. 

For my skin check patients, I'm looking for skin cancer. I'm counseling them on how to take care of their skin. I was told, “Don't talk to them about using sunscreen, because we want them to get skin cancer and come back.”

I was pulled out of the room by my boss and reprimanded for explaining why it's so important to use sunscreen. And so this is why I couldn't do it anymore. I had to start my own office and be on my own. I can't do that. That goes against everything that I believe in, in my oath. Because there is potential harm on many different levels for cosmetic procedures.

What are the risks to giving someone a cosmetic procedure that they don't really need?

This is a medical procedure. There is always risk for any type of intervention, right? What gets me is, like, Nordstrom is talking about having injections in their stores. This is ridiculous! This is a medical procedure. You can get infection, you can get vascular occlusion that can lead to death of the tissue overlying where you inject. It can lead to blindness. This is a big deal. It's fairly safe if you know what you're doing. But not everyone knows what they're doing and knows how to handle the complications that can come about. 

Honestly, I feel like the psychological aspect of it is a big problem. At some point you become dependent, almost, on these procedures to either feel happy or feel good about yourself. And at what point is it not going to be enough? 

One of my colleagues actually coined this term. It's called perception drift. At some point, you will do these little, little, incremental tweaks until you look like a different person. And you might look very abnormal. So even if someone comes to me for something that is legitimate, it's still: Once you start, it's going to be hard for you to stop. If you're barely able to scrimp together enough to pay for that one thing, and you have it done, great. What about all the rest of your life that you're going to want to do something? Are you going to be able to manage it?

I wonder how all of this makes you think about your profession. Most people get into medicine, it has always been my assumption, to be helpful. And you've laid out a world in which procedures are being done that are not only not helpful, they could be dangerous. And you don't seem to like it very much.

This is why it is a smaller and smaller percentage of what I do in my office. I love cosmetics to an extent, right? I love to make people love how they look. But when you start using cosmetics as a tool to make them feel better about themselves in a major way, it's a slippery slope. It should be more of a targeted thing, not making you look like an entirely different person because society has told you you can't age. It's really disturbing to me.

How women took over literary fiction.

by  Miles Bryan and  Noel King

Every generation has a small group of young fiction writers who make it: They top bestseller lists, win prizes, and become household names. And for decades — well, nearly every decade — they have all been straight white men. 

Philip Roth. Norman Mailer. John Updike. Jonathan Franzen. Jonathan Safran Foer. You get the picture. 

But in the last decade or so, that's changed: The up-and-coming writers capturing buzz and dominating critics' lists have largely been women. Think Sally Rooney or Emma Cline or Ottessa Moshfegh. And when men do break through, they usually aren't young, straight, or white. 

It's worth pointing out that, while women now publish more books than men, men are still publishing more books now than they ever have before.

But the (relative) decline of the men in letters has led to searching discussions, first murmured, but now increasingly debated in places like the New York Times and the Guardian: Why does the decline of the young, white, male writer matter? And what do we lose — if anything — with this shift?

“We've seen a lot of great work being done to account for perspectives that were left out of literature for a long time,” Ross Barkan, a journalist and novelist, told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “But I also think it's important to know, for better and for worse, what the men of the 2020s are up to.”

Barkan and King talked about how he feels young men have been shut out of literary fiction, what he thinks is lost, and his experience trying to get fiction published. His third novel, Glass Century, was released earlier this month.

Below is a transcript of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. Make sure to listen to hear the whole thing wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

We are talking to you today because you wrote an essay not long ago called “From Misogyny to No Man's Land: The Vanishing Male in Contemporary Literature.” What's your argument in that essay, Ross?

My argument in that essay is that among young literary writers today, there is a lack of men. This doesn't mean there are no male novelists of prominence under the age of 40 — that's the cutoff I use for young — but there are fewer of them than there were historically. 

And most of the prominent literary fiction writers today are women. I'm talking about a very specific type of fiction that is vying for awards or trying to vie for awards, trying to attain a certain level of prestige.

You're 35, and you're a white man? 

Correct. 

I wonder about the kind of driving force for this essay and whether you are the vanishing male writer of which you wrote.

I think so, yeah, I think there's less of me for sure. I mean, there'd be an era where there were a lot of novelists like myself, Jewish or not Jewish, but certainly white men.

I am inclined to find your argument very compelling. I was a teenager in the '90s, a young adult in the 2000s. That's when you read a lot of fiction, right? And I do remember David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer…

Yeah.

…Jonathan Franzen. 

Jonathan Lethem! 

And so what you're saying actually really does track to me. The question I wonder about is the why. And let me ask you first to answer the why from your personal perspective. 

You're a novelist. You're 35 years old. You're a straight white guy — do you feel like those identities are holding you back in some way?

Not in the real world. In the real world, I have enormous privilege. 

But in the 2010s, the literary world was less interested in straight men. I think you have a general lack of the heterosexual male perspective in newer fiction. There's a long history of writers portraying toxic masculinity and rough male characters — and it feels like you see less of that today. 

I also think at the same time, young male writers, white and non-white, were taking less of an interest in fiction. It's a chicken-and-egg challenge: Is it the publishing industry deciding this is no longer something we're going to push or take a real interest in, or is it market forces as well?

So some of it is internal — maybe there are fewer men who want to be great novelists, but maybe publishers are saying, “Hey, we're just less interested in the perspectives of straight white men.” When you approached publishers with your novel Glass Century, did you hear that?

I think you hear it behind the scenes. You're never told to your face. I'm not complaining — I don't consider myself a victim. I've had a successful career. I'm very happy with it. 

But what do you hear behind the scenes?

To echo Joyce Carol Oates in a sort of notorious but not wrong tweet from several years ago — and I'm paraphrasing — agents and editors, at least in the 2010s and early 2020s, were just less interested in straight male fiction. I want to broaden it a little bit because you see even among Black, Hispanic, and Asian straight men — there are some, but [they're] less common. 

And, certainly, the white male is now even less common, so I think publishers in general in that era were trying to diversify, which was fine. You had social justice politics, you had what they call “woke,” and in a way woke worked because it broadened things out and brought in new voices, but it is also zero sum. Some come up; some go out. And so for me, it's observing that trend. 

What do you think we lose when we lose the perspective of those young white men?

It's a large part of the country. I think you have a lot going on with young men today. White and non-white alike, straight men — they are falling behind academically. They're increasingly alienated. They're increasingly angry. They are increasingly online. And fiction, in my view, is not grappling with all of that.

I agree with you, but I did actually see that in one book in the last year, Rejection by Tony Tulathimutte. There were characters who were highly online. The most acclaimed story was about an incel. That book was incredibly powerful. And it got praise, right? What do you think about that?

He's a fantastic writer. I'll start there. He's a great prose stylist. There's a short story I love about a young Asian man who is having these very lurid sexual fantasies about dominating other men. Fantastically written — he's sort of the Roth of our era in terms of his ability to make a sentence really sizzle. 

But this is the caveat that people seem to be afraid to point out: It's not a straight male fantasy. Could Tony have written a straight male fantasy of wanting to subdue a woman the way that character wants to subdue men? Tony himself is straight. It was an interesting choice there to inhabit a gay character. Nothing wrong with that. Writers should write about whatever sexuality. I don't believe in limiting anyone in that way. 

But I thought it was a choice, right? Because straight male lust is very disconcerting. It's not easy to write about. What do men think about? The modern novel is not addressing that enough. The nasty, nasty men. The men who are not — maybe they're good at heart, but they have a lot of bad thoughts. And they take bad actions. You don't see that much in fiction today, I would argue.

Let me ask you about an argument that I think many people might have in response to what you've said, including many women. 

If you look at the stats going back to the year 1800, women made up about 5 percent of published authors. It's 10 percent through about the 1900s, and then in 2015, women surpassed men — more women are publishing books than men. Although both genders are still publishing a lot of books, it should be said.

Are you at all sympathetic to the argument that you guys had your turn for centuries, the attention, the prizes, the accolades, so we're just leveling the playing field out?

Yeah, I'm sympathetic, for sure. I think that it's reasonable to believe that — that's an honest argument. The problem is you'll hear from people who say this isn't happening, and I find that very tiring. 

I think the honest thing to say is that it's time to rebalance the scales or turn the tables. But there are winners and losers, right? Women were losing; now men are losing. I will say, there's no solace offered to the 26-year-old male who must pay for the sins of the past, right? The young male writer can't sit at home and think, Well, golly, it was good Norman Mailer and John Updike had such a great run. 

So yes, I think one can rebalance, one can seek balance, one can ensure that groups of people who are discriminated against have their time as they should. My point merely is that you can't then pretend there aren't those who aren't getting what they want.

Marc Faber, a longtime investor who says his nickname is ""Dr. Doom"" (not to be confused with this Dr. Doom), has been buying gold for decades and telling other people to stock up for just as long.

The gold bug regularly appears on videos extolling the metal's virtues while sounding alarms about economic collapse. He's eyeing a litany of crises coming our way: a debt crisis, a plunge in asset prices, and soaring inflation round out his list of concerns.

""My sense is that a debt crisis is inevitable,"" he said, adding that he buys gold regularly, with the metal comprising 25% of his overall portfolio.

Faber's clients also hold a significant portion of their wealth in gold, but the scramble to own more of the metal that's helped drive prices higher this year is spreading to more everyday investors.

Blame the bad energy in the economy in 2025, with ""soft data"" like consumer sentiment and inflation expectations souring even as the economy continues to hold up.

Some of what these buyers are worried about—which, among Faber's clients range from hyperinflation to the start of World War III—are unlikely. But forecasters don't expect the heightened demand from nervous buyers to end anytime soon.

Gold bugs having been popping up in the US and abroad. Global demand for gold bars climbed to 257 metric tons in the first quarter of 2025, up 13% in a year, according to the World Gold Council.

Joe Cavatoni, a market strategist at the World Gold Council, said he believes concerns about the US dollar, economic weakness in the US, and the government's debt and deficit are several reasons gold demand is rising.

This year, Google search interest for ""gold bars"" has spiked on market-moving events, like the announcement of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and Moody's downgrading the US debt.

Genesis Gold Group, a gold dealer that commonly works with clients it describes as ""homesteaders"" or ""preppers,"" says it's seen intense interest in gold in the last few quarters. Demand for gold has been so hot, the company rolled out a prepper bar, a gold bar that can be broken off into pieces, making it easier to trade in the event of a crisis.

Jonathan Rose, the CEO of Genesis, says demand for prepper bars briefly surged after the presidential election and then jumped 20% in the first quarter of 2025, around the time President Donald Trump began to iron out his tariff policy.

More clients who have invested in gold have also been requesting that the gold be sent to them, Rose said, estimating that the number of the firm's clients who insist on holding physical gold has risen to 70%, up from 20% in past years.

Most of Genesis's clients are off-the-grid types who desire to be self-sufficient in the event of a collapse, Rose said. But not all of them are as extreme. More everyday people have come to him over the years, with fears about the dollar, inflation, and volatility in risk assets like stocks.

""They have a preparedness plan, you then find out — you kind of peel the layers back — that these people also have dry food, they have water supplies, and it doesn't mean that they're tinfoil hat people and they're living off the grid and they're listening to shortwave radio. These are just general people looking for a hedge,"" he said of their interest in gold.

On the subreddit r/preppers, where membership has soared 354% since 2020, according to historical subreddit data, questions about stocks up on gold regularly flow in from users.

""It helps when a currency collapses. Cash is always king, until it collapses, then that's where gold and silver step in,"" one user wrote.

It's been a good time to own gold. The price of bullion has climbed 25% in 2025, handily beating the S&P 500, which is down by about 1% year-to-date.

Analysts say that some of the worries driving gold demand could be overstated.

While the risk of a US recession is elevated, Wall Street forecasters don't expect the economy to enter a serious downturn. Goldman Sachs recently lowered its recession outlook from 45% to 35%, while Barclays recently removed its forecast for a mild recession.

Trump's tax bill has also stoked more concern about the US debt and budget deficit in the last week. But those worries will likely ease, especially if policymakers amend the bill to appease investors in the bond market, Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, told BI this week.

""There's definitely a feel that there may be a little bit excessive influx,"" Michael Boutros, a senior technical strategist at StoneX, told BI. ""There's a lot of fearmongering going on in the markets right now.""

Still, Boutrous thinks the demand for gold will remain strong as long as people feel uncertain about the economy. Even when trade agreements get hammered out, he believes investors will still be jittery as they wait to see the impact of tariffs on the economy.

""The rockier things get, the more this is going to find footing,"" he said of gold's price momentum. ""It's just really hard to justify a strong bearish, a bear sentiment on this.""

""We see the price support and the upward trajectory very well positioned for 2025,"" the World Gold Council's Cavatoni added.

A US gauge of the 60/40 mode returned some 1.6% this year through mid-May.

A slump in the US long bond is clouding the comeback of a classic investment strategy.   

The so-called 60/40 portfolio — long recommended for investors who want to balance exposure to risk with a cushion of safer, steady income — calls for allocating 60% of holdings to stocks and 40% to bonds. While a bedrock of retirement savers over decades, the approach lost some of its luster in recent years as its underlying mechanism fell out of whack, with US stocks and bonds moving more in lockstep rather than offsetting each other.

SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has proposed setting up a US-Japan sovereign wealth fund aimed at making large investments in technology and infrastructure, the Financial Times reported, citing three unidentified people close to the situation.

Son has discussed the plan with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, although it hasn't been formally proposed, the report said. The joint fund would likely need about $300 billion in initial capital, with significant leverage, to be effective, one person told the FT.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

The rising U.S. budget deficit is on the forefront of investors' minds, weighing on stocks. However, sell-offs can present a buying opportunity — for those who know where to look.

The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick out the right stocks for their portfolios, as their ratings are backed by a thorough analysis of a company's financials and growth potential.

With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Ride-hailing and delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER) is this week's first stock pick. The company recently held its Go-Get 2025 event and revealed its new products and solutions to attract users.

Following the event, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a buy rating on UBER stock with a price target of $115. The analyst noticed several new products, features and services, which he thinks are incremental to the company's existing offerings. In particular, Mahaney noted the launch of Price Lock, Uber's competitive offering to rival Lyft's well-received feature at the same price point of $2.99 per month. Uber also launched its Prepaid Pass offering, which allows users to buy trip bundles for 5, 10, 15 and 20 trips at a discount beginning this summer.

""We view the announcement of Price Lock and Prepaid Pass as the most material new products for UBER,"" said Mahaney.

Further, the analyst believes that Uber's Shared Autonomous Rides offering has the potential to enhance the utilization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Additionally, he views the announced launch of Volkswagen AVs on the Uber platform in Los Angeles in 2026 as a positive signal for the company, with similar deals with AV technology providers expected in the long term. Meanwhile, Mahaney sees the other launches like Route Share, Savings Slider and Dine Out as slightly incremental.   

Despite the solid year-to-date rally, Mahaney said that Uber remains one of Evercore's top ""Longs,"" as its valuation continues to be reasonable for a company that he believes can sustain about 30% earnings growth.

Mahaney ranks No. 150 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.3%. See Uber Technologies Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Next on this week's list is CyberArk Software (CYBR), a cybersecurity company that specializes in identity security. The company delivered better-than-expected results for the first quarter of 2025 and highlighted that its subscription annual recurring revenue reached $1.028 billion.

In reaction to the Q1 print, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari reaffirmed a buy rating on CYBR stock and increased the price target to $460 from $450. The analyst highlighted that the company reported strong results and surpassed ARR, revenue and free cash flow (FCF) expectations.

Kothari added that Q1 results aligned with his preview and checks and reflected identity's criticality and CyberArk's solid execution. He noted that CyberArk's extensive identity security platform continues to attract customers, with Venafi and now Zilla seeing robust early traction. 

The analyst stated that despite macro pressures, CYBR indicated zero disturbance to deal flow and steady demand, with the company not seeing any impact on its business, as identity security remains a top priority within IT budgets.

""While confident in current momentum, CYBR acknowledged a prudent posture embedded in FY25 outlook assumptions, reflecting general macro caution without seeing impact to date,"" noted Kothari.

Kothari ranks No. 43 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 77% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.8%. See CyberArk Software's Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

We will look at another cybersecurity stock, Palo Alto Networks (PANW). The company posted market-beating earnings and revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, but its adjusted gross margin lagged expectations.

Reacting to the Q3 FY25 results, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reiterated a buy rating on Palo Alto stock with a price target of $230. The analyst stated that the company delivered strong results at the top range of its guidance on most metrics, including revenue, operating margins, earnings per share and remaining performance obligations (RPO).

He noted PANW's significant product revenue growth and next-generation security (NGS) tailwinds. Eyal also pointed out the accelerated adoption of the company's platformization strategy. Notably, PANW had about 1,250 platformization customers in Q3 FY25, with 90 net new platformization deals in the quarter.

""PANW remains focused on its LT [long-term] $15B ARR target through the expansion of its platform strategy targeting 3,000 at mid-pt to reach its FY30 $15B ARR goal,"" said Eyal. He also mentioned the robust adoption of AI solutions and a solid Q4 FY25 pipeline, which would drive a strong finish to the year.

Overall, Eyal's investment thesis is based on his expectations that Palo Alto will remain the market leader in next-gen firewalls and the rapidly growing secure access service edge market. He also expects the company to expand into adjacent security markets, including cloud security and security operations, with its vast installed base of more than 70,000 customers presenting massive cross-sell opportunities.

Eyal ranks No. 12 among more than 9,500 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.9%. See Palo Alto Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

A massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other regions in the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens, officials said early Sunday.

The scale of the onslaught was stunning — Russia hit Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles, making this the largest single aerial attack of the more than three-years-long war, according to Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force.

In all, Russia used 69 missiles of various types and 298 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed drones, he told The Associated Press.

It was ""the most massive strike in terms of the number of air attack weapons on the territory of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022,"" Ihnat said.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow.

For Kyiv, the day was particularly somber as the city observes Kyiv Day, a national holiday that falls on the last Sunday of May commemorating its founding in the 5th century,

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian missiles and drones hit more than 30 cities and villages across Ukraine and urged Western partners to ramp up sanctions on Russia.

That has been a long-standing demand of the Ukrainian leader but one that — despite warnings to Moscow by the United States and Europe — have not materialized in ways to deter Russia.

Zelenskyy wrote on X that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions.

""These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities. Ordinary residential buildings were destroyed and damaged,"" he said.

""Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will certainly help,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Determination matters now — the determination of the United States, of European countries, and of all those around the world who seek peace.""

The attack came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month that have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. The exchange amounted to a rare moment of cooperation between the warring sides.

Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Sounds of explosions boomed throughout the night in Kyiv and the surrounding area as Ukrainian air defense forces persisted for hours in efforts to shoot down enemy drones and missiles. At least four people were killed and 16 were injured in the capital itself, according to Ukraine's security service.

""A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night. The most massive Russian air attack in many weeks lasted all night,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X.

Fires broke out in homes and businesses, set off by falling drone debris.

In the region of Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, three children were killed, aged 8, 12 and 17, according to the emergency service. Twelve were injured in the attacks, the service said. At least four people were killed in the Khmelnytskyi region, in western Ukraine. One man was killed in Mykolaiv region, in southern Ukraine.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district was hit by a drone and one of the building's walls was on fire. In Dniprovskyi district, a private house was destroyed and in Shevchenkivskyi district, windows in a residential building were smashed.

The scale of Russia's use of aerial weapons aside, the attacks over the past 48 hours have been among the most intense strikes on Ukraine since the February 2022 full-scale war. The last in a three-day prisoner swap was expected to take place later on Sunday.

In the village of Markhalivka, just outside Kyiv, where several homes were burned down in the overnight strikes, the Fedorenkos watched their ruined home in tears.

""The street looks like Bakhmut, like Mariupol, it's just terrible,"" says 76-year-old Liubov Fedorenko, comparing their village to some of Ukraine's most devastated cities in the war. She told the AP how grateful she was her daughter had not joined them for the weekend with her family.

""I was trying to persuade my daughter to come to us,"" Fedorenko said, adding she told her daughter, ""After all, you live on the eighth floor in Kyiv, and here it's the ground floor.'""

""She said, 'No, mum, I'm not coming.' And thank God she didn't come, because the rocket hit (the house) on the side where the children's rooms were,"" Fedorenko said.

Ivan Fedorenko, 80, said he regrets letting their two dogs into the house after the air raid siren went off. ""They burned to death,"" he said. ""I want to bury them, but I'm not allowed yet.""

Zelenskyy and Russia's defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers the previous day, on Saturday, a day after each side released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Once completed, the swap will amount to the largest exchange of prisoners in more than three years of war.

""We expect more to come tomorrow,"" Zelenskyy said on his official Telegram channel on Saturday. Russia's defense ministry also said it expected the exchange to be continued, though it did not give details.

The previous night, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard throughout Kyiv as many sought shelter in subway stations as Russian drones and missiles targeted the Ukrainian capital.

The ongoing POW exchange, the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians so far did not bring a halt in the fighting.

Battles have continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.

Even as more Americans tap, swipe or scan to pay, most still carry at least a little cash — and financial planners say that's a good idea.

Americans keep $67 in their wallet, on average, according to a recent Federal Reserve survey on how people use their money. While cash remains widely carried, usage has been slipping: in 2024, 83% of consumers said they used it at least once in the past 30 days — down from 87% in 2023, according to the Federal Reserve. 

Still, financial planners tell CNBC Make It that it's worth keeping some on hand — particularly for situations when digital payments fall short. Whether it's a power outage, a dead phone, a vendor with a card minimum or just the need to get home, cash can bridge the gap.

The amount of cash you should have on hand depends on your routine, says Christopher Rand, a certified financial planner in San Diego. He recommends keeping enough to handle a typical expense if something goes wrong — whether that's gas, food, parking or a tip — but not so much that you'd lose sleep if it went missing. ""Generally, $50 to $100,"" he says.

Melissa Caro, a CFP in New York, carries a similar amount — usually $60 to $80, depending on her plans. ""If I know I'll need it — say for tipping, parking, or certain small businesses — I'll add a bit more to my wallet,"" she says. ""A good gut check is: If I lost my phone and needed a cab home, would I be covered? That's my 'panic point.'""

Other planners emphasize the value of cash when tech fails altogether. Leslie Beck, a CFP in New Jersey, recommends keeping at least $50 in your wallet for outages and emergencies. ""When Hurricane Sandy hit the NYC area, ATMs were out, internet was down in many areas, and cash was king,"" she says.

Some people only start carrying cash after a mishap. Brett Anderson, a CFP in Minnesota, says he used to carry less than $5 — until his credit card was declined due to suspected fraud.

""It's truly inconvenient and embarrassing, depending on who you're with,"" he says. As a ""financial advisor, your real friends will never let you forget if your credit card gets declined, and they take financial advice from you, I'm just saying."" He now keeps a couple hundred dollars on hand as a backup.

You probably don't need a lot of cash, and certainly shouldn't carry more than you'd be upset to lose or have stolen.

""Having large amounts of cash in your wallet makes you more susceptible to losing the funds."" says Tipiwa Walker, a CFP based in California. Unlike cards, ""cash simply does not have the protections that credit cards do.""

But having about $50 can be a smart backup for tips, low-dollar purchases or tech hiccups — even if you rarely use it, financial pros say.

Carrying cash isn't about ""replacing digital tools, but having just enough cash to handle those moments when tech fails or feels like overkill,"" says Caro.Want to boost your confidence, income and career success?

South Korean presidential frontrunner Lee Jae-myung said on Sunday the deadline to reach a deal with the U.S. on President Donald Trump's trade tariffs needs to be reconsidered to find a mutually beneficial agreement between the two allies.

Tariff negotiations with the United States will be one of the biggest challenges for the winner of the June 3 election, Lee told a press conference.

The snap election was called after Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached as president and removed from office for briefly declaring martial law in December. Lee, from the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, is leading in opinion polls over conservative contestants.

Seoul and Washington have said they aim to craft a package on tariffs and economic cooperation by July 8. But the South Korean minister for trade and industry said recently that there was not enough time and delays would be possible due to the election.

""There is not much time,"" Lee said. ""Isn't diplomacy something that benefits both sides? If one country benefits and the other country suffers unilaterally, that is not diplomacy. It is called plunder.""

He called for mutual respect between the two countries, saying they ""need to reconsider whether the timeline set by one side should be bound to"".

Lee said South Korea must compile an extra budget to boost the economy in the short term and vowed that if elected, he would form and head a task force to tackle the slowing economy.

""I will swiftly prepare immediately actionable economic measures and actively respond to the domestic economic slowdown with the determination to fight the recession,"" he said.

Lee said he would pursue peace on the Korean peninsula, criticizing the ousted Yoon's tough policy on North Korea, which he said had raised tensions high, burdening the economy and adding to concerns among foreign investors.

""We should maintain and strengthen our powerful defense capabilities, military power, and strengthen the South Korea-U.S. security alliance, but find a path toward dialogue, cooperation, communication, and coexistence where possible,"" said Lee, who considers pragmatism a key to diplomacy.

Lee is leading the race with 45% support ahead of conservative rival Kim Moon-soo, Yoon's labor minister, with 36% support in a Gallup Korea poll released on Friday.

Kim has been closing the initially double-digit gap with Lee. Asked about his recent decline in polls, Lee said he was confident that South Koreans would not choose those who supported or staged the ""insurrection,"" referring to the criminal charges against Yoon over martial law.

A year into the job, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has scored some key wins, including recently signing major trade deals with the U.S., India and European Union that will boost the British economy and wages.

Opinion polls paint a different picture of his success.

A survey by pollster YouGov, published in mid-May, showed that the British public's approval the prime minister has plummeted to a record low, with 69% of voters now having an unfavorable view of Starmer, while just 23% regard him enthusiastically.

More worryingly for the Labour Party leader, the fall in popularity is concentrated among Labour voters, half of whom (50%) now have an unfavorable view of Starmer — a 17-point increase from the last poll in mid-April. The share of Labour voters with a favorable opinion of him has meanwhile fallen from 62% to 45% over the month.

With things seeming to point in the right direction for the British economy, what's going wrong for its prime minister?

The U.K.'s leadership might be touting their impressive record on trade deals recently, but cost-of-living pressures continue to worry ordinary British voters, and businesses are reckoning with Labour-led tax rises.

The U.K.'s annual inflation rate hit a hotter-than-expected 3.5% in April, up sharply from 2.6% in March, according to data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday.

The data highlighted increasing pressures on British households, as prices of electricity, gas and other fuels rose by 6.7% in the year to April. The prices of water and sewerage meanwhile added 26.1% in the month to April, marking the largest monthly hike since at least February 1988, the ONS said.

British businesses now face a higher tax burden as a result of government policies introduced in the ""Autumn Budget,"" as well as other measures deemed be many economists to be ""anti-growth."" These include limits on immigration set to affect foreign workers — who are key to a number of sectors — a rise in the national minimum wage and reforms to workers' rights, which put pressure on many small and medium-sized firms.

As such, lofty trade deals promising economic growth and investment that will take time to feed through are cold comfort for many British consumers and businesses struggling right now.

""On domestic policy, this government hasn't scored well so far; let's give it a C-minus,"" Kallum Pickering, chief U.K. economist at Peel Hunt, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Wednesday. ""[We've seen] mostly anti- growth measures and that's the thing that disrupted bond markets over the past few months.""

On foreign and international policy, the government is ""doing a fairly good job,"" with its latest trade deals a testament to that, Pickering said.

""Starmer has contained the downside risk that the U.K. and the U.S. could really escalate on trade. It's not a good deal, but it contains downside risk. The U.K.-India deal is actually a strong signal that the U.K. is open for business. And if you read the press, people that are unhappy with the deal that the U.K. and the EU is striking but, actually, what's the alternative?"" he asked.

Big business leaders say they're happy with the British government's general direction of travel, with C.S. Venkatakrishnan, group chief executive of Barclays, telling CNBC Thursday that it was ""absolutely on track.""

""If you look at if you look at what they've achieved over the last few weeks, they've had trade deals with the U.S., with India, with Europe, important trading partners. They continue to be repairing relationships with Europe, which they need to,"" he told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick.

Inflationary pressures, he noted, were evident but were not yet leading to ""consumer distress,"" the Barclays exec believed.

""We're in fact seeing conduit continued consumer strength, but it's coming because of people managing their balances and their finances prudently. So [they're] economizing. The job market is still strong. But as you see ... people are worried about inflation. People are worried about cost, whether it's winter fuel bills or whether it's more generalized inflation from tariffs, and the only real answer to that is growth, which is what this government is focused on, and what we want to help them.""

Although some quarters welcome Keir Starmer's calmer and less bombastic approach to leadership than politicians like Reform UK leader Nigel Farage or former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he continues to face criticism that his leadership style and personality hold him and the Labour Party back.

CNBC has contacted the Labour Party for comment on Starmer's poll ratings and is awaiting a reply.

""Starmer has great positives — [signing] the trade deals"" for one, Bill Blain, strategist and founder of Wind Shift Capital, said that the prime minister's lack of charisma is a deficit.

""But he is dull, boring and precise. He is competent, but he is not a personality and lacks political charisma ... Farage has it in spades. So did Boris Johnson,"" he told CNBC Tuesday.

""A additional problem is Starmer lacks able cabinet colleagues able to create the illusion of a cabinet of smart, leaders. Some are settling into their roles but most look out their depth. This is particularly true of Rachel Reeves ... who is naturally not a risk taker,"" Blain added.

""The bigger issue is the narrative — Labour present it as doing the right thing to control spending, but it's backfired as insensitivity to their voters. They are perceived as cruel,"" he said.

Starmer is coming ""under pressure,"" Blain noted, increasing the risk that rank and file Labour lawmakers ""will revolt if the polls bite.""

""That may be happening — [meaning] mutiny!,"" he said.

A man was arrested Friday after being accused of kidnapping an Italian tourist and torturing him for weeks inside a Manhattan home in a bid to steal the alleged victim's bitcoin, according to officials, law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation and a criminal complaint.

The victim was able to escape the home and run for help Friday morning, the law enforcement sources said. John Woeltz, 37, was taken into custody that same day and was arraigned Saturday on one count each of second-degree assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, court records show.

Law enforcement sources close to the investigation said Woeltz and the tourist, along with a third person, had been in business together for years. Police are still searching for the third business partner, who has not been publicly identified.

The sources said Woeltz and the other person have allegedly gotten violent with the victim in the past, but never to this extent. They described the relationship between the three as very complex, and said it appears the victim was often picked on by the two men.

An attorney for Woeltz declined to comment Saturday. A judge granted a request to hold Woeltz in custody during Saturday's arraignment. His next court date is Wednesday.

The tourist, a 28-year-old man visiting from Italy, met his alleged kidnapper on May 6, law enforcement sources said. That's when, they said, Woeltz took the younger man to a home he was renting in Nolita, a neighborhood in Manhattan.

According to a criminal complaint, Woeltz and an unidentified, “unapprehended male” kidnapped the victim, took his electronics and passport, and tortured him until he managed to escape weeks later.

The pair tried to get the tourist to give them the password to his bitcoin account so they could steal the electronic currency, and when he refused, they beat him, shocked him with electric wires and hit him in the head with a gun over the course of weeks, the complaint said.

Woeltz and the other man allegedly pointed a gun at the victim's head multiple times, dangled him over the ledge of the top flight of stairs in the home and threatened to kill him if he did not reveal his password, according to the complaint, which also alleged the pair threatened to have his family killed.

The tourist also told officials that the men tied his wrists and bound him to prevent him from moving, according to the complaint.

Law enforcement sources added that the men urinated on the victim and put an Apple AirTag around his neck to ensure he did not escape.

Upon his escape, the 28-year-old ran into a traffic agent who called police to the home on Prince Street. He told the agent he had been taken and held against his will and that he was repeatedly assaulted during his captivity, police said.

The alleged victim was taken to a hospital in stable condition, police said. When he approached officers Friday, he was covered in cuts and bruises, with marks on his wrists where he was bound, law enforcement sources said.

Law enforcement sources said Woeltz is a prominent crypto currency trader from Kentucky, estimated to be worth around $100 million. The victim has an estimated worth of $30 million, they said.

Woeltz had reportedly been renting out the Prince Street residence at a monthly rate of between $30,000 and $40,000, the sources said. An online listing for the home says it was last rented in March for $75,000.

Law enforcement sources said there were cases of alcohol throughout the six-story residence, as well as stripper poles in the basement.

Those sources said officers turned up multiple Polaroid pictures of the victim being tied up and tortured at the home. Investigators also reportedly recovered several torture items.

Inside the residence, investigators on Saturday found a gun, believed to be the same one used to torture the victim, law enforcement sources said.

Jennifer Crawford lives across the street from where the events unfolded Friday morning and saw Woeltz being arrested.

“I watched, like, the SWAT guys get out of the truck with their shields and everything and enter the building, and they were just starting to rope off the area and everyone's yelling. It looked like they were a little bit in a panic,” she told NBC News.

She said she was shocked when she started learning more of the allegations.

“I just stood and froze,” she said. “A lot does go on here in New York. You can imagine, I've seen a lot, but this is the most unusual thing I've seen in 30 years in this neighborhood. I mean, that's just beyond what you can even describe or imagine.”

Crawford said she couldn't imagine the motive of someone with so much wealth committing this type of crime.

“All that money in the world didn't do anything. It's not going to help him,” she said. “Just doesn't make sense, you know?”

On Saturday, hundreds of people passed by the townhome in Manhattan, some whispering about the details of the case. A few even took selfies in front of the home by the iron fence wrapped in police tape.

Police officials and investigators were in and out of the house Saturday, several standing guard in the front and recommending to those passing by to Google the home address to learn more.

An old Ethereum (ETH) wallet that hadn't been touched in nearly a decade just came back to life — and it's holding millions. The address, created during Ethereum's pre-mine phase, originally received 2,153 ETH back in 2015 when that amount was worth around $667. On May 24, 2025, it moved for the first time in 9.8 years, now holding ETH worth over $5.43 million as reported by Whale Alert.

The address ""0x10df68"" made its first transaction in almost a decade, sending 30 ETH worth about $75,970 to another wallet: ""0x967e37."" Just a few hours later, that second wallet began routing the funds through Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing service often used to break the link between wallets and obscure the transaction history.

ETH Shows Big Bullish Sign After Reclaiming $2,700: Report

ByYuri Molchan





On-chain data shows that after receiving the funds, the second wallet quickly started making multiple transactions — mostly 1 ETH at a time — directly to Tornado Cash. Within hours, the full 30 ETH had been split up and moved through the mixer.

💤 A dormant pre-mine address containing 2,153 #ETH (5,433,793 USD) has just been activated after 9.8 years (worth 667 USD in 2015)!https://t.co/MqGPrKIyw4

The original wallet still holds over 2,100 ETH, valued at more than $5.2 million. Its reactivation after almost 10 years, combined with the immediate use of a privacy tool, has definitely drawn attention from those tracking long-dormant wallets and early Ethereum holders.

$3,380,000,000 Bitcoin and Ethereum Expiry: Volatility to Hit?

ByArman Shirinyan





There is now only around 2.78 ETH, worth just under $7,000, in the second wallet. Given Tornado Cash's involvement and no additional large transfers yet, it's unclear what the long-term plan is for the remaining funds.

It's possible that this could be Vitalik Buterin. The address dates back to Ethereum's Genesis phase, limiting the possible owners to a small group of early insiders. Additionally, the immediate move to Tornado Cash stands out — a tool that Vitalik Buterin has supported and admitted to using for personal privacy. While there's no hard proof it's him, the pattern fits just enough to raise the question.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Forms Inverse H&S","https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-forms-inverse-hs-bulls-eye-breakout-above-2700-level/","Sun, 25 May 2025 13:30:53 GMT","

Ethereum is trading around $2,500 after failing to reclaim the $2,700 level during the week. Despite the rejection, market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with many analysts viewing the recent pullback as part of a healthy consolidation phase. After weeks of volatile swings, ETH appears to be stabilizing above key support levels, potentially setting the stage for a stronger breakout in the weeks ahead.

Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum may be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the 12-hour chart—a classic bullish reversal signal. According to Pillows, this structure could act as a springboard for ETH to retest and potentially break above the $2,700 level.

For now, ETH's ability to hold the $2,500 zone is a positive sign, as bulls look to defend key support and build momentum. If the pattern confirms, the next leg higher could unfold quickly. However, failure to hold current levels would likely invite renewed selling pressure. As the market awaits further confirmation, Ethereum's technical setup continues attracting attention from traders eyeing the next move.

While many analysts continue to call for an incoming altseason, most agree on one key requirement: Ethereum must reclaim higher levels above $3,000 to lead the charge. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH historically acts as the gateway for broader altcoin rallies. Without its participation, the likelihood of a full-scale altseason remains low.

Currently, Ethereum is trading near $2,500, consolidating after a failed attempt to break through the $2,700 resistance zone earlier in the week. Despite this rejection, optimism remains high. Analysts like Ted Pillows believe ETH is simply setting the stage for a larger breakout. In his latest analysis, Pillows highlights a developing inverse head and shoulders pattern on the 12-hour chart—an established bullish structure often preceding trend reversals.

According to Pillows, a breakout above the $2,700 neckline would be a strong technical confirmation, likely triggering a rapid move toward the $3,000 level. “If ETH closes above $2,700 with momentum, it won't take long to reach $3,000,” he noted.

Many also believe Ethereum's explosive move could come shortly after Bitcoin finishes its impulsive push above all-time highs. Once BTC cools down, capital may rotate into ETH and large-cap altcoins, fueling a new leg higher across the board.

Ethereum is currently trading at $2,512 on the 4-hour chart after failing to break through the $2,700 resistance earlier in the week. The chart shows ETH consolidating between $2,470 and $2,700, forming what appears to be the right shoulder of a developing inverse head and shoulders pattern—a potential bullish reversal setup that traders are watching closely.

The 34 EMA (green) sits at $2,557, and ETH is now trading just below it, signaling short-term weakness. However, the 100 SMA (purple) at $2,511 is offering immediate support, and bulls will need to defend this level to avoid a deeper correction toward the 200 SMA, currently near $2,156.

Volume has declined during the recent pullback, suggesting that selling pressure may be losing steam. As long as ETH holds above $2,470 and avoids a breakdown below the neckline of the pattern, the setup remains valid. A confirmed breakout above $2,700 would likely trigger a quick move toward the psychological $3,000 level.

The next few sessions will be crucial. Ethereum needs to reclaim the 34 EMA and gain momentum above $2,600 to confirm strength. Otherwise, a failure to hold support could delay the anticipated breakout and stall altseason hopes.

As the cryptocurrency world continues to mature, Ripple's XRP token is once again a strong contender for mainstream adoption. Once overshadowed by regulatory uncertainty, XRP is now experiencing a remarkable resurgence driven by global partnerships, growing utility, and growing investor interest. Meanwhile, cloud-based mining platform BlockchainCloudMining is offering crypto enthusiasts, especially XRP holders, a whole new way to benefit from the digital asset ecosystem without actively trading or managing mining hardware.

This article explores the current state of XRP, the importance of its growth to the broader crypto economy, and how BlockchainCloudMining enables passive income generation that fits perfectly with XRP's expanding footprint.

The past few years have been nothing short of an up-and-down journey for XRP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit that began in 2020 cast a shadow over Ripple's development. However, since the court partially ruled in Ripple's favor in mid-2023, the tide has turned. XRP is being relisted on mainstream exchanges such as Coinbase, and global financial institutions are returning to RippleNet and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution.

In recent months, Ripple has consolidated partnerships with large remittance corridors in Asia, South America, and the Middle East. By reducing transaction fees and enabling instant settlement, XRP continues to position itself as a transformative tool for cross-border finance. The latest data from Ripple Labs shows that ODL usage grew by more than 30% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the previous quarter.

In terms of price, XRP prices have risen significantly, up more than 20% in the past 30 days. Analysts say that if the momentum continues, the psychological barrier of $0.80 may be tested in the short term. But the price itself is not everything – people's renewed confidence in the legitimacy of XRP opens the door to a wider range of applications and innovative use cases.

While XRP itself is not a mineable coin (unlike Bitcoin or Litecoin), investors looking to benefit from the overall growth of the cryptocurrency market often seek a diversification strategy. BlockchainCloudMining is here to help – a platform designed to make cryptocurrency mining convenient, profitable, and user-friendly for the average investor.

BlockchainCloudMining is a UK-registered platform that offers cloud-based cryptocurrency mining contracts.

Environmental focus: BlockchainCloudMining utilizes green energy whenever possible, in line with the crypto industry's increasingly important sustainability goals.

This makes the platform an attractive option for both cryptocurrency newcomers and experienced investors looking to optimize portfolio performance.

Moreover, BlockchainCloudMining's interface makes it all seamless. The platform allows users to choose their preferred withdrawal currency, providing flexibility that matches personal investment strategies.

Market Timing: Why It Matters Now

There's a perfect storm brewing for XRP and platforms like BlockchainCloudMining. On one hand, XRP is seeing a return of institutional investors and renewed public interest. On the other hand, cloud mining is gaining traction as a convenient and reliable way to earn crypto without the need for large upfront capital or maintenance headaches.

For those who have been waiting on the sidelines for the “perfect time” to re-enter or diversify into the crypto space, this may be the perfect time. BlockchainCloudMining bridges the gap between passive income and active asset allocation. Investors no longer have to choose between mining, trading, or holding — they can combine all three strategies on one platform.

As the cryptocurrency space grows more complex, so does the need for convenient, reliable income-generating platforms. BlockchainCloudMining stands out not only for its ease of use, but also for its adaptability — allowing users to easily earn across major assets and convert profits into XRP.

As XRP recovers in utility, price, and ecosystem strength, combining it with a reliable income stream like BlockchainCloudMining is not only strategic, but also smart portfolio design.

In the context of smart homes, efficiently managing temperature control while optimizing energy consumption and ensuring data security remains a significant challenge. Traditional thermostat-based systems lack predictive capabilities, and energy consumption often spikes during peak hours, leading to inefficiency. Additionally, the security of sensitive data in smart home environments is a growing concern. This paper presents a novel AI-powered blockchain framework for predictive temperature control in smart homes, leveraging wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and time-shifted analysis. The framework integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms for predictive temperature management, blockchain technology for secure data handling, and edge computing for real-time data processing, resulting in a highly efficient and secure system. Key innovations include the dynamic detection of heating and cooling events, predictive scheduling based on historical data, and blockchain-based decentralized energy trading. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the system accurately detects radiator heat-on events with a 28.5% success rate, while radiator cooling event detection achieves 37.3% accuracy. Scheduled heat-on events were triggered with 68.4% reliability, and the system's machine learning component successfully reduced energy consumption by 15.8% compared to traditional thermostat controls, by adjusting heating based on predictive analysis. Additionally, the time-shifted data processing reduces peak-time computational load by 22%, contributing to overall energy efficiency and system scalability. The integration of blockchain ensures tamper-proof data security, eliminating unauthorized data access, and improving trust in smart home environments. These results illustrate the potential of combining AI, blockchain, and WSNs to create a robust, energy-efficient, and secure smart home temperature control system, offering significant improvements over traditional solutions.

As the adoption of smart homes continues to expand globally, the need for efficient, secure, and autonomous temperature control systems has become increasingly important1. Traditional thermostat-based systems, while effective in basic temperature regulation, lack the sophistication necessary to optimize energy usage and improve user comfort in dynamic environments2. These systems often fail to account for real-time data, external factors, or user behavior patterns, leading to inefficient heating and cooling cycles that contribute to energy waste and increased costs3. Recent advancements in WSNs and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have introduced new opportunities for more precise temperature control4. WSNs enable the continuous monitoring of environmental parameters, such as room temperature and radiator activity, within a smart home5. However, managing and processing the large volume of data generated by these networks, while maintaining data security and minimizing energy consumption, remains a significant challenge6.

Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to address the issues of data security and privacy in IoT systems7. Its decentralized architecture ensures tamper-proof data storage, while smart contracts enable automated decision-making processes, such as adjusting temperature settings based on predefined conditions8. Despite these advantages, blockchain's high computational demands can lead to latency and inefficiency when applied to real-time data processing in smart homes9. To further enhance the capabilities of smart home temperature control, ML techniques have proven effective in predictive analytics, enabling systems to anticipate user needs based on historical data10. By integrating ML models with blockchain and WSNs, it is possible to develop a more responsive and energy-efficient system that adjusts temperature proactively, reducing the need for manual intervention11.

Furthermore, the integration of edge computing offers a viable solution to the problem of latency by processing data locally at the home level12. This reduces the reliance on centralized cloud systems, enhancing real-time response and improving overall system performance13. Additionally, time-shifted data analysis can be employed to reduce computational loads during peak times, ensuring that energy consumption is optimized without compromising the accuracy or responsiveness of the system14. The integration of smart technologies in residential environments has been a rapidly growing field of research over the past decade, driven by the increasing demand for energy-efficient and automated systems in modern homes15. WSNs, IoT devices, and smart thermostats are among the key enablers of intelligent home systems, allowing for real-time monitoring and control of environmental conditions such as temperature, lighting, and security16. The deployment of these systems at scale has brought about new challenges related to data security, computational efficiency, and energy management, which have been the focus of recent research17. WSNs have been extensively studied for their ability to monitor and control environmental parameters in real time18. In the context of smart homes, WSNs enable continuous tracking of room temperature, humidity, and occupancy, providing the data needed for adaptive heating and cooling systems19. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of WSNs in improving energy efficiency in smart homes. For example, research20 showed that sensor-driven temperature control systems could reduce heating energy consumption by up to 20% when compared to traditional thermostat systems.

Blockchain technology has emerged as a robust solution21 for addressing security and privacy concerns in IoT systems22. By decentralizing data storage and securing transactions with cryptographic algorithms, blockchain ensures the immutability of data records and protects against unauthorized access23,24 is among the first to explore the use of blockchain for securing IoT data in smart homes, proposing a lightweight framework that protects user data from external attacks. The use of smart contracts in blockchain further enhances automation by enabling devices to execute predefined actions autonomously, based on specified triggers25. The computational intensity of blockchain, particularly its reliance on consensus mechanisms, can introduce delays that reduce system efficiency for real-time applications26.The integration of blockchain technology and machine learning techniques to enhance the security management of 6G wireless networks is explored in27. The application of blockchain technology to enhance various aspects of smart city infrastructure is examined in28. It highlights how blockchain can improve security, transparency, and efficiency in urban systems such as energy management, transportation, and governance, enabling better data handling and fostering trust among citizens and stakeholders. The article29 explores the integration of blockchain technology to enhance the security and privacy of smart devices in the IoT environment.

The application of ML for predictive temperature control has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for improving system responsiveness and energy efficiency30. ML algorithms can analyze historical temperature data, occupancy patterns, and even external factors such as weather to forecast heating or cooling needs, allowing systems to adjust preemptively31. Studies such as32 demonstrated that machine learning-based systems could reduce energy consumption by up to 18% compared to traditional reactive control systems, by predicting when heating or cooling is required based on user behavior. These predictive systems, however, require robust data33 handling mechanisms to ensure that real-time and historical data are processed securely and efficiently. The integration of edge computing into smart home ecosystems has been proposed as a solution to the latency and bandwidth issues associated with centralized cloud processing34. Edge computing allows data to be processed locally, closer to the source of data generation, which reduces the delays inherent in cloud-based systems35. Research36 highlighted the potential of edge computing in reducing latency and improving real-time decision-making in IoT systems, particularly in scenarios requiring immediate responses, such as smart temperature control. A transformative advancement in37, showcasing significant improvements across several key dimensions of industrial operations. Overall, the synergy between AI and blockchain technologies38 leads to a notable increase in productivity, operational reliability, and data security, setting a new standard for industrial excellence.

Despite the significant advancements in smart home temperature control systems, several critical research gaps remain in the integration of emerging technologies such as blockchain, ML, WSNs, and edge computing. Current approaches either focus on isolated aspects of temperature management (e.g., predictive analytics or security) or lack the computational efficiency needed for real-time applications. These gaps are becoming more pronounced as smart home environments grow increasingly complex and demand secure, scalable, and energy-efficient solutions.

Research Gaps:

At the same time, ensuring data integrity and privacy in IoT environments remains a challenge, especially when dealing with sensitive home environment data.

Latency and Computational Bottlenecks: Centralized cloud-based systems used in many smart home applications face significant latency issues and computational bottlenecks, especially during peak data loads. These limitations hinder real-time control and scalability, which are critical for large-scale smart home deployments.

The second part of the article focuses on Problem Formulation, addressing key components such as Predictive Temperature Control. The third section follows with the Results and Discussion, providing a detailed simulation analysis and comparison of the proposed method, while the fourth section offers the Conclusion for a final summary.

The rapid advancement of smart home technologies has highlighted the need for systems that not only provide comfort but also optimize energy usage and ensure data security. Traditional thermostat systems are limited in their ability to predict and adapt to varying environmental conditions and user behaviors, often resulting in inefficient heating schedules and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the centralized handling of sensitive data in these systems raises concerns about privacy and vulnerability to unauthorized access. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an integrated framework that combines predictive analytics, secure data management, and efficient processing capabilities. Specifically, the problem centers on developing a system that can accurately detect heating and cooling events, reliably trigger scheduled heat-on events, reduce energy consumption through predictive adjustments, and maintain data integrity and security within the smart home environment. This necessitates leveraging advanced technologies such as AI-powered machine learning algorithms, blockchain for secure and transparent data handling, wireless sensor networks for real-time environmental monitoring, and time-shifted analysis to optimize computational efficiency.

In this section, we define the mathematical framework and relationships necessary to develop an AI-powered blockchain framework for predictive temperature control in smart homes. The system aims to optimize temperature regulation while ensuring secure data handling and improving energy efficiency. The key components of the system include ML algorithms for prediction, blockchain for secure data management, WSNs for real-time monitoring, and time-shifted analysis for optimized computational efficiency.

Flowchart depicting the problem-solving process.

The AI-Powered Blockchain Framework for Predictive Temperature Control in Smart Homes can be modeled as a holistic system integrating predictive control, energy optimization, and blockchain technology. The architecture can be represented as follows:

The system takes the following inputs:

where \(\:{U}_{\text{user\:}}\) represents user-defined preferences, such as the desired temperature range. The predictive model forecasts future temperature:

with the control law ensuring:

The optimization function minimizes energy consumption:

subject to constraints on temperature stability. Sensor data and control signals are securely stored in a blockchain:

ensuring immutability and transparency in the data. The system detects heating and cooling events dynamically:

and uses historical patterns for scheduling:

The outputs are:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{Optimized\:}}\)​ represents optimized power usage and \(\:{E}_{\text{events\:}}\)​ identifies critical heating/cooling events.

This integrated system provides a robust, secure, and energy-efficient solution for temperature control in smart homes, demonstrating the novelty and practical relevance of the proposed framework.

Let \(\:T\left(t\right)\) represent the indoor temperature at time \(\:t\), measured by the wireless sensors. The goal is to predict the future temperature \(\:T(t+{\Delta\:}t)\) based on historical temperature data, user preferences, and environmental conditions.

To model the temperature dynamics, we can use a simple heat transfer equation:

\(\:C\) is the thermal capacity of the room,\(\:\:P\left(t\right)\) is the power supplied by the heating system at time \(\:{t}_{r}\),\(\:\:U\) is the overall heat transfer coefficient of the building and\(\:\:{T}_{ext}\left(t\right)\) is the external temperature.

The ML model uses historical temperature data \(\:\left\{T\left({t}_{1}\right),T\left({t}_{2}\right),\dots\:,T\left({t}_{n}\right)\right\}\) and corresponding energy consumption \(\:P\left(t\right)\) to predict future temperature changes. The prediction function can be expressed as:

where \(\:f\) is the learned function based on past data using a machine learning algorithm, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

The objective is to minimize the energy consumption \(\:E\), while maintaining user comfort, represented by a set temperature range \(\:\left[{T}_{\text{min\:}},{T}_{\text{max\:}}\right]\).

The energy consumed by the heating system over a period \(\:T\) is:

where \(\:P\left(t\right)\) is the power required to maintain the temperature within the desired range. Using predictive temperature control, the heating system can adjust the power supply based on the forecasted temperature \(\:T(t+\varDelta\:t)\), thereby reducing unnecessary energy use.

The system seeks to minimize \(\:E\) under the constraint:

To reduce peak-time computational load, the system leverages time-shifted analysis, where non-urgent computations, such as data processing or historical analysis, are performed during off-peak times.

Let \(\:{C}_{\text{p}\text{e}\text{a}\text{k}}\) ​be the computational load during peak hours, and \(\:{C}_{\text{o}\text{f}\text{f}}\) ​ be the load during off-peak hours. Time-shifted analysis aims to minimize \(\:{C}_{\text{p}\text{e}\text{a}\text{k}}\)​ by shifting part of the workload to off-peak times. The relationship can be modeled as:

with the goal to reduce \(\:{C}_{\text{p}\text{e}\text{a}\text{k}}\)​, where:

and \(\:\varDelta\:{C}_{\text{s}\text{h}\text{i}\text{f}\text{t}}\) represents the load shifted to off-peak times. This reduces overall peak-time load by a percentage \(\:\varDelta\:{C}_{\text{s}\text{h}\text{i}\text{f}\text{t}}/{C}_{\text{t}\text{o}\text{t}\text{a}\text{l}}\)​.

For data security, blockchain technology is integrated to ensure tamper-proof and transparent data management. Each temperature reading and energy consumption record is stored as a block in the blockchain. Let \(\:D\left(t\right)\) represent the data at time \(\:t\) (e.g., temperature readings, energy consumption). The blockchain ensures that \(\:D\left(t\right)\) cannot be altered once recorded.

The data is secured using a cryptographic hash function \(\:H\), where:

Each new block includes the hash of the previous block \(\:H\left(D\right(t-1\left)\right)\), ensuring data immutability:

This chain of blocks guarantees that any attempt to tamper with historical data will be easily detected, as it would alter the hash values in subsequent blocks.

The final objective is to optimize the system for both energy efficiency and user satisfaction. Let SSS represent customer satisfaction, which depends on maintaining the desired temperature range and minimizing energy costs. The overall optimization problem can be formulated as a multi-objective problem:

subject to the constraints \(\:{T}_{min}\le\:T\left(t\right)\le\:{T}_{max}\)​ and secure data handling through blockchain. The system seeks to balance energy efficiency with user comfort and data security.

The system must dynamically detect heating events (e.g., radiator turning on) and cooling events (e.g., radiator turning off). These events can be modeled as binary occurrences based on the rate of temperature change over time.

Let \(\:\varDelta\:T=T(t+1)-T\left(t\right)\) represent the change in temperature between time intervals. Define \(\:H\left(t\right)\) as a heating event and \(\:C\left(t\right)\) as a cooling event, which are triggered when certain thresholds are crossed:

\(\:H\left(t\right)=1\) if \(\:{\Delta\:}T>{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{heat-on,\:}}\) where \(\:{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{heat-on\:}}\) is the minimum temperature change to trigger a heating event.

\(\:C\left(t\right)=1\) if \(\:{\Delta\:}T<{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{cool-off\:}}\), where \(\:{\Delta\:}{T}_{\text{cool-off\:}}\) is the maximum temperature drop to trigger a cooling event.

The framework can further be refined by employing machine learning models that dynamically learn from data to refine these thresholds and account for varying environmental conditions:

where \(\:{f}_{\theta\:}\) is a learned function that dynamically adjusts thresholds based on environmental and system variables.

To optimize energy usage, the system uses predictive scheduling based on historical data. The goal is to anticipate future temperature changes and schedule heating or cooling events accordingly.

Define \(\:\mathcal{H}\left(t\right)=\left\{H\right(t-\tau\:),\dots\:,H(t\left)\right\}\) as the history of heating events over the time period \(\:\tau\:\), and similarly, \(\:\mathcal{C}\left(t\right)=\left\{C\right(t-\tau\:),\dots\:,C(t\left)\right\}\) as the history of cooling events. The system uses these historical patterns to predict future events:

where \(\:P\left(H\right(t+1)=1)\) is the probability of a heating event occurring at time \(\:t+1\), predicted using a machine learning algorithm trained on historical data \(\:\mathcal{H}\) and \(\:\mathcal{C}\).

The system then schedules heating and cooling events based on the predicted probabilities to minimize energy consumption while maintaining user comfort. If \(\:P\left(H\right(t+1)=1)>{P}_{\text{threshold,\:}}\) the system preemptively triggers a heating event, reducing energy spikes.

One of the key innovations is the integration of blockchain for decentralized energy trading. Users within a smart home network can buy or sell surplus energy generated from renewable sources (e.g., solar panels) using blockchain smart contracts.

Let \(\:{E}_{prod}\left(t\right)\) represent the energy produced by a renewable energy source at time \(\:t\), and \(\:{E}_{cons}\left(t\right)\)​ represent the energy consumed by the smart home at time \(\:t\). The surplus energy is given by:

where \(\:{E}_{surplus}\left(t\right)>0\) represents excess energy that can be sold, and \(\:{E}_{surplus}\left(t\right)<0\) represents a deficit that can be compensated by purchasing energy.

Using blockchain smart contracts, energy transactions are automated between smart homes. Let \(\:{p}_{buy}\left(t\right)\) and \(\:{p}_{sell}\left(t\right)\) represent the buying and selling prices at time \(\:t\). The smart contract automates the energy trade when:

Each energy trade is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. The smart contract logic can be formalized as:

The blockchain ledger ensures that energy trades are secured and logged without requiring a central authority, maintaining trust among users in the decentralized energy market.

WSNs play a vital role in real-time monitoring of temperature and environmental conditions in smart homes. However, optimizing the energy efficiency and reliability of the WSN itself is essential.

Let \(\:N\left(t\right)\) represent the number of active sensors at time \(\:t\), and \(\:{P}_{s}\left(t\right)\) represent the power consumption of the WSN at time \(\:t\). The goal is to minimize the power consumption of the WSN while maintaining sufficient sensor coverage.

The optimization problem can be formulated as:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{sensor\:}}\left(i\right)\) is the power consumption of the \(\:i\)-th sensor, and \(\:C\left(t\right)\) represents the coverage of the WSN, which must exceed a minimum threshold \(\:{C}_{\text{m}\text{i}\text{n}}\) for reliable temperature monitoring.

To reduce power consumption, time-shifted data analysis and adaptive sensing can be employed, where only a subset of sensors is active during certain periods, depending on predicted events.

The system can dynamically deactivate sensors when they are not required, using the predicted temperature changes \(\:T(t+{\Delta\:}t)\) from the machine learning model. This reduces sensor power consumption:

The interaction between the edge server and IoMT devices involves a collaborative exchange of data and computational tasks, which ensures efficient operation in the system. Each IoMT device independently collects and processes local data, generating model parameters based on its specific environment and tasks. These parameters are periodically transmitted to the edge server for aggregation.

The edge server plays a pivotal role in this framework by acting as a central coordinator. It aggregates the model parameters received from multiple devices using advanced techniques, such as weighted averaging or federated optimization, depending on the importance and quality of the data from each device. This aggregation process ensures that the global model is continually updated while preserving the privacy of individual devices since raw data is never directly shared.

To manage real-time updates, the edge server employs a systematic communication protocol that prioritizes low-latency and secure data transfer. The server can handle asynchronous updates, allowing devices with varying computational and network capabilities to participate effectively. Additionally, the edge server uses error-checking and version.

To formulate the overall optimization problem, we aim to minimize energy consumption, \(\:E\), and computational load, \(\:{C}_{total}\), while maximizing user satisfaction, \(\:S\), and ensuring secure data handling. This leads to a multi-objective optimization problem:

where \(\:{\alpha\:}_{1},{\alpha\:}_{2}\), and \(\:{\alpha\:}_{3}\) are weights representing the relative importance of energy consumption, computational efficiency, and user satisfaction.

Subject to the constraints:

Blockchain-based data logs enhance system security by providing an immutable and tamper-proof ledger for recording all system transactions and events. Each data log is cryptographically secured, ensuring that once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered without the consensus of the network. This feature prevents unauthorized access and data manipulation. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain eliminates single points of failure, making the system resilient against cyberattacks. By incorporating these secure data logs, the proposed framework ensures the integrity and confidentiality of temperature control data in smart homes, thereby fostering user trust and system reliability.

The previous formulation provided a basic energy optimization model. We can enhance this by incorporating dynamic energy pricing and more granular control over energy usage based on real-time conditions.

Let \(\:P\left(t\right)\) represent the dynamic price of energy at time \(\:t\), which varies based on demand and supply in the energy market. The cost of energy consumption, \(\:{C}_{E}\)​, over a period \(\:T\) can be expressed as:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{cons\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the power consumption at time \(\:t\).

The objective is to minimize the energy cost \(\:{C}_{E}\) while maintaining comfort, subject to dynamic pricing. Therefore, the optimization function becomes:

subject to the constraints:

The dynamic pricing \(\:P\left(t\right)\) can be modeled as a function of market conditions and predicted demand:

where \(\:D\left(t\right)\) is the predicted demand and \(\:S\left(t\right)\) is the available energy supply. Incorporating dynamic pricing incentivizes the system to reduce energy usage during peak periods and shift demand to off-peak times, which leads to cost savings.

Blockchain consensus mechanisms ensure the integrity of data within the system. Given the decentralized nature of smart homes, where each home or node is an independent agent, a consensus algorithm like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is appropriate to validate transactions without high energy costs.

Let \(\:D\left(t\right)\) represent a data block (e.g., sensor readings, energy trades), and let \(\:V\left(t\right)\) represent the set of validators in the network at time \(\:t\). Each validator \(\:{\nu\:}_{i}\in\:V\left(t\right)\:\)proposes a block \(\:{B}_{i}\left(t\right)\), where the block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block and the new data to be added.

The consensus algorithm requires that a majority of validators approve the new block. The total number of validators that approve a block \(\:{B}_{i}\left(t\right)\) is denoted as \(\:{A}_{i}\left(t\right)\). The consensus is reached when:

where \(\:\left|V\left(t\right)\right|\) is the total number of validators. If the block is approved by the majority, it is added to the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.

Step 1: Initialization.

• Define the network nodes N={n1,n2,…,nk}.

• Each node ni​ maintains a local blockchain ledger Li​.

• Initialize consensus threshold T (e.g., 51%).

Step 2: Data Collection.

• Each node collects temperature data Di​ from its associated WSN.

• The data includes room temperature Tr​, radiator temperature Th​, and time-stamped events.

Step 3: Block Proposal.

Node ni​ prepares a candidate block Bi​ with:

Sensor readings.

Predicted temperature control actions.

Previous block hash Hprev​.

Step 4: Validation.

• Broadcast Bi​ to all nodes in the network.

• Each node validates Bi​ by:

Verifying sensor data integrity.

Checking consistency with predicted control actions.

Step 5: Consensus Mechanism.

• Nodes perform a voting process.

• Accept or reject Bi​ based on validation.

• Count the votes V(Bi).

• If V(Bi) ≥ T, Bi is accepted and added to the blockchain.

Step 6: Blockchain Update.

• Update local ledger Li​ to include the new block.

Step 7: Execution of Control Actions.

• Apply the predictive temperature control actions specified in Bi​.

Step 8: Repeat.

• Continue the process for the next data interval.

This algorithm ensures secure and decentralized management of temperature control in smart homes while leveraging blockchain for data integrity and trust.

To encourage energy trading between smart homes, an incentive mechanism can be introduced based on a reward structure for participants who trade energy efficiently. Each user \(\:{u}_{i}\) has a surplus \(\:{E}_{\text{surplus\:}}\left(t\right)\) or deficit \(\:{E}_{\text{deficit\:}}\left(t\right)\) of energy at time \(\:t\), as discussed earlier. The system assigns rewards \(\:{R}_{i}\left(t\right)\) to users based on their contribution to the energy market.

Let \(\:N\left(t\right)\) be the total number of users in the network. The reward for user \(\:{u}_{i}\) at time \(\:t\) is proportional to the energy they contribute to the system and inversely proportional to the overall demand:

where \(\:{R}_{\text{total\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the total reward available at time \(\:t\), which is determined by the blockchain network. This reward system encourages users to contribute surplus energy to the grid, promoting decentralized energy management.

In the proposed system, time-shifted load balancing optimizes computational resources by deferring non-critical computations to off-peak times. This is particularly useful for resource-constrained smart home devices. The framework uses priority-based control to assign priority levels to tasks.

Let \(\:\mathcal{T}\left(t\right)=\left\{{T}_{1}\left(t\right),{T}_{2}\left(t\right),\dots\:,{T}_{n}\left(t\right)\right\}\) represent the set of tasks at time \(\:t\), and let \(\:{P}_{i}\left(t\right)\) be the priority of task \(\:{T}_{i}\left(t\right)\). Tasks with lower priority are deferred to off-peak times, thereby reducing peaktime computational load.

The optimization objective is to minimize the peak computational load \(\:{C}_{peak}\) by shifting lowerpriority tasks. The load is reduced according to the equation:

where \(\:{N}_{\text{high\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the number of high-priority tasks, \(\:C\left({T}_{i}\left(t\right)\right)\) is the computational cost of task \(\:{T}_{i}\left(t\right)\), and \(\:\delta\:\left({T}_{i}\left(t\right)\right)\) is the binary variable indicating whether task \(\:{T}_{i}\left(t\right)\) has been deferred to offpeak times.

In a decentralized smart home network, multi-agent collaboration allows multiple homes to collaborate in managing energy and computational load. Each smart home is treated as an agent \(\:{a}_{i}\)​, and the collaboration aims to minimize total system energy consumption while maintaining comfort across all agents.

Let \(\:{E}_{i}\left(t\right)\) represent the energy consumption of agent \(\:{a}_{i}\) at time \(\:t\). The total energy consumption \(\:{E}_{\text{total\:}}\left(t\right)\) of the network is the sum of energy consumption across all agents:

Each agent shares its load with others, reducing peak demand. The collaborative optimization function is:

where \(\:{w}_{i}\left(t\right)\) is the weight assigned to each agent based on their energy-sharing contribution.

The collaboration ensures that energy is distributed efficiently, and peak demand is reduced by sharing surplus energy between homes in the network.

The proposed system can implement an energy-aware control algorithm to manage heating and cooling based on real-time predictions and sensor data. The control algorithm calculates the optimal heating or cooling schedule by predicting the energy consumption required to maintain the desired temperature.

Define the control signal \(\:u\left(t\right)\) that represents the power adjustment made by the system at time \(\:t\). The control algorithm minimizes energy consumption while maintaining comfort within a defined range \(\:\left[{T}_{\text{m}\text{i}\text{n}},{T}_{\text{m}\text{a}\text{x}}\right]\):

where \(\:\lambda\:\) is a penalty term for deviations from the setpoint temperature \(\:{T}_{\text{set\:}}\).

The control signal is updated based on the following relationship:

where \(\:\eta\:\) is the learning rate and \(\:\nabla\:J\) is the gradient of the objective function with respect to the control signal.

This adaptive control algorithm ensures that the system learns over time, adjusting energy usage to maintain the desired temperature while minimizing cost.

Collect historical temperature data, energy consumption data, weather conditions, and occupancy patterns from IoT sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, occupancy sensors, weather forecasts). Collect the system parameters such as heating and cooling system efficiency, energy consumption rates, and other relevant data.

Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing/standardizing the data. Create additional features based on historical data (e.g., moving averages of temperature, occupancy trends, etc.).

Select an appropriate ML model (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc.). Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the ML model using the historical temperature and energy consumption data, incorporating the weather and occupancy data as input features. Optimize model hyperparameters for better performance.

Use the trained ML model to predict future temperature based on current temperature, weather forecast, and occupancy patterns. Predict the temperature setpoints for future hours or days based on this analysis.

Predict energy consumption for the heating and cooling system using the model based on the predicted temperature and occupancy data. Optimize the energy consumption prediction by adjusting the system's heating/cooling demand to match predicted temperature deviations.

Compare the predicted temperature to the desired temperature setpoint. If the predicted temperature is above or below the target, trigger the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system to adjust. Adjust the heating/cooling system settings to bring the temperature closer to the desired setpoint while minimizing energy consumption.

Apply energy-efficient strategies such as predictive scheduling (heating/cooling during off-peak times), adjusting setpoints based on predicted trends, or controlling HVAC systems based on occupancy data. Use reinforcement learning techniques, if applicable, to adapt and optimize the temperature control and energy usage over time.

Continuously monitor and update predictions using real-time data from IoT sensors, modifying the heating/cooling strategy as needed. Re-train the model periodically with new data to ensure that the system stays accurate.

The system generates optimal heating/cooling schedules and real-time control adjustments. Display energy consumption predictions and provide recommendations for further optimization.

Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing predicted energy consumption and temperature control results against actual outcomes. Use performance metrics like MAE, RMSE, or energy savings percentage to assess the performance of the predictive system.

The algorithm leverages machine learning models such as decision trees, neural networks, or other time-series models, combined with optimization strategies like predictive scheduling and reinforcement learning, to efficiently manage energy in smart homes. By integrating IoT with real-time sensor data and weather forecasting, it predicts temperature and energy consumption trends. This enables optimal HVAC scheduling, minimizing energy usage while maintaining comfort, ultimately achieving intelligent temperature control and energy optimization based on both real-time and historical data.

These results are benchmarked against traditional thermostat control methods to highlight the improvements achieved through predictive machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the framework's energy consumption reduction is quantified, demonstrating the impact of predictive scheduling on overall energy efficiency.

Blockchain's role in securing wireless sensor network data and enabling decentralized energy trading is also discussed. The system's tamper-proof nature is examined, along with its ability to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, thereby improving trust and transparency in smart home environments.

The discussion will also touch upon the scalability of the system, particularly the time-shifted data processing method, which significantly reduces peak computational loads. This reduction in processing demand ensures that the system remains efficient, even in large-scale smart home deployments.

This means that the system can make decisions and update control actions (such as turning the radiator on/off or adjusting the temperature) in real time. Furthermore, the blockchain component allows for secure, tamper-proof data logs in real-time, ensuring system integrity.

To illustrate the real-time performance, a time series of temperature data, event detection, and energy consumption adjustments were continuously monitored and updated during the experiments, reflecting how the system responds to changes in the environment and its effectiveness in optimizing energy consumption.

Algorithmic Procedure: The algorithmic procedure for the proposed system can be described in the following steps:

Step 1: Data Collection - Real-time data from WSNs (temperature, humidity) are collected.

The system's complexity is influenced by the machine learning models' training time, the number of sensors in the WSNs, and the blockchain's consensus mechanism.

The dataset was collected from a real-world smart home setup, equipped with a WSN and a variety of IoT devices. Data was recorded from January to June 2024 across multiple rooms, including the living room, bedroom, and kitchen, to ensure variability in temperature and energy usage patterns. The dataset includes temperature measurements, energy consumption readings, and radiator operational status (on/off) synchronized with real-time external weather data.

The dataset includes the following key features that are crucial for training and testing the predictive models, performing time-shifted analysis, and optimizing energy consumption in Table 3:

Total records: 25,920 data points (representing one data point every minute for a period of 18 days). Data is structured in time series, with a total of 6 months of data from multiple rooms, offering a rich set of variations in temperature, energy consumption, and heating events.

To ensure the quality and consistency of the data used for the predictive model and optimization algorithms, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

Missing temperature and energy consumption values were interpolated using a linear interpolation technique to fill in any gaps due to sensor failure or communication issues. For example, if the indoor temperature \(\:{\varvec{T}}_{\text{i}\text{n}\text{d}\text{o}\text{o}\text{r}}\:\)for the time 12:30 PM is missing, it is linearly interpolated from the neighboring values 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM.

Outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Any value higher than 3 times the IQR from the upper quartile (e.g., values > 10 kWh in a 2-hour period) was removed to prevent distortion of the analysis and prediction accuracy.

All temperature values were normalized using Min-Max scaling. For instance, if the range of indoor temperatures is from 18 °C to 28 °C, the normalized indoor temperature is calculated as \(\:{T}_{norm}=\frac{{T}_{indoor}-18}{28-18}\).

Temporal features such as time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), weekday/weekend status, and holidays were extracted to enhance the predictive models. These features were used to adjust heating predictions during high-demand periods like weekends or holidays.

The dataset was used for multiple purposes within the framework:

Historical data was employed to train machine learning models (such as LSTM or Random Forest) to predict the indoor temperature and heating durations, providing predictive scheduling for energy-efficient heating control.

Blockchain technology was used to securely log and share data related to temperature and energy usage across decentralized nodes within the smart home network, ensuring tamper-proof and traceable data handling.

The radiator status and event detection were analyzed using the dataset to identify the exact times heating events occur (heat-on, cooling, and heat-off events), which are integral to time-shifted load balancing.

Consider a smart home equipped with a WSN for monitoring temperature and a heating system that responds to temperature changes. The AI-powered framework uses historical temperature data, real-time sensor readings, and predictive machine learning algorithms to control the heating system more efficiently. At the same time, the system leverages blockchain to ensure secure data handling.

Modeling the Temperature Dynamics

First, the room temperature dynamics need to be modeled based on heat transfer principles. The rate of temperature change in the room can be modeled as:

\(\:T\left(t\right)\) is the room temperature at time \(\:{t}_{\:}\),\(\:\:P\left(t\right)\) is the heating power provided by the system at time \(\:{t}_{r}\), \(\:{T}_{\text{outside\:}}\) is the outside temperature,\(\:\:U\) is the heat loss coefficient (related to insulation), and\(\:\:C\) is the heat capacity of the room.

This differential equation governs how the room temperature changes over time based on heating power and heat loss to the environment.

Machine Learning for Predictive Control

To optimize energy use, a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network, RNN) is trained using historical temperature data and heating system responses. The goal is to predict the future temperature \(\:T(t+1)\) based on current and past data, allowing for pre-emptive heating adjustments.

Let the inputs to the model at time \(\:t\) be \(\:X\left(t\right)=\left\{T\left(t\right),P\left(t\right),{T}_{\text{outside\:}}\left(t\right)\right\}\), and the output be the predicted temperature \(\:\hat{T}(t+1)\). The trained model minimizes the prediction error:

where \(\:N\) is the number of time steps in the historical dataset.

The predictive control algorithm then adjusts the heating power \(\:P\left(t\right)\) to maintain the desired temperature \(\:{T}_{\text{set\:}}\) within a predefined comfort range \(\:\left[{T}_{\text{m}\text{i}\text{n}},{T}_{\text{m}\text{a}\text{x}}\right]\). The control signal is updated as:

where \(\:{K}_{p}\) and \(\:{K}_{d}\)​ are proportional and derivative control gains, respectively. This feedback control loop ensures that the heating system responds dynamically to temperature predictions, optimizing energy use.

Blockchain for Data Security

To ensure that all data exchanged between smart home devices (e.g., sensors, heating systems) is secure, the system integrates blockchain. Each temperature reading and heating event is recorded as a transaction in the blockchain.

Let \(\:{D}_{i}\)​ represent the data block for the iii-th transaction, containing temperature data and heating control decisions. A blockchain consensus algorithm (such as Proof of Stake) is used to validate each transaction. The validation condition is:

where \(\:{A}_{i}\left(t\right)\) is the number of validators approving the block, and \(\:\left|V\right(t\left)\right|\) is the total number of validators in the network. Once the consensus is reached, the block is added to the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof and auditable data.

Energy Consumption Optimization

The final step is to optimize energy consumption while maintaining room comfort. The cost function for energy consumption over a period \(\:T\) is:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{price\:}}\left(t\right)\) is the dynamic energy price at time \(\:t\). The optimization problem becomes:

subject to:

where \(\:{P}_{\text{m}\text{a}\text{x}}\) is the maximum power that the heating system can provide.

The AI-powered system adjusts the heating power \(\:P\left(t\right)\) to minimize energy costs by scheduling heating during periods of lower energy prices and leveraging the predictive model to avoid unnecessary heating during peak times.

Performance Metrics and Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the system, key metrics such as energy savings, temperature control accuracy, and system scalability are computed. For example, energy consumption can be reduced by 15.8%, as mentioned in the abstract, by optimizing heating schedules and predictive controls. Additionally, the system can reduce computational load by 22% through time-shifted data processing.

Comparison of temperature regulation and energy efficiency among control methods.

To analyze the algorithm complexity for the proposed AI-powered blockchain framework for predictive temperature control in smart homes, we need to evaluate both the time complexity and space complexity of the key components involved. Here is a general approach to analyzing algorithm complexity for the proposed framework:

Data Collection and Preprocessing.

Time Complexity: Collecting data from WSNs involves reading sensor data periodically, which is typically O(n) for n sensors.

Space Complexity: Storing sensor data requires O(n) space, as data from each sensor must be stored temporarily for processing.

Machine Learning Model for Predictive Temperature Control.

Training the Model: The time complexity for training a machine learning model (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, or neural networks) is usually dependent on the number of data points (m) and features (d). For a model like neural networks, the complexity can be O(m.d.k), where k is the number of epochs. For tree-based models, the complexity is generally O(m.log(m)).

Inference Complexity: The time complexity for real-time predictions is generally O(d), where d is the number of features used in the model. This is the time taken to make predictions after the model has been trained.

Blockchain Integration for Secure Data Logging.

Transaction Processing: Each data transaction to the blockchain (e.g., recording sensor readings or control actions) can be processed in O(1) time for each transaction. However, as the blockchain grows in size, block verification and consensus can introduce additional computational complexity. The time complexity for consensus protocols (e.g., Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake) is typically O(log(n)) where n is the number of nodes in the network.

Space Complexity: The space required for blockchain storage is proportional to the number of blocks and transactions. For a decentralized system, this grows with the number of blocks, making the space complexity O(b) where b is the number of blocks in the chain.

Real-time Event Detection and Adjustments.

Event Detection: Detecting heat-on or cooling events involves analyzing the sensor data in real-time. The complexity of event detection is typically O(n), where n is the number of sensors. If using a more sophisticated model for anomaly detection, the complexity could increase to O(n.d).

Adjustment Calculation: The time required to adjust temperature settings or initiate control actions is generally O(1) for each event.

Energy Consumption and Network Optimization.

Energy Consumption Estimation: Calculating energy consumption reduction involves estimating the energy saved through predictive adjustments. This is typically O(1) for each prediction, as it requires only the current state of the system.

Network Lifetime Analysis: The complexity of analyzing network lifetime depends on the number of edge devices (n) and their energy consumption rates. For systems with multiple devices, the complexity could be O(n) or higher, depending on the communication and processing requirements.

Overall Algorithm Complexity.

Time Complexity: The overall time complexity of the system can be considered a combination of the complexities of the individual components. The overall time complexity is influenced by the sensor data collection (O(n)), real-time machine learning inference (O(d)), blockchain transaction processing (O(1) or O(log(n))), and event detection (O(n)).

Space Complexity: The space complexity primarily depends on the data storage for sensor readings (O(n)) and the size of the blockchain (O(b)), resulting in an overall space complexity of O(n + b).

Additionally, future work could explore the integration of more advanced machine learning models, such as deep reinforcement learning, to further optimize predictive control and improve energy efficiency. This would allow the system to continuously learn from real-time data and adapt to environmental changes more effectively.

Another area for further investigation is the incorporation of more robust cybersecurity measures. Although blockchain technology provides a secure data logging mechanism, potential vulnerabilities may still exist in other components of the system. Future research could focus on enhancing the security protocols, such as incorporating secure multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive data throughout the network.

Lastly, real-world testing and validation of the framework in diverse smart home environments are essential. While the current results are promising, future work should include experimental validation in various settings to ensure the practical applicability and robustness of the system.

Home » Alchemy Acquires HeyMint to Boost Web3 Wallet Ecosystem

Alchemy, a leading Web3 development platform, has officially acquired HeyMint, a California-based NFT launchpad, as part of its broader effort to advance smart wallet technology. The announcement was made on May 23 and included plans to integrate both HeyMint's toolset and team into Alchemy's existing infrastructure. The acquisition also involves onboarding HeyMint's co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Flor Ronsmans De Vry, into the Alchemy team.

HeyMint has built a reputation for lowering technical barriers in NFT creation. Over 40,000 creators have utilized its platform to mint and sell digital assets, collectively generating more than $38 million in NFT sales. The platform offers customizable smart contract features and auxiliary tools such as allowlists and Discord bots aimed at supporting community engagement. HeyMint's involvement in high-profile Web3 campaigns with major brands, including Universal Music Group and The Sandbox, further underscores its industry relevance.

According to De Vry, the merger will enable HeyMint to accelerate its mission to simplify Web3 onboarding, with Alchemy's backing expected to significantly scale those efforts. Alchemy's leadership echoed this perspective, noting that HeyMint's focus on accessibility closely aligns with its vision of enabling mainstream adoption of decentralized applications.

The acquisition is expected to bolster Alchemy's smart wallet development by embedding HeyMint's intuitive tools into its wallet ecosystem. Alchemy's president emphasized the shared vision of both companies and confirmed ongoing efforts to refine and expand smart wallet functionalities. One of the anticipated outcomes of this partnership includes the continued evolution of HeyMint Quest, a feature designed to foster engagement and growth within NFT communities through gamified interactions.

As part of its expansion roadmap, Alchemy plans to incorporate HeyMint's capabilities to improve access across a variety of Ethereum Layer 2 networks, including Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, and Polygon. This cross-chain focus will further strengthen Alchemy's efforts to build user-friendly, scalable infrastructure for decentralized ecosystems.



What started as an educational project to help newcomers navigate the depths of web3, the @CuriousAddys NFT collection, has led us on an incredible journey helping collectors and creators alike leverage the powers of web3. (2/5)

This acquisition forms part of Alchemy's wider initiative to support developers across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Earlier in the year, the company also acquired Dexter Lab, a real-time data analytics provider for Solana. Additionally, it purchased Bware to boost its blockchain services in Europe, signaling a clear intention to diversify and strengthen its presence across the global Web3 space.

HeyMint's platform has already demonstrated substantial influence in driving early-stage Web3 adoption. With a user base that grew to over one million in just two years, its no-code minting pages have proven popular among both individual users and enterprise-level clients. The company's involvement in socially impactful campaigns, such as the 2023 NFT initiative with the Partnership for Central America and Mastercard, further underscores its versatile appeal.

Alchemy's purchase of HeyMint also contributes to the growing momentum in Web3 mergers and acquisitions. Improved regulatory clarity and favorable policy developments in the U.S. have encouraged more strategic investments within the sector. Recent notable deals include Robinhood's acquisition of WonderFi for $179 million and Ripple's $1.25 billion purchase of Hidden Road.

While data from PitchBook indicates a decline in the total number of venture capital deals, the overall funding volume has more than doubled year-over-year. This suggests that although fewer deals are taking place, investor focus has shifted toward larger, more strategic acquisitions aimed at strengthening technological capabilities.

In line with these trends, Alchemy's strategic acquisition strategy highlights its commitment to lowering barriers to blockchain adoption while simultaneously enhancing user experience. By consolidating key technologies and expanding support for developers and users alike, the company is positioning itself at the forefront of the Web3 evolution.

Ethereum price prediction is drawing a lot of attention right now. The market is shifting, and some big investors are quietly moving millions into a new XRP rival. That project, Remittix, has already raised over $15.3 million in its ICO.

If you want to understand where Ethereum and its investors are heading, and why Remittix is catching so much interest, keep reading. This article breaks down the latest moves, the Ethereum price prediction and the rise of Remittix as a strong contender.

Ethereum's price has shown strength, but the road ahead is uncertain. Analysts expect ETH to hover around key support levels like $2,500, but some warn of possible dips if the market turns bearish.

According to Glassnode and CoinMetrics data, Ethereum's activity is growing, with more users signaling interest in the network. Volume will be the key driver. But, without steady buying, ETH might struggle to break past its recent highs. Still, institutional money, especially inflows into Ethereum-focused ETFs, adds positive momentum.

Grayscale's Ethereum Trust recently saw a $45 million inflow and spot ETH ETFs reported strong net inflows, showing confidence among large investors. The Ethereum price prediction suggests cautious hope for a rally, but traders must stay alert to changing market conditions.

Ethereum whales are rumored to be quietly shifting funds into emerging assets that could offer bigger returns. With ETH facing resistance and regulatory uncertainties, these investors diversify to capture growth in other areas.

This trend is backed by data from Santiment and CryptoQuant, which show rising activity in smaller tokens linked to the Ethereum ecosystem. Traders want exposure to tokens that combine solid technology with real-world use cases and they want projects that can benefit from Ethereum's network effect.

Clearly, Ethereum investors need to be smart about their choices. The crypto market is volatile, and some projects will fail while others could surge dramatically. Many look for tokens that solve real-life problems, which is where new contenders like Remittix come into play, offering both innovative solutions and investor appeal.

Remittix, a payment-focused project, has captured the attention of Ethereum whales and smaller investors alike. Its ICO revenue recently passed $15.3 million, a clear sign that the market believes in its potential. The platform allows users to send crypto as fiat currency to bank accounts worldwide, which fills a big gap in the current crypto space.

Many Ethereum investors see Remittix as a next-generation rival to XRP. Its design hides blockchain complexity from users, letting receivers get money in their local currency without unnecessary fees or delays. With over 100 cryptocurrencies supported, Remittix aims to bridge crypto and traditional finance efficiently.

Experts note that Remittix offers staking rewards between 4% and 8% per year, making it attractive for holders who want passive income. Its native token, RTX, will launch on major exchanges soon, boosting liquidity and access.

Analysts hint that Ethereum whales are quietly moving millions into Remittix, hinting at strong confidence. This shift of capital highlights a growing interest in projects that bring real utility beyond just price speculation.

While Ethereum's price prediction points to cautious optimism, many investors are considering projects like Remittix. It offers practical solutions, growing adoption and strong backing from Ethereum whales. As the ICO crosses $15.3 million, the momentum behind Remittix only grows.

For those looking beyond Ethereum's current swings, Remittix presents a chance to get in early on a project designed to bridge crypto and fiat worlds. If you want to find a smarter investment that could outperform Ethereum, what are you waiting for? Remittix deserves a serious look.

A man was arrested Friday after being accused of kidnapping an Italian tourist and torturing him for weeks inside a Manhattan home in a bid to steal the alleged victim's bitcoin, according to officials, law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the investigation and a criminal complaint.

The victim was able to escape the home and run for help Friday morning, the law enforcement sources said. John Woeltz, 37, was taken into custody that same day and was arraigned Saturday on one count each of second-degree assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, court records show.

Law enforcement sources close to the investigation said Woeltz and the tourist, along with a third person, had been in business together for years. Police are still searching for the third business partner, who has not been publicly identified.

The sources said Woeltz and the other person have allegedly gotten violent with the victim in the past, but never to this extent. They described the relationship between the three as very complex, and said it appears the victim was often picked on by the two men.

An attorney for Woeltz declined to comment Saturday. A judge granted a request to hold Woeltz in custody during Saturday's arraignment. His next court date is Wednesday.

The tourist, a 28-year-old man visiting from Italy, met his alleged kidnapper on May 6, law enforcement sources said. That's when, they said, Woeltz took the younger man to a home he was renting in Nolita, a neighborhood in Manhattan.

According to a criminal complaint, Woeltz and an unidentified, “unapprehended male” kidnapped the victim, took his electronics and passport, and tortured him until he managed to escape weeks later.

The pair tried to get the tourist to give them the password to his bitcoin account so they could steal the electronic currency, and when he refused, they beat him, shocked him with electric wires and hit him in the head with a gun over the course of weeks, the complaint said.

Woeltz and the other man allegedly pointed a gun at the victim's head multiple times, dangled him over the ledge of the top flight of stairs in the home and threatened to kill him if he did not reveal his password, according to the complaint, which also alleged the pair threatened to have his family killed.

The tourist also told officials that the men tied his wrists and bound him to prevent him from moving, according to the complaint.

Law enforcement sources added that the men urinated on the victim and put an Apple AirTag around his neck to ensure he did not escape.

Upon his escape, the 28-year-old ran into a traffic agent who called police to the home on Prince Street. He told the agent he had been taken and held against his will and that he was repeatedly assaulted during his captivity, police said.

The alleged victim was taken to a hospital in stable condition, police said. When he approached officers Friday, he was covered in cuts and bruises, with marks on his wrists where he was bound, law enforcement sources said.

Law enforcement sources said Woeltz is a prominent crypto currency trader from Kentucky, estimated to be worth around $100 million. The victim has an estimated worth of $30 million, they said.

Woeltz had reportedly been renting out the Prince Street residence at a monthly rate of between $30,000 and $40,000, the sources said. An online listing for the home says it was last rented in March for $75,000.

Law enforcement sources said there were cases of alcohol throughout the six-story residence, as well as stripper poles in the basement.

Those sources said officers turned up multiple Polaroid pictures of the victim being tied up and tortured at the home. Investigators also reportedly recovered several torture items.

Inside the residence, investigators on Saturday found a gun, believed to be the same one used to torture the victim, law enforcement sources said.

Jennifer Crawford lives across the street from where the events unfolded Friday morning and saw Woeltz being arrested.

“I watched, like, the SWAT guys get out of the truck with their shields and everything and enter the building, and they were just starting to rope off the area and everyone's yelling. It looked like they were a little bit in a panic,” she told NBC News.

She said she was shocked when she started learning more of the allegations.

“I just stood and froze,” she said. “A lot does go on here in New York. You can imagine, I've seen a lot, but this is the most unusual thing I've seen in 30 years in this neighborhood. I mean, that's just beyond what you can even describe or imagine.”

Crawford said she couldn't imagine the motive of someone with so much wealth committing this type of crime.

“All that money in the world didn't do anything. It's not going to help him,” she said. “Just doesn't make sense, you know?”

On Saturday, hundreds of people passed by the townhome in Manhattan, some whispering about the details of the case. A few even took selfies in front of the home by the iron fence wrapped in police tape.

Police officials and investigators were in and out of the house Saturday, several standing guard in the front and recommending to those passing by to Google the home address to learn more.

A cryptocurrency investor from Kentucky allegedly held and tortured an Italian businessman in a luxury flat in Manhattan for over two weeks in a bid to steal his digital currency passwords, according to reports.

The businessman, 28, managed to escape the apartment on Prince Street in SoHo on Friday morning and ran to a police officer for help. He told police he had been held captive and tortured, quoting unnamed sources.

John Woeltz, 37, was arrested shortly afterwards. He is facing charges including kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and weapon possession.

Photos found at the scene reportedly showed the victim tied up with electrical wires. In one image, he appeared to be bound to a chair with a gun pointed at him, New York Post sources said.

The alleged abuse included being tasered while his feet were in water, pistol-whipped, forced to take cocaine, and threatened with an electric chainsaw. The Post said the man had a cut on his arm believed to have been caused by the chainsaw.

The flat was being rented for $30,000 to $40,000 a month, according to the report.

The police sources as saying the businessman had flown in from Italy on 6 May to meet Woeltz, with whom he had previous business dealings. Once inside the flat, Woeltz allegedly took his passport and tied him up.

Police found Polaroid pictures of the alleged torture and various items including broken glass, night vision goggles, a gun, a bulletproof vest and an Apple AirTag — which the victim said had been placed around his neck to track him in case he tried to escape.

The man told police he believed he was going to be killed on Friday, so he made his escape that morning.

Beatrice Folchi, 24, of Manhattan, was also arrested and charged with kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment.

Two other people linked to Woeltz were also being questioned by police, the Post said.

A photographer working nearby, Ciaran Tully, told the New York Post he saw a man in a robe being taken away in handcuffs. “This is definitely the strangest thing I've seen in my time here,” he said.

A local jewellery seller told the Post that the people renting the flat gave off a “weird vibe.” He said, “I knew there was something strange going on. I just assumed they were filming something.”

The NYPD's Emergency Service Unit searched the apartment for other possible victims but found none, according to the report.","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","cryptocurrency"

Editor's note: Este artículo está traducido al español.

The world's largest bitcoin conference will take place at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center this week, carrying new political significance due to prominent attendance from the Trump administration.

Vice President JD Vance, Trump's two eldest sons, and White House “crypto czar” David Sacks are all scheduled to appear.

At last year's conference in Nashville, Tenn., Trump championed bitcoin — a decentralized digital currency operating on blockchain technology — while criticizing what he considered regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. His remarks drew thunderous applause from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts.

Justin Doochin, head of events at the company that puts on the yearly conference, said Trump's policy on bitcoin has been “a lot more favorable” so far. Trump has reallocated seized bitcoin for a “strategic reserve,” installed friendly regulators and revoked Biden-era policy.

“That's what's getting everyone excited: him tweeting about it, him talking about it, him adding it to his campaign,” Doochin said. “Putting it on the forefront of U.S. policy is extremely bullish for the crypto community.”

Doochin said the event will have a strict policy on sticking to bitcoin, a technology that Elisa Cafferata, who's lobbied for blockchain legislation in Nevada, explained derives its value from its transparency and a cap on how many bitcoins can be created.

“Because it's harder and harder to create new ones, it's, by design, supposed to go up in value,” Cafferata said. “It was meant to hold value. It was meant to be a way to send money around the world without going through intermediaries like banks that charge you a transaction fee.”

With unprecedented government interest, the convention's industry day will feature programming exploring how bitcoin — alongside other emerging sectors like AI and space travel — intersects with public policy under the theme “Code and Country.”

Doochin noted that conference attendees have become far more politically engaged, a shift he traces back to 2023 when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, spoke at that year's convention.

Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency represents a dramatic reversal. In 2021, he dismissed bitcoin as a scam threatening the U.S. dollar.

Hilary Allen, a self-described “crypto critic” and professor of law at American University, said that “in the second administration, (Trump) realized that he could be the one profiting.”

Just days before his second inauguration, the Trump-connected firm World Liberty Financial launched a Trump “meme coin” — a purely speculative category of cryptocurrency that typically has no utility.

And while it wasn't announced until April, this one came with a catch: the top 220 owners get a private dinner with the president. Those who attended the dinner Thursday night spent around $148 million on the coins, according to USA Today.

“When you create most types of crypto, you are creating a digital asset out of thin air,” Allen said. “Any money you receive from them you can pocket. So it really is a way for people to give money for nothing to the Trump family should they so desire.”

Asked Thursday if the White House would release a list of those attending the dinner, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it wasn't a White House event and that Trump is attending on “his personal time.”

“The president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable,” she said later. “It's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency. This president was incredibly successful before giving it all up to serve our country.”

Las Vegas resident Ben Horowitz — half of the partnership behind venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the largest crypto investors in the world — said on a podcast last July with his business partner that “the future of technology” was at stake with the election.

Horowitz's partner, Marc Andreessen, said Trump's platform was a “blanket endorsement” of their industry: ending the “unlawful and un-American crypto crackdown,” defending the “right to mine bitcoin” and opposing a digital currency coming from the Federal Reserve.

The pair donated a combined $67 million to the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC, according to OpenSecrets, though the committee supported both Democratic and Republican candidates last year.

Just under half of all corporate spending in the 2024 election came from the crypto industry, left-leaning consumer rights group Public Citizen found.

Trump has followed through on that agenda Andreessen praised. At the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it's been “night and day” since Trump took office, Allen said

Now, the commission has a crypto task force designed to provide regulatory clarity, something the crypto industry maligned the Biden administration for lacking. But along with that, other regulators backed off their ongoing work.

“There were other things they lost on, but the fundamental issue of whether crypto assets were securities, the SEC just kept on winning” in court before Trump retook office, Allen said. “You get a leadership change at the SEC … and these lawsuits were just dropped, dropped, dropped.”

One of those companies that had its case dropped is Coinbase, a crypto exchange platform in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio which added former Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita to its advisory board in January. Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., also joined.

They're just two examples of what Allen described as a “revolving door” between government and industry lobbying. She also pointed to Summer Mersinger, who recently announced her move from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to CEO of a major Washington crypto trade association.

Despite the ongoing entanglement between crypto and the GOP, not all Democrats are against the new technology.

The Senate this month advanced industry-backed legislation around “stablecoins,” a type of cryptocurrency pegged to another asset, such as gold, or currency. The GENIUS Act, which got the support of 16 Democrats to get past the 60-vote Senate threshold for cloture, would provide some regulatory framework for the coins and create reserve requirements for issuers.

Both of Nevada's Democratic senators voted in favor, with a spokesperson for Sen. Jacky Rosen telling the Sun that “cryptocurrency is an emerging industry that is in need of regulation.”

“Sen. Rosen voted to advance bipartisan legislation to open the door for regulating cryptocurrency. This bill is not the only action Congress should take on crypto regulation, but it is an important step to protect consumers and support America's innovation,” the spokesperson wrote.

Allen doesn't see things the same way. She believes that the legislation only legitimizes a portion of the industry that's been fraught with abuse. World Liberty Financial, too, has its own stablecoin, other Democrats have worried.

“Other than fear of running afoul of the crypto industry's money cannon, I find it hard to see why Democrats are supporting this legislation,” she said. “The legislation essentially blesses stable coins, creating ... a greater market for them.”

Barry Silbert and Digital Currency Group face new legal action as creditors allege mismanagement, insider withdrawals, and fraudulent transfers in the wake of Genesis' collapse. A deep dive into the tangled saga behind crypto's long-running bankruptcy drama.

Barry Silbert – founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG) – is being sued again along with DCG and several of its DCG executives. We've written about this long-running saga quite a few times before. It is unreasonably complicated so here is a quick refresher before we unpack this latest lawsuit. Silbert founded, owned most of and ran DCG for a long time. DCG subsidiary Genesis ran in to solvency problems after the Terra-LUNA collapse in May 2022 as Genesis' counterparties failed to pay back loans from Genesis. The most prominent borrower that blew up and defaulted was Three Arrows Capital. Genesis, overall, had a lot of problems.

DCG owned Genesis and provided some sort of vague liquidity support that held off creditors for a while in 2022. But eventually Genesis filed for bankruptcy. This was linked to Gemini's Earn program freezing about a billion dollars (that was trapped in Genesis). A range of other entities had all kinds of problems too.

But DCG managed to retain control over Genesis' bankruptcy process through what is best described as Silbert and his lawyers outplaying the other participants. Barry Silbert worked in restructuring before founding DCG and, empirically, the man knows what he is doing. Of course being good and your job and being able to wave away billions in claims against an insolvent company you own are not quite the same thing. So this saga continues to roll on.

As a result of DCG exercising substantial control over Genesis even in bankruptcy the official creditors committee has been ""so so kind & gentle"" to DCG and Silbert. That behaviour led to the creation of a Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC) with the aim of ""Overseeing Litigation. Pursuing Accountability. Representing Creditors."" The LOC backers' theory was that while Silbert managed to retain control over Genesis that only meant he could stop Genesis from filing catastrophic lawsuits against DCG. There should still be other ways for aggrieved creditors to get their money back.

DCG owned Genesis. And then when Genesis blew up DCG provided support to Genesis. But – and this is key – DCG did not actually provide any cash to Genesis to fix the problems. It provided what are best described as smoke and mirrors. We can tell this did not work becaue, well, the bankruptcy case has been running for more than 2 years now.

The relationship between Genesis and DCG wasn't just one of parent and subsidiary — it was deeply enmeshed. DCG reportedly directed Genesis to make loans to other DCG-owned companies. On top of that, some DCG executives, including Silbert, held personal funds on Genesis' platform. These overlapping interests created a web of potential conflicts and cross-claims.

Now recall that DCG owned Genesis and managed to retain control through the bankruptcy. So if Genesis' main asset in bankruptcy is a claim on DCG and DCG can prevent Genesis suing to collect on that claim, then two things happen:

Exactly how much money DCG has to pay off Genesis is unclear. To be fair it is also still unclear quite how much money DCG owes Genesis. But we know for sure that if Genesis never tries to collect anything then creditors will get $0.

Silbert's plan was, pretty transparently, to find a way to keep sufficient control over Genesis that whatever assets remain at DCG, and in his personal holdings, are not pursued by Genesis. And, as far as the official creditor process is concerned, that has been largely successful. Enter the Genesis LOC.

This new filing makes essentially three claims. First it claims that Genesis was directed by DCG to enter into uneconomic-for-Genesis transactions to benefit DCG through benefiting other DCG portfolio companies. For example the LOC claims uncollateralized loans were extended by Genesis to DCG's mining subsidiaries at too-low rates. The flavour of this claim is that DCG deprived Genesis of value – approximately it stole from Genesis – and gave that value to other DCG subsidiaries. And so, the logic goes, Genesis' creditors are entitled to claim value from those other businesses.

As a standalone claim this is messy. If an executive mismanages a company the shareholders of that company do not normally have a claim on that executive's personal assets to cover the losses. Similarly investors in one VC-backed business that fails cannot just go and claim stakes in other companies backed by the same VC because the portfolio companies all did business together and had common investors.

But the LOC claims more than just something akin to ""normal"" mismanagement or a ""normal"" business failure. They claim two more sorts of things that change the balance.

They claim Silbert and associates withdrew personal funds from the Genesis platform even as they told external creditors everything was fine. That's a problem. We wrote about this component a few years ago on a separate blog pointing out that Genesis' own bankruptcy filings made clear Silbert's personal funds were withdrawn from Genesis at the height of the company's crisis.

It is not a ""normal"" business failure when management publicly assures creditors the company is solvent while they are pulling their own (large) deposits out the back. Whether that is fraud or some kind of criminal or civil violation is clearly a legal question. But it is not good and elevates this from ""So the business failed"" to ""Hmm, maybe management is liable for some of the losses.""

In that same separate blog post we cover how a combination of DCG and Genesis filings from 2022 and 2023 make clear the company was self-reporting as insolvent in the numerical sections of financial statements even while it was claiming in words that all was fine.

The standards, and one imagines the carefulness of proofreading, for private businesses like DCG and Genesis are lower than for publicly traded companies. But it is still a problem to report negative equity while claiming in words you are solvent. It is also a problem to take money out of a subsidiary in that operates in the financing business when that subsidiary cannot safely finance those payments. Specifically the LOC claims:

And the LOC has more to say. They provide details of loans Genesis made at DCG's direction to Foundry in strange circumstances:

Genesis, a company in the business of making loans, was instructed to make uncollateralized loans to a sibling mining business so that other business could go ahead and make collateralized loans. The LOC continues:

If Genesis made market-rate loans to Foundry and then Foundry made some sort of mining-equipment-collateralized loans this might all be fine. If Genesis made direct loans against that same collateral it might all be fine. But this is a pretty clear case of Genesis handing value to Foundry at DCG's direction.

If DCG owned the equity in all of these businesses, and Silbert owned most of the equity in DCG, what is the problem here? Shareholders direct company management and company management is answerable to the shareholders.

Or rather that is most of the story. Management has some duty to take care of creditors too. And once the business fails, or is near failing, the company may have stronger liabilities to the creditors than the shareholders.

Put simply: if DCG directed Genesis to transfer so much value to Foundry that Genesis immediately exploded then Genesis' creditors would clearly have a strong claim on Foundry's assets. They'd also have a strong claim against whoever at DCG directed that form of theft. Silbert could not simply, for example, direct Genesis to give all client funds to Foundry, put Genesis into insolvency, and then keep the asset through DCG's equity ownership of Foundry. There are myriad steps one can take in insolvency proceedings to undo that sort of transaction and get the value back to credtiors.

Genesis' creditors are owed money. And they appear to have plausible claims that DCG misappropriated at least some Genesis assets by transferring them to DCG's shareholders in a personal capacity and to sibling DCG portfolio companies via uneconomic deals.

The general principles at work here concern ""fraudulent transfers"" and ""trading while insolvent.""  Those are fancy insolvency-related ways of describing transactions that can be retroactively voided because they are ""unfair."" Fraudulent transfers, roughly, are transactions that were unreasonable and damaged the insolvent entity badly enough that the court will undo them. And trading while insolvent refers to the potential personal liability managers of a business take on when they enter into contracts on behalf of a company they already know is walking dead.

Silbert has lots of money. Some DCG portfolio companies are still around and earning money. The LOC clearly wants some of that money. Do they want a trial and a judgement? Do they want a settlement? They want money. And this case certainly makes Silbert and DCG management look bad. But Genesis, and DCG's portfolio as a whole, has been insolvent since the Terra ecosystem blew up 3 years ago. If Silbert and DCG can weasel out of this one, or settle for a small sum, maybe they can finally declare victory and avoid paying back most of the money.

Some of the dealings with other web3 companies looked bad – but then DCG's counterparties also looked bad. Whether an aggrieved Gemini or similar would get sympathy was never really clear. But with Silbert's personal financial dealing with Genesis finally reaching court this time does look different. Mismanagement is given a wide berth in insolvency in the US. But yanking tens or hundreds of millions of dollars from a company you manage that soon goes under? Seems a lot more likely Barry Silbert is finally going to need to pay out now.

Industry-backed frameworks for crypto token regulation, intended to foster innovation, may inadvertently create loopholes that could shield perpetrators of securities fraud, raising concerns about investor protection and market integrity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Faith meets fintech: How churches are betting on AI and crypto","https://www.businessinsider.com/church-technology-ai-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-2025-5","Sun, 25 May 2025 09:40:00 GMT","

Don't have cash for the offering plate at church on Sunday? Just use bitcoin.

Weaving bitcoin into the same conversation as Sunday service might seem odd, but it's now a reality for some churches in the United States, where church leaders are embracing modern technology.

Last month, Pushpay, a financial services company for churches, published the 2025 State of Church Tech report. It surveyed over 1,700 church leaders across the United States from ministries of different sizes, denominations, and budgets.

""The most tech-forward churches are starting to think of tech not just as operational or administrative. They see it as part of the mission,"" Gruia Pitigoi-Aron, PushPay's chief product officer, told Business Insider.

Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and other fields have reshaped the global landscape, making such advancements impossible for industries to ignore. Churches are no different.

The report said 45% of respondents now use artificial intelligence, an 80% jump from last year. Most church leaders use AI for communication-based tasks like writing content, editing, and generating graphic designs. However, 18% said they used it to develop sermons.

Earlier this month, the newly elected Pope Leo XIV discussed AI during his first address to the College of Cardinals, saying it posed ""new challenges.""

""In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labor,"" the first US-born pope said.

Pitigoi-Aron said church leaders who leverage technology don't want to replace people or the human aspects of worship. Rather, it's meant to amplify their mission and create community.

Livestreaming also proved to be a popular tech tool for church leaders during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the report. Nearly 90% of surveyed church leaders said they live-streamed worship services or events.

""Paul the Apostle took ships from place to place and told people about Jesus, right? Now you're livestreaming,"" Pitigoi-Aron said.

Technology has also influenced how the church navigates donations.

""Online giving continues to be the most popular digital solution among all churches — not surprising, considering 70% of leaders believe technology has increased generosity in their church. That proven impact is likely responsible for the fast-growing interest in accepting cryptocurrency and stock donations,"" the report said.

Only 10% of surveyed church leaders said they're leveraging cryptocurrency, but 39% said it will become ""strategically important to their church in the next two to three years."" That's a 44% increase from 2024, but 62% of respondents said they ""don't know"" or ""need to learn more"" about the benefits of cryptocurrency.

Pitigoi-Aron said non-traditional giving, like stocks and cryptocurrency, could be a ""huge opportunity"" for churches. In the digital age, where nearly everything is one click away, accepting new platforms can lower the barrier of entry for some congregants hoping to donate and connect.

Similarly, some church leaders are now using QR codes.

""Tangentially, QR codes are being utilized more than ever, often to drive community members and streaming viewers to next steps via a simple scan or tap,"" the report said.

The increasing focus on modern technology isn't just talk for church leaders. Over half said they increased their tech budgets over the last two years.

Editor's note: Este artículo está traducido al español.

The world's largest bitcoin conference will take place at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center this week, carrying new political significance due to prominent attendance from the Trump administration.

Vice President JD Vance, Trump's two eldest sons, and White House “crypto czar” David Sacks are all scheduled to appear.

At last year's conference in Nashville, Tenn., Trump championed bitcoin — a decentralized digital currency operating on blockchain technology — while criticizing what he considered regulatory overreach under the Biden administration. His remarks drew thunderous applause from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts.

Justin Doochin, head of events at the company that puts on the yearly conference, said Trump's policy on bitcoin has been “a lot more favorable” so far. Trump has reallocated seized bitcoin for a “strategic reserve,” installed friendly regulators and revoked Biden-era policy.

“That's what's getting everyone excited: him tweeting about it, him talking about it, him adding it to his campaign,” Doochin said. “Putting it on the forefront of U.S. policy is extremely bullish for the crypto community.”

Doochin said the event will have a strict policy on sticking to bitcoin, a technology that Elisa Cafferata, who's lobbied for blockchain legislation in Nevada, explained derives its value from its transparency and a cap on how many bitcoins can be created.

“Because it's harder and harder to create new ones, it's, by design, supposed to go up in value,” Cafferata said. “It was meant to hold value. It was meant to be a way to send money around the world without going through intermediaries like banks that charge you a transaction fee.”

With unprecedented government interest, the convention's industry day will feature programming exploring how bitcoin — alongside other emerging sectors like AI and space travel — intersects with public policy under the theme “Code and Country.”

Doochin noted that conference attendees have become far more politically engaged, a shift he traces back to 2023 when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, spoke at that year's convention.

Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency represents a dramatic reversal. In 2021, he dismissed bitcoin as a scam threatening the U.S. dollar.

Hilary Allen, a self-described “crypto critic” and professor of law at American University, said that “in the second administration, (Trump) realized that he could be the one profiting.”

Just days before his second inauguration, the Trump-connected firm World Liberty Financial launched a Trump “meme coin” — a purely speculative category of cryptocurrency that typically has no utility.

And while it wasn't announced until April, this one came with a catch: the top 220 owners get a private dinner with the president. Those who attended the dinner Thursday night spent around $148 million on the coins, according to USA Today.

“When you create most types of crypto, you are creating a digital asset out of thin air,” Allen said. “Any money you receive from them you can pocket. So it really is a way for people to give money for nothing to the Trump family should they so desire.”

Asked Thursday if the White House would release a list of those attending the dinner, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it wasn't a White House event and that Trump is attending on “his personal time.”

“The president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws that are applicable,” she said later. “It's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency. This president was incredibly successful before giving it all up to serve our country.”

Las Vegas resident Ben Horowitz — half of the partnership behind venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the largest crypto investors in the world — said on a podcast last July with his business partner that “the future of technology” was at stake with the election.

Horowitz's partner, Marc Andreessen, said Trump's platform was a “blanket endorsement” of their industry: ending the “unlawful and un-American crypto crackdown,” defending the “right to mine bitcoin” and opposing a digital currency coming from the Federal Reserve.

The pair donated a combined $67 million to the pro-crypto Fairshake PAC, according to OpenSecrets, though the committee supported both Democratic and Republican candidates last year.

Just under half of all corporate spending in the 2024 election came from the crypto industry, left-leaning consumer rights group Public Citizen found.

Trump has followed through on that agenda Andreessen praised. At the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it's been “night and day” since Trump took office, Allen said

Now, the commission has a crypto task force designed to provide regulatory clarity, something the crypto industry maligned the Biden administration for lacking. But along with that, other regulators backed off their ongoing work.

“There were other things they lost on, but the fundamental issue of whether crypto assets were securities, the SEC just kept on winning” in court before Trump retook office, Allen said. “You get a leadership change at the SEC … and these lawsuits were just dropped, dropped, dropped.”

One of those companies that had its case dropped is Coinbase, a crypto exchange platform in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio which added former Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita to its advisory board in January. Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., also joined.

They're just two examples of what Allen described as a “revolving door” between government and industry lobbying. She also pointed to Summer Mersinger, who recently announced her move from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to CEO of a major Washington crypto trade association.

Despite the ongoing entanglement between crypto and the GOP, not all Democrats are against the new technology.

The Senate this month advanced industry-backed legislation around “stablecoins,” a type of cryptocurrency pegged to another asset, such as gold, or currency. The GENIUS Act, which got the support of 16 Democrats to get past the 60-vote Senate threshold for cloture, would provide some regulatory framework for the coins and create reserve requirements for issuers.

Both of Nevada's Democratic senators voted in favor, with a spokesperson for Sen. Jacky Rosen telling the Sun that “cryptocurrency is an emerging industry that is in need of regulation.”

“Sen. Rosen voted to advance bipartisan legislation to open the door for regulating cryptocurrency. This bill is not the only action Congress should take on crypto regulation, but it is an important step to protect consumers and support America's innovation,” the spokesperson wrote.

Allen doesn't see things the same way. She believes that the legislation only legitimizes a portion of the industry that's been fraught with abuse. World Liberty Financial, too, has its own stablecoin, other Democrats have worried.

“Other than fear of running afoul of the crypto industry's money cannon, I find it hard to see why Democrats are supporting this legislation,” she said. “The legislation essentially blesses stable coins, creating ... a greater market for them.”

The cryptocurrency market faces renewed pressure as Solana (SOL) dropped below its stable $177 trading range, reflecting broader concerns about global economic stability.

The correction coincides with increasing geopolitical tensions that have rattled financial markets worldwide, forcing investors to reassess risk exposure across digital assets. 

Despite the pullback, Solana's ecosystem continues to expand with R3's strategic pivot to integrate with its blockchain, signaling growing institutional interest in the platform's capabilities for tokenizing real-world assets.

Bitcoin's recent pullback has established strong volume-based resistance near $108,300, with support forming in the $106,700-$107,000 zone.

The correction accelerated with a notable price surge from $107,373 to $107,671 between 13:06-13:36, followed by a sharp reversal.

Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin is now trading within a compression zone, trapped between two major fair value gaps that will determine the upcoming market direction. 

If bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, price could push toward resistance beyond $112K, while a break below $107,000 might test liquidity around $106K.

Global economic tensions are weighing heavily on cryptocurrency markets as XRP experiences a significant correction amid heavy selling pressure. 

The recent announcement of potential 50% tariffs on European Union imports by the US government has triggered widespread market uncertainty, with XRP falling alongside most major cryptocurrencies despite Bitcoin recently reaching new all-time highs. 

Technical analysts point to critical support at the $2.25-$2.26 range, with market watchers warning that a break below this level could trigger deeper corrections toward the $1.55-$1.90 zone. 

Meanwhile, institutional interest remains strong with Volatility Shares launching an XRP futures ETF and leveraged ETF inflows surging despite the price dip, suggesting Wall Street continues accumulating positions during market weakness.

What happens when retail logs off from crypto and Wall Street tunes in? Looking at bitcoin's BTC$107,289.09 recent all-time-high, one would say it feels bullish and the industry is maturing. 

That might as well be the case, but we might not be there yet. So before we floor our Lambos, let's look under the hood. 

First things first, retail investors have basically ghosted this rally. A quick search on Google Trends using the keyword ""bitcoin"" shows that the surge that was seen back in 2021's bull market is non-existent. Back then, everyone and their grandmothers were Googling bitcoin, aping into altcoins and flooding the social media with rocket emojis. In 2025? It's a ghost town in retail-land. 

There was a blip of high retail interest surrounding the U.S. presidential election, when a short-lived memecoin mania took over retail sentiment. However, that surge is long gone, as memecoin prices tanked swiftly, even as bitcoin hit an all-time high this week, ripping past $111,000. 

""Early in this cycle, memecoins became a concentration of risky retail-driven trading with related trading peaking in January,"" said Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial. ""However, since then, there has been a virtual wash-out of interest and memecoin trading activity,"" which shows ""the tepid risk appetite in crypto at the moment,"" FRNT added. 

Translation: ""Wen Lambo"" crowd got burned, and they aren't rushing back into the race track en masse anytime soon. 

On the topic of risk appetite, let's go back to the car analogy. 

During the 2021 bull market, people bought unreliable performance cars, stripped out the brakes and seatbelts to go faster than ever before, and did not care that there might be engine blowouts. As long as there was a promise of reaching the moon, bullish vibes were all that mattered. 

Now? After losing tremendous amounts of money on those unsustainable go-fast cars for years, traders are driving Toyota Corollas—sensible sedans that are slow but steady and still on the road.

That risk-off sentiment is also evident from the funding rates, according to FRNT's analysis of BTC perp rates—a measure of how much traders are willing to pay to maintain their long positions. When bitcoin reached a record high of around $42,000 in January 2021, the perp rate was about blistering 185%. Today, at bitcoin near $110,000, the rate is near 20% on crypto options exchange Deribit, meaning the risk appetite isn't completely gone but nowhere near the 2021 frenzy. 

A third point to add is the high number of short positions in the market. 

As CoinDesk's Oliver Knight reported this week, the bitcoin long/short ratio is at its lowest point since the crypto winter in September 2022. This implies that the majority of the traders aren't completely buying into this recent positive momentum and betting on bitcoin moving lower as a hedge for the new bullish rally. 

The impact of such positioning was clear on Friday, when bitcoin swiftly crashed from near $111,000 to $108,000 in a matter of minutes and then bounced right back up to $109,000. The anxiety of a swift volatility is real. 

So in a car-themed analogy, the drivers (in this case, investors) are still taking out their super-modified, unreliable sports cars for a weekend drive on the track. Still, they also have their Corollas following along. Just in case the engine blows on their go-fast cars. 

Given the current macro-risk, it's not entirely surprising that investors are on their toes and risk-averse. But this might just be exactly what your mechanic at the shop prescribed. In fact, this might be an indicator of a sustainable rally in the long term. 

""Periods of low leverage and risk appetite in crypto have often preceded further sustainable gains,"" according to FRNT. 

""BTC appears to be in such a phase, set against a backdrop of numerous bullish catalysts and narratives,"" the firm added. 

The bottom line is that the retail Lambos might have been towed away, but big money is stepping in with their everlasting Toyotas. This might start a slow but steady race to the moon, not just a reckless joyride.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","What's the HYPE about? Hyperliquid's 'Solana' moment eyes 240% gains","https://cointelegraph.com/news/whats-the-hype-about-hyperliquid-solana-moment-gains","Sun, 25 May 2025 11:17:08 GMT","

 HYPE is echoing Solana's 2021 breakout pattern, with technicals pointing to a potential 240% rally by July. 

Key takeaways:

HYPE is mirroring Solana's 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana's (SOL) early 2021 breakout—one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 

The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line at around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

Fast forward to May 2025, HYPE's daily chart is showing the same bullish structure following its  270% rebound from $10 lows in April, aligning with its 0.0 Fibonacci retracement line.

On May 23, HYPE broke above its 1.0 Fibonacci retracement level (~$35.88), echoing the early stages of SOL's explosive run in 2021.

Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) for HYPE has entered deeply overbought territory (above 84), which, while suggesting caution in the short term, also underscores the strength of the current momentum, much like Solana's RSI profile during its 2021 breakout.

If HYPE continues to follow this fractal, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level near $51.68 appears to be the next logical target. Beyond that, the 4.618 level at around $128 could mark the peak of this potential rally, a 240% move from its recent breakout zone near $35.

Popular analyst and commentator Ansem highlights that Hyperliquid's vision is very similar to what Solana and FTX aimed to build during their early partnership: a high-performance, low-cost crypto trading experience.

He argues that, unlike FTX's centralized architecture, Hyperliquid is fully onchain.

Nearly 97% of all trading revenue goes directly back to HYPE tokenholders, Ansem noted, adding that such fundamentals will assist the Hyperliquid token to reach “all-time highs soon.”

Psychologically, traders are often drawn to familiar and previously successful patterns. 

In 2017, Ether (ETH) mirrored Bitcoin's (BTC) 2013 arc almost identically, from the parabolic blow-off top to the retracement and range-bound recovery phase.

When traders recognize that HYPE could be repeating Solana's 2021 trajectory visually and fundamentally, it may reinforce bullish conviction and draw in speculators hoping to catch the next “Solana” moment.

 A crypto investor in Manhattan is accused of holding an Italian man captive for weeks, allegedly torturing him for access to Bitcoin wallet credentials. 

A Manhattan crypto investor is facing serious charges after allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian man in a disturbing bid to extract access to digital assets.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.

According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.

The attackers are said to have stolen the man's passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

The victim described being beaten, shocked with electricity, assaulted with a firearm and even dangled from the upper floors of the five-story building.

He also told police that Woeltz used a saw to cut his leg and forced him to smoke crack cocaine. Threats were also reportedly made against his family.

Photographic evidence found inside the property, including Polaroids, appears to support claims of sustained abuse. The victim managed to escape on Friday and alert authorities, leading to Woeltz's arrest.

Woeltz was charged with four felony counts, including kidnapping for ransom, and entered a plea of not guilty. Judge Eric Schumacher ordered him to be held without bail. He is expected back in court on May 28.

A 24-year-old woman was also taken into custody on Friday in connection with the incident. However, she was seen walking freely in New York the next day, and no charges against her were found in the court's online database.

Authorities have yet to clarify the relationship between the suspect and the victim or whether any cryptocurrency was ultimately stolen.

Executives and investors in the crypto industry are increasingly seeking personal security services as kidnapping and ransom cases surge, especially in France.

On May 18, Amsterdam-based private firm Infinite Risks International reported a rise in requests for bodyguards and long-term protection contracts from high-profile figures in the space.

French authorities have responded by introducing enhanced protections for crypto entrepreneurs and their families, including security briefings and priority access to police assistance.

This comes amid a recent surge in kidnappings and ransom attempts. David Balland, the co-founder of hardware wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped in January 2025 and held for ransom for several days before being rescued by French police.

In May 2024, the father of an unnamed crypto entrepreneur was freed from a ransom attempt after French law enforcement officials raided the location in a Paris suburb where the individual was being held hostage by organized criminals.

 Cathie Wood says crypto ETFs will not “lose a lot of their luster” and will stay around for those who just “wanna push a button.” 

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy, regardless of how widespread crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade.

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.

“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don't think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:

Bitbo data suggests that there are around 200 million active Bitcoin (BTC) wallets worldwide. Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.

Since spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US in January 2024, approximately $44.49 billion in inflows have been recorded, according to Farside data. Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.

Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise's application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.

However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). 

“So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.

Wood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump's memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.

“Institutions and you're saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said. Just days after its launch on Jan. 17, TRUMP slid around 50% after the president made no crypto-related “day one” executive orders.

“I mean, that might scare them,” Wood said. Her comments came in response to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reiterating the point that Bitcoin is “so easy” to explain to a “boomer or adviser” as being digital gold, but other cryptocurrencies “are tougher.”

Wood said she is still finalizing her Solana price target and will share it once her research is complete.

In April, ARK raised its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, primarily driven by institutional investors and Bitcoin's increasing acceptance as “digital gold.”

 Australian Senator Gerard Rennick criticized Bitcoin, saying ""you can't eat Bitcoin."" A Bitcoiner replied, asking if he feels the same about the internet. 

Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has drawn criticism from the Bitcoin community following his remarks referring to Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme and questioning the asset's value because it can't be eaten.

“You can't eat Bitcoin,” Rennick said in a May 23 X post, responding to an X user who questioned his stance after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.

“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it's a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.

“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.”

Bitcoiners across the world were quick to respond to Rennick's comments. The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) said Rennick's remarks about “Bitcoin reveal a deep misunderstanding.” The ABIB added:

Unchained podcast host Laura Shin said, “You also can't eat the internet, so do you oppose that too?” Bitcoin Marathon team lead Jimmy Kostro said, “This is definitely going to age well. Please enlighten us with more of your deep and nuanced understanding of Bitcoin.”

Rennick responded to the criticism and said he doesn't “need to explain anything.”

“It's pathetic how the Bitcoin community needs reassurance from a politician - the very people they claim they want to be free from,” Rennick said.

The Bitcoin community has frequently spoken out when prominent individuals have expressed anti-Bitcoin views.

Only a few weeks ago, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs experienced backlash from the Bitcoin community after her decision to veto a bill that would have allowed the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves.

Casa co-founder and cypherpunk Jameson Lopp said, “This will age poorly.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.” Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon said, “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.”

The Bitcoin community also pushed back when the US government decided to transfer $1.9 billion of Bitcoin to Coinbase in December 2024.

If there's one thing that turns people off from adopting new tech, it's being forced to look silly and feel uncomfortable for extended lengths of time. It was always the Achilles' heel for 3D in the past, and it remains the primary hurdle for VR headsets and goofy-looking smart glasses.

But there's a new wave of 3D coming. Laptops, tablets, and even computer monitors have started embracing a new form of 3D technology that solves this problem entirely, without giving up just how compelling 3D can look. I've used the latest iteration of the technology and spoke with the creators—this might finally be the version of 3D that sticks.

I was skeptical when I first saw this next generation of 3D technology. Interest in 3D comes in waves. It led Avatar to become the highest-grossing film of all time. Five years later, it became the butt of a joke. But this new wave of 3D products isn't just a rehash of past failed attempts. There's a new technology bringing this trend to life, and it's what makes this new era of 3D so compelling.

The creators of this technology have been watching the momentum build. “Today, we're at hopefully the inflection point,” says David Fattal, cofounder and chief technology officer of Leia Inc. Founded as a spinoff of HP Labs over a decade ago, the company has been responsible for nearly all of the 3D implementations in gadgets over the last several years. That includes its first project, the failed Red Hydrogen One smartphone in 2018, as well as its own hardware projects like the Lume Pad 2 Android tablet in 2023.

When I first saw the Acer SpatialLabs gaming monitors a few years ago (powered by Leia's tech), I knew the glasses-free experience had a certain magic to it. Despite my initial doubts, I was impressed by the strength of the 3D effect and the large “sweet spot.” Here I am today, with a full-fledged 3D monitor on my desk, the Samsung Odyssey 3D: It finally feels like 3D screens are coming to fruition.

Regardless of the device, every system that integrates Leia's solution uses a combination of eye-tracking cameras and lenticular lenses to create the feeling of 3D. This is combined with a switchable optical layer in front of the display, allowing you to switch between 3D and 2D. It works really well, partly because the monitor is stationary—Leia uses AI to predict your movements ahead of time, to avoid breaking the effect.

“We have a history of where your face has been in the past few seconds before the current moment,” Fattal says. “Then we use AI to predict where you're going to be in the future. There are only that many movements your face is doing, since your facial landmarks are correlated. If you turn your head, your eyes are supposed to follow in a certain way, and so on.”

The result feels magical. Like trying on a VR headset for the first time, seeing the 3D effect in full force without glasses feels significant, especially when matched with the right content.

You might wonder why gaming monitors and gaming laptops are becoming the go-to products for bringing 3D technology to the world, instead of TVs. Acer has been adding support for 3D games for years now, and it shows how much progress is possible on that front. Lenovo is even launching a brand-new gaming laptop, the Legion 9i, that offers an option to upgrade to a 3D screen as one of its premium features. Modern games are inherently 3D, making them a natural place to apply the 3D effect. But there's more to this trend.

“We feel like this is the start of the next big thing.” That's what David You, head of product marketing for monitors at Samsung, tells me when I asked how it felt to launch the company's first 3D gaming monitor. “It reminds me of when Samsung first launched its 49-inch ultrawide monitors a couple of years ago. Everyone said, ‘Do we really need this?' Now everyone has one on their desk.”

We've seen a vast expansion in gaming monitor technology over the past five years, successfully introducing adventurous screen sizes, aspect ratios, and display technology. There's something for everyone, and that variability is one big reason why gaming monitors are the perfect place to start getting this technology in people's faces.

Samsung says it performed an internal survey among what it calls its “hardcore gaming” demographic to find out what they wanted in a next-generation gaming display. This demographic is marked by a willingness to pay thousands for the latest PC gaming gear. Sixty-two percent said they expected the next generation to include advanced immersion—the perfect place to test the waters with 3D tech.

“As we're looking at the demographic, or just the overall consumer base for monitors, especially when you're talking about premium monitors over $1,000, the overwhelming majority is spending it on gaming,” You says. That's important because these first 3D gaming monitors don't come cheap. Despite the surprisingly limited game support at launch, the Samsung Odyssey 3D costs a cool $2,000.

“We're in that early adopter stage, right? The sticker price is a little bit of a shock to most consumers,” he says. “But we feel like once we get people into the 3D ecosystem, we'll get more game studios and developers brought into it because they see the total accessible market increasing.""

When it comes down to it, gamers are willing to spend more on an immersive experience, and that's going to buy time for the rest of the 3D ecosystem to catch up.

As You notes, even the Odyssey 3D is “so much more than just a 3D gaming monitor.” Whether it's YouTube, Zoom, or even just full-screen photos, the display can convert 2D into 3D using machine-learning algorithms, adding an artificial layer of depth that wasn't previously there. While the effect is not as convincing as in games, and DRM limitations restrict the content, it's an impressive tech demo nonetheless. More than that, AI is enabling 3D to overcome the need for tailor-made 3D content, another one of the main problems with 3D tech in the past. It's planting the seeds for broader uses that a more mainstream audience can benefit from.

Fattal says gaming is his second-favorite use case for 3D. “3D has that power to convey the human connection a lot better than on a flat screen,” he says, explaining that taking 3D photos and videos of his kids was what made him truly believe in the power of 3D. His dream is a world in which all videos can be taken and experienced in 3D. “Our goal is to end up completely standard on all devices, but especially on cell phones, so that people can chat and take pictures and videos, and share on social media—and all of that should be in 3D.”

It's an ambitious aspiration, and one echoed by Silicon Valley titans. Apple and Google have been touting spatial photos and videos with their respective mixed-reality ecosystems, where you'll be able to experience memories with depth. Google also recently showed off Google Beam—a way to convert people in video calls to appear more 3D and lifelike for a more personal touch.

The Apple Vision Pro could never exist without gamers willing to try out the early versions of VR, even with the severe lack of game libraries and uncomfortable headsets. There have always been other use cases for VR, but gaming has always been the main draw. It's too early to say whether this new era of 3D will have more success going beyond gaming than VR has.

Don't expect 3D TVs to make a comeback anytime soon—the current implementation makes it so that the 3D tech only works for one person. But for now, companies like Samsung have much brighter hopes for the proliferation of 3D, promising to “triple down” on its 3D monitor lineup in the next year or two. That's a serious vote of confidence.

There is nothing inherently wrong with the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung's ultra-thin Android phone. By that, I mean the Edge has a stunning display, excellent performance, and nice cameras. The software experience is rich in features, and it'll get 7 years of updates. I'm not going to delve deep into many of these specs because much of it remains the same as the Galaxy S25 series, which I reviewed early this year.

But it's impossible to review this smartphone without looking at the full picture, and what the $1,100 asking price can get you these days. The S25 Edge's pitch is that it's a supremely thin and lightweight phone with a big screen—hardly the first time a company has attempted this feat. But it makes a crucial sacrifice to get there, one that I think most people will find baffling.

At 5.8 mm thick, it's 2 mm thinner than the iPhone 16 Plus and weighs 36 grams less, despite both screens sitting at 6.7 inches. Compared to Samsung's own Galaxy S25+, which shares the same screen size, the Edge is 1.5 mm thinner and 30 grams lighter. Those are some real savings, and it's hard not to feel impressed when you first pick up the phone. Such a big phone with such a light weight—it feels strange, and perhaps surprisingly, not cheap.

While I appreciate the lighter package, my fingers seem to want a little more substance to hold onto. I have large hands, so the edges of this phone feel a little too thin, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels a little more natural. One thing is for sure: If you frequently put a case on your phone for protection, the S25 Edge will feel even thinner. That's because you expect a case to make your phone feel bulky, but the few cases for the Edge I've tried oddly emphasize its thinness.

I need to point out that while 5.8 millimeters is impressively thin, Samsung isn't shattering any records here. Nearly a decade ago, Motorola made the 5.2 mm Moto Z phone. The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to be roughly 5.5 mm. Even earlier this year, I saw Tecno's 5.75 mm concept phone, which stuffed a massive 5,000-mAh battery inside.

That last part is the problem with the Edge: It has a paltry 3,900-mAh battery capacity. That's the smallest of the Galaxy S25 series, 100 mAh smaller than the compact Galaxy S25. Samsung has made some smart optimizations to maximize the battery life of this small cell, but there's only so much it can do. The Galaxy S25 Edge's battery life is not good enough for a $1,100 phone.

Over the last week, I've been traveling with the Edge to cover Google I/O, and I've had to remember to charge it in the afternoon on most days. When I was away from a charger, I consciously decided to avoid using the phone so as not to drain the battery. I've often only had 4 hours of screen-on time by the end of the day before the device hits 15 percent. Mind you, with light to average use, this handset can last just about a day. Then again, if your needs are light, you hardly need to spend $1,100 to get a great phone.

In my 10 years of reviewing phones, I've frequently heard grumbles from the people around me when companies introduce thinner phones with smaller batteries. I have also heard complaints that phones are getting too big. The S25 Edge is still big—folks with smaller paws than me will still find it hard to reach the top of the screen—but the bigger size doesn't bring the benefit of a bigger battery. It begs the question, who is this for?

If you've bemoaned the same things, the clear winner for you is a folding flip phone. Devices like the Motorola Razr Ultra and the Galaxy Z Flip6 will match, if not offer slightly better battery life than the Edge, but you can fold them up and stow them in a pocket or purse even more nicely. No need to sacrifice screen size. Or just get the nice and compact Galaxy S25, which will last a smidge longer than the Edge.

Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 Edge as a phone for power users who want many of the capabilities of the Galaxy S25 Ultra without the massive screen and weight. But the Edge has more compromises than just having the worst battery life: it charges more slowly, there's no S Pen stylus, and there's no telephoto zoom camera. It does have a few perks over the cheaper S25 and S25+, though, such as the ability to capture 4K video at 120 frames per second.

The results from the 200-MP primary camera and 12-MP ultrawide cameras are sharp and colorful. You won't find too much to complain about. However, I kept trying to zoom in on a lot of shots, and while the 2x digital zoom has decent quality, things deteriorate quite quickly at further zoom options. It's rare to find a $1,000+ smartphone today without a 3x or 5x optical zoom camera, and it's sorely missed here.

I can't imagine many smartphone shutterbugs being happy with this (I'm not). It's not just about taking pretty photos! You'll have a worse time trying to get a nice shot of your kid on a soccer pitch or receiving their diploma due to the missing zoom lens.

More annoying is the fact that this phone rocks a lot on a table due to the camera bump. You might say it's the same with most phones these days (except Google Pixel phones, where the long camera bar keeps it stable), but even with a case, the Edge won't stop rocking because case-makers want to maintain as much of that thinness as possible.

My other concern was thermal performance, but this didn't turn out to be a big deal. A smaller phone means you likely won't have the same kind of cooling, right? Well, Samsung says the vapor chamber that dissipates heat is thinner but broader, and after an hour in Zenless Zone Zero, I didn't notice any abnormal thermal throttling on the phone. (My benchmark scores also turned out higher than the S25 Ultra.)

It boils down to what you're looking for in a phone, and I recommend heading to a retail store near you to get a feel for the Edge before making a decision. You might find the extra few millimeters of the Ultra or S25+ are manageable if it means a day and a half of battery life. Not to mention, you can find the Galaxy S25 Ultra on sale these days for as little as $1,050, cheaper than the Edge.

The lackluster runtime may not worry you if you spend 99 percent of your day near an outlet. In my eyes, we shouldn't accept a phone with this kind of battery life today. Make a thin phone with a big battery. Or do something interesting, like a phone with a wooden back. Or bring back the 10x optical zoom camera from older Samsung phones. The Edge just doesn't live up to the hype.

It's nearly summer. The flowers are in full bloom, the birds are well north, and REI is kicking off its annual anniversary sale, the outdoor company's biggest sale of the year. This year's REI sale started May 16 and runs through Memorial Day, May 26. Many items are up to 30 percent off, but REI Co-op members save up to 20 percent on any full-price item and an extra 20 percent off any REI Outlet item. To get the discount, add the promo code ANNIV2025 at checkout.

Several other retailers have launched early Memorial Day sales, including Backcountry and Public Lands, plus some of our favorite smaller retailers like Sea to Summit and Zenbivy, along with many others you can find on Garage Grown Gear. We've highlighted some deals on gear we've loved over our years of testing. There's something for nearly all our favorite summer activities—tents, stoves, sleeping bags, and plenty of outdoor apparel. Be sure to look at our guides to outdoor gear, like the Best Day-Hiking Packs, Best Tents, Best Sleeping Bags, Best Backpacking Sleeping Pads, Best Rain Jackets, Best Backpacking Water Filters, Best Merino Wool, and Best Binoculars.

Updated Sunday, May 25, 2025: We've added a new section of water filter and stove deals, our favorite Sea to Summit sleeping bag, an Oru folding kayak, our favorite headlamp and other deals on camping/backpacking essentials.

Don't forget to check out our guide to the Best Day-Hiking Backpacks and the Best Travel Bags.

The Flash 22 is possibly the best-value day pack on the market, especially on sale. I was surprised by how comfortable this thing is, despite the lightweight straps and minimal padding. It carries loads up to 15 pounds without straining the shoulders, and the side stash pockets are fabulously large—big enough for a Nalgene bottle or rain jacket. The Flash 22 is made of 70-denier recycled ripstop nylon, which is on the lighter side, but mine has held up well, even coming through some rough canyon hikes in Utah without any more than mud stains.

The ultralight cousin to the Flash 22, the Flash 18 lacks the hip belt, side stash pockets, and floating lid. What you're left with is a stripped-down, bare-bones pack that's great for traveling, since you can stuff it down to almost nothing, stash it in your carry-on, and have a nice backpack whenever you need it. Don't load it up with more than 8 pounds of gear though, and avoid anything with pointy bits, as there's no padding here.

One of our favorite day-hiking packs, This Mystery Rack pack was my introduction to wider shoulder straps, which provide more comfort without the bulk of extra padding. The result is a comfortable pack that's light (1 lb, 6 oz) and packable, making it a great extra pack when traveling. The side pockets are big enough for a Nalgene water bottle and the 25-L capacity carries everything you need for a day. It also fits under the seat of even small planes. This is a great little pack for hitting the trail or just walking around town.

Nemo Resolve

Our favorite day-hiking pack for the eco-conscious looking to travel light, Nemo's Resolve pack is 100 percent recycled, infinitely adjustable, and repairable, and once it's reached the end of its life, it can be sent back to Nemo for total recycling. The Resolve has a somewhat strange system of bungees and pull-tabs, instead of straps or webbing, but it's comfortable, sitting nice and high on your back. At 1 lb, 15 oz it's pretty light, considering all the hardware that it has on it.

Osprey has been making Talon packs since 2007. This model is the smaller cousin to the 33L version in our guide to the best day-hiking packs. The success of the Talon line is well deserved, the 100-denier high-tenacity nylon (Bluesign-approved) makes for a durable pack while remaining reasonably lightweight (2 pounds, 1 ounce for the S/M size). The dual zippered panel-loading design makes getting to your stuff a snap, and there are plenty of extra pockets inside and outside to help you stash all your gear.

These are the only shoes that have ever inspired me to write 1,000 words. They are really that good. Think of these as the barefoot answer to Chacos. Except where Chacos are like putting tractors on your feet, the Z-Trails flex and bend as you walk, giving your feet the freedom of movement you expect from a barefoot shoe. Despite being sandals, these have 10 mm of cushion, which is a good bit for a barefoot shoe, making the Z-Trail a good option for newcomers.

This is last year's version of my favorite Salomon X Ultra 5 hiking boots, which I just tested over the weekend in the Columbia River Gorge. Salomon makes our favorite hiking boots—the company offers impressive levels of protection and traction, while being lightweight and remarkably easy to take off and put on. I like how the heel grips so I don't smash my toes while going downhill, and it's so sticky that I can climb up rocks like an ant. —Adrienne So

I have worn the women's version of this shoe for years and years. Altra is the best running shoe if you want a shoe that has a barefoot feel (zero heel to toe drop, big toebox) but retains traction and protection against rocks and prickers. —Adrienne So

These are Altra's version of the Brooks Glycerin Max—a super-plush, comfy road running shoe. If you want a very cushioned shoe but are addicted to Altra's big toe box (no need to be embarrassed, I am too), these are the shoes to get. Also, don't forget to check out our guide to the Best Barefoot Shoes. —Adrienne So

Confused by the options? Check out our guides to the Best Sleeping Bags and the Best Backpacking Sleeping Pads.

REI Co-op's Magma 15 is our favorite bag for shoulder-season trips when the temps might drop more than expected. It has an excellent draft collar that's very good at keeping out the chill. The outside is a 15-denier nylon ripstop (Bluesign-approved, with a non-fluorinated DWR coating to keep moisture at bay). Baffles are variably spaced and not stitched through, which helps the fill stay put and minimizes cold spots. The Magma doesn't have a lot of frills; it just gets the job done.

Our favorite summertime car-camping sleeping bag, the REI Siesta Hooded 20, is plenty warm and affordable. It's also not a mummy bag, because you're not climbing Denali; why cramp yourself if you don't have to? The Siesta's rectangular cut makes for a much roomier, more comfortable bag. The Siesta's 20-degree rating makes it enough for three-season trips, and unlike most rectangular bags, the Siesta has a hood, which helps on those cold nights.

It's no longer our top pick for side sleepers, but the Questar remains a good option for those who want more room. It uses what Therm-a-Rest calls W.A.R.M. fit, which stands for “with additional room for multiple” positions. Indeed, this bag is very roomy for a mummy design. I was able to draw my legs up when side-sleeping and spread out considerably more than with most of the other sleeping bags I've tested.

This is our favorite ultralight sleeping bag. There are lighter quilts out there, but when you need the warmth of a mummy bag on those colder nights, this is the best sleeping bag I've tested. It also has the smallest pack size of any bag I've tested in this temperature range. With the included compression sack, this thing is truly tiny. It's got most of the benefits of a quilt and none of the negatives. The down fill is PFC-free, 850+ hydrophobic down. The zippers are on the small side, but they slide well and rarely if ever snag on the bag. I've slept in this bag down to 20 degrees and never been the least bit cold.

Nemo's Forte 20 is a 20-degree synthetic-fill sleeping bag, but the comfort rating is 30 degrees. In my testing, this feels more like where you'd want to stay temperature-wise with this bag. The outer shell uses a 30-denier recycled polyester ripstop with an inside liner made from 20-denier recycled polyester taffeta. It does a good job of holding back the moisture that often forms inside a tent, which I discovered after one very soggy night of testing. The fill is what Nemo calls Zerofiber insulation, which is made from 100 percent postconsumer recycled content fibers. The Zerofiber packs down remarkably small—this is the most compact synthetic-fill bag I've tested in this temp range—and it retains its ability to trap warmth even when wet.

Our favorite backpacking sleeping bag, the Bishop Pass 30 offers the best warmth-to-weight ratio while also managing to pack down small and not be too expensive. It isn't perfect, but it strikes the best compromise for most backpackers. I have slept in this bag for more than two weeks, with nighttime temps ranging from 28 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and, yes, it was too much in the heat, but on those warmer nights, I unzipped it and covered myself like a warm blanket. It's a versatile bag. Note that for the men's bag, only the long version is on sale. Both the long and regular size women's 30 bags are on sale.

I haven't had a chance to write about it yet, but I tested the Bishop Pass 0 over the winter and was pleasantly surprised at how warm it was. I took it out on several nights where temps dipped into the single digits (below the comfort rating of 13 Fahrenheit) and stayed warm. I did wear some merino base layers and a wool hat, but sleeping bag comfort ratings assume this. If you need a colder-weather bag, without dipping into extreme temps (and extremely pricey sleeping bags), this is a good option.

The Zenbivy Bed 25 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is hands-down the most comfortable backcountry sleeping experience I've ever had. It wouldn't be my top pick for extreme situations, but so long as your expected temperatures fit in Zenbivy's range (the comfort rating is 35 degrees Fahrenheit), it doesn't get more comfortable than this. The Zenbivy isn't just a sleeping bag. It's a sheet, hood, and quilt-style bag that can be combined in various ways.

Zenbivy's Light Bed is a brand-new option that takes the basic clip design of other Zenbivy beds and lightens up the load. I've been testing this bag for several months, and it is everything I loved about the original above, but lighter weight. I'll have a full review very soon, but if you've been tempted by the Zenbivy, but wanted to keep your base gear weight down, this is the option you've been look for. The price I've put here includes both the bed/sheet portion and the quilt. Note that Zenbivy is having a 25 percent off sale on almost everything on its site right now.

Nemo Tensor All-Season Sleeping Pad

Nemo's new 2024 Tensor-insulated sleeping pads (8/10, WIRED Recommends) have the best R-value-to-weight ratio of anything I've tested, and the All-Season is our top pick for backpacking trips. It has an R-value of 5.4 and weighs 18.2 ounces. That alone is impressive, but what I love about the Tensor is that it's thick, comfortable, and most importantly, nearly silent. The slightly lighter Trail model is also on sale, as is the Extreme Conditions pad, which is the lightest, warmest sleeping pad on the market.

The darling of ultralight hikers everywhere, the XLite NXT is our pick for backpackers looking to shed pack weight but preserve some margin of comfort. The XLite delivers a comfortable night's sleep while remaining well under 1 pound for the regular size. At 3 inches thick, it's plenty of protection from the ground, and the R-Value of 4.5 means it'll be plenty warm in most three-season conditions.

Sea to Summit's Ether Light XT is only marginally heavier than the Therm-a-Rest above. The extra 4 ounces for the Sea to Summit pad gets you quite a bit more cushion too—this is a 4-inch thick pad, compared to the 3 inches of the Therm-a-rest X-Lite, which makes this a better ultralight option for side sleepers. I also like the baffle design better, and it seems to be a little more durable, making this an excellent alternative ultralight pad. Note that this one is an REI Outlet deal; the XT has been replaced by a newer model.

Check out our Best Tents guide for more WIRED-tested recommendations.

REI Half Dome SL 2+

REI Co-op brand gear represents some of the best deals in the hiking/backpacking market, and this tent is a perfect example. Our pick for Best Two-Person Backpacking Tent, REI's Half Dome is rugged and lightweight (4 pounds), and offers generous living space for two with gear at a reasonably price. The tent body is made of 40-denier ripstop nylon for durability at the base and on the floor, with 20-denier nylon mesh for the body. The Half Dome comes with a footprint, which is a rarity these days, and nice to have. The tent poles are aluminum and interchangeable, which makes them easy to set up and take down.

Sea to Summit's ultralight Alto (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is designed to keep weight down on your solo adventures. At just 33 ounces for a semi-freestanding tent, it remains one of the lighter options on the market, and at this price it's hard to pass up. The mesh netting helps keep weight down, though for something warmer, the Plus version, which has less mesh, is also on sale for $275 ($275 off), an equally outstanding deal.

Sea to Summit's “3-plus season” tents are capable enough in almost any weather while staying crazy light—just 3 pounds and 12 ounces for this three-person model. I used it on a five-day trip to Loon Lake in northern California in early October, a true “shoulder season” trip with daytime highs in the 80s, nighttime lows in the 40s, and overnight winds of up to 60 mph. My favorite design detail is that the pole bag is kept rigid by an insert of opaque white plastic. Clip it to the tent's ceiling, pop in your headlamp, and illuminate your abode. —Michael Calore

The Big Agnes Copper Spur series is the king of freestanding ultralight tents. I've used the two-person and three-person models (on sale for $450) over the years, and Big Agnes has continually refined the design to the point that these are pretty near perfect. This is a high-quality, well-designed tent. It's lightweight, easy to set up, and stable even in strong winds. The steep sidewalls give you more livable space than most tents, and the “awning” design (with trekking poles or sticks) is great. The only complaint I have is the price, but on sale it's a little easier to handle.

Bikepacking (backpacking on a bike) is awesome, and brands are catching on. Big Agnes was an early adopter among the mainstream brands, designing tents with shorter pole lengths to fit between drop handlebars or in panniers. The Copper Spur UL3 Bikepacking tent is our favorite of the bunch we've tested. It weighs just 3 pounds, 11 ounces (1.6 kilos), and has enough space for two (a squeeze for three). It's also available in lighter, smaller, one- and two-person options, all with twin vestibules and doors, hidden helmet storage, and external webbing for hanging out wet clothes.

Nemo's Dagger Osmo (8/10, WIRED Recommends) line of tents are reasonably light with roomy interiors. The three-person version (also on sale) has long been my tent of choice for trips with my kids. Setup is simple thanks to the single main pole design (which forks at each end) with a cross pole in the middle. There are two spacious vestibules for storing gear, and if you leave the rain fly off, the mesh room is excellent for stargazing.

The Nemo Mayfly (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a three-season backpacking tent with a trail weight of 3 pounds, 8 ounces for the two-person version I tested. Split between two people, each is carrying under 2 pounds. The Mayfly saves on weight by using a semi-freestanding design, which means you have to partly stake it out. It's on the small side as well, at 27.9 square feet of living space, with two 7-square-foot vestibule areas. I find it plenty livable for two, and the cross pole gives you a wider roof area than most tents this size. I love the white mesh (instead of black) and the super simple clips that keep the rain fly secured.

This is my favorite single-wall ultralight solo tent. I have a full review coming later this month, but after spending quite a while with this tent I'm something of a convert, at least for summer camping. The Lunar Solo makes it easy to combat the main problem with single-wall tents: condensation. Thanks to plenty of mesh, and a top vent in the vestibule (like my all-time favorite backcountry shelter, the Hilleberg Akto (10/10, WIRED Recommends), I haven't had much issue with condensation in the Lunar Solo. It's not without its quirks (read the pitching tips), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat.

REI Co-op Rainier Rain Jacket

Every year, I repurchase one of these rain jackets for each of my children. It's hard to find rain jackets that are better value than REI's. The kid's version is a 2.5-layer shell with a non-fluorinated (read: PFAS-free) durable water-repellent (DWR) coating, taped seams, and an adjustable hood. These will last all year (at least, as long as your kid doesn't lose theirs). —Adrienne So

I bought my father, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and husband each one of these shirts last year. Roark Clothing is a small company that makes some of my favorite active apparel, and the Bless Up shirt is the perfect summer shirt. It's perforated and made from synthetic fibers, so it's perfect for super-humid beach days when the temperatures are above 90 degrees. —Adrienne So

Fjällräven's hiking pants—er, sorry, trousers—are legendary, and having now spent most of spring in a pair of these Abisko Trail trousers, I understand why. They're light but surprisingly warm and especially good at blocking the wind. The G-1000 Lite Stretch recycled fabric gives you a nice, stretchy freedom of movement, and having had Lyme disease already, the ability to cinch down the leg cuffs and keep things out is invaluable. (I've also put a good bit of repellant on the fabric with no staining or other damage.) I also like that the G-1000 can be waxed to refurbish the waterproofness (though I haven't had to do this yet).

I still prefer Darn Tough's lightweight hiking socks, but these Smartwool socks are a close second and well worth buying at this price. Can you ever have too many wool hiking socks? I'd say no. These are 56 percent merino wool, so there's a good bit of stretchiness, yet they stay pretty odor-free even after a couple of days on the trail. Grab two pair and rotate them to keep your feet dry and happy.

I haven't had a chance to add them to my Best Merino Wool Clothing Guide, but these are the best merino ankle running socks I've tried. They're not the highest merino content (54 percent, the remainder is nylon and elastane), but they're thin, light, and work well with barefoot shoes (and other shoes). They also resist odor surprisingly well for only about half merino. —Adrienne So

This is wildly affordable compared to the other sun hoodies we tested for our Best Sun Protection Clothing guide. WIRED reviewer Jaina Grey found it super soft and breathable, with thumb holes to protect the back of your hands. It's UPF 50, and it may be a lot easier to get your kids or sensitive family members to wear clothing instead of smearing sticky sunscreen all over their bodies. —Adrienne So

This is our second best helmet in our guide to the Best Bike Helmets. It's chock-full of extra features, like a magnetic rear light that snaps off for easy recharging and a pullout tab so that you can easily lock it up on the rack. It comes in a wide array of fun designs and colors. —Adrienne So

The Giro MIPS helmet has rechargeable lights on both the front and back of the helmet. It has an unassuming commuter-friendly design, and of course it has MIPS to protect against rotational impact. —Adrienne So

The CTY e2.1 (7/10, WIRED Review) is our favorite commuter ebike. It's a class 1 ebike with a 250-watt Suntour HESC motor, a 418-Wh battery, and a whole host of commuter extras, like front suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, big 2-inch-wide tires, gel grips, lights, and a hefty kickstand. It weighs a 54 pounds and has a little less torque than some of our other favorite ebikes, so it might not have quite enough oomph to get you up some of the bigger hills, but for the price it's a lot of ebike and will serve most people well.

The simplest, most convenient method of filtering water, the Katadyn BeFree Water is one of the lightest filters on the market (2.3 ounces, or 65 grams, for the filter and bottle). It's a great option for when you want to go as light as possible, such as trail running or day hikes. The design of the BeFree is part of its appeal. The filter is inside the collapsible container. Scoop up some water into the container, screw on the lid, and drink. The collapsible soft bottle rolls down to a tiny package, making it easy to stash in your pack or trail running vest.

The MSR Guardian is fantastically expensive, but it's our pick for trips with sketchy water sources. It's also heavy and requires pumping, but the Guardian filters down to 0.02 micron, which will remove even viruses. It's also designed to be self-cleaning, which makes field maintenance incredibly easy. It's rated to pump 10,000 liters, and because it screws right onto a Nalgene bottle, it's pretty easy to crank out a couple of liters in hardly any time at all.

This MSR Gravity filter changed backpacking for me. Pumping water for a family of five, day after day on the trail, sucks all the fun out of backpacking. This filter eliminated the pumping and returned my sanity, which is why it's our favorite backpacking water filter for large groups. All you have to do with this filter is scoop up 10 liters of water in the dirty water bag, attach the hose, connect your water bottle, and sit back and relax. The filter is good enough to keep you safe from all the usual protozoa and bacteria, and the flow rate is a solid 1.5 liters per minute when the filter is clean.

We're in the final stage of testing for a backpacking stove guide that will be up very soon, and the MSR PocketRocket 2 will be our top pick for propane canister stoves. It's simple to use and boils water quickly (about 3.5 minutes for 1 liter at sea level). It's also more durable and therefore more reliable than the other ultralight stoves I've tested. And it weighs just 2.6 ounces.

The WhisperLite Universal is a legend for good reason. It'll burn just about anything (isobutane-propane, white gas, gasoline, kerosene), making it a great choice for traveling internationally or wherever you don't know what kind of fuel will be available. Flame control is a little tricky, but we have managed to get it to simmer, as long as the wind isn't too bad. Just be forewarned that it sounds like a jet engine.

I'm not sure this really qualifies for the “ultralight” moniker, and these pots are unfortunately marred by having a ton of fake influencer reviews out there, but they're actually quite good. And if you're cooking for a group, this 3-liter pot is about as light as it gets. This is my go-to pot for family backpacking trips. The hard-anodized aluminum is sturdy and provides good heat transfer. The ceramic nonstick coating makes for easy cleanup (especially paired with the GSI scraper below). You can also nest the 2L version ($49) inside this one for more cooking options on the trail. If you want to go nuts with it, I haven't tried it, but you can theoretically also nest the 1.3L version ($49) inside the 2L.

Sea to Summit's Frontier pan is my all-time favorite backcountry cooking vessel. It's not ultralight to bring an 8-inch frying pan backpacking, but when you're ready to move beyond boil-in-a-bag food and whatever those disgusting gel tubes are, the Frontier pan is the way to do it. When you want to build a cream sauce from dried milk (it can be done!) or need to sauté those brook trout, a good pan that distributes heat reasonably evenly is indispensable. The Frontier manages to do that, and it has a nice curved edge, making it easy to work with and easy to clean up. The Frontier pan checks all the boxes thanks to its great design and ceramic coating, and it somehow manages to weigh just 13 ounces.

No, it's not an earth-shattering deal, but this is possibly the best piece of backpacking gear I own. GSI's pot scraper is the unsung hero of backcountry cooking, turning cleanup from a tedious chore to a couple of seconds' work. Now, if you seriously burn something, this thing will not save you (boil water in the pan to loosen the burnt bits), but for every other situation, scraping down your pot with this tool will get you 99 percent of the way to a clean pot. I consider this one indispensable; you might as well grab one while it's a couple bucks cheaper.

This chair is the coziest way to hang out around camp. It is somewhat huge, heavy, and awkward to fold up and carry, but so long as you have room for it in your vehicle there's no better way to relax around the fire with your loved ones.

Do you crave a chair when you're backpacking? If so, this is one to get. It's just about the lightest on the market at 18 ounces, packs down very small, and solves the number one problem with all pole chairs: the included base pad keeps it from sinking in soft ground.

Nalgene water bottles for half off, what's not to love? I've always preferred the timeless classic to the latest style, which might be part of why I've never used another water bottle (well, not counting reusing Smartwater bottles when backpacking). Nalgenes are lighter than stainless steel and, frankly, the only sane option for hiking. Grab two of the big 48 ounce bottles, stick them in the sides of your Mystery Ranch Coulee 30, and your family will never be thirsty again.

This is the built-in straw version of the most durable water bottle we've tested. So long as you're not hiking with it (it's heavy) this is a great water bottle, and it comes in a variety of fun colors.

My favorite of Coleman's current lineup, the Cascade 3-in-1 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) features heavy-duty cast iron grates, comes with a cast-iron griddle and grill, and can fit a 12-inch pan and a 10-inch pan side by side. It's all-around sturdier and more robust than other Coleman stoves, well worth the extra money if you're serious about camp cooking. That said, the much cheaper stove below will get you by if you're only using it a few nights a year.

This is our favorite camp stove for most people. Technically this version is a little fancier than our top pick, with electronic ignition and a nice pale green paint job. Is it worth an extra $30? That's up to you. If it's not, snag the less fancy version for $59 at Walmart.

Our favorite way to avoid the green propane bottles is this gas growler. This model gets you a 1.2-pound propane tank with a nice padded/insulated sleeve and a handy strap for carrying, and it makes your camp setup look much nicer than a bare tank. It also saves your shins during those inevitable run-ins with cold hard steel that come from lugging around a big propane tank. This size is the equivalent of five green propane bottles.

I have yet to do a trip with a satellite communicator, but I do understand why people use them. If I were to bring one along, this is the one I'd get. It's tiny, light (3.5 ounces), and easily stashable. It utilizes the super-fast Iridium satellite network, so you can send a rapid SOS from pretty much anywhere. There are extra features like waypoints and interval tracking, and it plays nice with compatible Garmin watches.

This is my own personal REI purchase for this year, which is a life jacket for my 1-year-old puppy. We do a lot of boating during the summer, and while my spouse insists that dogs can swim, I am not quite sure I trust her. At the very least, it gives my dog a few handles for me to grab if she gets swept away. —Adrienne So

The Petzl Tikka is our favorite headlamp. I've had the same one since 2012, and it's still going strong, which beats every other headlamp or flashlight I've tried in that time. The Tikka is not the brightest light. The models linked here top out at 350 lumens, but it's plenty of light to cook by in the backcountry or trace the source of that transmission fluid dripping off the oil pan. This Tikka runs on three AAA batteries (we recommend Panasonic Eneloop rechargeable batteries) and lasts over 5.5 hours.

Whenever I can, I like to cook over open flame using my firebox stove, which often means cutting wood. The best portable saw I've found is this Silky folding saw. It's light enough to bring bikepacking (5.3 ounces), and it folds down to about 9 inches long, which slips in a pannier no problem. This thing is razor sharp though, be careful when using it in the backcountry.

I like these dry bags for organizing things in my pack. They're not dry bags in the since that you can submerge them and your gear will be fine, but the 30D silnylon with PCF-free DWR sheds a little rain no problem and makes finding your stuff so long as you use different colors for each thing. I put all my cooking gear in a red bag (red for fire), all my water filtering stuff in a blue bag for, wait for it, water, and so on. I find the 3 and 5 liter bags the most useful, but you can get all the way up to 35L.

NRS straps are a must-have for anyone strapping … well, anything to anything. Whether you're a river guide cinching gear to your boat or, like me just want to make sure the paddleboards stay on the Jeep roof, these are the best straps I've ever used. I have NRS straps that are over 30 years old and still going strong. I find the 1-inch straps the most useful. You can grab a two-pack of 6-footers for $13 or a two-pack of 12-footers for $14.

Oru's foldable kayaks are genius—all the boat, none of the size. The lake is light, reasonably fast, and the cheapest way to get into the world of folding kayaks. As with all Oru's offerings, the Lake folds origami-style into a roughly 30-inch square that's just 15 inches deep—small enough to fit in a car trunk or hall closet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Quest to Prove the Existence of a New Type of Quantum Particle","https://www.wired.com/story/paraparticles-would-be-a-third-kingdom-of-quantum-particle/","Sun, 25 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

On a quiet pandemic afternoon in 2021, Zhiyuan Wang, then a graduate student at Rice University, was alleviating his boredom by working on a weird mathematical problem. After he found an exotic solution, he started to wonder if the math could be interpreted physically. Eventually, he realized that it seemed to describe a new type of particle: one that's neither a matter particle nor a force-carrying particle. It appeared to be something else altogether.

Wang was eager to develop the accidental discovery into a full theory of this third kind of particle. He brought the idea to Kaden Hazzard, his academic adviser.

“I said, I'm not sure I believe this can be true,” Hazzard recalled, “but if you really think it is, you should put all your time on this and drop everything else you're working on.”

This January, Wang, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany, and Hazzard published their refined result in the journal Nature. They say that a third class of particles, called paraparticles, can indeed exist, and that these particles could produce strange new materials.

When the paper appeared, Markus Müller, a physicist at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna, was already contending with the notion of paraparticles for a different reason. According to quantum mechanics, an object or observer can be in multiple locations at once. Müller was thinking about how you can, on paper, switch between the perspectives of observers in these coexisting “branches” of reality. He realized that this came with new constraints on the possibility of paraparticles, and his team described their results in a preprint in February that's now under review for publication in a journal.

The close timing of the two papers was a coincidence. But taken together, the work is reopening the case of a physics mystery that was believed to be solved decades ago. A basic question is being reevaluated: What kinds of particles does our world allow?

All known elementary particles fall into one of two categories, and the two behave almost as opposites. There are the particles that make up matter, called fermions, and the particles that impart the fundamental forces, called bosons.

The defining characteristic of fermions is that if you switch the positions of two fermions, their quantum state gains a minus sign. The presence of that measly minus sign has enormous ramifications. It means that no two fermions can be in the same place at the same time. When packed together, fermions cannot be compressed past a certain point. This feature prevents matter from collapsing in on itself—it's why the electrons in every atom exist in “shells.” Without this minus sign, we couldn't exist.

Zhiyuan Wang, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany.

Bosons have no such restriction. Groups of bosons will happily all do exactly the same thing. Any number of particles of light, for instance, can be in the same place. This is what makes it possible to build lasers, which emit many identical light particles. This ability comes down to the fact that when two bosons swap places, their quantum state stays the same.

It's not obvious that fermions and bosons should be the only two options.

That's in part due to a fundamental feature of quantum theory: To calculate the probability of measuring a particle in any particular state, you have to take the mathematical description of that state and multiply it by itself. This procedure can erase distinctions. A minus sign, for example, will disappear. If given the number 4, a Jeopardy! contestant would have no way to know if the question was “What is 2 squared?” or “What is negative 2 squared?”—both possibilities are mathematically valid.

It's because of this feature that fermions, despite gaining a minus sign when swapped around, all look the same when measured—the minus sign disappears when quantum states are squared. This indistinguishability is a crucial property of elementary particles; no experiment can tell two of a kind apart.

The Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated his “exclusion principle” in 1925, when he was 25 years old. It says that two indistinguishable fermions can never have identical quantum states.

But a minus sign may not be the only thing that disappears. In theory, quantum particles can also have hidden internal states, mathematical structures not seen in direct measurements, which also go away when squared. A third, more general category of particle, known as a paraparticle, could arise from this internal state changing in a myriad of ways while the particles swap places.

While quantum theory seems to allow it, physicists have had difficulty finding a mathematical description of a paraparticle that works. In the 1950s, the physicist Herbert Green made a few attempts, but further inspection revealed that these paraparticle models were really just mathematical combinations of typical bosons and fermions.

In the 1970s, the mystery of why no one could find a proper model of paraparticles seemed to be solved. A collection of theorems called DHR theory, after the mathematical physicists Sergio Doplicher, Rudolf Haag, and John Roberts, proved that if certain assumptions are true, only bosons and fermions are physically possible. One assumption is “locality,” the rule that objects can only be affected by things in their vicinity. (“If I poke my table, I better not affect the moon instantaneously,” as Hazzard put it.) The DHR proof also assumed that space is (at least) three-dimensional.

The results discouraged new ventures into paraparticles for decades, with one exception. In the early 1980s, the physicist Frank Wilczek came up with a theory of particles called anyons that can't be described as either bosons or fermions. To get around the DHR theorems, anyons come with a big catch: They can only exist in two dimensions.

Physicists now widely study anyons for their potential in quantum computing. Even confined to two dimensions, they could manifest on a flat surface of a material, or in a 2D array of qubits in a quantum computer.

But paraparticles in three dimensions that could form a solid still seemed impossible. That is, until now.

While developing their model, Wang and Hazzard noticed that the assumptions behind DHR theory went beyond typical concerns of locality. “I think people overinterpreted what limitations or constraints were actually imposed by these theorems,” Hazzard said. Paraparticles, they realized, may be theoretically possible after all.

In their model, in addition to the usual properties of a particle like charge and spin, groups of paraparticles share extra hidden properties. As with the minus sign that gets squared away during a measurement, you can't directly measure these hidden properties, but they change how the particles behave.

Kaden Hazzard, a physicist at Rice University.

When you swap two paraparticles, these hidden properties change in tandem. As an analogy, imagine that these properties are colors. Start with two paraparticles, one that's internally red and another that's internally blue. When they swap places, rather than keeping these colors, they both change in corresponding ways, as prescribed by the mathematics of the particular model. Perhaps the swap leaves them green and yellow. This quickly turns into a complex game, where paraparticles affect each other in unseen ways as they move around.

Meanwhile, Müller was also busy rethinking the DHR theorems. “It's not always super transparent what they mean, because it's in a very complicated mathematical framework,” he said.

His team took a new approach to the paraparticle question. The researchers considered the fact that quantum systems can exist in multiple possible states at once—what's called a superposition. They imagined switching between the perspectives of observers who exist in these superposed states, each of whom describes their branch of reality slightly differently. If two particles are truly indistinguishable, they figured, then it won't matter if the particles are swapped in one branch of the superposition and not in the other.

“Maybe if the particles are close by, I swap them, but if they are far away I do nothing,” Müller said. “And if they're in a superposition of both, then I do the swapping in one branch, and nothing in the other branch.” Whether observers across branches label the two particles in the same way should make no difference.

This stricter definition of indistinguishability in the context of superpositions imposes new restrictions on the kinds of particles that can exist. When these assumptions hold, the researchers found that paraparticles are impossible. For a particle to be truly indistinguishable by measurement, as physicists expect elementary particles to be, it must be either a boson or fermion.

Although Wang and Hazzard published their paper first, it's as though they saw Müller's constraints coming. Their paraparticles are possible because their model rejects Müller's starting assumption: The particles are not indistinguishable in the full sense required in the context of quantum superpositions. This comes with a consequence. While swapping two paraparticles has no effect on one person's measurements, two observers, by sharing their data with each other, can determine whether the paraparticles have been swapped. That's because swapping paraparticles can change how two people's measurements relate to each other. In this sense, they could tell the two paraparticles apart.

This means there's a potential for new states of matter. Where bosons can pack an endless number of particles into the same state, and fermions can't share a state at all, paraparticles end up somewhere in the middle. They are able to pack just a few particles into the same state, before getting crowded and forcing others into new states. Exactly how many can be crammed together depends on the details of the paraparticle—the theoretical framework allows for endless options.

“I find their paper really fascinating, and there's absolutely no contradiction with what we do,” Müller said.

If paraparticles exist, they'll most likely be emergent particles, called quasiparticles, that show up as energetic vibrations in certain quantum materials.

“We might get new models of exotic phases, which were difficult to understand before, that you can now solve easily using paraparticles,” said Meng Cheng, a physicist at Yale University who was not involved in the research.

Bryce Gadway, an experimental physicist at Pennsylvania State University who sometimes collaborates with Hazzard, is optimistic that paraparticles will be realized in the lab in the next few years. These experiments would use Rydberg atoms, which are energized atoms with electrons that roam very far from their nuclei. This separation of the positive and negative charge makes Rydberg atoms especially sensitive to electric fields. You can build quantum computers out of interacting Rydberg atoms. They are also the perfect candidates for creating paraparticles.

“For a certain kind of Rydberg quantum simulator, this is kind of just what they would do naturally,” Gadway said about creating paraparticles. “You just prepare them and watch them evolve.”

But for now, the third kingdom of particles remains wholly theoretical.

“Paraparticles might become important,” said Wilczek, the Nobel Prize–winning physicist and inventor of anyons. “But at present they're basically a theoretical curiosity.”

This JSON can reference external files, so the animation is  either- a folder with bunch of files (sub pictures)\- or those files are inlined in the JSON as base64- or it's just a single file, which turns out to be a zipped folder of this amalgamation.If you imagine loading this on the web, you have to load absolutely enormous SDK (which is not very actively maintained and isn't very well size optimized), and then loading the animation either means loading a bunch of files separately, or loading a single file but processing it through multiple different parsers in multiple passes (JSON, base64, png, lottie, zip). If you use the .lottie file, you have to include zip decompresser in the JS bundle (.lottie player, which is a different library, also uses 2MB wasm blob, not sure why).It took me a while to squash the footprint of this craziness in our app and I'm glad we don't use it in a hot path, because this is just crazy - it's  supposed to be this little cherry on top for special occasions, but it's by far the heaviest part of the codebase. I had to manually tweak tose animations, run them through some optimizers, fixup weird path and inlining issues, fixed issue with those exporters turning vectors to png, all sorts of stuff.On top of that, the browser doesn't survive playing more than a few of them reliably at the same time (especially on lower end devices), because turns out (who would have guessed?) - animating stuff with JS and DOM is not quite performant.I kinda want to try a weekend project to turn these into optimized svg sprites and try to play them with a CSS transision, see if this makes it more bearable.

In many cases just rendering a video and binding playback to interaction is much more lightweight and less work-intensive than using Lottie.I've heard about Rive before and a lot of the choices they make seem to be exact fixes for the issue of Lottie. I haven't worked with it yet however, so YMMV.

I'm sure it is a good fit for usage on native mobile apps, though.

A good example is the Telegram messenger that uses Lottie as the format of animated stickers, e.g. https://tlgrm.eu/stickers/Princess (click to animate).

Contrarian opinion: Flash was one of the best things about Web 1.0.The forced move to CSS and the constellation of other ""standards"" still hasn't caught up to what Flash once offered us.Flash was all at once a video format, animation format, programming environment, video player, interactive UI system, game programming engine, multiplayer MMO game dev engine, infographics system -- actually, it was literally everything you wanted it to be. And it was so simple that even kids could use it.If Adobe had opened everything - the format, the player, etc. - it could have become something tremendous that is still with us.I think there's space for this to be rethought and redone. We shouldn't be so dogmatic that CSS and SVG and HTML and Javascript are the only way. They've had nearly 40 years to shine and we're still struggling with the same issues.We should be trying to reinvent the wheel.

Hard disagree. Modern web apps can be amazing within the browser alone. Look at Figma or OnShape as class leading examples.I think you're also misunderstanding Lottie: For web use it is compiled down to those browser primitives you were talking about. It works well, too, so I don't understand why you're claiming we're “still struggling”.

What do you mean by that?
My understanding of the above suggestion is that the author dreamed of a world where something like flash would have become the standard, so part of the browser, without the (proprietary) extension.

There are plenty of options today for technically-minded or 'computer people' to work with, but there's a dearth of options for the 'merely' creative to play around with and investigate.A lot of the magic from the 'old' (mid?) web came from people who had very little initial interest in the technical nature of the solution from just going ahead and making Cool Shit™ anyway. Some of those people might then relish getting their hands grubbier and delving deeper into the technical guts (eg. Praystation et al).- ed : for the record, at the time i was also critical of the proprietary nature of Flash.

I've personally pushed against the use of Lottie in projects I've worked on due to the file sizes being very difficult to justify for the kinds of animations that our designers wanted to use it for. SVGator was another alternative we had success with.One thing I've been very frustrated is the amount of places I see Lottie pushed with no mention of file size. ie tools like Webflow, and general advocacy from prominent figures in the tech community. I'm sure there is a sweet spot for Lottie, but I'm also convinced that there are better choices for use cases most people are using it for.

Not sure if this is only a problem with lottielab or the lottie format, but if not using their proprietary minimizing hosting the animations are so big that I consider them useless for a landing page. Their compression reduces the size by 400% on average for larger animations. We ended up paying $30 subscription just to host the animations which does not sit right with me. So will be looking for alternatives but not looking forward to recreating them..In the past I've used other react based animation libs and they chore of building animations was so tedious I would not attempt anything complicated. With lottlielab you can really play and build what you can imagine with relative ease.Have not tried Rive.. Will check it out. 
Any suggestions on how to better compress lottie format for libs for that would be appreciated.

This can also be used for progressive enhancement, since if the user has requested reduced motion you can simply leave the first (or last) frame of the animation, or hide it altogether.

Many designers I've worked with get really excited about Lottie animations but I usually just make the animations in CSS since it's more performant and easier to work with.By the way, CSS animations have gotten significantly easier with the @property rule. Simply edit the CSS variable and your animation will update!

> The Best And Worst Infotainment Systems In Popular EVs Right Now> https://dmarge.com/cars/best-worst-infotainment-systems-evsThis article is pretty barebones. 1-3 paragraphs be EV system, no video, vague descriptions (mostly “vibes” IMHO), and inconsistent information. For example, they mention CarPlay/Android Auto (as not being available) on _some_ of the cars but in fact I don't think it's available on any, they were just inconsistent in calling it out. Also there is no ranking system at all and making a comment like:> Ther's no Apple CarPlay. No Android Auto. And no real need for them. It's a closed ecosystem, but a slick one, setting the benchmark for native infotainment design.Typo aside, I disagree completely with that statement. Nothing I've used comes close to CarPlay (I'm sure Android Auto is similar, idk).Each little “review” seems like it was written in isolation from the other reviews which makes it harder to follow and impossible to actually compare.

Sure you can pressure people to transfer money from banks to you.  But that will be easier to trace and the transactions could just be reversed.  If moving all your wealth the bank is likely to ask some questions, maybe want to see you in person.With crypto the philosophy is “be your own bank”.  It's like keeping your money under the mattress.  So you are a much more promising target.

You are the weakest link wrt private keys and storage.Also, even talking about it amongst folks you think are your friends, like fellow Bitcoin users, isn't wise either. Hypothetically, if you became exceedingly wealthy on paper, it would be in the interest of others to take you out of the equation so you can't cash out. If that means a five dollar (or whatever they cost these days) wrench to the head so you stop moving… now that value is locked up in the blockchain! Could this happen to any given bitcoin users with just a few satoshi or whatnot? Very unlikely, but don't forget that a decade and a half ago, a handful of bitcoins could cost you very little money. Now it has gone up exponentially in value and would make you a big fat target.There are those on /r/bitcoin that think a wrench won't ever break their wills and spirits. That math is invincible. Don't think they've ever been on the wrong side of one before. Math might be bulletproof, but wetware is very fragile.

The interesting thing to me about this is watching how we've changed over the past 40 years. As a kid, it was impressed up on kids to not talk to strangers. You don't tell people where you live. You don't tell people anything more than necessary. Now, people share the most intimate details of their daily lives. People share/invite random strangers to their accounts without any concerns about who they are or what they might do. People just do not think about how the most benign of posts can be used for nefarious purposes by someone else. So we've gone from share nothing to over sharing everything.

During covid some SWEs had pretty sweet gigs due to lowered expectations and a rush on talent. And what do a small fraction of SWEs do? Make “life in the day of” videos that glamorize how cushy and easy-going it is, painting the whole group of SWEs as spoiled and entitled who make too much money. Point is they could've just realized they had it good and kept quiet.But, no, they had to hustle for internet points, even risking their job inadvertently. It's unbelievable to me how fast we flipped from the internet being an accessory to life to it being a surrogate for actual social interaction.

And I think it all boils down to the fact that some humans need to make noise about their successes so they feel validated. Much like the cryptocurrency evangelists, they probably can't help themselves because they want to ensure they defend “the mission” even if it comes at great personal cost in the long run.

It's worth worrying about in the general case, too. There are subtler and much more noxious failure modes here than merely getting beaned with a Swedish nut rounder.

Everything you do to keep keys safe from some risks weakens your posture against other risks. Making sure most people don't know about your holdings is nice and all, but ultimately key management is a really hard problem. It's hard enough for companies, but I'd argue it's even worse for individuals.

Of course it would be easy to say one's never touched crypto, and not so easy to prove, as with any negative. I don't care. If I ever get bounced with a King Dick, it'll far more likely be because I said something someone didn't like - which seems to happen about as often as I open my mouth, these days. Or because I said something someone failed to comprehend and so took insult at. Brains are severely out of fashion this decade, and I can't seem to help having some, so presumably someone will seek to scatter them sooner or later. Why not? I hear it's the last argument of kings, and their time too seems coming 'round again.In any case they better not let me hear them coming. Wiser to spin the block in a car, really. I've never been hit with a wrench before, but it did once take more than a hammer to get me off my feet.

The paper *""Investigating Wrench Attacks: Physical Attacks Targeting Cryptocurrency Users""* presents the first comprehensive study on wrench attacks—real-world physical attacks used to coerce cryptocurrency users into handing over their digital assets.###  Summary of the Paper:#### *Definition & Origin** The term ""\$5 wrench attack” originates from a webcomic and refers to using physical coercion (like a wrench) instead of complex hacking to obtain information such as crypto keys.
* The paper defines wrench attacks as *intentional physical attacks to unlawfully obtain cryptocurrencies* via coercion or violence, combining crimes against both persons and property.#### *Methodology** *Data triangulation* from:  * 10 **interviews** with victims and experts
  * 146 **news articles**
  * 37 **online forums** (672 posts analyzed)
* *Crime script analysis* was used to map how such attacks are prepared, executed, and concluded.#### *Key Findings** Attackers range from *organized crime groups* to *friends, family*, and *even corrupt law enforcement*.
* Victims are often *public figures, early adopters*, or participants in *peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transactions*.
* Attacks include *robbery, kidnapping, murder, blackmail*, and a new category: *cryptocurrency-facilitated domestic economic abuse*.
* *No user is immune*, including security-savvy individuals.
* Attacks have *increased over time*, especially during market booms (e.g., 2017, 2021).
* Victims often *do not report attacks*, fearing revictimization or police inaction.#### *Security Insights** Most victims had *used centralized exchanges* and undergone *KYC* processes, potentially exposing their identity and holdings.
* Wrench attacks *bypass digital security*—no software or hardware defense can prevent coercion under threat.
* Victim behaviors (e.g., displaying crypto apps in public, sharing wealth) can unintentionally increase risk.#### *Recommendations** *For Users:*  * Keep a **low profile** about crypto holdings.
  * Use **multi-signature wallets**, **distributed fund storage**, and **plausible deniability mechanisms**.
  * Exercise caution during **P2P transactions** and avoid carrying large amounts of crypto assets.

* *For Industry & Regulators:*  * **Reevaluate KYC policies**—data leaks can serve as “shopping lists” for attackers.
  * Implement **transaction delays** or **alerts** for large withdrawals to thwart coercion.
  * Improve **wallet UI/UX** to prevent exposing sensitive information (e.g., display balance).

#### *Contributions** Introduces the first *formal legal definition* of wrench attacks.
* Identifies *seven forms* of wrench attacks.
* Provides *actionable policy and design recommendations* for reducing risk.---This research highlights the *growing intersection of physical crime and digital assets*, calling for urgent changes in user behavior, system design, and policy to mitigate this underreported but increasingly relevant threat.

To torture the metaphor a bit, crypto is more like an iPhone competitor which markets itself around the supposed benefits of not having anti-theft features like factory reset protection. If you go out of your way to refuse already existing safeguards against your stuff being stolen then you don't really get to be surprised when thieves single you out as an easy mark.

Although the crypto might be relevant being attacked is something that any asset owner has to worry about (even for assets like houses, oddly enough - I suspect big mansions would be something of a thief draw). The attacks are unintended consequences of wealth as opposed to any specific property of crypto - having an equal amount of cash on hand isn't safe either.

New weekend, new F1 race. If you're a fan, you're looking for a free channel that streams the Formula 1 Monaco GP. Rightfully so — overpriced subscriptions aren't ideal if you want to save money and keep up with F1 races simultaneously.

The good news is that you can watch the Monaco Grand Prix online for free with a bit of effort. There's a handy free channel that broadcasts it in Full HD. This guide will explain how to access it worldwide and stream the event.

We won't keep you waiting. The channel you're looking for is called SRF.

SRF is a Swiss-based TV channel known for broadcasting a vibrant palette of sports events. It's also a place where you can watch MotoGP races for free. This weekend, it'll broadcast the F1 Monaco GP live, as well.

Since it's a Swiss TV channel, it has a few issues. For example, it's accessible only in Switzerland and doesn't come with English commentary. On the other hand, it's accessible without an account, so that's great.

As you can see above, the free live stream of the F1 Monaco GP will be on SRF Zwei (link: https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/live/srf-zwei?tvLiveId=c49c1d64-9f60-0001-1c36-43c288c01a10). This is the GP race, however, SRF also displays the qualifying if you're interested.

Stream the Monaco GP for free with NordVPN

Okay, so SRF is exclusive to Switzerland — is there a workaround?

Yes. Swiss residents abroad often swap their IP addresses for Swiss ones. With a Swiss IP, SRF detects that the user is located in Switzerland. This results in effortless access regardless of the user's actual location.

According to F1 fans worldwide, NordVPN fits the bill. It's a famous VPN service with thousands of global servers, many of which are in Switzerland. Moreover, the VPN supplies applications for all devices.

This eases the process of watching the F1 Monaco GP on a free channel, or any other Grand Prix for that matter. The user can install NordVPN, connect to a server in Switzerland, and use SRF even in Europe, the USA, Asia, etc.

NordVPN is a paid VPN, but that's no issue.

It comes with a non-conditional 30-day money-back guarantee to set things straight. This is, in a way, a NordVPN free trial that you can use it for this purpose, cancel it, and obtain a refund if you don't need it anymore.

The same principle applies to unblocking other restricted content. With unlimited bandwidth and market-leading speeds, users have reported nothing but pure enjoyment in streaming, gaming, and other online activities.

Yes, it'll be on F1 TV Pro as well, but as you likely know, it's a subscription service. This means it's a paid channel, too, and unfortunately, it does cost a lot. F1 TV Pro is also unavailable in some countries — keep that in mind.

Generally speaking, all subscription services, especially those sports-related, tend to be pricey. While SRF's lack of English commentary is evident, it's still the best option to watch the Monaco Grand Prix online for free.

Not sure when to tune in? Don't think we've forgotten to include a full schedule for your convenience. The event kicks off on May 23rd and ends on May 25th. As always, the race will be on Sunday.

Try NordVPN risk-free now

If that's your only goal, tune in on the 25th of May and feast your eyes. If you'd rather sit through the entire event and live the hype, here's how this weekend will transpire:

In 1976, NASA's Viking mission successfully landed the first spacecraft on Mars. When the mission began sending images from Mars' surface back to Earth, scientists noted long, dark streaks on crater walls and cliff sides. To this day, some researchers suggest that the strange geographical features are the result of water flow—but a recent study says otherwise.

Planetary scientists from Brown University and the University of Bern have used artificial intelligence to reveal that the enigmatic Martian streaks likely result from wind and dust, not water flow. Their results have important implications for future Mars exploration, as well as humanity's continuous search for habitable environments and life beyond Earth.

Some slope streaks are long-lasting, while others—called recurring slope lineae (RSL)—are more ephemeral, continuously appearing in the same places during Mars' hottest times of the year. Although Mars is generally dry and cold (with temperatures as low as -225 degrees Fahrenheit, or -153 degrees Celsius) small amounts of water from potential ice, underground sources, or humidity could conceivably mix with enough salt to become liquid and flow down a slope. Because water is a key ingredient for life on Earth, such formations might represent habitable regions on the Red Planet, too. But some researchers aren't convinced, arguing that dry processes could have created those features instead.

To settle the matter, the researchers trained an algorithm on a dataset of confirmed slope streak sightings, as detailed in a study published Monday in the journal Nature Communications. They then used the algorithm to scan over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images and compose a map of Martian slope streaks.

“Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors,” Valentin Bickel, co-author of the study and a University of Bern Center for Space and Habitability fellow, said in a Brown University statement. “Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.”

Simply put, their results do not link slope streaks and RSLs with features indicating the presence of liquid or even frost. Instead, the researchers discovered that both slope streaks and RSLs tend to develop in areas with high wind speed and dust deposition. In other words, they are likely caused by a dry process in which dust layers abruptly slide down a slope, triggered by external forces.

Rather than seeing these results as yet another failure in our search for extraterrestrial life, the planetary scientists explain that the study still carries weight for future Mars explorations. If their research had confirmed the theory that slope streaks were caused by water, and that as a result the region might host some form of life, NASA would have actually avoided the area for the time being. That's because scientists fear that spacecraft and rovers might still harbor terrestrial life, such as microbes, which could contaminate Martian habitats and interfere with our search for Martian life.

“That's the advantage of this big data approach,” explained Adomas Valantinas, the other co-author of the study and a planetary scientist at Brown University who specializes in Martian geology. “It helps us to rule out some hypotheses from orbit before we send spacecraft to explore.”

In an industry that seems obsessed with finding water on Mars, the study stands as a reminder that not every scientific breakthrough needs to be about extraterrestrial life.

Vikings were formidable Scandinavian warriors and sailors who, from around 800 to 1050 CE, raided, traded, and settled throughout northern Europe, Iceland, Greenland, and even as far as North America. Most of what scholars know about Viking maritime networks, however, has to do with their start and end points. After all, they could have taken any number of routes in between. To shed light on this gap, an archaeologist decided to follow in the Vikings' footsteps—or, more accurately, their wake.

In order to reconstruct their seafaring itineraries, Lund University archaeologist Greer Jarrett sailed functional Viking-like boats along the Norwegian coast in a series of experimental voyages. By experiencing these journeys firsthand, the archaeologist hoped to understand where it would have made most sense for Viking sailors to seek shelter along the way to their destination. In this way, he identified four natural harbors that could have served as pitstops hundreds of years ago.

“A lot of the time, we only know about the starting and ending points of the trade that took place during the Viking Age. Major ports, such as Bergen and Trondheim in Norway, Ribe in Denmark, and Dublin in Ireland. The thing I am interested in is what happened on the journeys between these major trading centres,” Jarrett explained in a statement. “My hypothesis is that this decentralised network of ports, located on small islands and peninsulas, was central to making trade efficient during the Viking Age.”

Between September 2021 and July 2022, Jarrett and his crew undertook 15 sailing trials and two approximately three-week-long trial voyages in seven different Nordic clinker boats: traditional, small, open, wooden sailboats whose use in Nordic regions dates back almost 2,000 years. It wasn't always smooth sailing—once, the pole supporting the mainsail snapped over 15 miles (25 kilometers) from the coast, and they had to tie two oars together to secure the sail until they managed to return to land. Overall, they covered 1,494 nautical miles.

The experimental archaeologist decided that possible “havens” along maritime itineraries should have provided fresh water, shelter from swells and winds, and a good view of the sea. Furthermore, they had to be reachable in low visibility, big enough to host several boats, approachable and exitable from different directions, and located in a “transition zone”: coastal points between exposed regions and inner areas.

Along with these criteria, Jarrett's investigation integrated a digital reconstruction of Viking Age sea levels, pre-established knowledge of large Viking maritime centers, and information about traditional 19th and early 20th century sailboat routes from sailors and fishermen. The archaeologist also clarified that his work regards long-range Viking expeditions rather than voyages for raiding and war purposes.

“This study's emphasis on practical seafaring knowledge and experience seeks to counter the common academic bias towards terrestrial and textual sources and worldviews,” he wrote in the study, published earlier this month in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory.

In this way he claims to have identified four potential Viking havens. These remote locations along the Norwegian coast each have varying degrees of pre-existing archaeological evidence indicating past human presence. Presumably, Jarrett is the first to suggest they may have also been pit stops along Viking maritime journeys.

“The list of possible Viking Age havens,” he explained, indicating a diagram in the study, “is intended as a working document, which can shape and be shaped by future archaeological surveys and excavations.”

It's worth remembering that, even with digital reconstructions of the Viking-era seascape, experimental voyages can never provide evidence of Viking activity to the degree of direct archaeological evidence. Nevertheless, creative and practical approaches such as Jarrett's stand as a reminder that sometimes the solution to a problem requires a different perspective—literally. It remains to be seen whether his work will inspire future archaeological surveys.

But as firms seek to monetize their AI investments, we expect AI results to lose their cleanness.

Google Search's market share fell below 90% in late 2024, happening for the first time in almost a decade. According to StatCounter, the search giant's share first dropped in the last quarter of 2024, when it hit 89.34%. The company was able to briefly recover to 90.15% in February 2025, then fell back down to 89.71% the following month and has yet to recover.

International Blockchain Consulting Group founder Mario Nawfal first shared this info on his X (formerly Twitter) account, saying, “Why dig through link farms when you can just Grok it and get straight to the point?” Elon Musk then reposted this, adding the caption, “AI will obviate search @grok”.

AI will obviate search @grok https://t.co/v0qC67n8bNMay 25, 2025

AI search can indeed be more convenient than sifting through website-based search results. And even though Google sometimes tries to get the best results on the front page of search engine results pages, many “SEO specialists” game the system just to get their websites on top. There's also the issue of sponsored results, which can confuse people who just want the best answer to their queries.

However, AI search isn't perfect — we've already seen several cringeworthy Google AI answers, and AI is also known to hallucinate and give out wrong answers. So, if you're going to rely on that, you cannot take its answers at face value. Instead, you must always ask it for sources so you can ascertain for yourself if the answer it returned is true or false. This might be an issue, though, if a user does not do this verification step and takes AI answers as gospel.

More importantly, nothing in this world is free. AI companies are investing billions into research and development, so they have to some way, somehow, make money from it. So, unless everyone pays for an AI subscription, AI search might eventually be filled with ads, too, to offset operational costs.

And who's to say that AI systems cannot be gamified? We've already seen 'experts' online telling people how to make content 'AI-friendly.' While we cannot blame people for offering services to website owners who want their pages to have a wider reach, would AI tech be smart enough to determine when a certain page is the best answer that a specific person is looking for?

The development of AI has been controversial, especially with the countless number of allegations and lawsuits based on the unlawful use of intellectual property. If AI search takes off and starts to replace traditional search, this will definitely be another can of worms that must be addressed, or else we risk killing the creativity that AI LLMs rely on for their training data and end up with useless results from AI searches based on AI-generated gloop.

Have Tom's Hardware readers seen any more disgustingly dusty PCs?

Dust can literally choke your PC, and a level-headed enthusiast will regularly check and clean dust filters, fans, and other parts of their systems. Though it might seem inexcusable to let dust pile up in a PC, it seems to be a pretty common occurrence. This weekend, Germany's PCGH.de highlighted some of the worst “fluffy balls of horror” (machine translation) that have been shared by its readers. If you enjoy a scare, its ~400 picture gallery might shiver your timbers.



The images over at PCGH.de come with a disclaimer of sorts. “Please note: Many of the extremely dirty computers do not belong to community members, but were simply handed over to them for troubleshooting, upgrades, or cleaning, and photographed at the time,” pleads the magazine on its readers' behalf.

As well as the horror of seeing these images, there is some dusty nostalgia to be had, as the PCGH.de user forum thread has been growing since back in 2012, when a guest poster first showed off a be quiet! CPU cooler caked with dust.

There's a lot of old PC coolers, motherboard, graphics cards and more which you might recognize from back in the day – despite their cloaking in dust. See this old Gainward graphics card, for example, or this Asus Maximum III Formula-based system that was owned by a heavy smoker, and here's a dust-caked Abit Fatality FP-IN9 SLI system, too.



In this writer's experience, laptops are even more prone to and more badly affected by dust ingress - due to users often placing them on soft furnishings and the relatively tiny cooling systems they use. However, they don't feature heavily in this PCGH.de gallery.

Last year we reported on a similarly grotty looking PC system from North Carolina. However, we couldn't blame the owner for lax housekeeping, as their Fractal Design Define C housed system was devastated by the terrible Hurricane Helene. That system was too far gone for even a capable electric duster like the Wolfbox MF100, currently 40% off at Amazon, to make a meaningful impact.

Last, but not least, it would be fun for our readers to share some of their 'fluffy balls of horror' (remember, we are talking PCs) alongside this post. Feel free to upload your latest dusty horror images here.

Sources allege a $6,500-$8,000 price tag, undercutting H20s which were $10,000-$12,000. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Following the ban of its Hopper H20 accelerations in China, Nvidia is reportedly planning on launching new Blackwell-based solutions at a lower price this year, per Reuters. With mass production anticipated by June, we can expect these solutions to be widely available in the Chinese market by Q3 or Q4. While technical details are still emerging, we can already discern some important details and specifications.

Due to stringent U.S. export policies targeting China, the Hopper family has largely been a cat-and-mouse chase between U.S. regulators and Nvidia. Even before their official debut, the flagship H100 and H200 accelerators were already subject to export bans. Nvidia introduced the H800 to circumvent these regulations, which eventually faced a similar fate in October 2023. The cut-down H20 served as Nvidia's primary AI solution for the Chinese market in the interim until its recent ban under the current administration last month, which forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in GPU supply.

Reuters reports that Nvidia's follow-up to the H20 will be based on the Blackwell architecture, more specifically, the RTX Pro 6000D. Further clarification by tipster Jukanlosreve at X, citing a report from China's GF Securities, suggests the RTX Pro 6000D will be dubbed B40 (likely a successor to the Ada Lovelace L40). Reuters classifies this as a server-class GPU which uses traditional GDDR7 memory instead of HBM, and notably avoids the use of TSMC's CoWoS packaging technology, likely signaling at its monolithic nature.

There are two possibilities based on the available data. This GPU can either be based on datacenter grade GB1XX Blackwell or consumer-grade GB2XX Blackwell silicon. The former is unlikely, as it only features HBM controllers at the silicon level. If the B40 utilizes GB2XX dies, it would be a derivative of the GB202 chip (found in the RTX 5090 and RTX Pro Blackwell 6000) and would lack NVLink support. The report estimates the price of the B40 between $6,500 and $8,000, which is less than the H20 and comparable to Nvidia's global RTX Pro 6000 workstation models.

The HGX H20 could be configured in an 8-GPU configuration, but without NVLink, the B40 would likely face challenges in multi-GPU setups. Nvidia's latest RTX Pro Blackwell servers employ up to eight RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, connected via ConnectX-8 SuperNICs with integrated PCIe 6.0 switches, for GPU-to-GPU communication. This setup is likely what we'll see for the B40, with scaling beyond eight GPUs expected to be handled by Nvidia's Spectrum-X networking platform. Since details are scarce, this is just speculation on our part, so please don't read it as gospel.

The FIFA Club World Cup is an exciting international tournament featuring the best clubs from around the globe, including the top teams from each continental confederation and the host nation's champion. Real Madrid holds the record for the most victories in this competition, having won five times. Meanwhile, Manchester City is the reigning champion, having claimed the title in 2023.

The Palm Beach County Sports Commission collaborated with the City of Palm Beach Gardens and Lynn University to bring these prestigious clubs to premier facilities in the area. 

The Gardens North County District Park is equipped with 10 lighted FIFA-regulation fields and has hosted numerous international teams in recent years. The facility has also served as the training site for various Major League Soccer teams.

Over the past few years, the Palm Beaches have hosted training camps for Major League Soccer teams, National Women's Soccer League clubs, and other prestigious youth and amateur organizations.

Excitement is building as these two soccer giants prepare for their journey toward the FIFA Club World Cup title.

BAYERN MUNICH have frustrated members of staff with their plans to send the players' Wags to the Club World Cup, according to reports.

The German giants are set to head to the US for the controversially revamped tournament next month.

Harry Kane will head to the States hoping to add further silverware to his collection, having broken his duck by winning the Bundesliga title.

According to Bild, the trip has caused friction behind the scenes at the German champions.

Bayern's Club World Cup campaign will come amid a series of cost-cutting measures.

Several staff members have reportedly been informed that they won't join the team at the tournament.

Despite sporting director Max Eberl's efforts to reduce costs, players families' will be sent to the US at the expense of the club.

This means that Kane's wife Katie Goodland can be sent to the States at Bayern's expense, despite her husband being one of the club's top earners.



Bild's Bayern expert Christian Falk revealed: ""The players' families have been invited.""

On the German outlet's podcast, Falk went on to add: ""You have to say, a few employees were annoyed.

""They're cutting costs everywhere, so only a small group of employees is allowed to go over, but the families are.""

The staff members thought to be affected include lower level roles like middle management and matchday stewards.

Bayern boss Vincent Kompany is looking forward to the competition, which could net the winners a £100million prize kitty.

The Belgian said: ""I think the closer we get to the tournament, the more you can see the excitement growing. 

""It's been quite a special season anyway so far. You have the new format of the Champions League, and you have the next competition with the Club World Cup.

""You know, I think we're part of a club here with Bayern Munich where every trophy is important, so by the time we get to America, it will be a priority.""

Bayern will begin their Club World Cup campaign by facing New Zealand side Auckland City in Cincinnati on June 15, before a trip to Miami to take on iconic Argentine outfit Boca Juniors five days later.

Bayern face Benfica on matchday three in Charlotte on June 24.

Ahead of the tournament, Kane said: ""It's going to be unique, playing this type of major tournament with your club is different to what's been done in the past but I think it's going to be a great experience.

""Going out to the US, as well, a year before the World Cup itself will be a great chance to get to know some of the stadiums and get to know the fans out there.



""It's going to be a really great tournament.

""As always, when it's the first of any type of tournament, people are wondering how it's going to go but I'm really excited for it.""

Real Madrid are now fully focused on the FIFA Club World Cup after signing off on the 2024/25 La Liga season.

Huge changes will take place in the coming weeks, as Carlo Ancelotti departs to take charge of the Brazil national team, and Xabi Alnoso steps in as his replacement.

Alonso has agreed a three-year deal back in Madrid to lead the team until the end of the 2027/28 campaign.

His first test comes via the Club World Cup in the USA as Los Blancos look to bounce back from a poor final season under Ancelotti.

Barcelona stormed away to clinch a La Liga, Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup treble with Ancelotti's charges dumped out by Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals.

Jude Bellingham has called on Real Madrid to rescue a 'weak' season at the Club World Cup and Alonso will name a strong travelling squad.

📲 Follow The Sporting News on WhatsApp

The huge financial bonuses offer - allied with the chance to seal a much-needed instant trophy for Alonso - means Real Madrid will want to hit the ground running.

Bellingham's shoulder surgery has been delayed, to allow him to feature, but Fede Valeverde faces a race to be ready in time.

Valverde completed 90 minutes, as Real Madrid sealed a La Liga campaign finale win over Real Sociedad, but a back issue was immediately flagged up for the 26-year-old.

An official statement confirmed the issue for the Uruguay international with a return date unclear at this stage.

""After tests carried on Fede Valverde by the Real Madrid medical services, he has been diagnosed with lumbosciatalgia. Pending evolution.""



Real Madrid will utilise the incoming break to rest their vital No.8 ahead of their flight to the USA at the start of June with indications hinting at a two-week absence.

The tournament kicks off on June 14, but Real Madrid's first game is not until June 18, against Al Hilal in Miami.

Alonso will be hopeful that window gives Valverde sufficient time to recover but he is expected to be excused from international duty with Uruguay.

Marcelo Bielsa's team are closing in on qualification for the 2026 World Cup ahead of CONMEBOL clashes with Paraguay on June 5 and Venezuela on June 10.

 play videoAsamoah Gyan got past Per Mertesacker to put Ghana 2-1 ahead

FIFA have paid glowing tribute to one of the most unforgettable matches in recent World Cup history, Ghana's pulsating 2-2 draw with eventual champions Germany at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

More than a decade later, the clash at Estadio Castelao still resonates as a shining example of drama, quality, and fearless football from the African giants.

In a special throwback feature shared across their official platforms, FIFA hailed the Black Stars for their bold, high-energy display against one of the tournament's heavyweights.

Ghana not only matched Germany stride for stride in Fortaleza's scorching heat, they went toe-to-toe and came within minutes of a famous victory.

The match saw Germany take a 51st-minute lead through Mario Götze, whose awkward header-knee combination just beat goalkeeper Fatau Dauda.

But Ghana responded with ferocious intensity. Just three minutes later, Andre Ayew soared to meet Harrison Afful's pinpoint cross, heading home to send the crowd into raptures.

Nine minutes after that, Asamoah Gyan capitalized on a rare Philipp Lahm error, latching onto a brilliant Sulley Muntari through ball to fire the Black Stars into a 2-1 lead.

Gyan's goal not only gave Ghana the lead but also brought him level with Cameroonian legend Roger Milla as the joint-top African scorer at the World Cup with five goals, a record Gyan would surpass in the next group match against Portugal, making him the continent's all-time leading scorer in the tournament to this day.

But Germany, brimming with talent and led by Joachim Löw, weren't finished. The introduction of veteran Miroslav Klose changed the tide.

With his very first touch, Klose poked home from close range following a flick-on from Benedikt Höwedes in the 71st minute, a goal that made him joint top-scorer in World Cup history alongside Brazil's Ronaldo with 15 goals.

Klose will eventually score against Ronaldo's Brazil in their 7-1 loss against Germany in the semi-finals, to become the leading scorer of the World Cup

The remainder of the match was a fierce end-to-end battle. Toni Kroos and Thomas Müller threatened for Germany, but Ghana held firm. Christian Atsu and Gyan came close to snatching a winner as the Black Stars refused to back down.

The final whistle was met with exhaustion, applause, and respect, neither side deserved to lose, and the football world recognised that something special had unfolded.

There are four Inter Milan players in the Italy squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers, whilst Francesco Acerbi will be in on one condition.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews.

The club season is only just coming to an end.

It has been a dramatic conclusion which saw Inter Milan miss out to the Serie A title to Napoli on the final day of the season.

Meanwhile, the Nerazzurri will face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final next Saturday.

Then, next month, Inter will play in the expanded Club World Cup in the United States. They will be one of two teams representing Serie A in the competition along with Juventus.

However, there is also time for another international break right after the Champions League final.

There will be four players from the Inter Milan squad who shift gears to the national team immediately after the Champions League final.

The Corriere confirm that Italy coach Luciano Spalletti has called up Alessandro Bastoni, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella, and Davide Frattesi.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma will also be in the Azzurri setup.

Then, there is the possibility of a fifth Nerazzurri player being part of the Italy camp.

The Corriere report that Francesco Acerbi is the first name in reserve in defense.

Aside from Bastoni, Spalletti has called up Arsenal's Riccardo Calafiori, Napoli's Alessandro Buongiorno, and Fiorentina's Pietro Comuzzo.

Therefore, if any of those pull out, then Francesco Acerbi will be in the Italy squad.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

By Gianni Taina

May 24, 2025 09:29PM EDT

As FIFA prepares to introduce a 48-team format for the 2026 World Cup, discussions have emerged about an even larger expansion for the tournament's centennial edition in 2030. The proposal would allow 64 nations to compete, marking a significant step in the tournament's evolution.

In an interview with Argentine journalist Andrés Cantor, Infantino was candid about the idea, emphasizing that while it poses challenges, it isn't entirely off the table.

“Right now, we're organizing the first World Cup with 48 teams, which is already a big challenge. After that, we'll see what happens,” Infantino said with a chuckle, as Cantor playfully urged him not to entertain CONMEBOL's suggestion too seriously.

Infantino went on to explain his broader vision for inclusivity in the World Cup. “If it were up to me as FIFA President, I'd organize a World Cup with 200 or 211 countries—let everyone in the world play in it,” he joked before clarifying, “But the World Cup is for the best teams, and they have to qualify, of course”.

The proposal originated from CONMEBOL President Alejandro Domínguez, who advocated for the expansion, emphasizing the symbolic significance of the 2030 World Cup as a global celebration.

“I want us to use all our creativity to ensure the entire world is part of this festival—the biggest and most popular event on planet Earth, the 2030 World Cup. No one should be left out of this celebration,” Domínguez said.

The 2030 World Cup will be the first in history to span three continents. While Spain, Portugal, and Morocco will host the majority of matches, South America will play a special role with Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay each hosting one match to commemorate the tournament's centenary.

The push for 64 teams aims to increase South America's presence in the tournament, allowing Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to host their group-stage matches on home soil. While such an expansion presents logistical challenges, FIFA has not ruled out the possibility of implementing CONMEBOL's ambitious proposal.

Winners & losers as awesome Arsenal show Chelsea EXACTLY how to beat Barcelona as Women's Champions League triumph provides career-completing night for iconic Kim Little","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/build-statue-renee-slegers-winners-losers-awesome-arsenal-show-chelsea-beat-barcelona-womens-champions-league-triumph-iconic-kim-little/blta001fbb6aff9f395","Sun, 25 May 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

The Gunners stunned the Catalans in Saturday's final, with Stina Blackstenius' goal securing a 1-0 win and a first European title since 2007

When Arsenal won the Women's Champions League for the first time in 2007, back when it was still known as the UEFA Women's Cup, they were underdogs. Facing Umea, described by former Gunner Karen Carney as ""the Galacticos of women's football"" at that time, Vic Akers' side needed to stop Marta, the sport's greatest of all time, in order to taste success, all while they were without their own biggest star, Kelly Smith, who was suspended. On Saturday, when they won the competition for the first time since that triumph 18 years ago, they had to do it against the odds again.

The situations were very different, of course. In 2007, Arsenal were the dominant force at home and the European triumph they would enjoy was part of a quadruple, the first - and still only - completed by an English side. So while they were not the favourites to come out on top in the final against Umea, and it was a remarkable achievement that they did so, it was not a shock for the ages.

Saturday wasn't that, either - but it was almost the opposite situation. Arsenal haven't won a Women's Super League title for six years now, with their only trophies in the time since coming in the form of two League Cups, and yet they had reached a European final. In it, they were again underdogs, coming up against a Barcelona side that had won the last two Champions League titles and reached the final in six of the last seven seasons. And yet, once more, they upset the odds to claim a second continental crown.

What does it mean for Arsenal moving forward? The Gunners continue to live in the shadow of Chelsea in the domestic game, with the Blues winning a treble this season and not losing a single game in the WSL, but could this triumph act as something of a springboard as they look to challenge their London rivals more consistently?

And what does it mean for Barcelona? Is this simply a case of not being able to win them all? After all, they could still secure a domestic treble themselves, with two trophies already in the bag. Or should the club be concerned by some of the underwhelming performances that have cropped up in Pere Romeu's first season in charge?

John McEnroe is a tennis legend, with seven Grand Slam titles to his name, including three Wimbledon championships and four US Open crowns. 

Since retiring from the game, McEnroe has embarked on multiple different career paths, including music, punditry and commentating, but also briefly took a coaching position with a former Wimbledon finalist. 

In 2016, he joined Milos Raonic‘s coaching team for the grass season, but the partnership ended before the US Open due to McEnroe's media commitments with ESPN. 

Ahead of Roland Garros, which is now underway, he recently hinted at a return to coaching when, in an appearance on ‘Inside the NBA', McEnroe indicated there was a player on the ATP tour he could help.

When asked on the show to pick which American has the best chance of winning a Grand Slam title, McEnroe said: “Ben Shelton to me.

“I like his story because he played football as a kid, went to college for a couple of years, won as a sophomore, so he is maturing in a nice way and improving.”

The American legend added: “His Dad coaches him. Maybe he could bring a part-time coach on for 10 weeks a year.

“Maybe he is on the TNT set right now to try and get him over the hump. But he would be the best [hope].”

McEnroe thinks he could help Shelton get over the line at Grand Slams, where the young star has come close before.

Shelton made his main draw debut at a major in 2022, when he appeared in the first round of the US Open.

It didn't take long for him to make a name for himself on the biggest stage, though, as the following season he found his way to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open.

In the same season, Shelton had his best Grand Slam campaign to date, when he made the semi-finals of the 2023 US Open, before ultimately bowing out to Novak Djokovic.

The 22-year-old had a year-long stretch of struggling at the big four events, failing to make it past the fourth round for the entirety of 2024.

He has since returned to form at majors in 2025, reaching the quarter-finals of the Australian Open for the second time in his career.

Shelton will now look to make a deep run at Roland Garros this year, where he is the 13th seed. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

ATPTour.com highlights five players from the ATP Challenger Tour to watch during Roland Garros.

Emilio Nava
The American is in the French major as a wild card after winning the USTA's Roland Garros Wild Card Challenge. Nava, 23, boasts a season-leading 30 Challenger-match wins, all of which have come on clay. He won three consecutive titles and built a 19-match winning streak that was halted by Chris Rodesch in the Tallahassee final, during which Nava was seeking a fourth straight trophy.


Nava is just the second American to win three clay-court Challenger trophies in the same season and, coincidentally, the first was his good friend Tristan Boyer just last year.


""I'm in a really good moment right now,” Nava told ATPTour.com last month. “I'm super happy of the work we've put in. We've just put the work in day in and day out and we're just happy with the work.


“I think on paper, it definitely is [the best I've ever played]. I'm moving well. Mentally, I think I'm at a place where I'm just calm with my tennis and where I'm at.”




Terence Atmane
A potential match with top seed Jannik Sinner looms in the second round, but the French lefty will be focussed on his first task. There is bound to be a big crowd for Atmane's opening-round clash with countryman and Tour veteran Richard Gasquet, who is playing his final event.


Atmane won two Challenger hard-court titles last month and will look to bring that momentum in Paris as he seeks his first major main-draw victory. The 23-year-old is coached by Guillaume Peyre, who has previously worked with Gasquet.

Jaime Faria
Portugal's Faria reached his maiden tour-level quarter-final at the clay ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro. The following week, the 21-year-old was competing in another ATP quarter-final in Santiago. Faria showed some of his best tennis across both weeks, but then missed two months due to injury.

The No. 115 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Faria won two clay-court Challengers last season (Oeiras, Curitiba), in addition to a runner-up finish in Valencia. He advanced through qualifying at this year's Australian Open, which marked his major main-draw debut. Faria reached the second round and took a set off of record 10-time champion Novak Djokovic.



Ethan Quinn
Two years ago this week, the American won the NCAA singles championship competing for the University of Georgia. Now at a career-high No. 106 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Quinn is playing his second major tournament and first away from home soil. He held his nerve in the final round of qualifying, escaping Argentine Thiago Agustin Tirante in a third-set tie-break to book his place in the main draw.

At a career-high No. 106 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the 21-year-old has faced stiff competition throughout the clay-court swing, having met Carlos Alcaraz at the ATP 500 in Barcelona and #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik in Madrid. Quinn faces another fan favourite, Grigor Dimitrov, at Roland Garros.

Francesco Passaro
Following a second-round appearance at the Australian Open as a lucky loser, Passaro made his Top 100 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Italian has played just five events since Melbourne, including a quarter-final run at the Challenger 175 event in Turin, where he was defending the title.

Passaro is making his Roland Garros debut. He will look to relive his memories from last year's clay-court season, during which he made the third-round in Rome as a qualifier and the following week he won the Turin Challenger, becoming the first player since 2009 to oust five Top 100 players en route to a title at that level.

Rafael Nadal was honoured at Roland Garros on Sunday in a special farewell ceremony that celebrated his extraordinary legacy in Paris. In a poignant tribute, the 14-time champion took a final bow on the Court Philippe-Chatrier, the stage where he carved out his legacy.

In the afternoon Paris sun, Nadal stood before a capacity crowd, which included Carlos Alcaraz and WTA star Iga Swiatek, clad in ‘Merci Rafa' shirts. A stirring video montage played across the screens, capturing the thunderous forehands, the triumphant roars and the iconic trophy lifts that defined his reign at the clay-court major. Towards the end of the ceremony his great rivals, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray, joined him on court.

With emotion in his eyes, Nadal watched the memories unfold, taking in the magnitude of his historic achievements before he spoke openly to the crowd.

“Good evening everyone, this is difficult for me,” said Nadal, fighting back the tears. “I don't know how to start after having played on this court during the past 20 years. To have enjoyed, suffered, won, lost… Above all, [I'm] emotional that I had the chance to play here.

“My infinite gratitude to Gilles [Moretton], Amelie [Mauresmo] and the entire Roland Garros team for giving me the opportunity to have this farewell on without a doubt the most important tennis court in my career.""

Nadal's legacy at Roland Garros is unparalleled. Since his title winning debut in 2005, the Spaniard transformed the clay courts of Paris into his personal domain, claiming a record 14 titles. From 2005 to 2008, Nadal won four straight titles, defeating Federer in the final on three occasions and most notably in 2008, when he lost just four games to the Swiss.

After a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling in 2009, his first defeat at Roland Garros, Nadal returned in 2010 to avenge that loss against the Swede in the final and begin another five-year title streak. His 2012 victory against Djokovic gave him a record seventh crown, surpassing Bjorn Borg. La Decima arrived in 2017, as Nadal claimed his historic 10th Roland Garros title with a dominant win.

“It has been an incredible story that began back in 2004 when I came to Roland Garros for the very first time. I could barely walk due to my foot injury but that year I climbed to the top of the court on my crutches,"" Nadal said. ""I dreamed of coming back the following year. In 2005, I was finally able to play here for the first time. I was 18 years old and my first major experience was the match that I played against my childhood friend and rival Richard Gasquet. From that day on, I fully understood what Roland Garros meant.

“I experienced everything over these 20 years. I have had incredible rivals — like Andy, Novak and of course Roger — and many others who pushed me to my physical and mental limits. Truly nothing would be as thrilling without these long-lasting rivalries that have driven all of us to improve every single day. Roland Garros is unique. Not only because it is a fundamental part of history but for all the people who work tirelessly, with a smile, to make this tournament what it is, unique.”

A legacy that will last forever, Merci Rafa ❤️@rolandgarros @RafaelNadal #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/UPYUzF2M4D

A major part of the Spaniard's success was down to coach Toni Nadal, who helped guide his nephew to 10 Roland Garros crowns between 2005-2017.

“Toni, you are the reason why I am here,” Nadal said during the ceremony. “Thank you for giving up a large part of your life to want to be with me. Training, talking, making me suffer, making me laugh, and also bringing me to my limits. What we have lived was not always easy, but without any doubt, it was worth it.”

Nadal ended his career holding a 112-4 tournament record, according to Infosys Stats.

Lorenzo Musetti marked his return to Court Philippe-Chatrier with a dazzling first-round performance on Sunday at Roland Garros.

The eighth seed, competing at the iconic venue for the first time since winning the bronze medal at last year's Paris Olympics, delivered a stylish all-court display to move past qualifier Yannick Hanfmann 7-5, 6-2, 6-0. With his opening win at the clay-court major, Musetti improved to 23-5 on the surface since July, including a run to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 final in Monte-Carlo last month.

“There was pressure being the first man to start this year [on Court Philippe-Chatrier],” said Musetti. “It's an incredible honour, I've played many beautiful matches and have incredible memories on this court.

“This month has been incredible, I've reached many of my goals, but the best is yet to come. I've managed to find a way to make the click that I needed to make a step forward in my level, and I'm here to show it, so hopefully I will.”



At a career-high No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Musetti has enjoyed a significant breakthrough during the European clay swing. In Rome earlier this month, he became the first Italian in history to reach the semi-finals at all three Masters 1000 events on the surface in one season.

Having lost his previous Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Hanfmann in Madrid in 2023, Musetti was eager to mark his recent rise with an impressive first-round performance, and he did so after a testing opener. The 23-year-old countered Hanfmann's big serving with ease, highlighted by a stunning backhand return winner in the seventh game of the second, one of five straight points Musetti won from 40/0 to break for a 5-2 lead.

Overall, Hanfmann won just 49 per cent (31/63) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys Stats, during the two-hour, seven-minute match. By improving to 9-4 at Roland Garros, Musetti set a second-round meeting with local wild card Valentin Royer or lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan.

Musetti is seeded for a fourth-round meeting with Holger Rune, whom he trails 0-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

The past fortnight has been a whirlwind of emotion for Arthur Rinderknech, and the ride isn't over yet.

Fresh from his wedding to partner Hortense Boscher in Brittany last week, the 29-year-old Frenchman prepares for a pivotal moment at Roland Garros. Rinderknech will take on the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner, in the first round on Monday.

“I feel very good. I got married hardly a week ago, so this is a beautiful part of my private life that is taking place, and I want to continue surfing on this wave,” Rinderknech said in his pre-tournament press conference on Saturday. “Obviously the first round is not going to be easy.

“After all, some people say it's better to play him [Sinner] in the first round than the finals. I would have liked to play him in the finals, but I respect him very well. I managed to beat him once. He's a great player, I'm impatient. I want to enjoy the game on the court, and I will give everything I have, and I believe in my chances.”

Rinderknech will hope to continue that wave against a player he has notched success against in the past. While Sinner leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 2-1, Rinderknech won their first meeting in Lyon in 2021, which was their only battle on clay.
Aiming to forge another memorable win on the surface, Rinderknech will have the backing of a raucous home crowd on his side when they step foot on Court Philippe-Chatrier.
“I love the [crowd], especially the French [crowd],” said Rinderknech. The ‘Blue Tribune' is a little group that has been created that is really supporting the French and animating the whole [crowd].”

Rinderknech first competed against Sinner in 2021 and then played him twice more over the next eight months, so is well placed to comment on the Italian's development.
“I saw him grow. I saw him develop and blossom, and he's a guy I have a lot of respect for,” said Rinderknech. “He is quiet, and that is very important. It's very nice when a player like him says hello to everyone when he comes into the lockers. It's something I really respect. He's a great champion. I believe we have a very good relationship.”
If Rinderknech is successful against Sinner, he will face a second-round meeting with Terence Atmane or Richard Gasquet, who is retiring at the conclusion of the tournament. The 38-year-old Gasquet made his debut in 2002 and notably reached the quarter-finals in 2016.
“I can picture myself there already,” said Rinderknech, who owns a 2-5 record at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “I saw that I was lucky enough to play against Richard here at Roland Garros two years ago. I know what it means. I know the player. I know the person. He's a great guy, and I hope for both of us that we play the second round. It [would] be a great pleasure.”

The second Major of the season gets underway at Roland Garros on Sunday and Express Sport is on the ground to bring you all the latest news. The final round of press conferences will also wrap up, with Novak Djokovic set to face the media following his triumph in Geneva yesterday.

There are no British players in action on day one, where world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka gets proceedings underway on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Rafael Nadal will also be honoured on the main show court where he won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles.

Rafael Nadal said farewell to Court Philippe-Chatrier for the final time with a special guest after being honoured in an emotional tribute ceremony.

The 14-time French Open champion carried his son down from the stands and held him as they both waved goodbye to the 15,000 fans inside the Roland Garros centre court.

READ THE FULL REPORT FROM RAFAEL NADAL'S CEREMONY HERE



Federer, Djokovic and Murray have left Court Philippe-Chatrier but Nadal has been asked to stay behind to receive his own send-off.

""I think it's been a very, very special moment. Perhaps the last time we see those four great champions on the court but I'm sure we're going to see them off the court in the future,"" Tim Henman said on TNT Sports after the Big Four's emotional reunion.

Rafael Nadal addressed Federer, Djokovic and Murray after they came out for his special celebration on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

""We, all of us, achieved our dreams. We became tennis players, we played in the most important tennis stadiums,"" he told his rivals in an emotional address.

They remained on the court as Nadal received a special trophy from tournament director Amelie Mauresmo and FFT President Gilles Moretton.

Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have walked onto the court to honour their old rival, Rafael Nadal.

A video montage of Big Four highlights played in the stadium before Federer, Djokovic and Murray shared a video message. But the video cut out and cameras suddenly panned to the three men waiting in the wings.

""They are here!"" announcer Marc Maury declared.



Nadal's speech is over and he is being honoured by a group of guests. Some dancers performed in front of him before a group of French Open support staff took to the court, and he started sobbing.

""This is a combination of dancers and ballkids who have come onto the court to form a human 'merci' for Rafael Nadal,"" commentators said.

""Now they're joined by a collection of people who have helped and supported Rafa Nadal and all the players here at Roland Garros for many, many years. Drivers, physios, locker room managers, player relations.""

Rafael Nadal became tearful as he thanked his uncle Toni, who started coaching him when he was a young boy and only left his team at the end of 2017.

But his speech was quickly derailed when he admitted he had lost one of his pages.

""I have to admit I lost one of the pages of my speech, but it'll be okay!"" he laughed.

Rafael Nadal is addressing the crowd inside Court Philippe-Chatrier with a speech.

The former world No. 1 recalled his first victory here two decades ago and paid tribute to three of his greatest rivals.

""In 2005 I was finally able to play here for the first time. I was 18 years old. My first major experience was the match that I played against my childhood friend and rival, Richard Gasquet,"" he said.

""From that day on, I fully understood what Roland Garros meant. I experienced everything over these 20 years.

""I've had incredible rivals like Andy, Novak, and, of course, Roger. And of course, many others who pushed me to my physical and mental limits.""



Rafael Nadal's ceremony has only just started and he's already looking teary.

The 14-time champion in Paris is currently watching on as a video plays on the screens inside Court Philippe-Chatrier showing all of his highlights at Roland Garros.

The entire court is orange. Fans are decked out in custom shirts and Merci Rafa signs have been projected across the court.

His uncle Toni is also here along with around 90 members of his friends and family, and he looks just as emotional.

Nadal's wife and son are also watching on.

Rafael Nadal has stepped out onto Court Philippe-Chatrier for a special tribute ceremony.

Everyone in the 15,000-strong stadium is wearing a special, clay-coloured t-shirt saying ""merci Rafa"".

Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz and Juan Carlos Ferrero are among those in the stands.

Musetti wrapped up the final set to love and says he felt the pressure because of everybody anticipating Nadal.

""It was even tougher to enter on court knowing that after my match was this big tribute to Rafa who had been an inspiration to me,"" he said.

""King of clay. He needs all the love he's gonna receive. I'm really happy for him. Really looking forward to the ceremony.”



Musetti is a double break ahead in the third set, leading Hanfmann 7-5, 6-2, 3-0.

Fans are starting to get excited for what could be Rafael Nadal's final appearance at Roland Garros for a while.

Emma Raducanu's former coach Philippe Dehaes has shared a sure-fire way for somebody to be sacked while working with the 2021 US Open champion.

Long before that Grand Slam success, the Brit was working with Dehaes, who has also coached Daria Kasatkina, Elise Mertens and Greet Minnen.

And in a new book, he revealed why Raducanu may be so fussy with her mentors.

""You cannot send her to play a match without giving her a lot of information about the opponent,” he said.

“I knew it, because it was in her profile. But if you started the job and you don't know that she loves to know a lot of info, after three weeks you'll be fired, that's for sure.”

No. 11 seed Diana Shnaider received a medical time-out at a crucal stage of her opening match.

The Russian led qualifier Anastasiya Konstantinovna Soboleva 5-0 in the first set when she suffered a huge collapse and lost six games in a row, allowing her opponent to serve for the set.

Shnaider then had three break-back points when she fell and immediately had to stop playing, calling the physio. She had a medical time out and play resumed almost six minutes later.

The 11th seed managed to get the break back. To a tiebreak we go...



Medics have rushed to Court Philippe-Chatrier during Lorenzo Musetti's clash with Yannick Hanfmann.

The match was paused for two minutes while a screaming woman was removed.

They're flying through the matches on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Olympic gold medalist Qinwen Zheng has beaten Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4, 6-3.

We are awaiting the conclusion of Lorenzo Musetti vs Yannick Hanfmann and then Rafael Nadal will make his way on court.



Ahead of Rafael Nadal's planned tribute ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier, organisers have been handing out special t-shirts to those in the stands.

Nadal will be honoured at the conclusion of the match between Lorenzo Musetti and Yannick Hanfmann. By the time he takes to the court, it's hoped that the 15,000-strong crowd will all be wearing their shirts.

Lorenzo Musetti is not a name on many pundits' lips when predicting who will win the French Open title.

But the Italian is confident of challenging Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic.

Musetti reached the Monte-Carlo Masters final, and semi-finals in Madrid and Rome, in the build-up to Roland Garros.

""I arrived Paris with an ambition to win Roland Garros,"" he said. ""I feel I have improved in every aspect of my game, especially my physicality. I'm ready to chase big titles and consider myself a contender for the title.

""I have never felt so confident in my tennis, and I believe I know how to chase the title.""

And play has resumed on the outside courts.

It's been a bleak day at Roland Garros weather-wise but the fans aren't letting that stop them from enjoying the action. The rain is letting up and the outside courts are being uncovered, with spectators flocking back to their seats before matches resume.

There's a buzz around the grounds today with 14-time champion Rafael Nadal already back on site ahead of his tribute ceremony later this afternoon. The atmosphere in Court Philippe-Chatrier could be even more electric if the roof stays on, trapping and enhancing the noise from the 15,000 fans.

An absolutely stacked day two schedule has just been released and Carlos Alcaraz, the defending champion, has not been selected for the biggest court.

The Spaniard has been given a daytime slot. He takes on qualifier Giulio Zeppieri second on Court Suzanne-Lenglen.



Maybe it's not going to be as brief as we initially thought.

There will be no play on the outside courts for at least the next 20 minutes.

Play has been suspended on the outside courts and the rain covers have been put to use.

This should only be a brief shower.

Top seed Aryna Sabalenka raced through her opening match at the French Open, but she still believes she needs some extra help.

Ahead of Rafael Nadal's tribute ceremony later today, the world No. 1 said she wanted to seek him out and get some advice to help her finally claim the trophy in Paris.

""Whenever someone asks me about Rafa the first thing which comes to my mind is a really hard worker. Everything he's achieved is through really hard work and he's been an inspiration to me, an inspiration to so many players so I'm really grateful for a great example,"" she said on court.

""Of course I'll try to stick around and watch this beautiful ceremony and I'll try to catch him somewhere there and ask him, How? How can I win this tournament? Please, give me one or two advice. I don't need more than that!'""

The world No.1 has destroyed Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-0 on Court Philippe-Chatrier

Five aces and 71% of first serve points won sees Aryna Sabalenka cruise into the second round.



Elina Svitolina has made a flying start, beating Zeynep Sonmez 6-1, 6-1.

The first seed has also fallen with Peyton Stearns, seeded No. 28, losing to Eva Lys 6-0, 6-3



Emma Raducanu played a stacked schedule in the lead up to the French Open.

The Brit competed at the Madrid Open, Italian Open and Strasbourg International.

“I love the fact that she has been out on the match court week in, week out and playing a busy schedule. She's doing all the right things and now it's about continuing that for two years, three years and five years,"" Tim Henman said.

“What is good is that she has invested that commitment and she has been getting the rewards. Sometimes it can take time for success to come. The fact that Emma is such a good player means we are seeing the results and progress come quickly for her.”

Six players have withdrawn from the French Open draw before the first round.

Belinda Bencic is the only women's player to have pulled out of the tournament.

Matteo Berrettini, Kei Nishikori, Emil Rusuvuori, Roberto Carballes Baena and Raphael Collignon also withdrew.

Play is underway on the outside courts but today's weather forecast is looking pretty grim.

There could be prolonged spells of rain meaning action may be limited.



Naomi Osaka dropped down to Challenger level to compete at the WTA 125k Saint-Malo earlier this month - and she won the title.

The Japanese star felt extra pressure competing on the Challenger Tour because of her previous success.

""I would say yes, there was a lot of pressure,"" she explained.

""I wouldn't really say it was to not lose, but it was more like I had in the back of my head, ‘I wonder what people would say about me if I lost here'.

""Granted, I should never be thinking about that when I'm playing a tennis match, but I got over it during the semis.""

We're not on about the iconic daytime TV show here.

Aryna Sabalenka has revealed that she loves being the world No.1 because it puts a huge target on her back.

""Honestly, I just love it so much, knowing there's someone chasing me,"" she said.

""I take it as a challenge. Every time I go out there, it's like, 'OK, let's see who's ready for the pressure moments'.""

Novak Djokovic has claimed that Andy Murray and Roger Federer are planning to join him in honouring Rafael Nadal during the Spaniard's ceremony.

""It will be a very special, very emotional moment for everyone,"" Djokovic said.

""Along with Federer and Murray, we will be there for the ceremony. It will be a beautiful moment.""

Rafael Nadal will be during at a ceremoney on Court Philippe-Chatrier today.

“He will not be playing this year at Roland Garros, but he will be very present by our side for this 2025 edition,” said Ronald Garros tournament director and Olympic silver medallist Amelie Mauresmo.

“Rafa has an important bond with Roland Garros; we want it to be a surprise.”

Alexander Zverev has opened up on the ""extreme abuse"" that tennis players receive on social media.

The German fell ill at the Hamburg Open this week and crashed out in the second round to Frenchman Alexandre Muller.

""These days, social media is more important than anything else,"" Zverev explained.

""We get a lot of hate. For us tennis players, the insults we are exposed to daily online and on social media are extreme, because a lot of it happens via hidden messages, direct messages and the like.

""If I had withdrawn (from Hamburg), I would have been accused of many things. I would probably have been accused of just taking the money and leaving after one match. That I wasn't taking the tournament seriously, and so on. But that's not true; I lost because I was sick. Tennis has a strong culture of blame among fans and also on social media.""



Novak Djokovic may have won the Geneva Open title yesterday, but Mats Wilander thinks he has a big problem at the French Open.

That's because his rivals now have the belief that they can beat him.

Wilander said: ""Once you get to five-set tournaments, where he's won so many of them, I think [his] confidence will come soaring back.

""The only problem is that other players suddenly believe that they can beat Novak Djokovic and that's something that they haven't believed before.""



Good morning and welcome back to our coverage of the French Open.

Play gets underway on the outside courts at 10am BST, with the show courts kicking off an hour later.

John McEnroe believes Andy Murray will stop coaching following his split with Novak Djokovic.

The American shared his thoughts on the duo's partnership before arguing that Murray will quit coaching now to spend more time at home instead with his children.

He said: “I can't tell you right now who I think he'd coached, he's got young children, so he was travelling all the time. So I'm guessing he doesn't want to do that.”

It all begins tomorrow at Roland Garros, and we're in for a very exciting fortnight.

Aryna Sabalenka is among the big-name stars getting their French Open campaigns underway tomorrow.

Here is a quick look at some of the biggest matches from tomorrow.

Philippe-Chatrier - from 11am UK time

Aryna Sabalenka v Kamilla Rakhimova

It will be an emotional day as the French Open organisers have planned a special ceremony for the retired Rafael Nadal tomorrow.

And the Grand Slam's X account have stirred up the emotions on social media beforehand.

See you tomorrow, hasta ma\u00f1ana \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/6acUkxepvL

Jasmine Paolini has assessed her chances of glory at the French Open.

Ahead of the tournament getting underway, Paolini has named four rivals who stand in her way at Roland Garros - them being Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Zheng Qinwen and Mirra Andreeva.

She heads into the Grand Slam in fine form, winning the singles and doubles titles at the recent Rome Masters.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has criticised the ceremony Rafael Nadal received at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga in November last year.

His comments come ahead of the planned tribute to the retired Spaniard at the French Open.

In an interview with 'Clay Tennis', he said: ""The farewell ceremony in his honor in Malaga was really sad, I have to be honest. I think they had planned that ceremony later in the event and were surprised by the elimination of Spain on Day 1.

""When I saw it, I immediately thought that a legend like Nadal deserved a better celebration. Every tournament in the world should pay tribute to him, including Roland Garros. Rafa has made the history of this tournament more than any other player, which is why it will certainly be a beautiful moment.""

Hubert Hurkacz was very gracious in defeat after his final loss to Djokovic.

An emotional Hurkacz was full of praise for his rival, saying: ""First of all, congratulations to Novak, his family, his team. One hundred tournaments, it's a lot.

""It's really inspiring how you present yourself on the court and off the court, it's really incredible what you have achieved so congratulations for that and what you are doing for the whole sport of tennis.""

After securing an emotional win, Novak Djokovic showed his class by paying tribute to his rival, who was almost brought to tears by his words.

It was a bitter defeat for Hubert Hurkacz to take after he went a set ahead, and Djokovic apologised after claiming victory.

Novak Djokovic has sealed glory in Geneva, coming from a set behind to beat Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2).

It's his 100th singles titles and he becomes just the third ever player to reach that milestone.

Not bad preparation ahead of the French Open...



Flavio Cobolli overcame Andrey Rublev in straight sets to claim the Hamburg Open title.

And afterwards, he said he'll be having some celebratory drinks this evening ahead of his French Open campaign beginning on Monday.

He said during his winning speech on the court: ""I just want to hold the trophy and maybe drink a little bit tonight for this amazing day.""

Novak Djokovic has stayed alive in the Geneva Open final after claiming the second set in a nail-biting tie-break against Hubert Hurkacz.

All to play for in the final set...

Naomi Osaka has revealed she endured a 'scary' wake-up call at 5am in Paris to be drug tested.

She was targeted by anti-doping control before the French Open.

She told reporters: ""I honestly don't know the rules about talking about anti-doping. Am I allowed to say whatever I want?

""I don't know. They're kind of scary. Yeah, for me, anti-doping is like - I don't have a great relationship with them, just because they always come and take blood and urine, which I don't know if that disgusts people to say, but whatever, and my veins are, like, very notoriously hard to find.

""One person once told me it was like a Japanese thing. I don't know if that's accurate. Yeah, so they come at 5am and 'stick' me multiple times.

""Usually they can't find my veins, so they have three attempts to find it. Sometimes they can't find it.

""They're like, 'oops, sorry, let me try this arm, let me try this arm, let me try this arm'. I always have to tell them 'hey, my playing arm is my right arm, I prefer the left, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah'.

""And today was kind of scary, because the last year I was here they also came at 5:00am, and the lady couldn't find my veins at all.

""I had huge bruises on my arms for a while. Thankfully it wasn't the same lady. No shade to her. And yeah, today was a success because luckily I had to use the bathroom when they woke me up, so...""

Jacob Fearnley is on a Scottish revenge mission against the Swiss star who beat Andy Murray here last year. But the British No.2 admits he still gets star-struck by meeting tennis superstars.

He said: “We can see it like a Scottish revenge mission. I remember he beat him. I couldn't remember if it was last year or not, but yeah, definitely we could see it like that. Hopefully I can get the revenge for Scotland!”

Hubert Hurkacz has taken the first set against Novak Djokovic!

The Serb delivers a double fault on the first set point and loses the opener 7-5.

What a turn-up for the books this could be.



Daniil Medvedev has warned his French Open rivals that he has never felt in better form on the red dirt.

“On clay I personally feel like I'm playing, honestly, the best level of my life on clay, even considering Rome title [in 2023],” the former world No 1 said.

“A lot of things came together. If we talk about the game, like the movement, the game, the feeling of the game, I do think I play my best season on clay. So it's tough for me to answer.

“On hard courts it's easier for me to answer that, yes, I'm far from the Daniil that I was on hard courts. On clay I feel like I'm even better than before. So that's all I can answer.

“That's good for Roland-Garros because I'll try to show it.”

By Neil McLeman in Paris

Emma Raducanu is fighting her fear of needles to get fit for the French Open.

The former US Open champion admitted she is not “100%” after suffering a back spasm in her defeat in Strasbourg this week.

And the British No.1 is undergoing acupuncture to be ready to face China's world No.42 Wang Xinyu in the first round here.

“It's not feeling 100%,” Raducanu admitted. “I had a spasm in Strasbourg, and just been trying to manage it as best I can doing treatment. I've been on the practice court last night and this morning. Yeah, it felt okay, but obviously it's different playing a match. I'm trying to do everything to get up to speed as fast as possible.

""It is similar to the problem I had in Australia, I would say the one before Australia was worse. I feel like this one I kind of caught before it fully locked up. So I think the treatment is a lot of it with the physios, a lot of it with heat. Been doing some dry needling where they twitch the needle, like they move it.

“At the start of the year I was so scared of needles. It was my biggest phobia. That was the only way I was going to be able to play Australia.

""So since then, I've been kind of dipping my toes into it because I know it helps even though I'm really scared of them. That's how I've kind of been trying to manage it.”



By Neil McLeman in Paris

Jodie Burrage has admitted her boyfriend missing out on Lions selection has hit her form in the build-up to the French Open.

 Scotland scrum half Ben White was devastated not to be picked by Andy Farrell in his 38-man squad for the tour to Australia next month.

""I've been a bit preoccupied mentally, just with a few other things, and I think that's taken more out of me than I thought the last few weeks,"" she said. ""Did the Lions affect me?

""To be honest, yes. He's dealt with it very well but he's been different to normal. When you're in a relationship you've got to be there for your other half and he did that a lot for me last year when I spent six months out and it probably took a lot of effort for him to deal with me during that time.

""So I've tried to be there for him the last few weeks, keep him positive and happy and it probably did take more than I thought out of me but at the end of the day there's always going to be things going on off the court, that just happened to be now.""

By Neil McLeman in Paris

Katie Boulter said staying British No.1 is “not my goal” before she bids to win her first ever singles match at the French Open.

The Leicester City fan prepared for the claycourt Grand Slam by winning the WTA 125 event in Paris last week. She is now world No.38 with Emma Raducanu (43) and Sonay Kartal (53) close behind.

But Boulter, who has struggled with a foot injury this year, said: “I've been in this space for a long time now. I've not been here for one week. I don't even know now. Almost three years, probably something like this.

“I feel like I have ticked that goal of being British No. 1. If my ranking is going in the right direction, I'll remain there. If not, great. The other girls are doing really well. I want to see Emma and Sonay and anyone else pushing me in the rankings. I want that because ultimately it means I've got to get my ranking up to hold that spot.""



Paula Badosa has very low expectations head into the French Open.

The Spaniard has struggled with injuries for the majority of this year and is using the clay Slam to build momentum ahead of Wimbledon.

She said: “I have to be realistic. Of course, I could get excited and excited about being close to another Grand Slam, but this isn't the reality.

""Maybe at Wimbledon the situation will be different, but here I arrive having completed one tennis match in the last two months. The goal in Paris is to play as many matches as possible; every minute on the court will mean a lot to me.

""I approach the tournament without any expectations. If I can play one match, great; if I can play three, phenomenal. I wish the reality were different. You know I love Roland Garros, but I'm coming off an injury, and that's what it is.”

Stefanos Tsitsipas says he is glad that he never had to face Rafael Nadal on the Spaniard's favourite court.

The Greek star said: ""I was lucky not to play against him on the Chatrier, because I don't think it would have been a fun experience.

""I played against him on clay, he has a knack for it, a talent, as he has done for years. I have enormous respect for him. He taught me a lot about the game on clay, about determination, about perseverance on a tennis court.

""I always talked about Roger Federer saying that he was the person I admired, but I think it was a bit of both. I never admitted that it was Rafa too, because I felt like I had a game that was closer to Federer's, but maybe if I had a two-handed backhand like him, I might have played as many Roland-Garros as him, 29 Roland-Garros I think, including 14 victories.

""In fact, it's strange to see him stop competing and live a different life than he lived for years.""

Novak Djokovic gets his Geneva Open final underway and Hubert Hurkacz in around 90 minutes time.

Ahead of that tie, the Serb explained how he continuously needs to adapt to stay at the top of his game.

He said: “Honestly, I change things all the time when I feel like I'm not at the level I want. I'm looking every day, even at 38, even after more than 20 years at this level. I'm not the same player I was 15, 10, or five years ago. You need that mentality to get in tune with the young players. Looking for things every day, improving your game, your mentality.

“I look for a lot of things every day with my team to change my approach to training and tournaments. The situation wasn't ideal before arriving here. But after the first match, I felt confident. I played well in training, but in matches it's always different, with mental things interfering. So far, everything's going very well.”



Richard Gasquet is ready to embrace his final French Open - 20 years after first appearing at his home Grand Slam.

“I'm feeling, of course, it's my last tournament, so it's a bit particular, a bit emotional,” Gasquet reflected.

“But I try my best of course when I'm going on the court to try to win, so we will see what will happen. I just know I try my best to win the match and we will see what will happen. The match is always different. It's the end, maybe the last match of your career. Hard to say. It's special, but I'm happy to do this, I'm happy to play here one last time. I'm practically 39 years old.

“I never thought I was going to be playing such a long time. So I'm lucky enough to be able to do it here one last time. I know what that represents, to play in a tournament like this. So I'm going to try to enjoy it from beginning to end and give my all. It's sport. You never know what's going to happen. I don't know if I'm calm, but in any case, I want it, and I'm going to enjoy it.”

Nick Kyrgios has withdrawn from the doubles draw.

His partner, Jordan Thompson, will instead compete alongside fellow Australian Jason Kubler.

Iga Swiatek has not won a title since her French Open triumph last year and there are concerns over the Pole's form heading into the clay Slam.

She has dropped to No. 5 in the world rankings but is working to change her mentality in order to bounce back.

""Well for sure after Rome, I had a lot of time to think about how I played and what my attitude was,” Swiatek said.

“So, for sure I focused on changing some stuff and also having more intensity because I feel like I'm not starting the matches well.

“And then obviously I got tight a little bit when I played with Danielle, but yeah, these are things that any athlete needs to work on, I would say.""

The schedule for the opening day of the French Open has been released.

World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka kicks things off on Court Philippe-Chatrier against Kamilla Rakhimova.

Ben Shelton headlines the night session when he takes on Lorenzo Sonego at 7.15pm BST.



Kei Nishikori has withdrawn from the French Open meaning Carlos Alcaraz has been given a new first-round opponent.

The defending champion will instead take on 23-year-old Italian Giulio Zeppieri , who is ranked No. 306 in the world.

Jack Draper is planning to talk with Andy Murray ahead of Wimbledon - but he has no plans to hire the three-time Grand Slam champion as his coach.

Murray is a free agent after parting with Novak Djokovic and has long been linked with coaching a British player.

“My team's very set at the moment,” Draper said ahead of the French Open

“I'll definitely pick Andy's brains here and there. I'm yet to speak to Andy about that stuff, but I definitely will, and I know he's always there if I need him.”



Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff were among the players present for showdown talks with Grand Slam chiefs at the French Open. Top-10 stars on the ATP and WTA Tours have made a series of demands, which include increased prize money.

In March, players including Sinner, Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Aryna Sabalenka signed a letter addressed to the four Grand Slams. The letter requested an in-person meeting with tournament bosses to discuss prize money, player welfare, and allowing players a stronger say in key decisions.

Jannik Sinner has been warned he faces a hostile reception when he takes on Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in his opening match at Roland Garros.

Sinner returned from his doping ban at the Italian Open last week and was treated kindly at his home event.

But Andy Roddick fears it won't be the same in Paris.

He said: ""I'm just telling you as nice as the reception was for Sinner when he had kind of that soft landing in Rome, where he was getting standing ovations by the press when he speaks to the media.

""It's like two Frenchmen straight out of the gate, that's a guarantee and then Arthur Fils, he is going to hear it from the French crowd in Paris for the first week of his this year's French Open.""

Boris Becker says he is ""lost for words"" over Novak Dokovic's split with Andy Murray.

""I really wanted to see them both at Wimbledon, actually. Andy knows a thing or two about winning Wimbledon, he's very popular there. I thought it would be an advantage for Novak to have Andy in his corner. I'm a little bit lost for words [as to] why they've broken up just before the second Grand Slam,"" Becker said.

Alexander Zverev opening his press conference on Friday by admitting that his plane was struck by lightning en route to Paris and was forced to make an emergency stop.

""We were supposed to fly yesterday evening at 6.45pm, and we took off from Hamburg,"" Zverev said.

""We got struck by lightning. We had to do an emergency landing back in Hamburg.

""It made a little noise — no real wobbling or anything. It was a first-time experience.""

Emma Raducanu has decided against withdrawing from the French Open after picking up an injury in Strasbourg this week.

The Brit complained about ""long and intense"" spasms in her back, leading to suggestions that she could pull out of the clay Slam to focus on Wimbledon.

But it is understood that Raducanu will take to court to face Chinese world No42 Wang Xinyu in the opening round.



Good morning and welcome to our live coverage from the French Open.

We'll be building up to the tournament, that gets underway tomorrow.

We'll also have live updates from Novak Djokovic's clash with Hubert Hurkacz in the Geneva Open final from 2pm.

Rafael Nadal was honoured at Roland Garros on Sunday in a special farewell ceremony that celebrated his extraordinary legacy in Paris. In a poignant tribute, the 14-time champion took a final bow on the Court Philippe-Chatrier, the stage where he carved out his legacy.

In the afternoon Paris sun, Nadal stood before a capacity crowd, which included Carlos Alcaraz and WTA star Iga Swiatek, clad in ‘Merci Rafa' shirts. A stirring video montage played across the screens, capturing the thunderous forehands, the triumphant roars and the iconic trophy lifts that defined his reign at the clay-court major. Towards the end of the ceremony his great rivals, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray, joined him on court.

With emotion in his eyes, Nadal watched the memories unfold, taking in the magnitude of his historic achievements before he spoke openly to the crowd.

“Good evening everyone, this is difficult for me,” said Nadal, fighting back the tears. “I don't know how to start after having played on this court during the past 20 years. To have enjoyed, suffered, won, lost… Above all, [I'm] emotional that I had the chance to play here.

“My infinite gratitude to Gilles [Moretton], Amelie [Mauresmo] and the entire Roland Garros team for giving me the opportunity to have this farewell on without a doubt the most important tennis court in my career.""

Nadal's legacy at Roland Garros is unparalleled. Since his title winning debut in 2005, the Spaniard transformed the clay courts of Paris into his personal domain, claiming a record 14 titles. From 2005 to 2008, Nadal won four straight titles, defeating Federer in the final on three occasions and most notably in 2008, when he lost just four games to the Swiss.

After a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling in 2009, his first defeat at Roland Garros, Nadal returned in 2010 to avenge that loss against the Swede in the final and begin another five-year title streak. His 2012 victory against Djokovic gave him a record seventh crown, surpassing Bjorn Borg. La Decima arrived in 2017, as Nadal claimed his historic 10th Roland Garros title with a dominant win.

“It has been an incredible story that began back in 2004 when I came to Roland Garros for the very first time. I could barely walk due to my foot injury but that year I climbed to the top of the court on my crutches,"" Nadal said. ""I dreamed of coming back the following year. In 2005, I was finally able to play here for the first time. I was 18 years old and my first major experience was the match that I played against my childhood friend and rival Richard Gasquet. From that day on, I fully understood what Roland Garros meant.

“I experienced everything over these 20 years. I have had incredible rivals — like Andy, Novak and of course Roger — and many others who pushed me to my physical and mental limits. Truly nothing would be as thrilling without these long-lasting rivalries that have driven all of us to improve every single day. Roland Garros is unique. Not only because it is a fundamental part of history but for all the people who work tirelessly, with a smile, to make this tournament what it is, unique.”

A legacy that will last forever, Merci Rafa ❤️@rolandgarros @RafaelNadal #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/UPYUzF2M4D

A major part of the Spaniard's success was down to coach Toni Nadal, who helped guide his nephew to 10 Roland Garros crowns between 2005-2017.

“Toni, you are the reason why I am here,” Nadal said during the ceremony. “Thank you for giving up a large part of your life to want to be with me. Training, talking, making me suffer, making me laugh, and also bringing me to my limits. What we have lived was not always easy, but without any doubt, it was worth it.”

Nadal ended his career holding a 112-4 tournament record, according to Infosys Stats.

The Filipina phenomenon parlayed her breakthrough into doubles with Coco Gauff in Rome.ByDavid KanePublished May 25, 2025 copy_link

Published May 25, 2025

ROME, Italy—Alexandra Eala didn't know doubles players could get called for press.“That's what happens when you form a superstar team,” joked Hologic WTA Tour communications manager Teyva Sammet, who shepherded Eala and partner Coco Gauff into the Foro Italico's mixed zone for multiple media obligations.Only 14 months apart, Gauff is lightyears ahead of Eala in experience, a Grand Slam champion and world No. 2. Sitting together for an on-camera interview, they laughed like old friends despite only meeting for the first time at the Miami Open, where a then-19-year-old Eala stormed into her first WTA 1000 semifinal.“She's such a nice person,” Gauff said of the phenom from the Philippines. “When there's people finally my age on tour, I'm glad to interact.“She seems chill. She seems like she's working hard, so I don't have any advice for her just because she seems relaxed. The only thing I did tell her was that doubles helped me a lot in that space, having some time on court where it's a little less stressful. So, I encouraged her to play when she could.”

Eala and Gauff's doubles campaign became one of the biggest stories at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, reaching the quarterfinals on the strength of two straight-set wins.

After a whirlwind spring, the Quezon City-born Eala could have expected a down week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, having endured a disappointing singles defeat to Marta Kostyuk. Instead, she slid into Gauff's Instagram DMs to pitch a partnership with the former doubles No. 1.“I took a chance!” recalled Eala, herself a former junior Grand Slam champion in doubles. “I felt that we could get along given our closeness in age. She'd done really well in Madrid, so I was thinking maybe I could get her in a good mood.“I'm so happy that she replied and said yes.”Together, Eala and Gauff—who are still looking for a team name, vetoing the fan-suggested “Coachella”—won back-to-back straight set matches before falling to eventual champions Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini. The week became a well-earned reset for Eala, one of the fastest-rising stars in the women's game.

It's such a great learning experience for me. You want to give your best because of how good she is, but I've also learned a lot from how she works, how she warm-ups up and does everything. Alexandra Eala on Coco Gauff

“It's such a great learning experience for me,” she told me. “You want to give your best because of how good she is, but I've also learned a lot from how she works, how she warm-ups up and does everything.“She has a pretty extensive warm-up routine. She's obviously very fit, and for me to get to that level of athleticism will take a bit more time.”A graduate of the Rafael Nadal Academy, Eala has been a quick study thus far. She rocketed into the Top 70 with wins over Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek in Miami, and nearly toppled the reigning Roland Garros champion for a second time in Madrid, leading Iga by a set and a break.The run came to a thudding halt in Rome, where victorious opponent Marta Kostyuk offered sage advice as a former teen phenom.

Eala cut her singles ranking in half after making the Miami Open semifinals in March, guaranteeing a main-draw spot at next week's Roland Garros.

“She's going to make it. She's going to be here, around,” she said confidently and despite handing Eala a 6-0, 6-1 defeat. “But it's just, when you are young, you go through these kinds of days...“I told her at the net, ‘It's a rough road, but you've got it. Just enjoy it,' because it is. It's not pleasant when you go onto the court after working so hard and things don't go your way and you're trying to figure it all out. You feel everything so much more. You feel everything like it's so big, but that's just because their time hasn't passed by. They still haven't had enough matches played, enough sh*t that you've been in!“But it's cool because, if you've gone through that, congrats: you're going to be better on the other side.”The loss may have been the best thing to happen to Eala as she prepares to make her major main-draw debut at Roland Garros. Rather than continuing to marinate in the growing volume of expectations, she spent a pressure-free week making a new friend and enjoying an in-person master class from a player at the top of their game.

Though she won't reunite with Gauff in Paris, fans could see them team up in London to catch Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour before Wimbledon.“I'm so obsessed with Beyoncé's and Blue Ivy right now,” said Eala, whose favorites include “Partition” and “Single Ladies.” “Blue Ivy is really killing it right now, going viral with all of her dancing and stuff. It's crazy to think she's only 13!”With a potential second round against reigning Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, Eala will slide onto the terre battue with ample opportunity to not only make another viral moment of her own, but also build her own path to superstardom.

Iga Swiatek has spent the past fortnight digesting a tough Rome defeat and recalibrating her mindset as she returns to the Roland-Garros tournament chasing a fourth successive French Open crown.

The Pole admitted she had been weighed down by perfectionism in recent weeks, but believes a subtle shift in attitude could be the key to extending her dominance on Parisian clay.

""After [the third-round defeat in] Rome, I had a lot of time to think about how I played and what my attitude was,"" Swiatek told reporters. ""I realised I needed to change something and maybe get a little bit more energetic before matches.""

The 23-year-old, who lifted the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen in 2020, 2022, 2023 and last year, said she had been guilty of over-focusing on mistakes, anchoring them instead of moving past them - a trap for any elite athlete.

""It's not that complicated. Sometimes you just need to be more brave, go for it, and not overthink the errors,"" she said.

Despite recent frustrations, Swiatek said she was buoyed by strong form on the practice court and a sense of homecoming at Roland Garros, where she feels ""just good"" both on and off the clay.

As for conditions, she dismissed concerns about the unpredictable spring weather in Paris.

""I feel like I'm a good player in terms of adjusting,"" she said. ""It's all about reacting quickly. No point to overthink it.""

The French Open is a claycourt Grand Slam tournament organised by the French Tennis Federation. It was first held in 1891 and originally known as the French Championships or Championnat de France.

The French Open is also referred to as Roland Garros after the venue it is staged at, which was named after French fighter pilot and aviator Roland Garros.

Te Anau-born Lulu Sun is playing in the women's singles, with her first round match on Sunday night (9pm NZT scheduled start) against Victoria Mboko from Canada. Sun, listed at 45 in the WTA rankings, made the quarterfinals at Wimbledon last year.

Michael Venus and playing partner Nikola Mektic from Croatia are the seventh seeds in the men's doubles. They play Matthew Romios (Australia) and Gregoire Jacq (France) in the first round on Tuesday (9pm scheduled start NZT).

In the women's doubles, Erin Routliffe will team up with former world No 1 singles player Victoria Azarenka as regular partner Gaby Dabrowski is injured. They have a tough first round match, against second seeds Olympic champions Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani on Wednesday (9pm NZT scheduled start).

The 38-year-old became just the third man in the Open Era to do so.

The world No.1 is determined not to let anything upset her title hopes - or her digestion - as she eyes a first French Open title.

Erin Routliffe and Michael Venus went down to an Australian wildcard pair on Margaret Court Arena.

New Zealanders Michael Venus and Erin Routliffe march deep into the Wimbledon men's, women's and mixed doubles championships.

After becoming the first NZ woman to reach Wimbledon quarter-finals, Sun was beaten 5-7 6-4 6-1 by Croat Donna Vekic.

...

PARIS (AP) — Tommy Paul was pleased to come back to win his first-round match at the French Open on Sunday, of course, but perhaps not as thrilled as he was to discuss regaining the truck that was repossessed back home in Florida when he accidentally missed some payments.

The 12th-seeded Paul kept on truckin' with his clay-court results at Roland-Garros by eliminating Elmer Moller of Denmark 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 at Court Simonne-Mathieu on a day that alternated a light rain and heavy wind with sunshine.

Afterward, the 2023 Australian Open semifinalist explained that his vehicular adventures that arose while he was reaching the semifinals at the Italian Open earlier this month resulted from changing banks and forgetting to properly adjust the automatic payments for his Ford F-150.

“I missed, I think it was, like three payments. They came and took it. I didn't know it happened like that. I didn't know how quick they would come and grab it — like in the middle of the night,” Paul said. “Now I'm watching all these ‘repo' shows, where they come in and swoop trucks at 1 in the morning. It's definitely a funny experience. To be in Europe while it happened is even crazier. But we did get it back.”

He found out that the truck was gone when his trainer — who was back in Florida — asked Paul to check his security camera footage to see whether there were any packages that had been delivered to the house and needed to be picked up.

To Paul's surprise, he recounted Sunday, “There were no packages — and no truck.”

When he scrolled back through the video, the 28-year-old American who grew up in New Jersey saw what happened.

“I'm like, ‘What the hell is going on? There's a tow truck coming and taking my car!' I thought it was stolen at first,” he said.

When he figured it out, Paul took to social media and posted the black-and-white footage of his property being towed away from his driveway, adding a soundtrack of Celine Dion's “My Heart Will Go On.”

ATPTour.com highlights five players from the ATP Challenger Tour to watch during Roland Garros.

Emilio Nava
The American is in the French major as a wild card after winning the USTA's Roland Garros Wild Card Challenge. Nava, 23, boasts a season-leading 30 Challenger-match wins, all of which have come on clay. He won three consecutive titles and built a 19-match winning streak that was halted by Chris Rodesch in the Tallahassee final, during which Nava was seeking a fourth straight trophy.


Nava is just the second American to win three clay-court Challenger trophies in the same season and, coincidentally, the first was his good friend Tristan Boyer just last year.


""I'm in a really good moment right now,” Nava told ATPTour.com last month. “I'm super happy of the work we've put in. We've just put the work in day in and day out and we're just happy with the work.


“I think on paper, it definitely is [the best I've ever played]. I'm moving well. Mentally, I think I'm at a place where I'm just calm with my tennis and where I'm at.”




Terence Atmane
A potential match with top seed Jannik Sinner looms in the second round, but the French lefty will be focussed on his first task. There is bound to be a big crowd for Atmane's opening-round clash with countryman and Tour veteran Richard Gasquet, who is playing his final event.


Atmane won two Challenger hard-court titles last month and will look to bring that momentum in Paris as he seeks his first major main-draw victory. The 23-year-old is coached by Guillaume Peyre, who has previously worked with Gasquet.

Jaime Faria
Portugal's Faria reached his maiden tour-level quarter-final at the clay ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro. The following week, the 21-year-old was competing in another ATP quarter-final in Santiago. Faria showed some of his best tennis across both weeks, but then missed two months due to injury.

The No. 115 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Faria won two clay-court Challengers last season (Oeiras, Curitiba), in addition to a runner-up finish in Valencia. He advanced through qualifying at this year's Australian Open, which marked his major main-draw debut. Faria reached the second round and took a set off of record 10-time champion Novak Djokovic.



Ethan Quinn
Two years ago this week, the American won the NCAA singles championship competing for the University of Georgia. Now at a career-high No. 106 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Quinn is playing his second major tournament and first away from home soil. He held his nerve in the final round of qualifying, escaping Argentine Thiago Agustin Tirante in a third-set tie-break to book his place in the main draw.

At a career-high No. 106 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the 21-year-old has faced stiff competition throughout the clay-court swing, having met Carlos Alcaraz at the ATP 500 in Barcelona and #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik in Madrid. Quinn faces another fan favourite, Grigor Dimitrov, at Roland Garros.

Francesco Passaro
Following a second-round appearance at the Australian Open as a lucky loser, Passaro made his Top 100 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Italian has played just five events since Melbourne, including a quarter-final run at the Challenger 175 event in Turin, where he was defending the title.

Passaro is making his Roland Garros debut. He will look to relive his memories from last year's clay-court season, during which he made the third-round in Rome as a qualifier and the following week he won the Turin Challenger, becoming the first player since 2009 to oust five Top 100 players en route to a title at that level.

Hamilton brands his Monaco race 'miserable' after being left 'in no man's land'

INSIGHT: What it feels like to complete a high-speed lap around Monaco's famous streets

Piastri says Monaco podium is ‘not all bad' as he reflects on ‘tricky' weekend

FACTS AND STATS: Racing Bulls' Hadjar and Lawson both secure career-best results

Leclerc admits he ‘lost the race' in Qualifying but takes positives from competitive Monaco weekend

Lando Norris expertly converted pole position into victory during Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, leading home Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri at the end of an intriguing, strategic race, which saw Max Verstappen hold P1 until the penultimate lap on an alternate strategy.

Norris survived a massive lock-up at the first corner before working through Virtual Safety Car phases, spells of traffic and the mandated two-stop rule to score his second win of the season and slash Piastri's championship lead.

Leclerc applied plenty of pressure at various stages of the race, including that initial run to Sainte Devote and late on when Verstappen backed the pack up, but ultimately had to settle for second, with Piastri – now just three points clear of Norris in the standings – completing the podium.

Verstappen ran an off-set tyre strategy that saw the Red Bull driver go much longer across his stints, giving him the race lead into the very closing stages, but he dropped to fourth after completing his required second stop with a lap to go.

Race results

Lewis Hamilton had a lonely race en route to fifth place, making up a couple of spots following his post-Qualifying penalty for impeding Verstappen, with rookie Isack Hadjar taking a fine sixth over Haas' Esteban Ocon and team mate Liam Lawson.

Williams bagged a double points finish with Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz in P9 and P10, denying the Mercedes of George Russell, who grew frustrated at Albon's defensive driving earlier in the race and picked up a drive-through for an illegal overtake.

Haas driver Ollie Bearman put on a strong recovery from his 10-place grid penalty and some wild moments in the opening stages to take the chequered flag in 12th position, followed by fellow rookies Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber).

Bortoleto hit the barriers at Portier on the opening lap after a scrap with Kimi Antonelli, but bounced back to finish just ahead of Lance Stroll's Aston Martin, experienced team mate Nico Hulkenberg and Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull.

Antonelli was the final finisher in 18th, having completed his pit stops extremely late in the race, with Fernando Alonso retiring for Aston Martin amid engine trouble and Alpine's Pierre Gasly dropping out via a clash with Tsunoda exiting the tunnel.

Race Highlights: 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

After another classic Monaco Qualifying session topped by Norris, attention soon turned to Sunday's 78-lap race around the Principality, and how the new, mandatory two pit stop rule might shake things up over the course of the afternoon.

In short, every driver would be required to use three different sets of tyres across the race, including two different slick tyre compounds, with F1 supplier Pirelli amusingly declaring that “anything can happen” in their usual pre-race strategy guide.

A couple of drivers looking to take full advantage of that new rule were Bearman and Stroll, who lined up at the back with respective 10-place and four-place grid penalties – earned for various red flag, impeding and clashing incidents throughout practice.

Another man to lose grid spots ahead of the start was Hamilton, who recovered well from an accident at the end of final practice to finish fourth-fastest in Qualifying, only to earn a three-place drop for getting in Verstappen's way during Q1.

As the drivers lined up on the grid, with Bearman's car noted for being in an ‘unsafe condition', it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Verstappen, Alonso, Hamilton, Sainz, Russell, Antonelli, Colapinto and Stroll going for hards, and Tsunoda running softs.

Norris started on pole after a pulsating Qualifying hour on the streets of Monte Carlo

Norris got away cleanly when the lights went out and survived a sizeable double lock-up at Sainte Devote to maintain his pole position advantage over a fast-starting Leclerc, followed closely by Piastri and Verstappen, with the rest of the top 10 positions also remaining unchanged.

However, the Virtual Safety Car was soon deployed when Bortoleto – having gone wheel-to-wheel with Antonelli through the hairpin – went straight on at Portier and hit the wall. The Brazilian backed out of it and headed to the pits for repairs, while Tsunoda, Gasly and Bearman also stopped for fresh rubber.

Lap 4 saw the VSC end and the race resume in earnest – Norris managing the situation well to edge away from Leclerc. Meanwhile, the aforementioned battle between Bortoleto and Antonelli was looked at by the stewards, who decided that no further action would be required.

The drama stepped up a gear on Lap 9 when Gasly ran into Tsunoda's Red Bull under braking for the Nouvelle Chicane, forcing the Frenchman back to the pits and into retirement. ”Is he an idiot? What is he doing?” Tsunoda sighed over the radio.

As drivers navigated the debris, Verstappen saw an opportunity to attack Piastri on the run between the chicane and Tabac, with the McLaren man's firm defence drawing a frustrated radio message from the reigning four-time World Champion. There would be no action from the stewards, though.

2025 Monaco Grand Prix: Norris locks up into Turn 1 but fends off Leclerc to keep the lead on the race start

Hulkenberg and Colapinto were the next drivers to pit for fresh tyres under green flag conditions, following a brief pit lane closure due to Gasly parking up at Williams, before Hadjar boxed for softs from fifth and rejoined in eighth, just ahead of Racing Bulls team mate Lawson, who had been backing up the cars behind him.

Alonso and Ocon responded to Hadjar's stop next time around, rejoining in seventh and eighth respectively, with the Spaniard shouting that “I can't push now” on his harder rubber. Stroll and Bearman also took on more tyres, meaning the latter had already hit his two-stop requirement.

After being told to push by his engineer, Hamilton pitted on Lap 19 for a set of hard tyres, coming back out ahead of Hadjar, with Norris doing the same from the lead of the race shortly afterwards and returning to the track in fourth – a huge gap of clean air to work with and hammer in some quick times.

Racing Bulls' strategy became crystal clear on Lap 20 when Hadjar pitted for a second time and took on hards, again rejoining in front of team mate Lawson, before Piastri got called in to try and undercut new leader Leclerc, albeit with a slow stop hampering that plan.

Leclerc duly stopped on Lap 22 and, despite Piastri's best efforts, the home favourite slotted back in between the McLaren drivers – Verstappen, having started on hard tyres, sitting 10 seconds clear of Norris and extending his opening stint.

Verstappen worked his way to the front on a different strategy to those around him

“So now what's the plan? Because that didn't work very well,” Piastri lamented over the radio as the race settled back down. While McLaren pondered that, the only drivers yet to stop at all were Verstappen, Lawson, Albon, Sainz, Russell and Antonelli.

At this point, television footage cut to Russell harassing Sainz just outside the top 10 places, with the Williams man seemingly attempting to create a gap for team mate Albon ahead as per Racing Bulls' plan. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff jumped on the radio to give his driver some encouragement.

Verstappen decided that enough was enough on Lap 28 and pitted for medium tyres, dropping him back down to fourth and restoring the original top three of Norris, Leclerc and Piastri. Ocon, Colapinto and Bortoleto also pitted for a second time, with the Sauber rookie intriguingly taking on softs.

While Norris and Leclerc complained about backmarkers not adhering to blue flags, Bearman added a couple more dramatic moments to his difficult weekend thanks to a wheel-to-wheel scrap with Stroll through Rascasse and a bounce over the kerbs exiting the Swimming Pool section – but no lasting damage was done.

At the halfway mark of the race, Norris led Leclerc by around six seconds, with Piastri five seconds further back and Verstappen hovering two more seconds behind the Australian. “Ah, my shifts feel like the Monaco Grand Prix 1972,” Verstappen then chimed over the radio.

Norris was soon back in the lead, but he had home hero Leclerc for company

Stops for Lawson (taking on softs) and Albon (mediums) meant only Sainz, Russell and Antonelli (all still running their starting sets of hards) were yet to complete a tyre change, while Bortoleto made his third pit lane visit of the day to switch to mediums.

Lap 38 brought another incident when Alonso parked his smoking Aston Martin at the exit of Rascasse and retired from the action, ending what had turned into a tough afternoon for the two-time World Champion after he lost places in the pit lane and developed a power unit issue.

Lawson and Albon pitted together again on Lap 41 to hit their required two stops, maintaining their places at the tail-end of the top 10 in the process, with Sainz moving into the points-paying positions thanks to Alonso's aforementioned retirement.

Williams took the team game to the next level when Albon released Sainz into some clean air and backed up the cars behind in a bid to give his team mate a free stop. That added to the frustration for Russell and Antonelli behind – the Briton accusing his rival of driving “dangerously slowly”.

Piastri was the first of the front-runners to stop for a second time on Lap 49, prompting Leclerc to pit and cover him off a lap later, and then leader Norris to come in for new tyres one tour after that. Verstappen, meanwhile, continued on his way and extended once more.

Russell and Albon's battle then turned sour at the Nouvelle Chicane. After avoiding the back of the Williams under braking and skipping over the chicane, Russell ignored Mercedes' advice to hand back the position. “I'll take the penalty… he's driving erratically,” said Russell.

After a swift investigation from the stewards, Russell was hit with a drive-through penalty. “To be honest… I prefer not to speak,” he said in response. Now it was Antonelli's turn to attack Albon, bringing another near-miss at the same spot.

Sainz and Russell both pitted on Lap 55 to fit new tyres, with the latter being told that his penalty would be delayed “as long as possible”. That meant Antonelli was the only driver yet to complete a pit stop with just over 20 laps to go.

As the lap count hit 60, Verstappen remained in the lead – but with that second stop still to be made – from a closing Norris and Leclerc. With no way through for Norris, it in turn allowed Leclerc to edge ever closer and hover only a few tenths back.

The situation continued into the final 10 laps, with Norris coming under more and more pressure from Leclerc. “Where's Oscar? I need him to put Charles under some pressure,” Norris enquired at this point, adding: “Max is just backing me up. He's not even pushing.”

Verstappen gave Norris a late-race headache before pitting on the penultimate lap

Norris did everything he needed to across a tense phase of laps before Verstappen finally made his second stop, releasing his 2024 title rival, Leclerc and Piastri back into the top three positions, which would remain that way to the finish.

In a statement to his rivals, Norris clocked the fastest lap of the race on his way to the chequered flag, before taking in the applause from the fans and celebrating his first triumph since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix with a cry of “Monaco, baby!”.

Verstappen followed the podium finishers home in fourth, with Hamilton the last driver to cross the line on the lead lap in fifth, and Hadjar, Ocon, Lawson, Albon and Sainz rounding out the points over a frustrated Russell.

Bearman turned 20th on the grid into 12th, ahead of Colapinto and Bortoleto, with Stroll, Hulkenberg, Tsunoda and Antonelli bringing up the rear – the latter waiting until the final stages to tick off his two mandatory stops. Alonso and Gasly were left on the sidelines following their respective incidents.

Nobody could stop Norris on the streets of Monte Carlo

“It feels amazing,” said Norris afterwards. “It's a long, gruelling race, but good fun. We could push for quite a lot of the race. [At] the last corner I was a little bit nervous with Charles close behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco. It doesn't matter how you win, I guess. I had an amazing weekend. This is what I dreamed of when I was a kid, so I achieved one of my dreams!”

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was on provisional pole right up until the last seconds in Monaco when Lando Norris snatched the P1 away. “The disappointment is big,” Leclerc said after the session.

Thereafter, Norris managed the net lead throughout, only losing the position through the two mandated pit stops, which was a new regulation for this year.

Norris found himself behind Max Verstappen in the closing laps, the Red Bull driver still with a pit stop to make but holding out for a stoppage to hand him victory.

Norris' victory is only his second during the 2025 campaign, with the last coming in the Australian season-opener, but the result means he sits only three points behind team mate and Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri.

The Australian finished third and closed on both Norris and Leclerc ahead in the closing stages, as Norris managed his gap to Verstappen in order to not open the door for Leclerc to sneak through.

""The worst bit really was just the end. I felt quite under control the whole race but Max was ahead and Max was kind of backing it up a little bit and I knew then that was when Charles had the opportunity,"" said Norris.

""So I had to manage it quite a lot, I tried to back off Max so I could push when I needed to and chill when I needed to. I still had to manage, it was still a well-fought race but I'm very happy.

""My team are very happy and therefore, we're going to have a wonderful night.""

Charles Leclerc couldn't repeat his fairytale win of 2024, but boy did he give it his best shot. After coming into the Monte Carlo weekend with low expectations given Ferrari's recent form, the Monagasque put his car on the front row in Qualifying and then hounded race winner Lando Norris to the chequered flag, splitting the McLarens in the process. Here's how the voting broke down…

A mandatory two pit stops could shake up this year's Monaco Grand Prix, but you still want to be starting at the sharp end – and sharpest in Qualifying was McLaren's Lando Norris, who took pole from the Ferrari of local hero Charles Leclerc by just a tenth of a second.

Norris has team mate Oscar Piastri riding shotgun in P3 on the grid, but no such luxury for Leclerc, after Lewis Hamilton was demoted from fourth to seventh for impeding. The man he impeded? World champion Max Verstappen, who now lines up in an ominous P4 for Red Bull.

REPORT: Norris beats Leclerc and Piastri to pole with last-gasp lap in Monaco GP Qualifying thriller

We have a rookie on row three in the shape of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar, joined there by the most experienced man in F1, Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso. Row four comprises Hamilton and the Haas of Esteban Ocon, while the second Racing Bulls of Liam Lawson and Williams' Alex Albon complete the top 10.

No Mercedes you ask? George Russell and Kimi Antonelli start 14th and 15th respectively after the former lost power during Q2 and the latter fell victim to the Monaco barriers in Q1.

And at the very back are the other two drivers to take penalties. Aston Martin's Lance Stroll has a one-place drop for causing a collision during practice and a further three-place penalty for impeding. Meanwhile, Haas' Oliver Bearman was demoted 10 places for overtaking under red flags.

The two films fueled the biggest Memorial Day weekend in history, while 'Lilo' supplanted Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' as the holiday's top opener of all time (he's also the mainstay star of the 'M:I' series). 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The Memorial Day box office is on fire. 


	Disney's live-action redo of Lilo & Stitch and Tom Cruise‘s final Mission: Impossible movie, from Paramount and Skydance, fueled the biggest start-of-summer holiday weekend of all time, based on Sunday estimates. Lilo & Stitch blew away all expectations with a record-smashing domestic debut of $183 million and a jaw-dropping $341.7 million globally, while Mission: Impossible —  The Final Reckoning opened to a series-best $77 million domestically and $190 million worldwide.

	Female-fueled Lilo was always expected to beat the latest M:I title, but no one imagined it would hit these heights and, in an ironic twist, see Lilo & Stitch supplant Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick ($160 million) to rank as the biggest Memorial Day opener of all time, not adjusted for inflation. That's not the only irony: Cruise-starrer Minority Report barely beat the original animated Lilo & Stitch when they opened opposite each other in June 2002.

	Three weeks ago, Lilo & Stitch was tracking to open to $120 million. On Thursday, that number had grown to $165 million. But it came in even higher. The reason?


Stitch isn't just drawing interest from families; it's interest exploded among teenage girls and younger women adults — i.e., Gen Z and younger Millennials — who grew up on the first movie and resulting TV show about a Hawaiian girl with a fraught family life who adopts an adorable, albeit trouble-making, dog-like alien. Box office pundits say the nostalgic factor is running high, just as it did among Millennials and Gen Z'ers for Disney's live-action Aladdin, which made $1.1 billion in global ticket sales after getting families, teens and younger adults. Rideback produced both Lilo and 2019's Aladdin.


	For a minute, the live-action Lilo & Stitch was originally intended to go straight to Disney+, helping to explain its modest $100 million production budget. 


	Both films benefited from strong critics scores and glowing audience exits, including five-out-of-five stars from moviegoers polled by industry-leading service PostTrak. Lilo has a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 70 percent and nabbed an A CinemaScore from audiences.


Lilo & Stitch began its historic run by grossing a huge $55 million on Friday from 4,410 theaters, including a record $14.5 million in Thursday previews, the largest preview gross of the year to date and a Memorial Day record for Disney's live-action studio after besting The Little Mermaid ($10.3 million) and Aladdin ($7 million), not adjusted for inflation. Regarding Disney's larger film empire, Thursday's previews also beat Memorial Day entry Solo: A Star Wars Story ($14.1 million). Overall, it repped the seventh-biggest preview gross of any PG title, including Disney's recent animated blockbuster Moana 2 ($13.8 million).

	











Final Reckoning — which had a lock on Imax screens — more than made up for the lackluster $54.7 million bow of Dead Reckoning, as well as supplanting the $61.2 million three-day launch of Fallout to set a new franchise opening record with a three-day gross of roughly $63 million. M:I movies have never been big openers since diehard fans are usually older adults. Ticket buyers over the age of 55 made up the largest chunk of Friday's audience, followed by the coveted 18 to 25 demo. It boasts a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 80 percent and earned an A- CinemaScore.


	Cruise's film, directed by his go-to partner Christopher McQuarrie, began its run with a Friday gross of $24.8 million from 3,857 theaters, including Thursday previews. The film set its own preview record in earning a franchise-best $8.3 million, ahead of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One ($7 million) and Mission: Impossible — Fallout ($6 million).


	A major challenge in terms of Final Reckoning‘s financial success is its $400 million net budget before marketing — making it one of the most expensive films ever made — although Paramount insiders note that each new installment increases the value of the entire library, including a spike in home entertainment sales and rentals of previous titles.


	Thanks to the might of the two films, overall ticket sales for the holiday weekend will come in north of $325 million. The previous Memorial Day revenue crown belonged to the $306 million in ticket sales collected in 2013 when Fast & Furious 6 zoomed to $117 million, followed by The Hangover Part III with $50 million. It would also mark the best showing for two Memorial Day titles going up against each other. In 2007, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End opened to $140 million over the holiday frame, followed by Shrek the Third with $67 million.

	











	While the mash-up isn't expected to be quite the same cultural phenomenon that Barbenheimer was in July 2023, the potent combo of the two movies can't be ignored (as for a moniker, how about “Stitchin: Impossible”?)


	Overseas, Lilo & Stitch likewise went up against Final Reckoning, although the M:I movie began rolling in a handful of major markets last weekend via aggressive previews.


Lilo is reporting an international opening of $158.7 million, likewise ahead of expectations. In a number of territories, it has scored the highest opening day of the year so far, including in China, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France and Italy.


Final Reckoning is reporting an international start of $127 million through Sunday. Both its domestic and international openings were in line with expectations. The movie doesn't open in China until May 30. 


	Also stocking the Memorial Day blaze was the second weekend of New Line and Warner Bros.' Final Destination: Bloodlines, which placed third with an estimated $24 million for the four days for an early domestic cume of $94.6 million and $187.1 million globally. Marvel and Disney's Thunderbolts* came in fourth with an estimated $12 million in its fourth weekend for a domestic cume hovering around $174 million, followed by Ryan Coogler and Warners' sleeper sensation Sinners, which earned another $11.2 million in its sixth weekend. Sinners will finish Monday with an estimated domestic cume of $259 million and $341 million worldwide.

	











	Estimates will be updated Monday morning.

Her credits include 'Elvis,' ‘Snow White,' ‘Mulan' and ‘Hidden Figures,' among others.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Mandy Walker has been elected the 48th president of the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), making her first woman to hold the prestigious position. 


	The cinematographer notably made history with Elvis in 2023 when she became the society's first woman to receive an ASC Award for feature film cinematography. Baz Luhrmann's Austin Butler-led film about the King of Rock and Roll, too, earned Walker an Oscar nomination for best achievement in cinematography. 




	“It is a great honor to be the president of the ASC, and an even bigger privilege to be the first woman to hold the position,” Walker said. “I am so humbled to take on the responsibility of representing a society that has carved out an inspiring, inclusive space to meet and support other cinematographers. I am proud of our century-old legacy to advance the art and science of cinematography, and I'm excited for the future of our organization.”

	Aside from her Academy Award-nominated work, Walker has lent her talents to features including Snow White, Mulan, The Mountain Between Us, Hidden Figures, Truth, Jane Got a Gun, Tracks, Shattered Glass, and Lantana, among others. She's been a member of the ASC since 2011. 


	The ASC announced the news Saturday, while also revealing new vice presidents Eric Steelberg, John Simmons and Patrick Cady; treasurer Charles Minksy; secretary Dejan Georgevich; and sergeant-at-arms Charlie Lieberman. Walker succeeds Shelly Johnson, who passes along the presidency with “a warm heart.”


	“I am intent on making sure our members have the space to grow, the opportunities to educate and learn from one another, and the support of their fellow filmmakers to carve out the best career they can,” she added. “We will continue to lead efforts in raising awareness about the importance of representation behind the camera.”


	The members of the ASC Board, elected by active members, include Natasha Braier, Alice Brooks, Russell Carpenter, Richard Crudo, Karl-Walter Lindenlaub, Tommy Maddox-Upshaw, Erik Messerschmidt, M. David Mullen, Cynthia Pusheck and Amy Vincent. Alternate board members include Chris Chomyn, Ernest Dickerson, Polly Morgan and Wally Pfister

Theresa Wolters steps in as interim executive director, Billboard has learned.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Laura Segura, executive director of MusiCares, has departed the organization after five years as executive director, according to an email sent to staff by Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy and MusiCares.


	The memo announced a “key leadership transition” heading into Memorial Day weekend, revealing that Segura is “no longer with MusiCares” — and that Theresa Wolters, who's been serving as MusiCares' head of health and human services, “is stepping into the role of interim executive director.” 


	No reason or details regarding Segura's departure were given. Billboard reached out to the Recording Academy and MusiCares on Saturday (May 24) for comment. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The leadership and staff directory on MusiCares' website no longer includes Segura's name and lists Wolters as interim executive director.


	Segura was named executive director at MusiCares in 2020, after serving as vp of membership and industry relations at the Recording Academy.


	She was honored at Billboard‘s Women in Music, which recognizes top executives in the industry, in both 2022 and 2023.


	Segura and Wolters, who is now MusiCares' interim executive director, co-penned a guest column for Billboard, “Health Insurance Isn't Enough — Music Also Needs a Financial Safety Net,” published in March.


	MusiCares, founded by the Recording Academy in 1989, provides a safety net of critical health and welfare services to the music community. The U.S. based, independent 501(c)(3) charity offers financial grant programs, support resources and crisis relief.


	Earlier this month, MusiCares reported that nearly $10 million raised for Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts during the 2025 Grammy Awards was distributed to recipients across the region. As of May 2, $6,125,000 was disbursed to more than 3,100 music professionals across L.A, and $3,969,005 had been directed to the community-based organizations California Community Foundation, Direct Relief and Pasadena Community Foundation.


	An additional $16 million was raised by MusiCares and the Recording Academy during Grammy weekend with the MusiCares Fire Relief campaign and its annual Persons of the Year gala. $6 million of that amount was allocated to longterm fire relief efforts, and $10 million will go toward the organization's year-round mission delivery.


	“What moved us most in the days following the Grammy telecast wasn't just the scale of support, it was the spirit behind it, Segura said in a statement on May 2. “Thousands of people gave what they could, and together, their generosity became a lifeline for those in crisis, which reached far beyond our industry. That's why we partnered with trusted community organizations who are helping Angelenos across the region access the care, resources and support they need to rebuild.”

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


Thierry Frémaux, the Delegate Général of the Cannes Film Festival, is propping up the Majestic Beach's main bar. The joint's buzzing, the victors being lionized after what has been acknowledged as a strong competition and selection, and I have the temerity to wonder idly when he'll retire.


	“I don't know,” he murmurs. “You know, in France the social contract is something different.”


	“Even if I'm fired, I stay,” he finishes defiantly.


	He laughs, then turns the tables and cheekily asks when I will retire.


	“I don't want you to retire,” he says caressing my arm. ”Stay with us.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Fremaux first visited Cannes in 1979, driving from Lyon in a truck. Every day that year he remained on the Croisette without watching any movies “because I couldn't attend any film. Each evening I used to go back to the highway and sleep in the car in the gas station.”


	Today (it now being the early hours of Sunday) he says, he will pick up his car at the Carlton ”and go back to Lyon like I was 19 again,” he says wistfully.


	“It's in my tradition to come by car… we need to feel, I don't want to say forever young, but it is something like that. When you, me, whoever, are in the screening room there is no age. No young people, no old people.” 


	Together we marvel over the diversity of the winners. There's Jafar Panahi, the Iranian-born director of Palme d'or winner It Was Just An Accident, and Norwegian Joachim Trier who took the Grand Prix prize for Sentimental Value. Oliver Laxe, director of Sirât, born in Paris to Galician emigrants, was joint Jury Prize winner with Berlin-born Mascha Schilinski the director of Sound of Falling, and so on all the way to Nigerian-born Akinola Davies Jr. who was garlanded with a Special Mention by the Caméra d'or jury for My Father's Shadow which was shown in Un Certain Regard.


	I note that Nadia Melliti who is French-Algerian heritage was named best actress for her beautifully captured performance as a young woman discovering her attraction for other women in Hafsia Herzi's The Little Sister, while it seemed that the the Cannes bubble was cheering for Jennifer Lawrence to win for Die, My Love – Lynne Ramsay's incendiary study of the disintegration of a marriage. Melliti tells me that Herzi's casting director discovered her “walking along the street.” She'd never acted before. Her background was in sport. Now it's in acting.  

	











	I tell Frémaux that it angers me that people forget that Cannes represents the whole world, not just the white western bit of it, and that cinema isn't just the shiny and splashy stuff from Hollywood.


	Nodding in agreement, Frémaux remarks that since the origin of Cannes “we are universal,” and remembers John Ford's comment, “Be local, you will be universal.”


	“We are not in France,” says Frémaux. ”Cannes is not a French film festival. It's a film festival in France and it's an international film festival,” he says reminding me that its official name is Festival International du Film.


	“We have for the first time Nigeria in Un Certain Regard. We have Czech, Iran… Cannes is a journey. We make that journey in the selection process.”


	He observes that in the past Asia meant films only from Japan. “And then in the beginning of the new century, Korea, China, Singapore, Thailand. And now it's Africa and not only ex-French Africa,” while conceding that “maybe not enough” attention had been paid to Africa: “Again, it's a frustration of the festival” but “we pay attention on what is going on everywhere …”


	He looks me in the eye because he knows I'm about to ask about America and the orangutan in the White House, and I mean no offence to the great apes. However, he cuts me off at the chase. “Regarding, of course, the US and what is going on in the world, in cinema not only in Cannes, there is no border. The language is cinema, the emotion is cinema or cinema is emotion. And the emotion is the same wherever you were born.”


	I wonder if others will second my emotion that Ari Aster's Eddington is a masterpiece about the sad decline of the United States?


	Frémaux and I warmly embrace and I scoot over to Renate Reinsve who's so darn good in Trier's Sentimental Value. The actress is taking a break, she tells me, ahead of starring in Alexander Payne's already announced movie Somewhere Out There. “Not one person has a bad word to say about Alexander and I'm looking forward to working with him,” says Reinsve, although she refuses to say what the film's about, except that “it's a remarkable script.”


	Filming, she says, begins in February on locations in Denmark and Ireland.


	Stellan Skarsgård plays Reinsve's father, a film director, in Sentimental Value. I tell him that the character reminds me, in part, of Lear, except that his filmmaker overcomes his madness.


	Later, I chat briefly to Elle Fanning who, as I noted in a previous column, excels in Sentimental Value, just as she did in James Mangold's A Complete Unknown.


	Fanning plays a Hollywood “type actress” in Trier's movie, but says, that she and the director tried not to make her a caricature. Whatever they did, it's some of her best work.  She says that her performance was aided by the fact that she went from shooting Predator: Badlands in New Zealand directly to filming a beach scene with Skarsgård in Deauville. “It was the kind of role my character might have played, so it was very meta,” says Fanning.


	Before he goes, I snap a few photos of Trier and his editor Oliver Bugge Coutté. They've been friends for years and, back in the day, shared an apartment with three others in St. John's Wood, NW London, while they were students at  the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield.

	











	The flat was ideally situated, he says, because it was close to Marylebone train station, “just a few stops to the school,” where the late agent Jenne Casarotto first saw his work and signed him. He's still with the Casarotto Ramsay & Associates agency, represented by Elinor Burns.


	Akinola Davies Jr. shows the same devotion to his longtime agent Roxana Adle at LARK management. The My Father's Shadow director has been inundated since the film was shown at the festival. But he's staying firm with both Adle and Element's Rachel Dargavel.


	“To get to me, they'll have to go through Roxana,” says Davies who was on a hike outside Marseilles when he received a message suggesting he return to Cannes in time for the closing ceremony.


	He was dressed in shorts, T-shirt and boots and his black-tie clobber was in a car miles away in Marseilles. Somehow, he and Nicholas Hayes,his producing partner at Red Clay Pictures, made it back to the Palais in time.


	I felt sad that Akinola's brother Wale, with whom he wrote the film, was not with him.


	However, I shall never forget when Davies's name was called and he stood up – and stood out due to his blond-dyed hair – and the world of cinema applauded him.


	I couldn't make out what he was saying; was it to the crowd or to himself, I asked? “I have a little motto I repeat to myself when I'm nervous,” he responds, about not being alone and to be kind to yourself and others.


	Davies spent most of the night hanging out with Hayes, Dargavel, the BFI's Ama Ampadu, as well as Element's Emma Norton and producer Lee Groombridge who were producers on Pillion.


Pillion's director Harry Lighton won the best screenplay honour in Un Certain Regard and he was on the Majestic Beach too and there was something touching about seeing them engaging and being supportive of each other.


	Spotting Jafar Panahi, I went over to pay my respects and to point out that his winning the Palme d'or had brought tears to Cate Blanchett's eyes.


	“I saw that,” he acknowledges softly behind dark glasses he's still sporting at one in the morning.


	I play the room and the pier one last time. Then I hear the beat of Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now). I look over to the dance floor and it sinks in that the world Frémaux was talking about is on that floor letting its collective hair down.


	The beat that brings us together must never stop.

David Tennant would probably have liked to use the TARDIS to nab the lead role in Walt Disney Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps.


	During a panel conversation at MCM Comic Con in London, the Doctor Who alum was asked by a fan if there were any villains or superheroes he would like to portray that he hasn't gotten the chance to yet. Though Tennant acknowledged he struck gold with the mind-controlling abusive antagonist Killgrave in Jessica Jones, there's another MCU role he would have also liked to nab. 


	“In terms of superheroes, I don't know, I did slightly have my eye on Reed Richards, and unfortunately, it looks like they've gone in a different direction,” he said tongue-in-cheek, “although if it has to be someone, I'm happy for it to be Pedro Pascal, frankly.”

	As the audience whooped upon the mention of Mister Fantastic himself, Tennant agreed, exclaiming a resounding “yes!”


	He continued, “I would have quite liked to be Reed Richards, I'd quite like to be able to do all that,” reaching out in front of him and making a sound effect to demonstrate the character's elasticity power. “So I'll stick with that even though it's gone, even though it's gonna be a while before there's another go at that, I think, unfortunately.”


	He concluded, “I think Pedro Pascal is great. I'm very, very pleased that he exists.”


	Tennant is in good company, as last year, The Fall of the House of Usher actor Rahul Kohli also said he lost out on the coveted role. Rounding out the fictional quartet is Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm (aka the Invisible Woman), Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm (aka the Human Torch) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm (aka the Thing). Additional cast members include Julia Garner as Silver Surfer, Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Ralph Ineson and Natasha Lyonne.


	For the Invincible Man himself, Pascal recently noted that embodying the de-facto leader of the familial superhero clan and fan-favorite franchise character was “really intimidating.” He told Entertainment Weekly, in part, “You really want to make people happy, especially if it's something that's widely known with particular expectations around it because you want those expectations to be met. You also want to be authentic to yourself so that it can be the best that it can be for anybody who wants to be entertained by a story and travel with us into this world.”

	











	Due in theaters July 25 and helmed by three-time Emmy nominee Matt Shakman, First Steps marks the fourth attempt to translate the original comic book characters to the silver screen. This time, the action will take place in an alternate history/parallel universe set in the '60s, offering a retrofuturistic environment for audiences.

PREVIOUS, SATURDAY: Big weekend at the global and international box office as Disney's Lilo & Stitch and Paramount/Skydance's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning take center stage. 


Lilo & Stitch, the live-action take on 2002's animated adventure, started rollout on Wednesday and is now playing in 50 material offshore markets, grossing $56.3M through the first three days overseas. 


	Included in that bunch are the biggest opening days of the year in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil, Mexico and Spain. That's great news, especially as this is a family property with no offshore holidays, and ahead of the key Saturday and Sunday plays.


	Internationally, the full opening frame is expected to come in ahead of pre-weekend projections. Along with domestic, the global opening has already exceeded $100M with $111.3M through yesterday. 


	The little blue alien's top markets through Friday are Mexico ($9.4M), UK ($4.2M), France ($4.1M), Italy ($3.8M), Brazil ($3.7M), Germany ($2.5M), Central America ($2.2M), China ($2M/$5.7M through Saturday – not reflected in totals above), Spain ($2M).


	The other mega movie in the mix this frame, Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, is at $75.9M through Friday in 64 offshore markets (80% of the footprint). The Christopher McQuarrie-directed actioner has had extensive previews that began last weekend, as we noted in our global preview, and through Friday, it's running 8% ahead of the 2023 installment, which had similar previews, at the same point. 

	











	Along with domestic, the global total through Friday is $100.7M.


	The top markets are as follows, all are including previews: Korea ($8.9M), Japan ($6.5M), Australia ($5.4M), UK ($5.M/No. 2), France ($3.9M), Germany ($3.6M), Mexico ($1.9M), Brazil ($1.5M), Spain ($570K).Important to note that this is not a race between the two movies. Rather, it's a terrific energizer for cinemas around the world. Both Lilo and Mission are scoring with critics and with audiences; it's a wonderful way to kick off summer moviegoing.


	We'll have a full update on Sunday.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	The one person who actually went to prison for the 2021 shooting death of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins is free just weeks after the tragedy suffused Alec Baldwin starring indie Western premiered and then promptly disappeared in a cloud of box office dust earlier this month.


	According to the New Mexico Department of Corrections, the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was granted parole earlier this week and released on May 23. Having served the state statute required 85% of her 18-month sentence and received extra marks for good behavior and the completion of a drug rehab program, records show Gutierrez-Reed having signed out of the Western New Mexico Correctional Facility on Friday morning. She quickly headed to her home in Bullhead City, Arizona where she will serve out her parole.

	A very situation specific part of that parole is that Gutierrez-Reed cannot have contact with Hutchins' widower, child or any other member of the filmmaker's family.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The stepdaughter of famed movie gun coach Thell Reed, the relatively inexperienced Gutierrez-Reed was charged with involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering out of Hutchins' death from a gun in Baldwin's hand going off.  Even before Gurierrez-Reed was charged in January 2023, the prosecution claimed the armorer was responsible for live rounds ending up on the Rust set. In a production under intense budget and time crunches, and film crews quitting, those live rounds got into Baldwin's 1880s Colt .45 replica that that fired during rehearsals on the Bonanza Creek set, striking Hutchins and director Joel Souza. 


	With her parole stretching from May 23, 2025 to May 23, 2026, the twentysomething Gutierrez-Reed has to get a job, as well as submit to a curfew, and mental health assessment as some of the conditions of her parole. She also can't own guns, has to meet regularly with a parole officer and agree to electronic monitoring. In point of fact, Gutierrez-Reed is under what's called dual supervision. That shakes down as a year for her involuntary manslaughter convictions and a year and a half for a different charge of “unlawfully” entering a firearm banning Santa Fe bar before Rust went into production with a gun on her.

	











On March 6, 2024, a Sante Fe jury found the Rust armorer guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal October 21, 2021 shooting. Despite the state's best effort, the jurors' decision was split as they decided the defendant was not guilty of evidence tampering. Six weeks later, Gutierrez-Reed was sentenced to 18 months bars.


	Baldwin never ended up spending a second in prison, nor even a full week before a jury in his own case last summer. The media frenzy matter was tossed out four days in by the judge due to evidence suppression by the prosecution and local cops. All appeals have been dropped, though the 30 Rock actor and now reality star in January filed paperwork to pursue a civil rights violations lawsuit against the special prosecutors.


	Gutierrez-Reed continues to have appeal of her conviction moving through the New Mexico courts. Her defense lawyer Jason Bowles did not respond Saturday to request for comment from Deadline on his client's release from prison.


	Finding a new cinematographer in Bianca Cline, the eventually finished Rust debuted at a Polish film festival in December 2024. The movie finally found U.S. distribution via Falling Forward Films, with a short lived domestic theatrical run starting on May 2.

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


	Renowned comedian and actor Dick Van Dyke revealed that he and longtime friend, the late great Ed Asner, were set to team for a remake of classic comedy The Odd Couple prior to the latter's death in 2021.


	“That would've been such fun, and we lost it. I've lost a lot of friends,” Van Dyke said during a Q&A at a Dick & Arlene Van Dyke Present Vandy Camp event held in Malibu, Calif. today, per People.


	Wife Arlene Van Dyke chimed in, adding, “He's outlived everybody. That's the curse of living to almost 100.” (Van Dyke is 99, and Asner was 91 when he died.) Despite this, she maintained that the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang star is “still so positive” in the face of grief.“Well, life's been good to me. I can't complain,” Dick answered as to how he stays upbeat. He added later of why he continues to perform and entertain, “I'm a ham. I love it. I get a jolt of energy from an audience.”

	











The Odd Couple — about two recently divorced men, neurotic neat-freak Felix and carefree slob Oscar, who decide to live together — was created by Neil Simon in 1965 as a play, before he translated it for the silver screen three years later with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in the roles. A box office and critical success, the comedy was later adapted into sitcom format for ABC, featuring Tony Randall as Felix and Jack Klugman as Oscar, running for five seasons beginning in 1970 and winning three Emmys. A sequel to the original film was released exactly three decades later, exploring the titular duo's road trip to their son and daughter's wedding, but it was a critical and commercial bust.

	After first strutting into the ‘Werk Room' four years ago, Tina Burner is pulling back the wig to share her mental health journey.


	The RuPaul's Drag Race Season 13 alum, who is currently competing on Season 10 of All Stars, recently thanked the show's therapy resource, Queen Care, for helping her discover her autism and ADHD diagnoses after facing “hate” and “negativity” from fans the first time around.


	“Tomorrow I am back on your screens. Although exciting it also feels like I am bracing for a storm,” started Burner (real name Kristian Seeber) in an Instagram post. “The first time around on Season 13, I have to say, I wasn't fully prepared for what would follow. The darkness, the hate, the confusion.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Burner said she's “grown so much as a person” since her debut on the competition series in 2021. “I've pushed myself to actually find out who I really was,” she added.


	“Not only in my physical drag transformation, but more so on the inside,” wrote Burner. “My whole life there have been so many things I never understood. Why I am who I am. Why I act certain ways in social settings, in relationships, in friendships and just life in general. My overwhelming focus on things and certain patterns. For years I tried to ‘quiet the creative' inside me.”

A post shared by Tina Burner (@thetinaburner)


	After turning to “overworking and alcohol” to “silence or slow down what I felt inside” during her debut season, Burner was introduced to Queen Care, which is “therapy at your disposal provided by RuPaul's Drag Race.”


	“For the first time in my life therapy didn't feel like a stigma but rather a tool to help,” wrote Burner, noting that Queen Care referred her to Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York City, where she was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD.


	“I finally had answers to so many questions,” she wrote. “If you know me you know I love a project. For the first time in my life, THE PROJECT IS ME!!! SO I wanna say thank you Thank you for the hate. Thank you for the negativity. Without it I would have never found myself.”

Chrissy Teigen is opening up about her latest cosmetic procedure after fans were left concerned by a recent hospital photo.

On May 23, the model, successful cookbook author, and mom of four shared on her Instagram Stories that she had undergone a “hairline lowering procedure.” The update followed an earlier post in which Teigen appeared in a hospital bed with a bandaged forehead, prompting widespread speculation online.

The post read, “Hi friends! [A] lot of you have been wondering about my hospital pic which is very understandable as I gave no explanation lol,” Teigen, 39, wrote in her Instagram post. “I had a hairline lowering procedure.”

Teigen, known for her candidness with fans, explained that the decision came after years of feeling self-conscious about extensive hair loss at her hairline. “Lost a lot in the front from babies and it's just very thin up there,” she revealed. “When you see it on a carpet, it's ALWAYS extensions.”

Per Johns Hopkins Medicine, “Postpartum hair thinning or hair loss, known as telogen effluvium, is a common condition that occurs when hormone levels drop back to their regular levels after childbirth.”

Teigen and her husband, singer and The Voice coach John Legend, 46, share four children: Luna Simone, born in 2016; Miles Theodore, born in 2018; and Esti Maxine and Wren Alexander, both welcomed in 2023, with Wren arriving via surrogate, Per People.

While the TV personality did not offer extensive details in her latest update, Teigen promised fans she would “share more later” if they were “interested” in hearing about the procedure, describing it as “a journey.”

Teigen is no stranger to publicly discussing her cosmetic treatments on social media. In 2021, she shared on Instagram that she had undergone an eyebrow transplant procedure, where hairs from the back of the head are grafted onto the face to create fuller brows.

Teigen later posted an update of her post-surgery brows, calling the results “crazy” and noting, “They look so cool,” while pointing out how the procedure evened out her brow line.

While Teigen has been open about cosmetic enhancements, she maintains a humorous and grounded approach, often sharing the realities behind the polished red carpet looks. As fans wait for more details about her latest procedure, Teigen's willingness to share her beauty journey continues to resonate.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jamal Roberts Goes Back to Work at Mississippi School After Winning ‘American Idol'","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jamal-roberts-teacher-back-to-school/","Sun, 25 May 2025 13:52:21 GMT","

Right after winning season 23 of “American Idol” on May 18, 2025, Jamal Roberts was whisked from Los Angeles to New York to make media appearances, including performing on “Good Morning America” and appearing “Live with Kelly & Mark.”

Although he shared on social media how exciting that trip was, Roberts also told multiple reporters how pumped he was to go home to Meridian, Mississippi, eager to see family and friends including his two young daughters — Harmoni, 6, and Lyrik, 4 — and newborn daughter Gianna Grace. 

But Roberts also couldn't wait to make time for the staff and students at Meridian's Crestwood Elementary, where he works as a physical education teacher. Within days of his big win, the man known as “Coach Jamal” was back at the school on “bus duty,” as seen in a Facebook Live video posted to the school's Facebook feed. 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

With his star on the rise and his single “Heal” topping the iTunes charts, Roberts likely won't be returning to his full-time role at Crestwood Elementary anytime soon. But he plans to pitch in whenever he can. Even before “American Idol,” he worked there because he loved it while regularly performing gigs.

The 27-year-old told USA Today right after his win, “I wasn't really doing the teaching thing for the money. It was really the kids, (who are) just my inspiration. So even if I could go back every now and then, just show up and be a part of something, I plan to do that.”

That's exactly what he did during his first week as the season 23 winner, hanging out with staff who were thrilled to see him back, and running outside with a walkie talkie on “bus duty,” helping to get the kids where they needed to go after school. 

“He loves his Crestwood family,” the staffer filming the video sang while filming Roberts shaking his head and smiling at her as he sat atop a lunchroom table, surrounded by teachers happy to see him. “He came back home to be his authentic self! And he's on bus duty, he sure is.” 

“He's back for a little while,” she continued. “Don't rush off neither!” 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

A whopping 20,000 supporters gathered to see the mini-concert Roberts gave at City Hall as part of his hometown visit on “American Idol,” the show reported. On May 30, it's possible even more will show up there for a free “Celebration for Jamal Roberts” concert the city has planned at 7 p.m., per WTOK. 

Fans can bring lawn chairs to the event or pay $50 for a VIP ticket closer to the stage, according to materials about the event. 

Roberts has been enjoying some downtime at home, bonding with his newborn Gianna — born in early May — and even stopped by Exclusive Cuts for a trim, as shared on Facebook by local hairdresser Dermaine Johnson on May 22. 

Roberts will be in Nashville for CMA Fest on June 4, but has a couple of other Mississippi concerts planned in future months, according to Super Talk Mississippi. On August 8, he's scheduled to perform at Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero Blues Club in Biloxi — a gig planned before his “Idol” run that's already sold out. 

Meanwhile, on September 19, Roberts will headline a fundraising concert at the Jackson Convention Complex titled “A Night of Soul, Celebration, & Support for Alcorn State Athletics.” General admission is $110, with VIP tables available for $1500.

[Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.']

Mid-way through his conversation with IndieWire, Richard Harmon paused for a passing truck. Already on location for his next movie, the “Final Destination Bloodlines” actor stepped offset in sunny British Columbia to pick apart his performance as Erik Campbell in Warner Bros.' hit reboot. 

Directed by Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky, the sixth installment in New Line's beloved freak accident franchise is the best movie of its kind. It also has one of the funniest and most relatable characters in the series: a magnetic fan favorite Harmon was destined to play but who the actor calls “misunderstood.”

 








Related Stories Seth Rogen Wants Daniel Day-Lewis to Cameo on Season 2 of ‘The Studio': ‘His Process Is So Specific' These Cannes 2025 Prize Winners Will Inspire Oscar Campaigns 

“I'm not bad, just drawn that way,” he quipped on behalf of them both. A testament to Harmon's kaleidoscopic talent — and a fitting ode to the friendly 2000s faces genre fans once had to loiter in Hot Topic to meet — the hilarious alt sweetheart is a great excuse to quote Jessica Rabbit. Promoting the vicious summer blockbuster, which opens on a high-res restaurant collapse set in the '60s that feels very “Looney Tunes,” Harmon has readily defended his complex performance to the press.

“Obviously, I wanted him to be likable,” the actor told IndieWire. “The amount of interviews I've done where people are like, ‘So, Richard, you play a bit of a dick!' And I have to keep fighting back on that.” An accomplished Canadian actor, who made his debut in the cult classic “Trick ‘r Treat,” Harmon has spent his career haunting across genres with memorable indie appearances (including 2013's “If I Had Wings”) and a slew of horror TV performances, from “The 100” to “Bates Motel.”

Sacrificed to a second triumphant weekend at the box office, Erik Campbell doesn't survive “Bloodlines,” but the impact of Harmon's tragicomic arc suggests a “Final Destination” legacy all its own. From a surprise reunion with former school classmate Max Lloyd-Jones to several alternative Jerry Fenbury reactions left on the cutting room floor, read on for lifelong franchise fan Richard Harmon's complete post-mortem account of the dreamiest nightmare in his filmography so far. 

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
 










You love these movies, famously. Tell me about your history with “Final Destination.”

Well, I was 11 when the second one came out, and I remember me and a few of my elementary school friends were having a sleepover. I forget whose parents' house it was, but they didn't look at the rating of the film that they rented for us. Our request was the second “Final Destination,” so that was the first one I saw actually. And we were just howling. We loved it. Well, some people couldn't watch it. But I could watch it and I loved it. Then, I went back and watched the first one, and then I watched the third, fourth, fifth, and now I'm in the sixth. I've watched them over and over and over and over again. The one that I've seen the least is mine, but I'm sure that I'll eventually have seen it the most. 

What do you like about them as a comfort watch?

I'm just a real horror movie fan. “Comfort watch” is the right way to put it. It's very soothing to make light of death, which I don't think we get the opportunity to do very often in our real lives, because it's obviously the thing we fear the most. But for an hour and a half when you're watching a “Final Destination” movie, you get to kind of root for death, which is rare. That's pretty fun and kind of takes away from the constant fear we all have.

 










Take me back to your debut with “Trick ‘r Treat” and your first credit as Vampire Kid. 

When I was 15, I was thinking about quitting acting, you know? I was a teenager, so I didn't take it very seriously back then. I just knew that I loved being on set, but I hadn't booked any big roles or anything up to that point. I kept having to spend time doing auditions that I never booked, and, you know, poor 15-year-old me, I guess, he was frustrated. 

Then, I got an audition for “Trick ‘r Treat,” and I said, “OK, fine, this is my last audition. I'll give it a chance.” Got a callback. Got another callback. Got to meet Mike Dougherty, who directed it and wrote it. He's an amazing, amazing filmmaker, and I ended up getting the role. But even then, I was saying, “Well, I'll leave the business this way after this.” 

It was a two-month shoot, which at that point was the longest I'd ever done. And of course, I just fell in love with it and suddenly thought, “There's no way I can quit this. I need to make this work!” I started working a lot harder than I had before, and said to myself, “If you're really going to do this, take it seriously.” I was already in love with Halloween and horror but with “Trick ‘r Treat,” it was even more so.

How did you end up auditioning for “Final Destination Bloodlines”? 
 










It was funny! My agent sent it to me over an email that said, “You have an audition for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.'” And I just thought, “No way, they're bringing back the franchise? I gotta be a part of this!” I auditioned for Erik. I thought I did really well. Then, I didn't hear back for eight months. I knew when they were supposed to start shooting it, so I was like, ‘I didn't get that.' I even auditioned to play my grandfather in the '60s, but I'm so much more Erik. I'm not this all-American heartthrob like Max Lloyd-Jones. We went to high school together, oddly enough.

Really? That's crazy. 

Same grade. We were the two actors. Now, he's playing my granddad. [Laughter.] But I knew I was never going to book that — and I didn't. Eight months went by and the strikes happened. When production came back, they said again, “You have an audition for ‘Final Destination Bloodlines.'” And I got a little pissy about it and was like, “I already auditioned for Erik. I already did this role. They can just see my old tape.” 

That's a very Erik reaction.

[Laughter.] Yeah, but my agent was like, “Richard, please. Just do the audition.” So, I did it and the very next day, I'm getting off this red-eye flight into New York City. I had barely slept, and suddenly they're asking, “Can you be available to do a Zoom with the directors tomorrow?” I was still in New York, staying on my friend's couch, and I told my friend, “You got to leave.” 

 










So, I did it with them and I thought it went well. I kept saying to myself, “God, I would love to be a part of this.” They took a week and I knew it was coming down to me and a couple other guys. I'm hoping. I'm praying. Then, I got the call from my agents that I had booked it, and I bawled my eyes out. I cried on my kitchen floor. It was like the greatest thing that's ever happened. I sit here on this bench now, and I still believe it might be the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. Other than meeting my girlfriend and all that, of course. But this is up there! 

When were you able to chat with your former peer/eventual grandfather about both getting cast in “Bloodlines”? What was Max's reaction? 

We were on set, actually. I came to the first day, when they were shooting some of the stuff in the '60s. I just wanted to get the vibe of the production because every film and TV set brings its own. So even though I wasn't working, I wanted to show up, hang out, see how our wonderful directors Adam and Zach worked, and figure out how to best prepare myself. That's where I saw Max. We had a big hug, and it was pretty wild! We couldn't believe we were both in this(*). 

(*) In an email to IndieWire, Lloyd-Jones reacted to Harmon's performance and wrote, “I've been so impressed watching Richard's rise since we first met in Mr. Grenier's 8th grade drama class at Sentinel Secondary School.” He continued, “I felt very lucky to share the stage with my boy. His screen presence is magnetic and it made me very happy to watch him get the biggest laughs and in my opinion the gnarliest death of the franchise.” 

 










Richard, you, Max, and Zach, you're all Canadian, right? I feel like a lot of people don't know the country's history with the franchise.

Yeah, a lot of it was shot in Vancouver. All of them except for the fourth one, really. That was Atlanta and New Orleans. But other than that, it's been a Vancouver franchise. Most of the leads aren't from Canada, but in this one, we have me, we have Max, and we have Kaitlyn Santa Juana as Stefani, who's our wonderful number one and my character's cousin. We're all locals, which is rare to book a big budget film in Vancouver as one of the locals. You rarely ever get that opportunity. We were finally able to break that door down, I guess.

Do you think that's part of why you had such great chemistry with your cast? Anna Lore's not from there, but she was saying what an amazing time she had.

It was so special for all of us. It didn't matter where any of us were from. Anna's in Los Angeles now. Owen Patrick Joyner's from Oklahoma. Rya Kihlstedt is in Los Angeles, too. But it was just sheer luck that every single person on this cast was so nice. We fell in love with each other so much and became a family. I've been texting them this morning. We're on a group chat that hasn't stopped since we were filming the movie.

 










Does it have a name?

Final Dipshits.

You've got two major scenes in “Bloodlines,” including the rare “Final Destination” fake-out. Let's start with Erik getting strung up by his nose ring at the tattoo shop. How was that? 

It was only the second week of shooting, and it was just amazing to film. I was on wires. There was real fire underneath me. I'm literally being hung by my nose. They built that whole set inside of a studio so they could have wire tracks all along the ceiling. No acting was needed, really. 

How did that work from a practical perspective? 

There was something inside of my nose. Do you know those things that sort of open your nostrils? They're for people that can't breathe through their noses when they're sleeping. They had that, but they reversed it, almost. It was able to spread pressure across my nose so it wasn't too heavy on any one area of my nostril. That was great because then I wasn't in so much pain. Then, they put me up on the wires, which kind of went through the chain that you see attached to my nose. They hid them up through that, and when I moved, they were able to follow me and hold me so I didn't fall flat on my ass. But, yeah, they basically just lit the fire and let me go. It was incredible.

 










And you truly had a good time doing all of that? It wasn't—

It was some of the most fun I have ever had. Seriously. 

Let's keep going in order. Your next scene isn't Erik's biggest but you play a critical part setting up Julia/Anna's moment with the garbage truck. That's also the first real kill in the Campbell family. How did you feel about approaching that scene and teeing up your sister's demise? 

That's the thing. We're all so excited to meet our dooms in these films. That's what these movies do to you. Like, I wanted to die. I wanted to die horribly! To set that scene up, we actually had a little bit of an issue that day because the dump truck stopped working. It just stopped picking things up, which is obviously a problem when you're putting a stunt actor inside and legitimately throwing her into a pile of blankets and pillows. We had to move it to another day because, as a rule, you have to make a stunt work like a hundred times without fail before you can even think about putting a performer in there. 

When we came back to redo it, I thought it worked beautifully. What I love about that scene is that the whole thing takes place in soft focus in the background while Erik is talking, but you still see everything that's happening to Julia. You see her get hit in the head with that ball and then just flip right into the trash. It might be my favorite death in the movie. It's absolutely hilarious.

 










It's so effective and snaps the focus onto Erik just as the emotional side of “Bloodlines” is really starting to hit. Chatting with Adam and Zach, they went on and on about how much improv you did for the film. Was Jerry Fenbury in the script? How did we get there?

Ah, Jerry Fenbury. [Laughter.] I'm hoping there's a bonus feature on the DVD that includes the like 35 different takes we did for that scene. Jerry Fenbury was in the script, but how I reacted to it was not. I knew I was supposed to be heartbroken, go to leave, and then my mom, April Telek, would follow me out. But Zach and Adam were like, “Hey, if you wanna throw something in when you leave, like a little button, just do it.” I've got plenty of those. So, that's where we found, “Is that why he always wants to play catch?” We had a lot of takes, but I did a different one every single time. That was the only time I ever said that. 

Can you give me some alts? 

One we couldn't use because we had to call cut when Kaitlyn and the rest of them broke down laughing. As I left the room, I had a tear in my eye, and I turned around and I was like, “Oh, God, is that why he always calls me Buckaroo?“

Another one was like, “Is that why he always hands me hard candies?” Or, “Is that why he came to every single one of my swim meets?” I'm trying to remember all of them now. There were more than 30 of them. “Is that why he always follows me into the park?” “Is that why he sends me Christmas cards every year?” 

 










There was one where he wasn't a loser. The whole impression you get of Jerry Fenbury from their reaction to it, especially Owen's reaction as my brother, is that he's a fucking loser. When Bobby hears it, he's like, “Oh, God. Not him.” So, for one of the takes, I switched it up to Jerry not being a loser. I heard the cue, looked at April, and went, “Fuck, mom. Fenbury got you too?!“

We had a lot, a lot, a lot of takes that I hope one day I get to see(*). 

(*) Speaking with IndieWire, “Final Destination Bloodlines” editor Sabrina Pitre said she'd be happy to take on the project — adding, “I was completely spoiled with choices because of Richard.” 

You also had options for props. How did you choose the Show Me Your Kitties mug?

We had five different mugs, and I chose the Show Me Your Kitties mug, which in fact now lives at my house. I fully took it. I forget what the other options were because that had to be it. I don't even use that mug. It's on my mantle. One of our prop guys snuck it to me at the end of the day. I was like, “Dude, I want this mug.” He looked at me, then he looked around, and then he shoved it into my hand and said, “Walk away. Now.” And I went, “OK, yep!”

In the history of “Final Destination,” “Bloodlines” is the first film to really capture the feel of the franchise's overall legacy. Erik is one of the more sympathetic victims of Death's Design, if only because the Jerry Fenbury reveal tells us he's in a situation that he could have walked away from. What can you share about getting Erik to that hospital? And who do you think he is at his core? 
 










That was maybe my favorite thing about playing this character, that he looks like a horror trope. When people see the way I look as Erik, and see the tattoos and piercings that they put on me, they make an assumption about every other alt-looking emo, punk-rock character that we've seen played in the genre since the '80s, you know? I feel like that trope came around then and we haven't left it. First and foremost because it's a trope that works. 

I'm not shitting on any actor that has done that trope and done that trope well. But what I loved about doing Erik was that, when I read the script and saw in the tattoo scene that it says that he opens his phone to see a photo of him and his dad, it informed me. I knew then that he cared about his family more than anything. That's actually Erik's driving force, which I don't know if it originally was supposed to be. But to me the number one thing about him is that he cares about his family. He doesn't have to follow Bobby, but he's like, “I'll be damned, that's still my brother.” Even if Fenbury-wise, he's not exactly. That's still his little brother and he won't let him die.

And it's such an emotional scene! I'm telling you, I cried. 

Yay! I don't know why I'm saying, “Yay!” But, yay! I'm so glad you cried.

 










Erik seems like someone horror fans will really relate to. He's countercultural and independent, but he also does the right thing — and he does the hard thing — only to get screwed for it. That's tragic. 

Totally. Even when he doesn't believe Kaitlyn's character, Stefani, because why would he at that point, he sees that she's making his mom cry and is confrontational about it. Critics have said to me, “Why was he so rude to her on the way out of the door?” When he's like, “Fuckin' stop.” With that, I keep saying it's because he's telling her to back off. Like, “I'm the man of the house now. My dad is dead. I'm not gonna fucking stand here and let you break my family's heart again and again. So fuckin' stop it right now.” Erik dies next, and he says that to Stefani because he's starting to realize that she's going down a path that will hurt his family. Erik would never just allow that to happen. 

Please, take me inside the MRI machine. What was it like shooting Erik and Bobby's deaths and the comedy beats leading up to that? The moment with the nursery is great. 

Oh, we love that. So much of that was ad lib. In the script, the line was like, “No, no, we could never.” But then me and Owen just kept looking back at the babies and riffing. My favorite line in the entire movie is actually Owen's in that scene. Erik looks back at the nursery an obnoxious amount of times and Bobby just goes, “Don't hurt those babies.” It's so good. 

 










Owen gave one of my favorite performances in the movie just by being so genuine. He was another one that could have been a horror trope. People shorthand Bobby as a himbo or jock, which is kind of originally what that character was. I remember in the script at one point, he was introduced by handing Stefani a beer. He was going to have a football with him all the time too, stuff like that. But Owen played Bobby as the most genuine sweetheart you could ever find — and that made it so easy for me. Owen is stronger than me. He is bigger than man. But Erik and Bobby still have that brotherly dynamic where it doesn't matter how big the little brother gets, big brother's still big brother.

How did you keep that focus while managing everything on the practical side?

Going into the MRI machine was incredible, but with characters, it's about the details. It was maybe the third scene that Owen and I shot, all during our first week. We knew it was going to be funny, but it was also important emotionally that you could see Erik being cocksure about his plan and also scared of it, because he really doesn't know that it's going to work. He just wants to save Bobby

I give so much credit to our directors. I think it was Zach who said, “On the next take, when you say, ‘I'm not gonna let you die,' you are gonna let him die. So realize that and say it.” That works in the scene because it's funny but also heartfelt. You have that and you have the tears in my eyes, while I'm looking at him like, “Technically, I'm going to let you die — but I am bringing you back!” That's where the family love comes in and our chemistry as actors, which came together right when we first met, comes in to help really convey, “He's my brother.” 

 










There's a sense of affection in that scene and the rest of the movie that is just so infectious. I'm thinking about the garbage truck moment with Julia again, when she notices that heart-shaped burn on your arm next to the “DAD” tattoo. What does she call you there? 

Oh, my God, Kiki. She calls me Kiki! Anna threw that in on the first take, and I was like, “Did she just call me fuckin' Kiki?” It's weirdly perfect. Erik. Kiki. Somehow it makes sense.

Knowing how much you enjoy the other “Final Destination” movies, I have to ask you about working with the late great Tony Todd. What do you remember about meeting him?

I mean, you have a legend like Tony Todd, who I've been watching since I was a kid. I saw “Candyman” when I was probably 13 or 14. The voice and all that, it sticks with you. Then, you have him come to set and you can see he's not well when he gets there, but you never would've been able to tell by his face — because all he did was smile. All he did was remind us to have fun. He just kept asking, “Are you having fun?” And I said, “I am, Mr. Todd.” And he said, “It shows.” 

 










He also said, “Never forget these are the best times.” And he was right. He was so welcoming and kind, particularly for a man who has played all sorts of evil in his career. He was everything you could ever hope him to be. That ending bit with him when he leaves, that wasn't in the script either. The directors just said, “Say whatever you'd like on the way out, say goodbye to the fans.” 

To me, it was pretty clear that he wasn't just saying goodbye to the fans. He was saying goodbye to everything. It was beautiful to see. I was crying on the other side of the camera, for sure. It was the perfect goodbye. Not just to the “Final Destination” fandom, but to everyone that's ever loved Tony Todd and watched him on screen. 

It breaks my heart that Erik can't come back for another “Final Destination,” but you definitely made your mark on the franchise. Are you walking away with any ink for the movie? Are you a tattoo guy?

I have 12, actually. I'm going to get a little skull somewhere, and I think Owen is going to get one as well. It's the perfect tribute. This movie changed my life. Whatever I book next is going to be because of “Final Destination.” I don't know what it'll do for me. I have no idea. But it changed my life. I got to knock-off not just a bucket list thing, but something that meant so much to me that I feel lucky to be part of its family.

To really die you have to die three ways. Townes Van Zandt discovered this after overdosing on model airplane glue. He was declared DOA at the hospital where, to hear him tell it, he sat for an hour and a half while doctors debated just how dead he was. “There's brain death, which I've suffered. There's respiratory death, which I haven't suffered yet. And there's heart death, which I go through every two or three months,” he told filmmaker James Szalapski. “But I figure if you're ever all three of those at once, that's it. That's the ballgame.”

Van Zandt died more than most because he lived more than most. He reasoned that to write great songs, he would have to experience everything that he could survive and a few things he couldn't. As a freshman at the University of Colorado at Boulder, he tipped backward over the railing of a fourth-story balcony just to see how it felt to lose control. “I started leaning back really slow, and really paying attention,” he recalled to journalist William Hedgepeth. “I fell over backwards and landed four stories down flat on my back. I remember the impact and exactly what it felt like and all the people screaming.” This kind of thing makes for a good story but a turbulent life. Van Zandt kept his balance between chaos and calm for as long as he could, but he always knew which way he would fall.

Whatever fame Van Zandt achieved was very nearly accidental. He went along, in a limited way, with the machinations of the music industry, recording six remarkable albums in five years between 1968 and 1972. Almost despite himself, he was on the verge of a breakout success with his seventh record, to be called Seven Come Eleven. Recorded in the spring of 1974, it was meant to build on his considerable momentum and launch him onto the national stage. However, the album would not be released for nearly 20 years. By the time it hit shelves in 1993, now titled The Nashville Sessions, Van Zandt was a cult figure, a songwriter's songwriter better known for other artists' covers of his work. Rather than a career-defining album, Seven Come Eleven had become a footnote in a tragic story.

Van Zandt came from a reputable family. Townes Hall at the University of Texas is named after one side and Van Zandt County, outside of Dallas, after the other. His father was high up in the oil industry and his mother wanted Townes to be a lawyer or a politician or an oil man himself. Van Zandt mainly wanted to get drunk and hit the road. After the balcony stunt, Townes got a friend to forge a letter to the dean excusing him from the rest of the semester and hitchhiked to Oklahoma and back. Upon learning of this behavior, his parents flew up to Boulder, took him out of college, and put him in a psychiatric hospital in Galveston, where he received a combination of insulin coma therapy and electroshock therapy. At the time, this method was at the cutting edge for his diagnosis of “schizophrenic reaction.” A side effect of the three-month-long treatment was the erasure of his long-term memory. Afterward, he had to be reintroduced to his mother: She was the one with the long hair.

Townes tried to settle down for a while. In 1965, he married Fran Peterson and they moved into a nice apartment in Houston provided by his parents. He enrolled as a pre-law student at the university. But quickly enough, Van Zandt locked himself into a closet to write his first song, “Waitin' Around to Die,” an ode to rambling, gambling, and crime that ends with a confession of love to codeine. It wasn't the type of song that his new wife expected during their honeymoon phase. He started playing in local clubs and coffeehouses for $10 a night and was soon putting more effort into his music than his studies. In a last-ditch attempt at stability, Van Zandt tried to enlist in the military but failed the psychiatric evaluation. The doctor called Townes “a manic depressive that had made minimal adjustment to life” and advised him to “wander for a while and find himself.” Now under doctor's orders, Van Zandt set off.

“There was one point when I realized, ‘Man, I could really do this,' but it takes blowing everything off,” Van Zandt said. “It takes blowing your family off, money, security, happiness, friends. Blow it off. Get a guitar and go.” He told Fran to wait for him at home, to be a source of safety and sanity that he could return to between stretches on the road. Fran held down a job at Shell Oil and took care of their first child, J.T., while Townes spent weeks or months touring. Visits home became less frequent. “A couple of times that he came back to see J.T. or when he would just call me out of the blue, he would say ‘Sanity is further away,'” Fran remembers in Margaret Brown's 2004 documentary Be Here to Love Me.

Van Zandt's big break came from Mickey Newbury, a songwriter working for Nashville's biggest music publisher, Acuff-Rose. Newbury had written songs for Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, and Joan Baez, among others, and had exactly the connections that Townes needed. Van Zandt had recorded a demo of “Tecumseh Valley,” a folk song about a miner's daughter who turned to prostitution after the death of her father. Newbury's production partner played him the tape and asked if they could do anything for this unknown singer. “Hell, I don't know, but he sure deserves it,” Newbury said, and signed him to a management contract. Newbury introduced Townes to “Cowboy” Jack Clement, a Nashville producer of hits by Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, who promised to record and publish his first set of songs.

When it came to his career, Van Zandt was his own worst enemy. He didn't care for contracts or royalties or the recording process itself—according to legend, he once offered his full publishing rights to the first person who could score him some drugs. A close second, though, was Kevin Eggers, a New York agent who was then scouting for talent for his new label, Poppy. He came recommended by a friend of Clement's, Lamar Fike, who was a close confidant of Elvis. Townes' camp sensed trouble early on. “I don't have much good to say about him,” Cowboy Jack told biographer John Kruth, author of To Live's to Fly. “I think he was bad news for Townes… worst thing that ever happened to him.” Newbury, too, said Van Zandt's deal with Eggers was “the worst move he ever made in his life.” But Eggers was a fast talker and an inveterate self-promoter who wooed Van Zandt with his anti-establishment stance. Townes signed a contract with Poppy for his debut album, For the Sake of the Song, in 1968.

Clement didn't know what to do with Van Zandt in the studio. Townes' holy trinity comprised Hank Williams, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Bob Dylan, but he didn't exactly fit the mold of a country, blues, or folk artist. Cowboy Jack forced the trendy Nashville sound onto For the Sake of the Song, adding organ, harpsichord, and backing vocals onto Van Zandt's sparse compositions. In Clement's hands, the somber “Waitin' Around to Die” became a spaghetti western track. Any mention of prostitution was stripped from “Tecumseh Valley” in consideration of the conservative country audience. This latter decision caused a rift between Clement and Eggers that would never fully be resolved. Clement similarly overworked Townes' second album, Our Mother the Mountain, before Eggers looked elsewhere for a producer.

The problems with Eggers started immediately. Nobody knows where the money from Van Zandt's first big contract went. “I'm not really sure what happened, but that check for 80,000 dollars got torn up or disappeared,” Fran later said. “We could barely pay the hospital bill when J.T. was born.” Townes' attitude toward money didn't help. He would give fistfuls of it to strangers, or gamble it away, or spend it on drugs and alcohol. Poppy released a handful of Van Zandt's albums, but Eggers' accounting was never transparent. Still, Van Zandt stayed loyal. He knew that he would always earn more from touring than from selling records and didn't care enough about royalties to chase them down.

During this era, Van Zandt's tours often traced a boomerang: starting in Colorado, moving south to Houston, and then east to Nashville and back. Houston was a problem because that's where Townes could score heroin. Soon, his summers in Colorado turned into retreats from his addiction. In 1970, Townes and Fran divorced as his behavior grew more erratic. The next year, he moved in with a dealer in Pasadena, an industrial section of Houston, where he had unlimited access to his drug of choice. Van Zandt started to sell off all of his possessions, including his record collection, and to avoid friends and family.

Fran convinced Townes to visit J.T. in the fall of 1971. He didn't show. Sensing that something was wrong, she waited by the phone all day. Finally, the call that she was dreading came: Van Zandt had overdosed. He was in the hospital, calling out her name. When Fran arrived, she was told that Townes had died again, twice this time, in the ambulance. His condition was still critical, but she kept him conscious by talking to him throughout the night.

To celebrate his most recent recovery from death, Van Zandt jokingly named his sixth record The Late Great Townes Van Zandt. Eggers claimed that he was responsible for the title, meant to poke fun at Townes' dead career. Really, though, he was as successful as he had ever been. The Late Great sold steadily and featured two songs, “If I Needed You” and “Pancho and Lefty,” that would come to define his career. Van Zandt had survived, even prospered, and was eager to continue his lucky streak. He looked forward to his seventh album with anticipation. “The next one will be a hit. The next one is likely to be a hit,” he predicted.

He had reason to be confident in the songs on Seven Come Eleven. Townes often claimed that he was only a vessel for lyrics that really originated elsewhere. They would come to him in flashes or in dreams. This may have been true sometimes, but was more likely a bit of modesty mixed with mythmaking: the humble poet, divinely inspired. However he arrived at his songs, Van Zandt was always meticulous. “It seems a lot of people in Nashville write by the phrase, or by the line. As opposed to writing by the word,” he told journalist Paul Zollo for the 2003 book, Songwriters on Songwriting. “A lot of my best songs are where every single word is where it's supposed to be.” He was influenced by Shakespeare and Dylan Thomas but cited Robert Frost as his most important touchstone. As in Frost's best poems, Van Zandt's lyrics are profound in their simplicity.

Townes' friend and fellow outlaw songwriter Guy Clark has called Seven Come Eleven's strange ballad “Two Girls” a “yardstick” for any country song: “That's how good it's gotta be,” he told Kruth. Its lyrics begin with an unsettling description of clouds that “didn't look like cotton/They didn't even look like clouds.” Van Zandt enters a dreamworld, encountering increasingly surreal figures. “Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse” ask him where the action is; a woman called Jolly Jane “just lays around/And listens with her mouth.” The song ends with apocalyptic imagery:

It's cold down on the bayouThey say it's in your mindBut the moccasins are treadin' iceAnd leaving strange designs

“Two Girls” was written in Pasadena, at Van Zandt's lowest point. The frozen bayou and its serpentine patterns are frightening enough, but even the song's more prosaic elements point to his suffering: The ugly horse is heroin, and the lazy Jolly Jane a need that cannot be met. The seemingly upbeat chorus describing Townes' two girls—“One's in heaven and one's below”—is about Leslie Jo Richards, a girlfriend who accompanied him to L.A. to record his fifth album, High, Low and In Between. They were in the studio when Van Zandt realized he had forgotten something. Richards volunteered to retrieve it and set out to hitchhike back to their condo. The driver who picked her up stabbed her more than 20 times before leaving her for dead. She made it to a nearby house to call for help before collapsing. Townes never forgave himself for her murder. While she was up in heaven, he was stuck down below with another girl who, he laments, “I do not know.”

Death and heroin haunt Seven Come Eleven. On “White Freight Liner Blues,” Townes is torn between love and hate for the drug. “White freight liner/Won't you steal away my mind?” he pleads, before admitting that “it's bad news from Houston/Half my friends are dying.” Rex “Wrecks” Bell, Van Zandt's touring bassist, was one of those friends. “He would come get me and take me on the road to get me out of Houston,” Bell told songwriter Otis Gibbs. “Rex's Blues” is dedicated to him, though he resented it. Bell points out that it could've been written for any number of people in their circle:

If I had a nickel I'd find a gameIf I won a dollar I'd make it rainIf it rained an ocean I'd drink it dryAnd lay me down dissatisfied

“The song captures what we were all doing. It was foisted upon me to be the focus of how we were all living,” Bell says. The song tells of their shared impatience with mundane life and their strategies for escaping it: gambling for money, spending it on booze, drinking to forget that they were all waiting around to die.

Clement was back in the producer's seat for Seven Come Eleven, but by this point, he knew not to over-produce Van Zandt's songs. The best tracks on the album are those where Townes is left alone to play and sing with minimal accompaniment. Townes could play delicately rolling melodies with finger picks or stronger, more percussive sounds with flat picks, and both styles could carry a song on their own. When Cowboy Jack adds his own touches, as with the addition of gentle backing vocals to the piano-driven ballad “No Place to Fall” or the eerie monastic chanting on the brooding “The Spider Song,” he usually enhances Van Zandt's songs. More than ever before, Townes' vision shines through unfiltered.

By this point, Van Zandt had fallen into a rhythm. He would record during the spring, hide out in Colorado over the summer, and then tour behind the new album in the fall. In September 1974, Bell was trying to kick heroin again, so Townes formed a band with Bell on bass and Mickey White on guitar for a tour through the Rocky Mountain region in support of the forthcoming album. Their friend Johnny Guess, who'd recently acquired a motor home that he dubbed the Blue Unit, was quickly recruited as tour manager and driver. Townes also brought along his new girlfriend, Cindy Morgan, then only 16 years old. The tour centered around a two-week residency at the Mangy Moose Lodge, a ski resort in the Teton Mountains. By the time they arrived there that winter, their group had expanded: Bell and Guess, both annoyed with Cindy, invited their girlfriends to fly in too, and the singer Richard Dobson joined as an opening act. The Mangy Moose had no vacancies, leaving the party of eight confined to the small motor home.

The group started to fall apart at the foot of the Tetons. They kept warm with butane and whiskey and added some LSD and cocaine for good measure. The longer they stayed, the less sure they were of their goal. The new year came and went with no sign of a release date for Seven Come Eleven, and it was doubtful that the crowd at the Mangy Moose would care much anyway. Van Zandt handed over more and more of his stage time to Bell and White for their incipient comedy-country duo, the Hemmer Ridge Mountain Boys. By the time they left Wyoming, the group's nerves were frayed. In Denver they scored some heroin and began furtively shooting up in their bunks. Outside of Crested Butte, White stabbed Van Zandt's stuffed dog, Spot. Later, Guess tried to stab Bell. They were glad to make it back to Texas alive.

Though it was ultimately disastrous, the Blue Unit tour was undertaken in good faith to promote Seven Come Eleven. “Townes tried to get tour support and advertising for the gigs. He clearly understood what promotion was about. He was loyal as the day is long and was still wondering when the new album was going to come out,” White told Kruth. They tried to get an explanation from Eggers to no avail. “It was becoming more and more clear that whatever hopes we had of the album getting out were just about gone. Every time we called Kevin and tried to find out what was going on with it, or try to communicate with him… It was just clear,” he recalled to documentary director Brown.

Many years later, Eggers would say that Van Zandt's increasing drug use was the reason that he refused to release the album. “This was the last studio album I did with Townes,” he explains in the documentary. “[It was] in Nashville and this was when his drugs were really kicking in hard. I didn't put this out for 20 years, I had such a bad feeling about the whole event.” In reality, Eggers himself was to blame. Poppy went bankrupt in 1973 and Eggers was eventually forced to sell the label's assets to United Artists for an undisclosed sum. The state of his business was still in limbo during the Seven Come Eleven sessions. Eggers negotiated with Clement to delay payment for the studio time, which totaled $6,000. “We cut that record in my studio,” Cowboy Jack said in Robert Earl Hardy's biography A Deeper Blue, “and Kevin never paid the studio bill. So I kept the tapes—for years. And he never did pay me.”

Rumor began to spread about the lost tapes. Musicians in Van Zandt's circle worried that Clement had recorded over them out of spite. John Lomax III, who would later become Townes' manager, called Seven Come Eleven “the missing link in his career. If that had come out right on top of The Late Great, it would have really been a whole 'nother thing.” Instead, Van Zandt's career stalled and, without much else to do, he gave himself wholly over to his worsening drug abuse.

Townes moved to a trailer in Clarksville, an area west of Austin that had been cut off from the larger city. The African American residents of Clarksville endured the local government's attempts to remove them to the east side, persisting despite a lack of services or even paved roads. Van Zandt and his friends soon cohered around Uncle Seymour Washington, a former blacksmith and amateur preacher who hosted his new white hippie friends at his famous barbecues. In James Szalapski's classic documentary Heartworn Highways, a profile of the emerging outlaw country movement, Van Zandt plays “Pancho and Lefty” and “Waitin' Around to Die” in Uncle Seymour's living room. During the performance, tears roll down the older man's face.

Though David Allan Coe was Heartworn Highways' most successful subject, Van Zandt stole its spotlight through sheer force of personality. Carrying a bottle of whiskey, a can of Coke, and a BB gun, he introduces his dog Geraldine before his girlfriend Cindy. He gives Szalapski a tour of the land, which he claims is infested with giant rabbits. But the charming, fun-loving man in front of the camera was far different than the one behind the scenes. Townes and Cindy's addictions were worsening, and they were dodging the filmmakers in order to shoot up.

Throughout their time in Clarksville, Van Zandt's behavior became worrying. “It wasn't a very productive time for him. He didn't do too many gigs. He mostly sat around drunk all the time. He and Cindy were constantly at each other's throats,” White told Kruth. The breaking point came when Townes and Bell, on a deranged drinking binge, jumped into dumpsters and covered themselves with filth. They then made a tour of bars and clubs where they would threaten to simply hang out unless they were given money to leave. Van Zandt was found that night unconscious in a dumpster and taken to Brackenridge Hospital in Austin, where he was admitted to the rehab program. He stayed for 10 days of the 45-day program before checking himself out.

It was obvious a change was needed. Townes and Cindy moved to a cabin outside of Franklin, Tennessee, about 20 miles south of Nashville. Van Zandt imagined it as a bucolic retreat where they would live off the land, hunting and chopping wood. “I think things might be OK. With the cabin and all I feel more settled,” he told Hedgepeth in 1977. “Leads me to believe I could be rooted somewhere and make it in this business, be ‘successful' with the public.” But it was a retreat from the music industry as much as anything. “I've been on the road so long I'm tired of it. I'm indifferent to it. I'd rather sit home and drink and pick up royalty checks.” Soon life in Franklin was out of control too. Townes made daily trips to the liquor store in his old pickup truck and alternated between shooting heroin and shooting guns. One day, Van Zandt played three rounds of Russian roulette to make a point to his young acolyte Steve Earle. He survived death again, though the only lesson Earle learned was that his hero was dangerously unstable.

Van Zandt hadn't written many songs since 1974. Instead, he treated his next record, 1978's Flyin' Shoes, as an opportunity to salvage the best tracks from Seven Come Eleven. Six of its 10 songs were originally on the lost album. The problem was that Townes was in no shape to record, and certainly could not capture the magic from those earlier sessions. Shortly before they were due at the studio, his neighbor and friend, Mike Ewah, crashed his truck into a tree on a liquor run. Townes was in the passenger seat and got thrown against the dash, breaking his right arm. He could no longer play guitar, but neither Eggers nor Van Zandt wanted to lose the studio time that they had booked with legendary Memphis producer Chips Moman, who decided that his session players could make up for Van Zandt's parts. The band, which included consummate professionals like Billy Earl McClelland and a young Randy Scruggs, could play the songs, but they lacked Townes' distinctive fingerpicking style.

Flyin' Shoes is expertly produced, with every instrument as big and clear as the Texas sky. This has the marked disadvantage of giving Van Zandt's voice, now noticeably tired, no place to hide. On Seven Come Eleven, he performed “Loretta,” an uptempo number about a barroom girl who's perpetually 22, like he was singing through a sly grin. Townes can barely get through the new version, a wistful ballad that's at odds with its lyrics about free and easy love. The original “Snake Song” is a short, moody sketch that Van Zandt delivers with real menace. On Flyin' Shoes, it expands into a full-band arrangement, complete with goofy rattlesnake sounds. “You can touch me, if you want to/But I've got poison, I just might bite you,” Townes slurs, more toothless than threatening.

His new manager, John Lomax III, who was largely responsible for this brief flurry of activity, was soon forced out by Eggers. Lomax (a nephew of the famous folklorist) was convinced that his ouster was punishment for prying into Eggers' business practices. Lomax uncovered what he called a “shell game” that had been ongoing since the advance from Van Zandt's first contract went missing. “I was fixin' to find out who was stealing the money and where it was going,” he told Hardy. Without Lomax on his side, Townes limped on through a few unsuccessful tours. His broken arm hampered his playing during the 1979 Flyin' Shoes shows. The next year, his band was confronted with a series of canceled gigs on a tour booked by a shady promoter. Sometimes, they would arrive at the venue only to find that nobody was expecting them. Townes retreated back to Franklin with empty pockets and opened the door to an empty cabin. Cindy had abandoned him and moved to Canada.

This was another low, but Van Zandt's luck was about to change. Emmylou Harris covered “If I Needed You” in 1981, making it to No. 3 on the country charts. Then in 1983, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard covered his defining song, “Pancho and Lefty,” which went to No. 1 on the country charts. Townes' dream of sitting home, drinking, and picking up royalty checks had come true. He also met Jeanene Munsell, who would become his third wife and the mother of his second son, Will, and only daughter, Katie Belle. These were all reasons to slow down and enjoy a life of quiet domesticity. Van Zandt struggled to quit drinking, but could never piece together more than a year of sobriety. He toured frequently, employing Eggers' brother Harold as road manager to monitor his drinking and ensure that he could at least start each show. He played some blazingly good concerts, but just as often he was so drunk that he would mumble his songs and fall off his stool. Townes had seemingly lost all interest in recording, as well. Throughout the '80s, he only released one studio album, At My Window—a far cry from the six albums in the half-decade that launched his career.

Seven Come Eleven was finally released in 1993 as The Nashville Sessions, nearly 20 years after it was recorded. How the tapes survived is unclear. One story is that Eggers, hearing that Clement planned to erase the tapes, had snuck into the studio and transferred the masters onto cassette back in 1974. But by the '90s, the release was hardly newsworthy: It was an obscure album by a cult singer-songwriter, and 10 out of 12 songs had already appeared on Flyin' Shoes, At My Window, or various live albums. The momentum of Van Zandt's early years had dissipated across two decades of hit-or-miss tours and infrequent recordings. The brilliance of the record that he was sure would be a hit had been dimmed through the later, lackluster versions of its best songs.

Van Zandt's last album was set to be recorded in Memphis in December 1996. Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley had reached out to Townes and offered to produce the sessions, which would be released on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace! imprint. But a few days before the studio date, Townes fell down outside his home. Though he didn't realize it at the time, he had fractured his hip. He arrived at the studio in a wheelchair, visibly in pain. He could hardly sing, much less play guitar. Growing increasingly frustrated, he would demand more liquor from Harold. Shelley tried to coax out some usable takes but soon found it impossible. He reluctantly cancelled the sessions.

Finally, Van Zandt agreed to go to the hospital as long as he was accompanied by Jeanene. The doctors told them that he would need surgery at once. The next day, Townes was suffering from delirium tremens, shaking and hallucinating. Doctors recommended an immediate detox, but Jeanene had witnessed Townes suffer during similar programs and felt he couldn't survive another attempt to quit drinking. Against medical advice, she signed him out of the hospital.

Back at home, Townes settled down with some vodka and a small plate of food. His doctors refused to give him pain medication if he was going to drink, but after sipping on the liquor and taking Tylenol, he seemed to get better. Jeanene went to call friends and update them on his improved condition. But later that evening, his son Will found him unresponsive. Jeanene's panicked attempts to revive him were fruitless. This time he was gone, really gone, in all three ways at once.

	The second week of Sean Combs' criminal trial brought another celebrity witness to the stand: Kid Cudi, who testified Combs stood posed like a “Marvel supervillain” when he confronted the jealous hip-hop mogul over his car being firebombed in 2012. 


	The alleged arson is central to the Southern District of New York's racketeering charge against Combs. It also helps bolster their claim that Combs kept his longtime girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, trapped in a decade-long abusive relationship through fear, coercion, and physical violence.


	Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to the five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution charges against him. His lawyers previously claimed no evidence directly connects Combs to a Molotov cocktail winding up in Kid Cudi's charred Porsche. 


	Nearly a dozen men and women took the stand this week to testify against Combs. Many had not seen Combs in years, while a few admitted they had sent sporadic messages to the music executive in recent years. Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard returned to the witness box following a brief appearance in the first week, as well as Ventura's mother, Regina, Ventura's former best friend of 17 years, Kerry Morgan, and Sharay Hayes, a male exotic dancer known as “The Punisher.”

	Combs seemed to be in good spirits despite most of his family's absence in court this week. He greeted his former personal assistant, George Kaplan, with a genuine smile. He laughed along with the court as another ex-personal assistant, David James, admitted he was “Diddy-bopping all around” Combs' New Year's Eve party after swiping a dose of MDMA from Combs' drug stash. 


	But Combs sat stone-faced when Kid Cudi — real name Scott Mescudi — detailed how his short-lived romance with Ventura went down in flames after he discovered that the R&B singer was dating Mescudi. 


	Combs also appeared to stew in silence as a Homeland Security Investigations special agent detailed the surplus of drugs, baby oil, and firearms seized from his Miami home and when clinical and forensic psychologist Dr. Dawn Hughes explained why victims remain in abusive relationships.

	Ventura isn't the only alleged victim in the case. An ex-girlfriend identified by the pseudonym “Jane” aka Victim-2 and a former employee referred to as “Mia” — Victim-4 — are also expected to testify against Combs. But there's a looming question mark over if another one of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Gina, will be called to the witness stand. (According to CNN, Gina is referred to in the indictment as Victim-3 and is not expected to testify.) 

	











	Already, Gina's name has popped up multiple times during the trial. Ventura and Morgan said Gina was a “problem” in Ventura's relationship with Combs, and Kaplan said he once saw Combs hurl decorative apples at Gina during a prolonged fight. This week, Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said Gina “is out of the case,” while the government shot back that she “is very much a part of this case.”


	Here are the key moments from the trial's second week: 


	Dressed casually in light wash jeans and a leather jacket, Kid Cudi strolled into the packed courtroom on Thursday morning. The 41-year-old appeared relaxed, seen smoking a cigarette as he pulled up to the federal courthouse in Manhattan. 


	Mescudi testified he had fallen in love with Ventura before their brief fling ended when Combs discovered the relationship in December 2011. In the early morning hours, Mescudi said he received a frantic call from Ventura, who sounded “really stressed on the phone, nervous, scared” after fleeing a furious Combs.

	Later that day, Mescudi said he received another distressed phone call, this time from Capricorn Clark, Ventura's friend and Combs' employee, who informed Mescudi that Combs was inside his house. Mescudi said he raced back to his home, calling Combs while on the way. 


	“I'm going to be very candid,” Mescudi told the courtroom. “I was like, ‘Motherfucker, are you in my house?' And he said, ‘I just want to talk to you.' I was like, ‘I'm on my way over right now.' He was like, ‘I'm here.'” But Combs was nowhere to be found once Mescudi arrived. Instead, Mescudi said he found presents from Chanel ripped open and his dog enclosed in a bathroom. 


	Mescudi refused to take Combs' repeated attempts to hash things out. “I told him, specifically told him: you broke into my house. You messed with my dog,” Mescudi said. “Like, I don't want to talk to you.” But Ventura and Mescudi's relationship fizzled out in the immediate aftermath of the break-in. “The drama, it was just getting out of hand,” Mescudi testified. “I kind of wanted to give her some space … for my safety, for her safety…”


	Still, the situation escalated on Jan. 9, 2012, when Mescudi learned a Molotov cocktail had been thrown inside his convertible Porsche, charring the inside of the luxury vehicle. Mescudi said he then decided to call Combs “because I knew he had something to do with” the car being firebombed. 


	Upon arrival at the members-only club, Mescudi said he saw Combs “staring out the window with his hands behind his back like a Marvel supervillain.” The meeting ended with the two shaking hands, but Mescudi asking about his car. “I don't know what you're talking about,” Combs responded. 

	











	The men left it at that. But Mescudi testified that he walked away thinking that Combs “was lying.” 


	During testimony from Combs' former personal assistants and a hotel manager, a number of Combs' strange personal habits came up — including his fondness of slathering Mott's applesauce on cheeseburgers and allegedly popping President Barack Obama-shaped Ecstasy pills. 


	David James, who worked for Combs from 2007 to 2009, said he was responsible for anticipating Combs' needs and whims, and would stock the mogul's hotel rooms with a variety of foods and toiletries. “He didn't always use these items, but I was always taught to provide everything just in case he needed something,” James explained. “That way he wouldn't need to call you later on.” 


	Among the items on Combs' preference sheet while traveling were Heinz ketchup, XXX-flavored Vitaminwater, Jello, Fiji water bottles, Ciroc vodka and Simply Lemonade. James said that Combs also kept his toiletry bag stocked with around 40 different products, including ointments and Just For Men hair and beard dye.


	On Thursday, L'Ermitage Beverly Hills general manager Fredric Zemmour pulled up what he testified was a hotel profile for Combs. Records indicate that Combs frequented the luxury hotel starting in 2008, with the bookings often being made under his and Ventura's various aliases. 


	Zemmour said the hotel kept an internal log of his preferences and housekeeping notes, including a mandate that the room required a deep cleaning after Combs checked out. “Always spill candle wax on everything and uses excessive amounts of oil,” the hotel note read. “Place the room out of order upon departure for deep cleaning. Please authorize an extra $1,000 when guest stays with us to cover any room damages.” 


	Another internal note read: “Please monitor outside his room. Down the hall to spray air freshener. Likes the room hot. Set thermostat to 75. Place a portable heater in the room prior to arrival.” 


	Sharay Hayes, an exotic male dancer known as “The Punisher,” gave more insight into what occurred during freak-offs with Ventura and Combs. Hayes estimated that he participated in up to a dozen sexual encounters with the celebrity couple between 2012 and early 2015. 


	The first time Hayes said he met Combs during a freak-off, the music executive entered the room fully nude, with his face hidden. “I could not see his face,” Hayes explained. “There was, like — I don't know it was called, it was like, what the Muslim women wear, where the face is covered completely in the veil and you can only see the eyes.” 

	











	Hayes said Combs would often give Ventura directions throughout the sexual encounter. “I don't have a thought process to her enjoyment level,” Hayes added. “It was my understanding was we were creating a sexy scene that was enjoyable for her partner.” 


Regina Ventura took the stand on Tuesday to testify that Combs “demanded” $20,000 from her in December 2011 after the hip-hop mogul became furious that Ventura was having a secret relationship with Kid Cudi. 


	Around the time of the demand, Regina said she received an alarming email from Ventura, who claimed that Combs was threatening to release sexually explicit videos of the R&B singer. “I was physically sick, Regina said. “I did not understand a lot of it,” she said. “The sex tapes threw me. I did not know the other person in it, but I knew that he was going to try to hurt my daughter.”        


	Regina said that an “angry” Combs contacted her, saying he needed to “recoup money that he had spent on [Ventura].” She rushed to take out a home equity loan for $20,000. She wired the money to one of Combs' bank accounts because, she said, “I was scared for my daughter's safety.” Regina said that the money was eventually returned with no explanation a few days later.   


	Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Gerard Gannon testified this week that an armored vehicle was used to ram through the iron front gate at Combs' Star Island mansion in a surprise raid last March. Dozens of officials searched the $48 million property for items that related to their sex trafficking and racketeering investigation, leaving the home with boxes of baby oil, firearms, platform exotic dancer heels, and a stash of narcotics.  


	Two de-serialized semi-automatic AR-15-style rifles were found in one of the closets in Combs' home, Gannon said. The lower part of the weapons were stored in a cardboard box, and the upper receivers were bundled up in a white towel. Gannon testified that because both guns had their serial numbers “cut out,” it made the process of identifying the weapon's owner “a lot more difficult or impossible.”


	During Combs' bail hearings last year, Combs' attorneys claimed the guns belonged to members of his security team. “He has nothing to do with how guns are kept in his house,”  Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said. “He has a professional security company that keeps firearms in the house.” However, as prosecutors pointed out during the same hearing, “it would be “absurd” that an “armed security in a professional security company would use defaced AR-15s and store them in pieces in the defendant's personal closet.” 

	











	Also stashed in the home's closets were several items that Ventura testified were routinely used in freak-offs. At least a dozen pairs of seven-inch platform heels were found in boxes and drawers; sex toys including “love cuffs,” rope, and oral sex candies; and packaged lingerie and sexy costumes were found, Gannon said. He said there were several dozen bottles of Astroglide and baby oil in a single closet. 


	A black Gucci bag was found in Combs' closet, which contained a surplus of powders and different-colored pills — including an orange triangle-shaped tablet that had a Tesla symbol on it — that later tested positive for ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, and an active ingredient that is found in Xanax. Some of the pills contained a mixture of ketamine and MDMA. Prosecutors said they also found a Lumify eye drop bottle in the pouch, and the liquid tested positive for ketamine and MDMA. 


	Four people this week testified they were present when Combs physically beat Ventura, all admitting they did not call law enforcement nor interfere with the rage-fueled attack because they were scared for their safety.


	Ventura's former best friend Kerry Morgan said she panicked during a Jamaica vacation in 2013 when she allegedly saw Combs drag Ventura by her hair down a long hallway before he violently pushed her to the ground, causing Ventura to knock her head on the brick pavement. Morgan said she chased after Ventura, who fled barefoot from Combs into a nearby wooded area. Together, they hid from Combs by crouching in a ditch for what “felt like hours,” Morgan said.


	Kaplan, who worked as Combs' assistant from 2013 to 2015, said once, during a private plane ride to Las Vegas in 2015, he heard the sound of glass shattering and a “tremendous commotion” coming from where Combs and Ventura were on the back of the plane. 


	He turned and allegedly saw an irate Combs standing over a distressed Ventura, with Combs holding a whiskey rock glass in his hand. “Isn't anybody seeing this?” Ventura cried out, Kaplan testified. He admitted that he looked the other way and didn't get involved because he was worried about jeopardizing his career. “I could not believe my good fortune would be working for such an icon,” he explained. “And the last way that I thought that I would be successful in that career would be to compromise his well-being in any way.” 

	











	Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money singer Dawn Richard testified she was shocked and scared when she allegedly saw Combs pick up a skillet and attempt to strike Ventura in the head with the pan in 2009. “He was beating her up in front of us,” Richard said of why she didn't try to stop the attack. “I was scared if I intervened or did anything, that it might get worse.”


	Celebrity makeup artist Mylah Morales said although she tried to encourage Ventura to seek medical treatment after Combs allegedly left Ventura with a black eye, a busted lip, and knots on her head in 2010, she was terrified of Combs. “I feared for my life because if he could do that to her…” Morales began, before Combs' defense team objected to her answer. When asked why she didn't report the alleged assault to police, Morales stayed firm. “I feared for my life,” she said. 


	Due to Memorial Day, the third week of the trial begins on Tuesday. Combs' former employee Capricorn Clark is expected to testify first, followed by two law enforcement officials.

	Ventura, Morgan, and Mescudi all mentioned Clark during their testimony. On Thursday, Mescudi said Clark alerted him that Combs had broken into his Hollywood Hills home in December 2011. 


	Before breaking for the long weekend, Assistant United States Attorney Maurene Comey told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian that the government was on track for the trial to be finished before the July 4th holiday weekend. Comey said prosecutors expect to take another four weeks, with the defense needing a week to present their case.

A
rielle Herzig is a normal person. She does pilates, avoids gluten, works in tech, and lives on a quiet cul de sac in Florida with her husband, Justin. Justin seems normal, too. He's 36, tall and slender, and wears a backward baseball cap most days that gives him the look of a slacker teen. But for a certain subset of people, Justin is far from a normal person. 


	When one of Arielle's brother's friends found out he was related to Justin, the friend freaked out. When Arielle was once at a company event with Justin, someone approached her for an introduction to him, and couldn't contain their excitement. “I can't believe I'm meeting Justin!” they exclaimed. He isn't a celebrity, but to those among us who are particularly obsessed with fantasy football, he is kind of a big deal. Justin Herzig is quite possibly the best fantasy-football player in the world. 


	How, you may wonder, could anyone know who is the best fantasy-football player? There isn't a single tournament that crowns a world champion (there are actually at least three). There isn't even one universally recognized league or scoring system. Fantasy football is a game played by more than 50 million football fans around the world, mostly in small recreational leagues with their friends. Each league has its own rules and conventions. Each league annually has its own champion who likely believes they are the one true Best Player in the World. 

	











	But if there were a way to qualify someone as the best, perhaps it is this: There is one tournament that has by far the biggest prize in the world — Underdog Fantasy's Best Ball Mania. Since 2020, Best Ball Mania has set records for the number of entries every year, and 2024 was another best: 672,672 different entries (individual players are limited to a maximum of 150 entries) and a prize pool of $15 million. Of those, only 56,056 advanced to the Best Ball Mania playoffs, and only 539 made it to the contest's final round in week 17. Only one player could win first place, which paid $1,500,000. To accomplish that, someone would need not only some real skill at playing fantasy football, but also a lot of luck. Over the past five years of this event, there is no player who has more of both than Justin Herzig.

	FANTASY SPORTS IS A MASSIVE piece of the sports industrial complex, with tens of millions of players and billions of dollars in revenue. In America, football is the most popular, accounting for 75 percent of the total fantasy-sports market. The two largest companies to spring from the fantasy-sports boom, FanDuel and DraftKings, also paved the way for the explosion of sports betting across the United States. It is no exaggeration to say that fantasy football has fundamentally changed the way many fans think about the game, the way broadcasters present football on television, the way the league markets the sport, and has possibly even ruined a few co-worker or neighborly relationships along the way. Herzig has played fantasy football for nearly his entire life, riding this wave all the way to the crest. To him, it is more than a game. It is his passion. And it has made him millions of dollars.


	Week 15 of the 2024 NFL season is the dog days of the regular season for most people, but in fantasy football it is when things just start heating up. Fantasy football ends when the regular season ends, so the playoffs in most leagues take place during those last few comparatively meaningless weeks of the regular season. For Best Ball Mania, week 15 is the first week of the playoffs, and only roughly eight percent of the total entries get in.  Of those entries, 90 percent won't advance to week 16.  


	On Monday night, most of the NFL games have already been played the day before, and only a Monday Night Football double-header remains to determine who advances in fantasy and who gets left behind. Herzig has a lot on the line, but instead of stress-watching the games at home alone, he chooses to watch the Vikings play the Bears while playing poker with a group of his civilian friends, all of whom have their own fantasy teams in friendly leagues, but none of whom have anything nearly as large of a sweat as Herzig.

	Late in the game, the Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold throws a deep pass to Jordan Addison that is intercepted. The refs throw a flag and call it pass interference. It sets the Vikings up on the 1-yard line, and they score a touchdown that essentially seals the game. One of Herzig's friends asks him why he seems so disappointed. 


	“Well, if Jordan Addison would have caught that ball instead of him getting the pass interference,” Herzig says nonchalantly, “I think I would have had $132,000.” 

	











	The penalty knocks Herzig out of some high-roller fantasy leagues, including a few with $10,000 buy-ins, where he had already defeated the likes of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy (Portnoy had bragged that he “kicked everybody's ass inside out” after week one, but failed to make the playoffs by season's end). And of Herzig's 150 Best Ball Mania entries, it eliminates all of them but three. In order for Herzig to make it to the finals, one of his three remaining teams would need to be among the top 539 teams out of the remaining 8,624 that would survive the following week. The likelihood of that happening was about one in six. Big deal, you may say. 


	But Herzig has made the finals of this tournament every year, and he even won the inaugural event back in 2020. If he were to make the finals again for the fifth year in a row, he'd accomplish something nobody in fantasy football has ever done before. The likelihood of that happening? One in 23,108. 


	FANTASY FOOTBALL'S ORIGINS CAN BE traced back to the early 1960s with the creation of the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League (GOPPPL) by Bill Winkenbach, an Oakland Raiders minority owner. The game spread in the 1970s through word of mouth, most notably through Andy Mousalimas, an Oakland sports-bar owner who is now known as the “godfather” of fantasy football. His league required players to show up to his bar and draft in person, and through the early years of the game, bar leagues were a major source of growth.


	One such bar league in 1989, at the Scholz Gartenden in downtown Austin, was raided by the local vice squad and eight people were arrested on felony organized-crime charges. It was the first arrest in what would become a national fantasy-football crime wave.


	The law that fantasy football supposedly broke was the prohibition on gambling on sporting events, a line that was blurred by fantasy leagues' use of cash entries and prizes. In 1991, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth issued an opinion that fantasy leagues were illegal and punishable by jail time. The NFL did all it could to distance itself from fantasy leagues, and sent cease-and-desist letters to fantasy-league operators who used the NFL's name and trademarks in their branding. But despite the crackdown, most fans were undeterred, and fantasy football continued to grow.  


	The rise of the internet in the 1990s made it easier than ever to track statistics and coordinate leagues. By 2003, the Fantasy Sports Trade Association estimated that 15 million people were playing fantasy sports, up from fewer than a million in 1988. 

	











	Fantasy had become mainstream, and the NFL realized that fantasy-football players were among its most passionate fans. Studies showed that fantasy fans attended more games, bought more team apparel, and consumed more media. In 2002, the league surveyed its fans and found that while the average fan watched 6.6 hours of football a week, the average fantasy player watched 8.4 hours. To cater to these die-hards, the NFL created a channel called RedZone, which would only show the scoring plays in each NFL game live as they happened, continuously for seven hours each Sunday. (Today, fantasy players on average consume more than 20 hours of sports media every week.) 


	By 2006, when Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act, a law designed to criminalize online gambling in all of its various forms, from poker to sports betting, the NFL had completely abandoned its objections to fantasy. The league lobbied Congress to write in an exception to the ban for fantasy sports. 


	It was around this time that Herzig got serious about fantasy football. He'd been playing since middle school in Florida, where he and his friends would use the computers at school to draft their teams and set lineups. Herzig was always a sports nut, and even a bit of an athlete. He played competitive tennis until an injury sidelined him. He went to college at Wake Forest and spent most of his nights playing online poker until the UIGEA shut it all down his sophomore year. He used his newfound extra time to put more work into his fantasy-football teams. To give himself an edge in his league with his friends, Herzig would join large leagues on Yahoo and ESPN that allowed anyone to enter, just so he could get a glimpse at what players other people were picking up and dropping so he could use that information in his own league, leveraging anything he could find to get an advantage. It grew into a major endeavor, despite only having $5 or $10 at stake among his friends. “If I was going to be playing, I've never been the type to half-ass something like that,” he says. “So I put in the time.” 


	Throughout college, Herzig wanted to work in sports, perhaps as an agent. He interned as a baseball scout for a sports agency, traveling through Florida and working as an adviser with high school and college prospects. The work involved player evaluation and was his first foray, however rudimentary, into projecting athletes' future performance. By the time he finished college with a degree in political science, he had job offers to work full time as a scout. It would have been his dream, getting paid to work in sports, but the work would have kept him on the road and the money wasn't great. “I considered it, but ended up kind of selling out a bit.” He abandoned his plan to go to law school and become a sports agent and instead applied for and was accepted into a development program for recent college graduates at Capital One, learning data analytics. 

	











	At Capital One, he quickly made friends with a group of like-minded sports fans, and they started their own fantasy-football league. They traveled to Las Vegas to make an event out of their draft, booking a suite at the MGM Grand. 


	Most of them went to Vegas to party — Herzig was there to win. Herzig had done his homework before the trip. He knew what state his friends were from, where they went to college, who their favorite players were. The plan? Make everyone overpay for players he knew they wanted, and to keep the prices low on the ones he wanted for himself. 


	“You've got to be paying attention the entire time,” Herzig tells me. Not all of his opponents were up for the task. “One of the guys had a little too much fun hanging at the pool and knew that he was not fit for the draft.” He spent all of his money on the first two players, then went to sleep. 


	After that first year, Herzig's Capital One co-workers kept their fantasy league going, each year collectively getting better and better. Because they all had technical backgrounds in data analytics, they took fantasy football seriously in a whole new way — they didn't just choose players based on their general sense of whether a player was “good” or “bad.” They built computer programs to analyze player statistics that mirrored the kind of models they built at work. “We kind of started thinking, ‘Hey, can't we apply these same methodologies?'” Herzig says. 


	Herzig wrote code to project individual-player performances based on data sets of past statistics, and used a solver program in Excel that took Herzig's projections and spit out an optimal fantasy lineup. His projections were rudimentary by today's standards, but at the time were ahead of the curve. Yahoo was publishing its own projections of what each player should expect to score in fantasy each week. Herzig tested his results against Yahoo's fantasy ratings and found his were more accurate. He knew he was onto something.


	Around this time, a new way to play fantasy football was growing in popularity. Daily fantasy sports (DFS) websites started cropping up, allowing players to build a new fantasy team every single day, and have that team compete in large-scale tournaments online. Rather than drafting one team that competed all season long, DFS players put together one or more new teams every week. Best of all, DFS players didn't need to wait until the end of the football season to collect any money they won. They could win money every week. 

	











	The rise of DFS was facilitated by the UIGEA, thanks to the fantasy-sports exemption. The exemption didn't require a minimum length of time for a contest, so enterprising companies figured out a way to develop a fantasy contest that would feel more akin to sports betting, while still operating within the guidelines of fantasy sports. The first significant DFS sites appeared in 2007, but the DFS industry gained traction with companies like FanDuel and DraftKings, which launched around 2009. Growth was explosive. Herzig and his buddies started playing DFS on these early sites, making use of their player projections and predictive models, and it didn't take Herzig long to build up a five-figure bankroll. 


	One of Herzig's friends at Capital One, David, moved to San Francisco to join a tech startup in 2016. “I was out there visiting him and met his sister, who he had previously done a great job of hiding from his friends.” The sister's name was Arielle, and two weeks after meeting her, Herzig flew back to San Francisco — this time to see Arielle. Three months later, Herzig packed his bags and moved to San Francisco.


	After Arielle and Herzig moved in together, she began to notice his stress level going up when he watched football. She asked him about it, and he told her about how much money he had riding on the results of the games. She was shocked. “Are you, like, gambling?” she asked him. “I build prediction models,” he told her, and he showed her how he was beating the competition with his models. That put her at ease. “If Justin was going to lose money at something, he wouldn't be doing it,” she tells me.


	Arielle says eventually she even came to enjoy Herzig's fantasy-football contests. “I have found some joy in it,” she says, “but I think what's different about how I used to watch football versus now is before I used to cheer for a team, whereas now it is more about the individual players.” This is a common conundrum for football fans in the age of fantasy sports. When Arielle's mother tried to watch a game with them and asked Justin what team to root for, he paradoxically replied “both.” 


	“A lot of people might really like a team,” Herzig says, “but their fandom for their fantasy team comes first.” 


	By 2017, Herzig qualified for the first-ever major DFS tournament on a site called Fantasy Drafts. It held 12 qualifying tournaments, each with 2,000 people putting up $500 and the winner moving on to a final event. Herzig entered, won, and made the finals. Fantasy Drafts brought him to Charlotte, North Carolina, where the final 12 competed live for a million-dollar first prize. Among those finalists were Alex “Awesomo” Baker and brothers Tom and Martin Crowley, three of the most successful DFS players at that time. Herzig finished ninth. “Even though I did poorly, I still felt like I'm on the right page,” he says. 

	











	Eventually Herzig grew weary of DFS, and went looking for a different game, perhaps with softer competition. “I don't want to just go swim with the sharks,” he says, “but I do need to increase how much I'm willing to play.” In 2018, he discovered Best Ball, where players draft a team and leave it for the whole season. They don't trade or drop players as they get injured or perform better. There's a draft, then 17 weeks of sweating. 


	Because you're stuck with whoever you pick, the game involves more luck than DFS — but still requires skill to win. “It's kind of the sweet spot,” says Peter Jennings, a two-time DFS world champion and one of Herzig's earliest opponents. “Just like poker.” While it had become nearly impossible for an unskilled player to get lucky and win at DFS, someone could occasionally win at Best Ball based solely on luck, which kept more recreational players in the pool. But a skilled player like Herzig could outperform the lucky players over the long run. “We were probably the top two guys in the early Best Ball days,” says Jennings of himself and Herzig. “That's just because the skill gap was enormous.” 


	Herzig discovered a small startup called Draft that ran Best Ball contests for small buy-ins, around $1 to $3 per contest. He entered as many of them as he could. The owner later told him that for the first three years of the company's existence, Herzig was their biggest player, both in terms of the number of contests he entered as well as how much he won. For the 2019 season alone, he drafted 31,000 teams. He won $164,000. 

“You don't have an edge with Justin. You're just hoping he doesn't have an edge on you.”


	IN 2019, HERZIG WENT TO WORK FOR Accenture, a major tech-industry consulting firm, leading research into emerging technology. Despite spending hours every day working on fantasy football, he held on to his day job. With the salary he was at, and the track that he was on, giving up his career to focus solely on a game where his wins (and losses) were never guaranteed, didn't seem wise. “I had golden handcuffs with the corporate life,” he says.


	He continued to have success playing fantasy, however. As he won more money, he'd invest more into his fantasy leagues each season, eventually reaching about $100,000 in entry fees per year. One year, he made more than $800,000. But a lot of that was from tournament wins where he had to get through large fields. “I can't say that was repeatable. There's still so much luck involved.” 


	In 2020, he won the first ever Best Ball Mania contest for $200,000, and donated a portion of his winnings to Son of a Saint, a charity that helps boys in New Orleans who have lost their fathers to death or incarceration. The donation was a way to say thank you: It's the charity of choice for New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara. “Alvin Kamara got me six touchdowns,” he says. “I wouldn't have won it without Alvin Kamara.”


	That 2020 win cemented Herzig as one of the top fantasy players in the world. He backed it up with a string of other wins and top finishes over the next few years. He's remained at the head of the curve by being independent rather than just copying what other successful players are doing. “He's been able to achieve one in 100 to one in 10,000 outcomes consistently, which just shows the level of skill that he has,” Jennings says. “We have a very similar strategy, and I've drafted thousands of leagues against Justin.… Justin's not going to make mistakes. You don't have an edge with Justin. You're just hoping he doesn't have an edge on you.”  

	











	In 2023, Herzig made it to the finals of a DraftKings Best Ball event, where first place paid a million. The final game fell on his birthday, which was also New Year's Eve. He and Arielle had just moved into a new house on a bayou near Tampa Bay, Florida, and she organized a party to celebrate the holiday, his birthday, and their new home. The party was not meant to be an occasion to sweat Herzig's potential million-dollar win. The guests were mostly Arielle's friends and colleagues, not Herzig's football crowd. “I obviously knew that he did these kinds of things,” Arielle says, “but no one else did.”


	As the party went on and the guests all watched fireworks from the veranda overlooking the bayou, Herzig started to receive frantic texts from his fantasy-football friends. Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jayden Reed, who was on Herzig's team, was having a big game. Herzig turned on the game in time to see Reed catch a touchdown pass right before halftime. He realized he needed only a single 20-yard catch or a pair of 11-yard catches from Reed to secure the win and the million bucks. 


	He told Arielle about what was happening. She told a couple of her friends at the party. Before long, the entire party was standing around the television peppering Herzig with questions. “People just did not understand at all. They were like, ‘How did you get this?' and, ‘Did you make, like, a $100,000 bet?'” 


	As halftime dragged on, Herzig and his guests agonized waiting for the game to come back on. A text appeared in his fantasy football group chat. It only said, “Oh no.” Herzig knew instantly what it meant. 


	Reed had hurt himself during the touchdown catch. The game was a blowout for the Packers, so the team had decided not to risk a worse injury to its wide receiver. He wouldn't return to the game. Herzig would finish in second place and “only” win $150,000.  His guests were crestfallen. “Now I've got people feeling bad for me. Why should they feel bad for me?” he says. “I'm still winning $150,000. It's still pretty awesome.” 

	











	If Arielle's friends felt bad for Herzig, they were equally in awe of his talent. A lot of them played fantasy football, too. “All my friends started reaching out to Justin about football,” Arielle says. No rest for the weary. 


	HEADING INTO THIS YEAR'S BEST BALL MANIA finals, Herzig felt relieved to just make it that far. His life was changing in ways that made it harder for him to prioritize fantasy football. Years at Accenture helping tech entrepreneurs with their startups had sparked in him a latent envy — he was ready to start his own business. He co-founded a startup with one of his friends from his Capital One days that produced fantasy games. He invested some of his money into real estate. Arielle was pregnant with their first child. 


	As I drive up to his house to watch the finals with him on a Sunday afternoon in late December, his neighborhood was in shambles after hurricanes Helene and Milton. Herzig's home remained standing and in good shape despite having been flooded. It overlooks a bayou just off of Tampa Bay, and he and his guests sit outside on a veranda watching a TV mounted on the outside of the house. 


	While Herzig is hoping to win a million dollars, his guests are all worried about their own various fantasy teams, mostly competing for a few hundred bucks. They each tell me some version of the same story: They had been in their league for many years, with the same people. There was money involved, but it was secondary to the glory of winning, the bragging rights, the triumph over their closest and dearest friends. “It's much more the pride than it is the money,” Arielle's friend Cory Brandfon tells me. “The pride will make me lose sleep.”


	Herzig, too, has one of these leagues he plays in every year. He used to manage about a dozen of them. Now he plays in only one, with a group of friends from his baseball-scout days he has played with for more than a decade, none of whom do high-stakes fantasy sports like he does. Whatever edge Herzig gets from all of his projections and modeling, they haven't borne much fruit in his friend league. Last year was the first year he won it. To finally win against his friends who only played “for the fun of it,” “I got so much pride out of that,” he says. 


	While the Super Bowl looms large for fans of the NFL, the comparatively insignificant week 17 of the regular season is equally big for fantasy-football players. It's the next-to-last week of the season, but it's the last week for fantasy, because the final week of the regular season is often a week that teams choose to rest their starting players. 


	To deal with this, Herzig spends a lot of time thinking about week 17 matchups at the start of the season when he's drafting his teams. He looks at things like the likelihood of their team being in contention, a player's contract situation, their age, the players behind them on the roster who might be competing for minutes late in the season. 

	











He also does some counterintuitive drafting, like picking up two players on the same team — a quarterback and wide receiver combo, for example — so that when one has a big game, they both do. In week 16, this strategy helped him advance to the finals, when Baker Mayfield, the quarterback of his hometown Tampa Bay Buccaneers, connected with wide receiver Jalen McMillan for two touchdowns in a 34-point game. Both were on Herzig's team. 


	The Buccaneers needed to beat the Carolina Panthers in week 17 to make the playoffs, and most of Herzig's guests wanted to watch that game, rather than the NFL RedZone channel. The Buccaneers played all of their starters, and Mayfield put up a staggering total of five touchdowns and 359 passing yards for the top fantasy score of the week. It vaulted Herzig's team into the top 100. He went from being happy just to be here, to a glimmer of hope. 


	The feeling wouldn't last. As the day's games wore on into night, Herzig could do nothing as he watched his fellow finalists leapfrog over him in the standings as all of his active players finished and other players continued to put up incredible stat lines all day. The Buccaneers were in the playoffs. Herzig's friends were home-league champions. But Herzig fell to 125th place out of 672,672. It wasn't first. It wasn't a million dollars. But he took some solace in knowing that in simply making it this far, in this large of a field, for the fifth consecutive year, he had done something nobody had ever done before, and possibly will never do again. “If you max out the contest, you should only make the finals once out of every 10 years,” he says, referring to entering Best Ball Mania with the maximum of 150 entries. “There's been millions of entries. Only one person has made all five finals.” 


	A few weeks later, the Buccaneers would play their first-round playoff game, and Herzig planned to be at the game. Arielle was due any day to give birth, so she stayed home, and insisted Herzig plan ahead a quick-exit strategy in case she went into labor during the game. 


	The Buccaneers appeared to be on the verge of victory, but Mayfield fumbled the ball in his own red zone, and they never recovered. In football, as in fantasy football, skill alone isn't enough to win. You need a little bit of luck, too. “I'm a firm believer in the way the universe works,” says Jennings. “You can create your own luck by working hard and being smart. I think that's evident with Justin.”

	Because the universe is both amusing and kind, a few hours after the Buccaneers game, Arielle went into labor and gave birth to their daughter, Riley.

Britney Spears has admitted to lighting a cigarette while on a plane. On May 22, while on a charter plane flight, Spears lit a cigarette mid-flight. She reportedly put it out at the request of flight attendants and authorities issued a warning to the pop star at the airport once the plane landed.


	On Friday, Spears addressed the incident on Instagram, confirming that what had been reported was true. Calling it “incredibly funny,” she wrote, “Some planes I've been on you can't smoke mostly but this one was different because the drink holders were on outside of seat.”


	In an accompanying video to her Instagram post, Spears looks happy as she holds a wine bottle split. The drink holder is indeed outside of the seat, though it's unclear why that made Spears think it was OK to smoke on this particular plane. That said, while it is a violation of federal aviation regulations to smoke on commercial flights, it can be permissible on private charter planes, depending on if the owner or operater permits it and that the jet complies with FAA rules regarding passenger and crew compartment interiors.

	After drinking vodka for the first time, she wrote that she wanted a cigarette. A friend then placed a cigarette in her mouth and lit it. “I was like OH SO THIS IS A PLANE WHERE YOU CAN SMOKE !!!,” she wrote.


	Turns out that was not the case. “I do so apologize to anyone I offended but the flight attendants always make sure I'm way at the back of plane anyways,” she added. When authorities met her at the airport, she thought that they were greeting her “as support and I was like WOW I feel special.”


	She finally put together that authorities were there because a flight attendant had alerted officials about the incident. Spears also claimed one particular flight attendant had tried to “embarrass” her and made sure she sat down when no one was on the plane yet, among other allegations.

	Amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested and detained a Florida-born U.S. citizen, claiming his REAL ID was fake, Noticias Telemundo reported Friday. 


	Law enforcement came to Leonardo Garcia Venegas' construction job in Foley, Alabama, on Wednesday. Before his arrest, he told NBC News, he was taking out his phone. One ICE agent threw it on the ground, and another grabbed him. 


	“I'm a citizen!” he said, according to video. 


	“He's a citizen, bro!” an onlooker yelled.

	Garcia Venegas, whose parents are from Mexico, told Noticias Telemundo that Immigration and Customs Enforcement said his REAL ID was fake. They detained him in a vehicle, where he gave officials his Social Security number. He was released hours later. 


	“They took out my wallet, took out my ID,” he told the outlet in Spanish, via The Latin Times. “And they told me it was fake. Said it wasn't valid and that it was fake. My ID. They handcuffed me and they handcuffed me really tight.”

	











	“I feel really sad, honestly, and I feel a bit nervous for everything that's happening,” he said.


	Immigration officials have arrested and deported thousands of people, making good on Trump's xenophobic campaign promises. Citizens have been deported, including at least two children with cancer. Trump has defied a judge by deporting people to a notorious prison in El Salvador. And earlier this week, he deported two Asian immigrants to South Sudan, violating a court order. 


	“He was actually pretty sore when he got back,” Garcia Venegas' cousin Shelah Venegas told NBC News. “He said his arms were hurting and his hands. His wrists, you could see where he had all the marks from the handcuffs. … The way they put him on the ground, his knees also were hurting.”


	“Apparently a REAL ID is not valid anymore. He has a REAL ID,” she said. “We all made sure we have the REAL ID and went through the protocols the administration is asking for. … He has his REAL ID and then they see him and I guess because his English isn't fluent and/or because he's brown it's fake, it's not real.”

	A REAL ID is an identification card that can be used to fly and enter federal buildings. It has higher federal security standards than a driver's license. A rule went into effect earlier this month that travelers need a REAL ID or a passport in airports. 

	











	ICE also detained Garcia Venegas' brother, who was not in the country legally. He reportedly signed deportation papers, wanting to avoid another family member's experience of spending months in a detention center. 


	Garcia Venegas “physically got in between agents and the subject they were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, told NBC News. “Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.”

	Venegas said her family owns a contracting company, and some people are refusing to come to work in the current political climate. 


	“It's just insane we can't be different, the color that we are. We contribute to this country the same way every other citizen does with their taxes,” she said. “But we have to be the ones that every time we go to work, we are going to be scared that we're going to get discriminated [against].”

A haunted doll collector who houses 54 'spirits' has weighed in on the debate surrounding the allegedly paranormal Annabelle doll being taken on 'tour.'

The Raggedy Anne doll was made famous back in the 1970s when paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren looked into alleged attacks made by the infamous toy.

While they warned that she should never be moved, Annabelle is now currently touring the US alongside other items from the Warrens Occult Museum collection – leaving people online up in arms.

Now, haunted doll collector Teej, who has over 50 paranormal items in her possession, has weighed in on the controversial Annabelle tour. 

She insisted, however, that we shouldn't be so quick to make snap judgements about the toy, and said that she believes the haunted doll is misunderstood.

'Do I believe that Annabelle is responsible for all of the tragedy that she is being blamed for right now? Absolutely not,' the US-based woman told What's The Jam recently.

'Most of the stories tied to her are unverified and don't have any evidence to back them up.

'Honestly, I believe that Annabelle deserves a fresh investigation with an unbiased investigation team, to figure out what is actually going on with her.'

While they warned that she should never be moved, Annabelle is now currently touring the US alongside other items from the Warrens Occult Museum collection. The Warrens are pictured

Teej said she believes the doll's narrative was 'created' by the Warrens following their initial investigation.

She added: 'This was a very long time ago and, since then, she has been sensationalized in Hollywood.

'We don't even know Annabelle's true story. We owe it not only to her, but to all spirits, to start asking the real questions and getting evidence on who they are and what happened to them.

'People keep saying ""bring Annabelle home,"" but the truth is – Annabelle doesn't have a home.

'The Warrens Occult Museum has been closed to the public since 2019, so she [was] not at home – she was in storage. Locked away, not honored, not protected, not valued.'

Teej pointed out that the doll has spent her entire 'afterlife' on display in a museum being 'gawked at, disrespected, and sensationalized for money' – without any way to 'defend' herself from the claims.

'Imagine being the center of basically an entire country's fear without any voice of your own, and no one to look out for and defend you,' she continued. 'Spirits like Annabelle are not props – no spirit is.'

Teej explained that all purported spirits should be treated with 'dignity, respect and kindness' – no matter the rumors that have dogged them over the years.

Now, haunted doll collector Teej, who has over 50 paranormal items in her possession, has issued a stark warning about the Annabelle tour

Teej said she believes the doll's narrative was 'created' by the Warrens following their initial investigation

In Annabelle's case, the doll dates back to 1970 when she was gifted to a nursing student, who was told by a psychic medium that the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a deceased girl named Annabelle.

'We don't even know Annabelle's true story,' Teej said. 'We owe it not only to her, but to all spirits, to start asking the real questions and getting evidence on what happened to them'

The student and her roommate reported 'malicious and frightening' behaviors from the doll.

Annabelle reportedly moved on her own and at one point attacked the fiancé of one of its owners.

That's when the Warrens stepped in to investigate, deemed it to be demonic, and moved it to their museum.

Annabelle then became one of the most well-known haunted items following the Conjuring and Annabelle movie franchises. 

The doll is now on tour across the globe through the Devils on the Run Tour, which takes items, including Annabelle, from the Warrens Occult Museum collection in Monroe to various cities to display them to horror buffs. 

Teej started connecting with the paranormal in childhood, encouraged by her family who took her on ghost hunts, and had her first encounter at the age of six.

She said: 'We were in a parking lot using an Ovilus, which is a device that turns environmental energy into words that appear on a screen – a common spirit communication tool still used by investigators to this day.

Teej explained that all purported spirits should be treated with 'dignity, respect and kindness' – no matter the rumors that have dogged them over the years

Teej started collecting haunted dolls in 2020 – but will only house ones with positive intentions

'Out of nowhere, the Ovilus said, ""Get out of the way, fast."" We didn't wait, we moved immediately.

'Right after we cleared the area, a car whipped around the corner. It was really dark, and if we hadn't moved, there's a good chance we could've been hit.

'That moment stuck with me, not just because it was my first clear experience, but because it felt like a spirit was trying to help us.

'That was the first time I felt like a spirit interaction was actually positive, and that's something I've kept in mind ever since.

'It's a big part of why I'm now interested in haunted dolls, specifically ones with positive energy. That early experience shaped the way I look at the paranormal today.'

She started collecting haunted dolls in 2020 – but will only house ones with positive intentions.

'What pulled me in were the stories behind them, specifically the personal accounts, the unexplained experiences, and the history behind some of the more well-known cases,' she continued.

'I spent a lot of time researching and reading about them, trying to understand what made each case unique.

'I choose to work only with positive spirits in my home because of the relationships that naturally develop over time.

'Many of these spirits have a genuine desire to communicate and be acknowledged, and that opens the door to meaningful and respectful connections.

She said: 'We treat them with respect, and in return, they do the same. Our interactions are often lighthearted and much of the paranormal activity in our home is playful'

'What pulled me in were the stories behind them, specifically the unexplained experiences, and the history behind some of the more well-known cases,' she continued

'We treat them with respect, and in return, they do the same. Our interactions are often lighthearted and much of the paranormal activity in our home is playful, sometimes even meant to make us laugh.

'Just as importantly, I'm mindful of safety. When I investigate haunted locations, I always have the option to leave.

'But my home is my safe space, and I won't risk inviting in any spirit that could bring harm or disruption to me or my family.

'By setting clear boundaries, I'm able to stay open to paranormal experiences while still protecting the comfort and peace of our home.'

She added of the recent news about Annabelle: 'While I know Annabelle is currently on tour and it's easy to fall into the trap of assuming all haunted dolls behave like the famous ones, it's important to remember that every spirit is unique

'No two spirits are exactly alike, and many are actually positive or neutral in nature.

'Making broad generalizations that all haunted dolls are dangerous or negative can be harmful and misleading.

'It's essential to take the time to get to know each spirit individually before jumping to conclusions about their behavior or intentions.'

The infamous Annabelle doll, known from horror stories and movies, has once again caused a stir on social media. Recently, many people claimed that the doll had disappeared during a paranormal tour in Louisiana. Some even said the doll was ‘missing'. This panic came just days after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Plantation, now called Nottoway Resort, in White Castle, Louisiana. Although no one was hurt, some social media users started rumours and conspiracy theories linking the fire to Annabelle being displayed nearby.

The Annabelle doll is actually a Raggedy Ann doll kept at the Warrens Occult Museum in Connecticut. It has been part of a paranormal tour across America. Locals in Louisiana said they were not able to see the doll during the tour and began to worry that it had gone missing.

One person wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), “I just saw a post on Facebook that they LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL? I'm fleeing the country goodbye.” Another user reacted, “THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL?? LIKE?? THE HAUNTED ANNABELLE DOLL?? They take her on a tour around America...... AND THEN THEY LOOSE HER? BRAH?” A third tweet read, “wdym the annabelle doll is missing??? who tf lost her??? i was already not able to sleep 😭😭😭”

However, these rumours were quickly proven false. Dan Rivera from NESPR, a paranormal research group, posted a video from inside the Warrens Occult Museum showing the Annabelle doll safe and sound. As one person wrote after sharing the video, “Some wild and crazy internet rumors this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost and here's Dan Rivera with NESPR proving she is back home inside the museum in Connecticut.. for now. And no, Annabelle is not supposed to be in Chicago.”

Officials have confirmed that there is no connection between the recent fires and the doll. The Annabelle doll remains locked away at the museum, far from the fires and the social media panic.

The story of Annabelle began in the 1970s, when paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren said the doll was possessed by a spirit. Since then, Annabelle has become one of the most famous haunted objects, inspiring films and countless tales of terror. Despite the fear she inspires, the real doll is a simple Raggedy Ann kept safe under glass in the museum.

As paranormal researcher Dan Rivera said, “Annabelle may be scary, but she isn't going anywhere — at least, not without the Warrens' permission.”

   08:42 EDT 25 May 2025, updated  11:49 EDT 25 May 2025    By STACY LIBERATORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM  

A 'UFO base' mentioned in a declassified CIA document has fueled a surge in sightings, turning Mount Hayes into one of America's top alien hotspots.

Rising over 8,000 feet, Mount Hayes sits within the so-called Alaska Triangle, a region notorious for unexplained disappearances and paranormal activity.

However, the CIA has never confirmed the alien base and the US government's stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. 

Locals have reported streaks of colored lights, orbs traveling at high speed, and mysterious vanishing people. 

One report came from Jared Augustin, a former security officer, who claimed he saw a glowing orb hovering in the night sky near Mount Hayes before it suddenly split into three.

'It was a UFO, of extraterrestrial origin,' Augustin told DMAX UK, adding that he stood frozen, shaking as the bizarre sight unfolded.

Theories about alien activity have led the public to scour Google Maps for signs of the secret base.

Some conspiracy theorists claim there's missing satellite data over Mount Hayes, allegedly to hide the base's location.

'Wow, that's a big coincidence, in a very specific shape,' one Reddit user commented, pointing to a rectangular patch seemingly missing from the mountain on Google Maps.

Mount Hayes is located within an area known for unexplained disappearances and paranormal activity.

Locals have aimed trail cameras at Mount Hayes, hoping to capture proof that the area is a UFO hotspot.

In an episode of History Channel's Missing in Alaska, a local resident named Wilbur shared footage he believed showed an alien craft.

The video captured a glowing green light hovering over Mount Hayes. Within seconds, it appeared to vanish behind the mountain.

Investigators said the object had 'hovering capabilities like a helicopter, but could also reverse direction instantly' — something no known aircraft can do.

Based on its position and movement, the team estimated the object's drop speed to be just over Mach 1 (the speed of sound).

In addition to mysterious airborne sightings, more than 2,000 people have vanished in the area since the 1970s.

Notable incidents include the 1972 disappearance of a plane carrying US House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, which vanished en route from Anchorage to Juneau. 

Despite an extensive 39-day search covering 325,000 square miles, no wreckage or remains were ever found.

In December 2023, Brian Erickson was reported missing after departing the village of Healy Lake on a green Polaris Ranger side-by-side vehicle.

He was last seen on December 2, 2023, at 4pm.

Search efforts were initiated, and the operation transitioned from a Search and Rescue to a Search and Recovery mission on December 6, 2023.

The Alaska State Troopers have been actively seeking assistance in locating Erickson.

Locals have suggested that these disappearances and many more are due to UFO activity near the mountain. 

However, Mount Hayes is situated within an area stretching between Anchorage, Juneau and Utqiagvik.

The combination of challenging terrain, unpredictable weather, and sparse population contributes to the difficulties in search and rescue operations. 

While UFOs have been reported in the area for decades, the sightings gained more attention when the CIA declassified its experiment in 2000. 

The report, titled 'Description of Personnel Associated 'ET' Bases,' detailed a session in which a remote viewer was given unknown targets and asked to describe what they perceived. 

The remote viewing session was part of the CIA's top-secret STARGATE program, which recruited individuals believed to have psychic abilities for military and intelligence purposes during the Cold War.

The program began in the early 1970s and officially shut down in 1995 after being deemed scientifically unreliable and operationally ineffective for intelligence gathering.

During a remote viewing session, participants typically sketched what they 'saw' and jotted down brief notes about their perceptions.

The 12-page document includes several drawings believed to depict the locations of these ET bases—one sketch appears to resemble a rocky mountain.

That drawing has been interpreted as Mount Hayes in Alaska, which stands roughly 8,000 feet tall.

According to the remote viewer, he found himself mentally inside a facility beneath Mount Hayes, where he observed 'two types of entities' associated with the site. 

He described seeing two beings standing outside one of the bases, 'accomplishing some sort of routine task.'

Inside the base, they perceived two more entities. One was seated at a circular console with a round, screen-like object, according to the session notes.

The second figure was performing another task in the background.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The 10 Best Stephen King Villains Who Don't Have Supernatural Powers, Ranked","https://collider.com/stephen-king-villains-dont-have-supernatural-powers-ranked/","Sun, 25 May 2025 02:00:00 GMT","

If there's one thing Stephen King is undeniably skilled at writing, it's horror, for obvious reasons. Much of the time, that horror is supernatural in nature, and that's good and all, but King's written dozens of novels, and for him to solely rely on supernatural threats 100% of the time would eventually make his stories stale.

Also, that kind of heightened horror can be scarier when it exists alongside terrifying individuals who behave in alarming yet more everyday ways. The following characters hopefully demonstrate King's knack for writing strong villains who don't have fantastical abilities or supernatural powers. Some exist in stories that do feature such fantastical things, while others are villainous in stories that don't feature fantasy and/or supernatural elements. In the end, though, none of them needed otherworldly abilities to be effective antagonists or secondary villains.

The first novel of Stephen King's that was published (in 1974), and the first to get a major film adaptation (in 1976), Carrie is a supernatural horror story, in a way, but it's also got some comparatively mundane villains. Well, mundane might be the wrong word. But it's the titular character who has the supernatural powers, and they're unleashed in a devastating way after she deals with abuse both at school and at home.

Chris is the one who orchestrates much of Carrie's misery at school, while her mother makes her life hell at home. It's the prank Chris pulls at prom that makes Carrie snap, though the more prolonged abuse Margaret White subjects her to makes her eligible for a dishonorable mention here. Carrie herself causes the widespread death and destruction, but ultimately feels like a victim, given how these two treat her.

11/22/63 is one of the best Stephen King novels to not be a work of horror, even though it's pretty intense and occasionally unsettling in places. It's instead a time travel story that has its protagonist be a man who is able to travel back to 1958 and affect the future, so he decides to use such a unique opportunity to thwart Lee Harvey Oswald before he can assassinate John F. Kennedy.

But he has to make sure Oswald was really behind the killing, and that involves monitoring him without impacting how he acted on the titular day in 1963. And the story does not paint Oswald in a positive light by any means, since he takes out so much of his anger on his wife, physically, and then does prove to be the lone gunman behind the JFK assassination.

The main villain in The Stand, Randall Flagg, has his fair share of otherworldly abilities (and that's putting it mildly), but this is a massive book, and certainly has room for other villainous characters. In fact, Flagg builds up a massive gang of followers that end up being on the side of evil in a whole massive good vs. evil conflict waged in the aftermath of a viral outbreak that kills most of the world's population.

So, the people who serve Flagg might be assisted by Flagg's abilities, but are ultimately just normal people, Harold included. He's worth mentioning here, though, since he starts on the side of good and flips, lashing out against the people he'd be better off allying with and coming close to destroying the Boulder community in the process.

In The Dead Zone, it's the protagonist, Johnny Smith, who has supernatural powers, and the antagonist, Greg Stillson, is just an all-around awful human being, but a human being nonetheless. Smith can see flashes of the future when he comes into contact with people, and much of The Dead Zone revolves around him trying to take Stillson, an aspiring politician, down, since one vision of the future seemed to show Stillson becoming President and starting a nuclear war.

The villain here stands to wield an extraordinary amount of power, and has a chance of ending the world, but in a rather mundane way, compared to some other supernaturally gifted Stephen King antagonists.

So, the villain here stands to wield an extraordinary amount of power, and has a chance of ending the world, but in a rather mundane (and thereby arguably more unnerving) way, compared to some other supernaturally gifted Stephen King antagonists. It might all sound a bit far-fetched, but King makes it work, with The Dead Zone being an engaging read and, like 11/22/63, has a high-concept premise executed well.

The Green Mile is not lacking in characters who've done terrible things, since it's set on Death Row and the prisoners who aren't John Coffey are said to have committed genuinely horrific crimes. Also, Percy Wetmore is a guard who abuses his power and causes more suffering than needed, making him stand as one of many noteworthy bullies King has written about.

But the character who's done the most evil within the story is William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton, who's on Death Row for murdering three people and, as it turns out, also committed the horrific crime for which Coffey is condemned to die. He does all his evil as an uneasily mundane sadist, as in he doesn't have any powers, nor is he possessed by some kind of otherworldly evil force. He's just a horrific person.

Like The Green Mile, The Mist had a film adaptation directed by Frank Darabont, and it was also a Stephen King story that had more than one villain. The titular mist does bring with it a ton of supernatural horrors, but within the supermarket that all the characters find themselves confined to, the religiously fanatical Mrs. Carmody is arguably just as much of a threat.

She builds up a decent following within the store, and is one of those quintessential “maybe humans are the real monsters” kind of characters. Neither the story nor the character of Mrs. Carmody is particularly nuanced, but the former is well-told, and the latter is undeniably easy to hate (much in the same way that Carrie's similarly fanatical mom was in Carrie).

There's a lot more than just the titular antagonist (that often takes the appearance of a clown) to fear in It, since this one, like The Stand, ends up being an epic novel with plenty of room for multiple villains. In typical King fashion, many of these are bullies, with Henry Bowers ultimately serving as the secondary antagonist of the story. He doesn't upstage IT itself, but no one really could.

To be fair, Henry is under the influence of IT for at least some of the novel, but the stuff he does isn't necessarily supernatural or anything more damaging than what a bully could feasibly do. He's someone who's already villainous, but becomes more so because of the central antagonist here, but he's still such a definitive bully within King's body of work that he's worthy of mention regardless.

The Body was the short story upon which Stand by Me was based. It's no exaggeration to call the latter one of the best coming-of-age movies of all time, and it's also one of the best Stephen King adaptations generally speaking. It's a simple film about four boys going on a journey to find a dead body, and dealing with the struggles of being young all the while.

Said struggles include encounters with bullies, with Ace Merrill being the leader of the main antagonistic gang. The Body and Stand by Me are about as far from horror/fantasy as Stephen King ever got, but Ace is still a completely monstrous character who comes close to feeling over-the-top, but never crosses that line, staying effectively menacing and wholly intimidating, as a result.

There might exist people who don't like The Shawshank Redemption, but good luck finding them. This is considered not just a great Stephen King film adaptation, but one of the greatest movies of all time in a more general sense, and perhaps the definitive prison film, too. It's about two prisoners – one who's lost hope, and one who maintains his innocence and wants to escape – and the bond that forms between them within the titular Shawshank State Penitentiary.

The main antagonist here is the prison's warden, and he's terrible, more so in the movie than he was in the original short story (which also had a different title: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption). Warden Norton abuses his power and often relishes the opportunities to cause misery in an already miserable place, and is immensely hateable in the process. Oh, and speaking of misery…

Stephen King's 1987 novel, Misery, is one of his most uncomfortable and intense works, and was adapted into a similarly grueling (but engaging) film in 1990. The premise here is simple, and the number of key characters is low, seeing as most of Misery is centered on an author who's confined to an isolated cabin, held prisoner by Annie Wilkes, who's a lonely nurse and the author's self-appointed number 1 fan.

Wilkes is a constant source of, you know, misery, and might well do the most psychological damage of any Stephen King antagonist who doesn't have supernatural powers. Hell, even compared to the ones who do, few put a Stephen King protagonist through anywhere near as much living hell as author Paul Sheldon goes through. It really has to be seen (or read) to be believed.

The Nike Air Foamposite One “Psychic Blue” is returning this May, and the icy tone brings a sharp update to the legendary silhouette. The Foamposite One, known for its futuristic shell and tough build, continues to age well. 

This colorway leans into simplicity, and it works. Originally introduced in 1997 and made famous by Penny Hardaway, the Foamposite One was ahead of its time. Its molded upper and carbon fiber shank plate helped redefine performance sneakers for guards. 

Over the years, it's become more of a lifestyle statement, popping up in bold colorways and collaborations. Still, its roots are in performance. “Psychic Blue” feels like a balance between heritage and lifestyle appeal. It's clean, it's wearable, and it nods to that late 90s era without going full retro. 

The matte finish adds a new texture to the upper while the contrast with the black mesh and tongue makes the color really pop. The on-foot shots show just how good this pair looks laced up. The soft baby blue shell catches light in a subtle way, and the minimal detailing lets the materials speak.

 It's a simple execution, but that's what gives it presence. Expect these to land soon and move quick once they do.

The Nike Air Foamposite One “Psychic Blue” features a crisp light blue shell paired with a black mesh upper and matching tongue. The Foamposite material wraps the shoe in a molded texture that's both futuristic and functional. 

Striped pull tabs on the tongue and heel add subtle flair, while the translucent outsole rounds out the look. Inside, Zoom Air cushioning delivers comfort and support. A carbon fiber plate sits beneath the midfoot for added structure. 

The shoe's bold shape contrasts cleanly with the soft color, creating a fresh spin on a classic basketball silhouette.

Sneaker Bar Detroit reports that the Nike Air Foamposite One “Psychic Blue” will be released on May 27th, 2025. Also, the retail price of the sneakers will be $230 when they are released.

Speculation began in 2023 when Foxx suffered a medical emergency which was later revealed to be a stroke

Jamie Foxx has shut down conspiracy theories that say Sean ‘Diddy' Combs tried to kill him.

Speculation began in 2023 when Foxx suffered a medical emergency, later revealed to be a stroke. While his illness still remained a mystery, some internet commentators suggested that Diddy had been involved.

Now, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Foxx has dismissed the rumours. “I'm in fucking perfect shape,” he told the publication. “[I saw things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me.' No, Puffy didn't try to kill me. When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These bitch-ass motherfuckers are trying to clone me?'”

The Oscar-winning actor admitted that he was heavily sedated with drugs during his hospital stay and doesn't remember weeks of that period. During that time, he says he snuck a cell phone in and began indulging in the multiple rumours surrounding his health.

“I was doing so many jokes in the hospital,” he continued. “That's the only way I could get through it. I'm a comic, so even when I was heavily sedated, and they gave me OxyContin, Dilantin and morphine at the same time.”

Foxx had previously addressed the Diddy speculation late last year, during his Netflix show What Had Happened Was…. The special saw him discuss his 2023 health emergency for the first time and take a sly shot at Diddy, referencing the infamous parties the former rap mogul would host for high-profile entertainment figures.

— Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) December 10, 2024



Speaking about the rumours around his health, Foxx said: “The internet was trying to kill me, though. The internet said Puffy tried to kill me. I know what you're thinking, did he?”

“Hell no!” he continued. “I left those parties early, I was out by 9pm. Because something don't look right, it's slippery in here.”

Foxx appeared to be referencing the fact that during police raids of Diddy's home in March, authorities recovered items including AR-15s, narcotics and “more than 1000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant”.

He also revealed in the special that his unspecified medical emergency was actually a bleed on the brain that led to a stroke. He was told that if doctors did not operate on him as soon as possible, he would die.

The actor said it “was kind of oddly peaceful” being unconscious, adding: “I saw the tunnel. I didn't see the light.” He then joked: “It was hot in that tunnel. Shit, am I going to the wrong place in this motherfucker? Because I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the Devil like, ‘C'mon.' Or is that Puffy [Sean Combs]?”

After the procedure, Foxx explained that the doctor told his sister Deidra Dixon that he “may be able to make a full recovery, but it's going to be the worst year of his life”. He added: “That's what it was.”

He continued: “I lost everything, but the only thing I could hold onto was my sense of humour. If I could stay funny, I could stay alive.”

Diddy's sex trafficking and racketeering trial began this month and has so far seen his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, testify against him in court, alleging that he had spent years subjecting her to brutal sexual violence and abuse.

Over a year ago, Ventura filed a lawsuit against the Bad Boy Records founder for physical assault and rape, and the case was settled the following day despite Diddy denying the claims.

Months later, CNN obtained CCTV footage of Diddy dragging, kicking and hitting Ventura in an LA hotel, lending credence to her allegations. Diddy was later arrested and charged with crimes including sexual trafficking and racketeering, the trial for which began earlier this month.

Diddy has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, and has denied all other allegations of misconduct levelled against him. He has also pleaded not guilty to five criminal counts, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has consistently denied all allegations against him and has asserted that all sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual.

Justin Bieber also recently shut down rumours that he was one of Diddy's alleged victims, with a representative for the singer saying: “Although Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims, there are individuals who were genuinely harmed by him,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

“Shifting focus away from this reality detracts from the justice these victims rightfully deserve.”

The answer involves time dilation.","https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/does-light-lose-energy-as-it-crosses-the-universe-the-answer-involves-time-dilation","Sun, 25 May 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

The speed of light is the fastest anything can travel. What happens to a photon from a galaxy 25 million light years away on its journey toward Earth?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


My telescope, set up for astrophotography in my light-polluted San Diego backyard, was pointed at a galaxy unfathomably far from Earth. My wife, Cristina, walked up just as the first space photo streamed to my tablet. It sparkled on the screen in front of us.

""That's the Pinwheel galaxy,"" I said. The name is derived from its shape – albeit this pinwheel contains about a trillion stars.

The light from the Pinwheel traveled for 25 million years across the universe – about 150 quintillion miles – to get to my telescope.

My wife wondered: ""Doesn't light get tired during such a long journey?""

Her curiosity triggered a thought-provoking conversation about light. Ultimately, why doesn't light wear out and lose energy over time?

I am an astrophysicist, and one of the first things I learned in my studies is how light often behaves in ways that defy our intuitions.

Light is electromagnetic radiation: basically, an electric wave and a magnetic wave coupled together and traveling through space-time. It has no mass. That point is critical because the mass of an object, whether a speck of dust or a spaceship, limits the top speed it can travel through space.

But because light is massless, it's able to reach the maximum speed limit in a vacuum – about 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, or almost 6 trillion miles per year (9.6 trillion kilometers). Nothing traveling through space is faster. To put that into perspective: In the time it takes you to blink your eyes, a particle of light travels around the circumference of the Earth more than twice.

As incredibly fast as that is, space is incredibly spread out. Light from the Sun, which is 93 million miles (about 150 million kilometers) from Earth, takes just over eight minutes to reach us. In other words, the sunlight you see is eight minutes old.

Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to us after the Sun, is 26 trillion miles away (about 41 trillion kilometers). So by the time you see it in the night sky, its light is just over four years old. Or, as astronomers say, it's four light years away.

Related: The shape of light: Scientists reveal image of an individual photon for 1st time ever



With those enormous distances in mind, consider Cristina's question: How can light travel across the universe and not slowly lose energy?

Actually, some light does lose energy. This happens when it bounces off something, such as interstellar dust, and is scattered about.

But most light just goes and goes, without colliding with anything. This is almost always the case because space is mostly empty – nothingness. So there's nothing in the way.

When light travels unimpeded, it loses no energy. It can maintain that 186,000-mile-per-second speed forever.

Here's another concept: Picture yourself as an astronaut on board the International Space Station. You're orbiting at 17,000 miles (about 27,000 kilometers) per hour. Compared with someone on Earth, your wristwatch will tick 0.01 seconds slower over one year.

That's an example of time dilation – time moving at different speeds under different conditions. If you're moving really fast, or close to a large gravitational field, your clock will tick more slowly than someone moving slower than you, or who is further from a large gravitational field. To say it succinctly, time is relative.



Now consider that light is inextricably connected to time. Picture sitting on a photon, a fundamental particle of light; here, you'd experience maximum time dilation. Everyone on Earth would clock you at the speed of light, but from your reference frame, time would completely stop.

That's because the ""clocks"" measuring time are in two different places going vastly different speeds: the photon moving at the speed of light, and the comparatively slowpoke speed of Earth going around the Sun.

What's more, when you're traveling at or close to the speed of light, the distance between where you are and where you're going gets shorter. That is, space itself becomes more compact in the direction of motion – so the faster you can go, the shorter your journey has to be. In other words, for the photon, space gets squished.

—New theory could finally make 'quantum gravity' a reality — and prove Einstein wrong

—Black hole paradox that stumped Stephen Hawking may have a solution, new paper claims

—In a first, physicists spot elusive 'free-range' atoms — confirming a century-old theory about quantum mechanics

Which brings us back to my picture of the Pinwheel galaxy. From the photon's perspective, a star within the galaxy emitted it, and then a single pixel in my backyard camera absorbed it, at exactly the same time. Because space is squished, to the photon the journey was infinitely fast and infinitely short, a tiny fraction of a second.

But from our perspective on Earth, the photon left the galaxy 25 million years ago and traveled 25 million light years across space until it landed on my tablet in my backyard.

And there, on a cool spring night, its stunning image inspired a delightful conversation between a nerdy scientist and his curious wife.

The decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will continue, probably for many years to come. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Around the U.S., about 90,000 tons of nuclear waste is stored at over 100 sites in 39 states, in a range of different structures and containers.

For decades, the nation has been trying to send it all to one secure location.

A 1987 federal law named Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, as a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste — but political and legal challenges led to construction delays. Work on the site had barely started before Congress ended the project's funding altogether in 2011.

The 94 nuclear reactors currently operating at 54 power plants continue to generate more radioactive waste. Public and commercial interest in nuclear power is rising because of concerns regarding emissions from fossil fuel power plants and the possibility of new applications for smaller-scale nuclear plants to power data centers and manufacturing. This renewed interest gives new urgency to the effort to find a place to put the waste.

In March 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments related to the effort to find a temporary storage location for the nation's nuclear waste — a ruling is expected by late June. No matter the outcome, the decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will probably continue for many years to come.

I am a scholar who specializes in corrosion; one focus of my work has been containing nuclear waste during temporary storage and permanent disposal. There are generally two forms of significantly radioactive waste in the U.S.: waste from making nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and waste from generating electricity at nuclear power plants. There are also small amounts of other radioactive waste, such as that associated with medical treatments.

Related: How do you decontaminate objects exposed to radioactivity?

Remnants of the chemical processing of radioactive material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, often called ""defense waste,"" will eventually be melted along with glass, with the resulting material poured into stainless steel containers. These canisters are 10 feet tall and 2 feet in diameter, weighing approximately 5,000 pounds when filled.

For now, though, most of it is stored in underground steel tanks, primarily at Hanford, Washington, and Savannah River, South Carolina, key sites in U.S. nuclear weapons development. At Savannah River, some of the waste has already been processed with glass, but much of it remains untreated.

At both of those locations, some of the radioactive waste has already leaked into the soil beneath the tanks, though officials have said there is no danger to human health. Most of the current efforts to contain the waste focus on protecting the tanks from corrosion and cracking to prevent further leakage.

The vast majority of nuclear waste in the U.S. is spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants.

Before it is used, nuclear fuel exists as uranium oxide pellets that are sealed within zirconium tubes, which are themselves bundled together. These bundles of fuel rods are about 12 to 16 feet long and about 5 to 8 inches in diameter. In a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions fueled by the uranium in those rods emit heat that is used to create hot water or steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.

After about three to five years, the fission reactions in a given bundle of fuel slow down significantly, even though the material remains highly radioactive. The spent fuel bundles are removed from the reactor and moved elsewhere on the power plant's property, where they are placed into a massive pool of water to cool them down.

After about five years, the fuel bundles are removed, dried and sealed in welded stainless steel canisters. These canisters are still radioactive and thermally hot, so they are stored outdoors in concrete vaults that sit on concrete pads, also on the power plant's property. These vaults have vents to ensure air flows past the canisters to continue cooling them.

As of December 2024, there were over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in the U.S., and over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground, located at current and former power plants across the country.

Even reactors that have been decommissioned and demolished still have concrete vaults storing radioactive waste, which must be secured and maintained by the power company that owned the nuclear plant.



One threat to these storage methods is corrosion.

Because they need water to both transfer nuclear energy into electricity and to cool the reactor, nuclear power plants are always located alongside sources of water.

In the U.S., nine are within two miles of the ocean, which poses a particular threat to the waste containers. As waves break on the coastline, saltwater is sprayed into the air as particles. When those salt and water particles settle on metal surfaces, they can cause corrosion, which is why it's common to see heavily corroded structures near the ocean.

At nuclear waste storage locations near the ocean, that salt spray can settle on the steel canisters. Generally, stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, which you can see in the shiny pots and pans in many Americans' kitchens. But in certain circumstances, localized pits and cracks can form on stainless steel surfaces.

In recent years, the U.S. Department of Energy has funded research, including my own, into the potential dangers of this type of corrosion. The general findings are that stainless steel canisters could pit or crack when stored near a seashore. But a radioactive leak would require not only corrosion of the container but also of the zirconium rods and of the fuel inside them. So it is unlikely that this type of corrosion would result in the release of radioactivity.

A more permanent solution is likely years, or decades, away.

—China's 'artificial sun' shatters nuclear fusion record by generating steady loop of plasma for 1,000 seconds

—Nuclear fusion could be the clean energy of the future — but these 'tough' challenges stand in the way

Not only must a long-term site be geologically suitable to store nuclear waste for thousands of years, but it must also be politically palatable to the American people. In addition, there will be many challenges associated with transporting the waste, in its containers, by road or rail, from reactors across the country to wherever that permanent site ultimately is.

Perhaps there will be a temporary site whose location passes muster with the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, the waste will stay where it is.

Largely due to President Donald Trump's changing tariff policies, markets have been on a rollercoaster ride since April. Although the S&P 500 has largely rebounded from last month's lows, some families who have been diligently saving for future college costs may still see their 529 college savings plan balance hasn't fully recovered.

For those with tuition bills now coming due, there are a few key considerations before tapping those accounts.

""With a little planning, making withdrawals can be something to celebrate, not just something to fear,"" said Smitha Walling, Head of Vanguard's Education Savings Group.

Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business.

For parents worried about their 529 account's recent performance, Mary Morris, CEO of Commonwealth Savers, advises starting with a look at the asset allocation. ""What you need to think about is assessing your risk appetite,"" she said.

Generally, 529 plans offer age-based portfolios, which start off with more equity exposure early on in a child's life and then become more conservative as college nears. By the time high school graduation is around the corner, families likely have very little invested in stocks and more in investments like bonds and cash. That can help blunt their losses but also mute gains.

Pay attention to your fund's approach toward shifting from stocks to bonds, Morris said.

""If you are in a total stock portfolio, you may not want that ride,"" she said: ""You don't want to get seasick.""

If the market volatility is still too much to bear, consider adjusting your allocation.

""One strategy is to start de-risking a portion of their portfolio and reallocate a portion into cash equivalent, which will provide a protection of principle while also proving a competitive return and peace of mind,"" said Richard Polimeni, head of education savings at ‎Merrill Lynch.

Still, financial experts strongly caution against shifting your entire 529 balance to cash. ""The worst thing an investor can do in a down market is panic and sell investments prematurely and lock in losses,"" Polimeni said.

Often that is the last resort. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, only 10% of investors liquidated their entire 529 accounts, and 20% switched to less risky assets, according to an earlier survey by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

For those who must make a hefty withdrawal for tuition payments now due, ""consider whether it's better to use the funds now or let the funds continue to grow and those returns compound,"" said Vanguard's Walling.

Polimeni suggests using income or savings outside the 529 to cover immediate college expenses, and requesting a reimbursement later to give the account a chance to recover from the recent market rout.

You can get reimbursed from your 529 plan for any eligible out-of-pocket expenses within the same calendar year. ""Using that strategy gives another six to seven months for the market to recover,"" Polimeni said.

Another option is to tap a federal student loan and take a qualified distribution from the 529 plan to pay off the debt down the road. However, if you're thinking of taking out private student loans or a personal loan that starts incurring significant interest immediately, you may want to spend 529 funds first in that case, and defer that borrowing until later.

Once you have a withdrawal plan, you can — and should — keep contributing to your 529, experts say. Not only can you get a tax deduction or credit for contributions, but earnings will grow on a tax-advantaged basis, whether over 18 years or just a few.

""The major advantage is the tax-deferred growth, so the longer you are invested, the more tax-deferred growth you will have,"" Polimeni said.

""Markets go up and down, but students' goals remain the same,"" said Chris McGee, chair of the College Savings Foundation.

Even as concerns over college costs are driving more would-be college students to rethink their plans, college savings accounts are still as vital as ever.

Roughly 42% of students are pivoting to technical and career training or credentialing, or are opting to enroll in a local and less-expensive community college or in-state public school, according to a recent survey of 1,000 high schoolers by the College Savings Foundation. That's up from 37% last year. 

As a result of those shifting education choices, 69% of students are expecting to live at home during their studies, the highest percentage in three years. 

Despite those adjustments, some recent changes have helped make 529 plans even more worthwhile: As of 2024, families can roll over unused 529 funds to the account beneficiary's Roth individual retirement account, without triggering income taxes or penalties, so long as they meet certain requirements.

Restrictions have also loosened to allow 529 plan funds to be used for continuing education classes, apprenticeship programs and student loan payments. For grandparents, there is also a new ""loophole,"" which allows them to fund a grandchild's college without impacting that student's financial aid eligibility.

In part because of the new changes, more parents are utilizing a 529 college savings plan. 

In 2024, the number of 529 plan accounts increased to 17 million, up more than 3% percent from the year before, according to Investment Company Institute.

Total investments in 529s rose to $525 billion as of December, up 11% from a year earlier, while the average 529 plan account balance hit a record of $30,961, data from the College Savings Plans Network, a network of state-administered college savings programs, also showed.

""The industry is coming off its best year ever in terms of new inflows,"" said Polimeni.

A Russian military commander has claimed that President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was ""at the epicenter"" of a Ukrainian drone attack on May 20 in Russia's Kursk Oblast. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this claim, and the commander did not provide any evidence. 

""We were simultaneously engaged in an air defense battle and ensuring airspace security for the president's helicopter flight,"" Yury Dashkin, commander of an air defense division, said, as cited by the Russian news agency RBC on May 25. ""The helicopter was effectively at the epicenter of the response to the massive drone attack.""

Ukrainian observers noted that the claims could be an attempt to garner support for the Russian president by painting him as more closely involved in the fighting. 

Putin visited Kursk earlier this week, marking his first known visit to Kursk Oblast since Russian forces took back most of the Ukrainian foothold in the region in March. 

Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. It held a significant portion of the territory until a successful counter-offensive by Russia in March, which was carried out with the help of North Korean troops.

Russia and Ukraine swapped hundreds more prisoners on Sunday, the third and last part of a major exchange that reflected a rare moment of co-operation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the more than three years of war.

Hours earlier, the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other regions came under a massive Russian drone-and-missile attack that killed at least 12 people and injured dozens. Ukrainian officials described it as the largest aerial assault since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Russia's Defence Ministry said each side exchanged 303 soldiers, following the release of 307 combatants and civilians each on Saturday, and 390 on Friday – the biggest total swap of the war.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed Sunday's exchange, saying on X that “303 Ukrainian defenders are home.” He noted that the troops returning to Ukraine were members of the “Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service, and the State Special Transport Service.”

Nataliya Borovyk, the sister of released Ukrainian soldier Ihor Ulesov, was overwhelmed when she learned of her brother's return.

“My uncle had to calm me down and put me in a taxi so I could get here,” she told the Associated Press. “A moment like that stays with you forever.”

Borovyk said the family had been waiting anxiously for news, and that she had hoped her brother might be released in the first part of the exchange on Friday.

“We were worried about all the guys. He wasn't there on Friday, but I was here – I at least greeted them, I stood there until the very end and waited, (hoping) maybe he would appear after all.”

In talks held in Istanbul earlier this month – the first time the two sides met face to face for peace talks – Kyiv and Moscow agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees each. The exchange has been the only tangible outcome from the talks.

The scale of the onslaught was stunning – Russia hit Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles, the largest single aerial attack of the war, according to Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force.

In all, Russia used 69 missiles of various types and 298 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed drones, he told the Associated Press.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the strikes.

For Kyiv, the day was particularly sombre as the city observed Kyiv Day, a national holiday that falls on the last Sunday in May, commemorating its founding in the 5th century,

Zelensky said Russian missiles and drones hit more than 30 cities and villages, and urged Western partners to ramp up sanctions on Russia – a long-standing demand of the Ukrainian leader but one that despite warnings to Moscow by the United States and Europe has not materialized in ways to deter Russia.

“These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities,” Zelensky wrote on X, adding that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions.

“America's silence, the silence of others in the world, only encourages” Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said. “Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will certainly help.”

Keith Kellogg, Washington's special envoy to Ukraine, condemned the Russian attacks on X, calling it “a clear violation” of the Geneva Protocols. “These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.”

Russia's Defence Ministry, meanwhile, said its air defences shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.

Sounds of explosions boomed throughout the night in Kyiv and the surrounding area as Ukrainian air defence persisted for hours in efforts to shoot down Russian drones and missiles. At least four people were killed and 16 were injured in the capital itself, according to the security service.

“A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X, adding that the assault “lasted all night.”

Fires broke out in homes and businesses, set off by falling drone debris.

In Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, the emergency service said three children were killed, aged 8, 12 and 17. Twelve people were injured in the attacks, it said. At least four people were killed in the Khmelnytskyi region, in western Ukraine. One man was killed in Mykolaiv region, in southern Ukraine.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district was hit by a drone and one of the building's walls was on fire. In Dniprovskyi district, a private house was destroyed and in Shevchenkivskyi district, windows in a residential building were smashed.

The scale of Russia's use of aerial weapons aside, the attacks over the past 48 hours have been among the most intense strikes on Ukraine since the February 2022 invasion.

A massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted Kyiv and other regions in Ukraine for a second consecutive night, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens, according to officials.

The Associated Press

In Markhalivka, just outside Kyiv where several village homes were burned down, the Fedorenkos watched their ruined home in tears.

“The street looks like Bakhmut, like Mariupol, it's just terrible,” said 76-year-old Liubov Fedorenko, comparing their village to some of Ukraine's most devastated cities. She told the AP she was grateful her daughter and grandchildren hadn't joined them for the weekend.

“I was trying to persuade my daughter to come to us,” Fedorenko said, adding that she told her daughter, “After all, you live on the eighth floor in Kyiv, and here it's the ground floor.“'

“She said, `No, mum, I'm not coming.' And thank God she didn't come, because the rocket hit (the house) on the side where the children's rooms were,” Fedorenko said.

Ivan Fedorenko, 80, said he regrets letting their two dogs into the house when the air raid siren went off. “They burned to death,” he said. “I want to bury them, but I'm not allowed yet.”

The PoW exchange was the latest of scores of swaps since the war began but also the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians.

Still, it has not halted the fighting. Battles have continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometre front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.

Russia's Defence Ministry quoted Yaroslav Yakimkin of the “North” group of Russian forces as saying Sunday that Ukrainian troops have been pushed back from the border in the Kursk region, which Putin visited days ago.

“The troops continue to advance forward every day,” Yakimkin said, adding that Russian forces have taken Marine and Loknya in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, which borders Kursk, over the past week, and were advancing in the Kharkiv region around the largely destroyed town of Vovchansk.

Speaking on Russian state TV on Sunday, a Russian serviceman said that Putin was reportedly flying over the Kursk region in a helicopter when the area came under intense Ukrainian drone attack during his visit.

Putin's helicopter was “virtually at the epicentre of repelling a large-scale attack by the enemy's drones,” said Yuri Dashkin, described as commander of a Russian air defence division. He added that Russian air defence units shot down 46 drones during the incident.

President Trump is putting pressure on US universities. The elite university Harvard is resisting, but now Washington has threatened to block it from enrolling foreign students. Can Harvard continue to hold out?

Founded in 1636, Harvard University is one of the most prestigious educational institutions in the world. It has produced many Nobel laureates and eight US presidents. However, the current US president, Donald Trump, has declared Harvard ""a JOKE"" — one he doesn't find funny. According to Trump, the university teaches ""hate and stupidity"" and hires ""woke, radical left, idiots."" This, he stated in a post on his own social media platform, Truth Social, in mid-April, was why Harvard ""should no longer receive federal funds.""

Government agencies immediately froze $2.2 billion (approximately €2.2 billion) that had been earmarked for the university. Then, in May, a government antisemitism task force informed the university leadership that an additional $450 million of funding was also being cut.

On Thursday, May 22, the Trump administration escalated the conflict further. The US Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem, issued a letter revoking the university's license to enroll foreign students. Harvard was given a 72-hour deadline to provide the administration with specific information about foreign students if it wished to regain its license.

Harvard promptly sued the administration, and scored an initial legal victory the following day when US District Judge Allison D. Burroughs found in the university's favor. She accepted its argument that the government order would cause Harvard ""immediate and irreparable injury,"" and temporarily blocked the order pending a further hearing.

As Trump himself and many of those close to him have repeatedly indicated, they are troubled that, in their eyes, Harvard's teaching and research are dominated by left-wing content and ideologies. However, the US Constitution makes clear that the government can only restrict freedom of speech in a few, very specific instances. Last month, more than 100 US universities signed an open letter, citing the Constitution, and protesting ""unprecedented government overreach and political interference.""

The legal pretext for the funding cuts is the pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have taken place at many US universities as a reaction to Israel's war against Hamas. The war is Israel's response to the terrorist attack launched from the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023. There have been many reports that Jewish students have been targeted in antisemitic attacks during protests in the United States. The US, along with Germany, Israel and other countries, characterize Hamas as a terrorist organization.

The new US government has withdrawn funding, or has threatened to do so, from around 60 universities. In March, for example, it pulled $400 million of federal funding from Columbia University in New York, accusing the university leadership of ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.""

Columbia sued the administration over the cancellation of funding, but it did comply with several other government demands, such as banning the wearing of masks during protests, hiring new security personnel and making changes to the management of the department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies. In spite of this, the US Department of Health and Human Services nonetheless upheld the accusation of inaction.

Harvard, which is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a suburb just outside Boston, is so far the only university to openly resist the administration's demands. Part of the reason why it can afford to challenge the government is that it has an endowment of more than $50 billion. This endowment may now be targeted by the government.

If the administration is successful in blocking Harvard from enrolling international students, one consequence will be that many international students will lose their US residence permits, unless they are able to enroll at a different university.

This would not only deprive Harvard of international talent. There are around 6,800 non-US citizens enrolled at the university, which receives around $400 million per year from them in tuition fees. Fees are the same for US students — around $59,000 per year — but many are awarded scholarships that the university funds. Overall, Harvard therefore earns more from international students than from American ones.

The US government is also considering imposing heavy taxes on capital gains from university endowments. Endowment funds are invested primarily in securities, yielding hundreds of millions of dollars per year. During his first term in office, Trump introduced a capital gains tax of 1.4% for universities with endowments that exceed $500,000 per student. Now, he proposes to add further tiers, and for capital gains on endowments in the highest category — in excess of $2 million per student — to be taxed at 21%.

In the USA Today national newspaper, the economist Phillip Levine estimated that elite universities like Yale, Stanford, MIT, Princeton, and, of course, Harvard, could each face tax bills of between $400 and $850 million a year under the new scheme.

According to a letter sent by three government agencies to the university administration, the US government is demanding that Harvard implement sweeping reforms by August 2025, supposedly in order to counter what it perceives as the dominance of left-wing ideologies at Harvard faculties.

These reforms include introducing new guidelines to limit the ""power"" of students and faculty, especially those university staff ""more committed to activism than scholarship."" Jobs and study places, the letter states, should in future be awarded solely on the basis of merit: The university must ""cease all preferences based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."" Programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are to be discontinued. Furthermore, it says, the reforms will broaden the range of viewpoints represented, and prevent the admission of students' ""hostile"" to ""American values and institutions.""

It is not clear what will happen next. Judge Burroughs, who temporarily blocked the government order on Friday, has scheduled a hearing for May 29 to decide whether or not the hold should be extended. These are probably just the first steps in what may be a long legal battle.

It could of course have been pure coincidence that when Vladimir Putin unveiled Russia's first hypersonic missile to the world, he did so with a simulation of the weapon plummeting into an unnamed peninsula bearing an uncanny resemblance to Florida.

The similarity was not lost on Donald Trump whose face whitened as he watched on, presumably with visions of his beloved Mar-a-Lago resort reduced to an atomic wasteland, flashing before his eyes.

Standing next to him on that day in March 2018 was Fiona Hill, the president's Russia tsar at the time.

“That got Trump's attention,” she said. “Trump was like, ‘Why did he do that? Real countries don't have to do that.'”

For Hill, a long-term Kremlin watcher who once sat so close to Putin at dinner she could smell the detergent used to launder his clothes, the episode revealed much about how Mr Trump views the Russian leader. “He is deferential towards Putin because he really is worried about the risk of a nuclear exchange,” she said.

The threat of impending nuclear fallout shaped Hill's early life. Born in County Durham in the 1960s, the daughter of a coalminer and a midwife, she was inspired to study Russian following the war scare of 1983, setting her on an extraordinary trajectory that propelled her all the way “from the coal house to the White House”.

She settled on St Andrews University, after a failed interview at Oxford where posh students mocked her for her working-class northern accent. From there she moved to Russia then America, where she met her husband at Harvard, before going on to serve as an intelligence analyst for successive administrations – first for George Bush, then Barack Obama – and finally on the national security council of Mr Trump.

Yet unlike the US president, whom she said remains trapped in a 1980s mindset, both in his foreign policy approach and his musical tastes (see his penchant for YMCA), Hill is at pains to stress that the biggest global threat is no longer a nuclear strike, but more clandestine methods of warfare.

“It's not the likelihood of a Russian tank coming across the Suffolk Downs or a nuclear weapon taking out Sheffield,” she said, speaking over Zoom from her office in Washington DC. “Now it's much more about critical national infrastructure and acts of sabotage, poisonings and assassinations.”

That is not to say she believes the world is a safer place today. Far from it. In fact, she believes World War Three is upon us. “World wars are when you have global sets of conflicts that become intertwined,” she said. “That's where we are.”

Having spent decades in the US capital quietly blowing the whistle on Russian aggression, Hill was thrust into a media firestorm when she testified at Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019.

Her testimony, delivered in her lilting Durham cadence, exposed vulnerability to Russian meddling at the heart of the White House – and caused her inbox to fill up with plaudits and death threats in equal quantities.

She has since released a memoir, There is Nothing Here for You, recalling her father's advice that spurred her on a dizzying career path to the heights of US geopolitics, been installed as chancellor of Durham University, and was last year appointed by Sir Keir Starmer to lead the UK's forthcoming Strategic Defence Review.

Since Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and even more so following Mr Trump's return to the White House, her expertise has been in greater demand than ever.

With large chunks of the front lines in stalemate, and Russia on track to reclaim its territory seized by Ukraine in last year's daring counter-offensive, all eyes have turned to Washington. Mr Trump pledged to end the war on “day one” of his presidency. And as the conflict drags on, the giant question mark hovering over western Europe is how long it will take for the US to make good on its promise.

So, when the two presidents shared an “excellent” phone call on Monday, Hill was uniquely placed to read the tea leaves of the paltry briefings from each side.

How did Mr Trump fare? “Terrible. Let's give him a pass for effort,” she said, matter-of-factly, as if marking the president's report card. A former Harvard researcher who serves as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, an influential foreign policy think tank, Hill is a career academic with the manner of a firm but fair head teacher.

“What Trump is doing is answering the wrong exam question,” Hill added.

“Trump thinks it's just about real estate, about trade and who gets what, be it minerals, land or rare earths,” she explained. What the president doesn't understand is that “Putin doesn't want a ceasefire”.

“[He] wants a neutered Ukraine, not one that is able to withstand military pressure. Everybody sees this, apart from Trump,” she said.

Hill has previously said that her straight-talking approach is what earned her a place in Mr Trump's inner circle. Whereas in Britain, she was advised to go to elocution lessons to round-out her vowels, this wasn't a problem in the US, where Mr Trump referred to her as a “Deep State stiff with a nice accent”. Sexism, however, was a constant, with the president once mistaking her for a secretary.

“In the Trump White House being a woman was something of a liability because I wasn't going to do the Fox News anchor makeover,” she said. Despite her resistance, she did purchase “a whole array of dresses” (“I got them in flash sales”) to camouflage herself.

“For women, it's very important to not look, in his view, ‘doudy',” she said. “It was just this obsession with how you looked which became very bothersome, because if you didn't look the part, you couldn't impart the information.”

After his call with Putin, Mr Trump floated the possibility of a “large-scale trade” deal. Putin, in turn, offered syrupy platitudes about negotiations being “on the right track” and the prospect of a “memorandum of understanding”. But one cannot help but detect a growing sense of desperation in the US president's boosterism. After all, the phone call was only ever a last-minute stand-in for the headline act: direct talks between Zelensky and Putin.

The Ukrainian leader had called Putin's bluff, inviting him to a face-to-face meeting in Turkey that the Russian president dropped out of. Mercifully, the Trumpometer appears to have swung in recent months from open hostility towards Ukraine, culminating in the infamous Oval Office shake-down, towards more conventional mistrust of Moscow – thanks in no small part to a lucrative minerals deal signed with Kyiv and a tete-a-tete with Mr Zelensky beneath the vaulting dome of St Peter's Basilica.

Putin's no-show, despite proposing the talks himself, was the latest in a string of empty promises to work with the US towards a ceasefire.

The US president has so far resisted hitting Putin with further sanctions, instead offering a deal which Hill said provides a “great incentive for the Russians to play along with Trump”. “If you offer the Russians a carrot, they just eat it, or they take it and hit you over the head with it,” she said.

“The entourage, the circle around Putin, have enriched themselves so much by availing themselves of all the goodies that the state can provide, what is it that Trump can give them that they don't already have?”

Hill is well-versed in the hard ball tactics of Russian negotiators (and the difficulties of corralling Mr Trump). Indeed, she helped prepare the US team for 2018 talks with Russia in Helsinki – where she was forced to call on the Finnish prime minister for help, imploring him to advise Mr Trump about how to engage with Putin after the president ignored his own advisers.

Putin, who has maintained the same “tight team” of top diplomats around him for the past 25 years, dispatched his Stanford-educated economic adviser Kirill Dmitriev, former ambassador to Washington Yuri Ushakov, and Sergei Lavrov, his comic villain foreign minister, to recent talks in Saudi Arabia.

“These guys are really skilled diplomats. They all speak absolutely excellent English,” said Hill. “They can talk the hind leg off a donkey. They can turn you around in circles. They've got an answer for everything.”

Batting for the US are Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, Mike Waltz, Mr Trump's erstwhile national security adviser, and his special envoy Steve Witkoff, a former real estate dealer. Between them, they have less than a year's-worth of cabinet-level experience.

So, what does the dancing Russian bear make of these three cotillion debutantes? “They're eating the neophytes on the US side for dinner,” said Hill.

Mr Witkoff, the president's long-term golf buddy, comes in for particular scorn from Hill.

Touted as a “killer” by the president, real estate billionaire Mr Witkoff appeared to forget the names of the Ukrainian territories that he was negotiating with Russia over during a recent episode of Tucker Carlson's podcast.

Having driven around the streets of 1980s Harlem looking for houses to flip in a former life, he has traded in his real estate licence for criss-crossing the globe to negotiate hostage deals and ceasefires on behalf of the US government.

“Witkoff's probably thinking about condos in Moscow,” said Hill.

“They think it's really tough being in Queens,” she added. “It's not as tough as trying to do business in Russia, where people have a propensity to fall out of poorly sealed and easily opened windows from high buildings.”

In her line of work, Hill is all too aware of the dangers of dealing with malign governments in the near east. She fell violently ill after being told she was asking too many questions at a meeting with Chechen separatists. She later discovered she had been poisoned.

As a member of Mr Trump's security council from 2017 to 2019 , she said the president made it “very clear” that Ukraine “must be part of Russia”. “He really could not get his head around the idea that Ukraine was an independent state,” she told a New York Times journalist.

But what has changed since Mr Trump was last in office, she said, is that he has surrounded himself with “sycophants and courtiers”, with no one pushing back against his more outlandish ideas.

During his first term, she said, “he was a little bit deferential here and there to various people. But now he's so convinced [in his own abilities] that he doesn't pay attention to anyone”.

Underpinning Mr Trump's soft approach to Moscow, she believes, is his personal idolisation of Putin, and their joint belief in “spheres of influence” and “might makes right”. “Trump is enthralled by Putin, and as a result becomes in thrall to him,” she said.

However, she is equally scathing of European leaders for not coming to terms with this new reality sooner. “The fact that the Europeans are so shocked by his deference to Putin actually shows that they haven't also done their homework,” she said.

Despite European outrage at Mr Trump's repeated threats to withdraw American support for Ukraine, Hill gives credit to the US president for sounding the alarm on the need for Europe to increase its defence spending as far as 2016.

“He's been accurate right from the very beginning”, she said, of the need to reach the two per cent of GDP spending on defence target and of ending Europe's energy dependency on Russia's Nordstream pipeline, which, prior to the war in Ukraine, provided more than half of Germany's gas supply.

Even on the subject of tariffs, Hill said, there is method in the madness. “Europe wanted defence and security provisions from the US, but wanted to be an economic competitor,” she said. “There is an absolute and utter solid basis for why Trump is really pissed off about all of this.”

Hill now believes that America turning its back on Ukraine is “the most likely scenario”, yet despite the gloomy picture, she is optimistic that European sanctions can still bear fruit if the bloc can pull together.

Although sanctions currently rely heavily on the power of the US treasury to act unilaterally, Hill said collective action between the UK and Europe could be “pretty powerful”, but requires “a lot more coordination”.

One possible avenue, she suggested, would be for Europe to leverage relationships with its major trading partners to encourage them to cut ties with Russia.

The Europeans handing an ultimatum to the Chinese, Indians and Iranians if the US withdrew sanctions could provide “some really significant leverage”, she said.

“All these countries that have a vested interest in investing in Europe and doing work with Europe,” she added. “Maybe you don't do the kind of sanctions that the US does, but Europeans can have very serious conversations.”

Talking to Hill is like opening one of the sets of the encyclopaedia Britannica she used to read on the stairs of her small family home as a child. Seamlessly interweaving politics, philosophy and history, she cross-stitches conversation with references to Thomas Hobbes, Jean Monnet and, in a nod to her adoptive homeland, American football.

Growing up, her family did not have a telephone, a car or a television and often switched off the electricity to save money. A star pupil, Hill won a scholarship to a private school but did not attend because her family could not afford the uniform or the books.

In her memoir, Hill writes at length about how mass job losses in working class communities fuel populism. Yet despite the hardships of her upbringing, she was able to rise to the dizzy heights of American politics – a feat she credits to her parents, her teachers and her local MP.

Working in the highest echelons of foreign politics, she was often the only woman in the room. In Russia, this led to her being dismissed, in turns, as a waitress, an aide, and even an upmarket prostitute. But it was also a secret weapon.

“People just forgot you were there and talked as if you were part of the scenery,” she said. “I'd hear and learn all kinds of things that I never would have done under different circumstances.”

When she testified against Mr Trump at his impeachment trial, she was careful about her choice of outfit, opting to dress in deliberately muted tones, so as not to draw attention away from what she was saying. The next day, she earned gushing front page headlines across the US national newspapers, with many marvelling at her accent. She also won a shout out in the Washington Post style section for her “reassuringly dull” black ensemble.

Besides the bouquets of flowers arriving at the door, her daughter, then 12, heard some of the death threats left on the family's voicemail. Hill told her the callers were “cowards” and said not to worry, but taped up the letterbox in case of letter bombs.

“I'm from the north east of England, I'm not that easily intimidated,” she once said.

Hill became a US citizen in 2002 and lives in Washington DC with her husband Kenneth Keen, a business consultant, and their daughter. But she splits her time between the US and the UK. Her mother lives in a care home in Bishop Auckland, near where she grew up, and she has taken on an advisory role to the British government as a leader and co-author of the Strategic Defence Review.

So how does life in the White House compare to the Ministry of Defence? “I always find it quite refreshing in the UK context now, that people just look normal,” she said. “It didn't feel like I had to be out there choosing my fanciest frock.”

The review was meant to report in the first half of 2025, but is expected to be delayed until autumn, much to Hill's frustration (“everyone knows what's in it. It's just the whole politics of finding a time.”) Its release has been shrouded in secrecy amid reports that it will recommend protecting critical infrastructure through the creation of a home guard, uncharitably compared to dad's army – Hill dismisses this as “rubbish”.

Hill said she hopes the review will act as a wake up call for Britain and Europeans to understand that a land invasion is not the only threat we face from Moscow.

Pointing to recent blackouts in Spain and at Heathrow Airport, she said: “What we're arguing is the physical front lines in terms of the likelihood of an invasion by Russia may be further away, but the other front lines are here all the time. They're your IT systems, they're your electrical grids, the power stations.

“Every country is massively vulnerable,” she added. “Ninety per cent of our way of life, everything from you being able to do your orders online for your food, to your ability to function at work would be taken out by a massive strike on all of the power grid.”

Working in the weeds of European defence and fighting a losing battle to convince the US to stay engaged is enough to turn anyone into a cynic. Yet despite everything, she remains optimistic that Britain and Europe will step up. “The UK has absolute potential to play a leadership role at the moment,” she said.

Her message for Sir Keir's government? “Come on then, get a move on. What I worry about is that people are going to be dithering about for too long, because the time for action was yesterday.”

The White House confirmed a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the key issues they discussed on May 22.

“President Trump and President Sheinbaum discussed economic and security issues,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly wrote in an email to The Epoch Times.

“And we continue to talk about trade issues, nothing in particular, but we continue to negotiate, and with a good relationship and good communication,” the Mexican president said.

Sheinbaum said she has held seven calls with trump so far.

“In the beginning, we continued talking about trade and tariffs. Remember that we, in the case of the automotive industry, have a very preferential situation for Mexico, although we would still like more, but we have a preferential situation,” she said.

Sheinbaum said they discussed other issues, without specifying which ones, and noted that both governments are continuing to work on the steel and aluminum issue, but clarified that “I would not like to say much more until we can reach an agreement.”

The call between the two presidents took place after Sheinbaum's meeting with the new U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ronald Johnson, for the presentation of credentials at the National Palace on May 19.

“We invite them to come to Mexico on this occasion,” Sheinbaum said.

“We've been primarily focused with Mexico on two things ... one is on trade, which is not my department ... and then the other is on security cooperation,” Rubio said.

On May 22, the Mexican president announced that, as part of the negotiations between the two countries, Mexican Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will travel to Washington for a meeting.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 25. /TASS/. Russia will refer a note of protest to Sweden following a drone attack on the Russian embassy in Sweden, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS.

""Tomorrow, Stockholm will receive a note of protest. Sweden must tame its ultras, take control of the situation and strictly observe the Vienna Convention,"" she said.

The Russian embassy in Stockholm said earlier that on May 25 it was attacked by a drone, which dropped a container with paint near the building's entrance.

The embassy recalled that such attacks have been continuing for more than a year. It repeatedly urged the Swedish police and foreign ministry to take measures to avert such attacks and ensure the implementation of the country's commitments under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

After boasting he would end the war within 24 hours, the question now is whether US president has disengaged



The noises in Kyiv in the early hours of Sunday morning went like this. First was the staccato sound of the air defences booming on the edge of the city. As those guns stopped, the sound of drone motors approaching was audible, getting quickly louder before the briefest moment of silence and then a sudden detonation.

But, after two days of heavy Russian air raids that hit civilian buildings across Ukraine, the response has been silence from Donald Trump.

In the space of just over a week, since the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since March 2022 broke up inconclusively with no sign of a ceasefire, the failure of his intervention has become clear.

Boasting before his inauguration as US president that he could end the war in 24 hours, he has instead emboldened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by declining to impose pressure for an immediate ceasefire – backed by Europe – or meaningful sanctions.

Since Trump's two-hour call with Putin last Monday, the Russian leader has made clear his disdain even as Trump's own Defense Intelligence Agency predicted that Moscow would continue fighting through this year.

In the aftermath of the call, Putin has ordered the creation of a “security buffer zone” along Ukraine's eastern border. Strikes on civilian targets only seem to be accelerating, culminating in two straight days of air raids, including Saturday night's – the heaviest aerial bombardment of the war so far, with almost 300 drones and nearly 70 missiles.

Ukrainian and western officials anticipate that Russia will once again attempt a large-scale offensive during the summer, even if they are highly sceptical that it will be effective given Moscow's punishing losses.

The reality is that with deadlock on the ground, the escalating long-range drone war on both sides is becoming ever more significant, even if it cannot conquer territory.

As it has become ever larger, with Russian and Ukrainian factories turning out thousands of new drones, it has become more sophisticated with Moscow's employment of big numbers of decoys and systems designed to fool air defence systems.

While Ukraine has targeted bases and factories, including those producing fibre optic cable for a new generation of small combat zones, the purpose on Russia's side appears aimed solely at undermining morale on the home front. In recent days, drones and missiles have hit apartment blocks, homes and a student dormitory.

On Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, angrily denounced “the silence of America … encouraging Putin”. His words raised a more critical question: whether Trump, as he has long threatened, has already walked away from his perfunctory efforts to end the war.

When a US official did stir themselves to condemn the strikes, what was missing – any suggestion that Putin and Moscow were responsible- was as significant as what was said.

Posting on X, Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, condemned the attacks under an image of fires in the Ukrainian capital. “This is Kyiv,” he wrote. “The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now.”

Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, has suggested in his newsletter on the war that, far from the recent talks heralding any hopes of a breakthrough, they had in fact removed any pretence that the US-mediated talks were going anywhere.

“On Monday the great charade we have been seeing for months came to an end,” wrote O'Brien this weekend. “The charade was that Trump was trying to negotiate a deal between Ukraine and Russia that would work for both states. The reality was always that Trump was trying to bludgeon Ukraine into making major concessions to Russia and help Putin achieve many of his strategic goals.”

If Trump has already disengaged, that raises a number of difficult questions for Kyiv: will the US continue supplying military aid in sufficient quantities? More crucially, can Europe step into the diplomatic and military void provoked by that disengagement?

What is clear to Ukrainians, despite the several weeks of headlines over the potential for a breakthrough in peace talks, is that without pressure from Washington, or hugely accelerated aid from Europe, the war will grind on. And there will be more nights like Saturday's in their future.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Park responds to deer issue

Kenting National Park Headquarters called on the public to refrain from collecting wild specimens from scenic and protected areas, which is prohibited by law, unless they have obtained approval. Under Article 17 of the National Park Act (國家公園法), collecting wild specimens is permitted only after receiving approval from the National Nature Park Headquarters, it said. The statement comes in the wake of a viral video uploaded on Threads, where a couple was holding a naturally shed sika deer antler they picked up at the Kenting park, with the two talking about how they had been searching for it and were taking it home with them. People online questioned the legality of the couple's actions, but the poster said sika deer was not a protected species and that he had already inquired with the 7th Special Police Corps, who said it was “OK.” The Kenting park authority said that without permission from the park headquarters, such actions are illegal, and the offender would be subject to a NT$3,000 fine.

CRIME

Body found in fishing port

The body of a man was found in a Kaohsiung fishing port early yesterday and has been identified as the skipper of a towboat that capsized on Friday, the Port of Kaohsiung Police Department said. First responders recovered the body from the Cihou Fishing Port (旗后漁港) after receiving a report from a local police station around midnight, the harbor police said, adding that a family member of the 25-year-old towboat captain, surnamed Yang (楊), identified the body. Yang had been missing since the vessel capsized not far from the fishing port, when it was assisting a fishing vessel out of the Port of Kaohsiung, the police said. The search-and-rescue team was unable to locate the skipper following the accident, while the only other crew member on board, a 33-year-old man surnamed Chen (陳), managed to swim to shore. No apparent wounds were observed during the initial examination of the body. Police said prosecutors would be notified to conduct an autopsy. What caused the towboat to capsize remains under investigation, the police said.

CULTURE

Novel shortlisted for prize

The translated version of Northwest Rain (西北雨), a novel by Taiwanese author Tung Wei-ge (童偉格), has been shortlisted for the 2024 Josef Jungmann Award, the Czech Literary Translators' Guild (CLTG) said. The novel is one of 25 selected from nearly 90 entries in 24 languages, with Northwest Rain being the only Chinese-language work on the list, the CLTG said. The Josef Jungmann Award, established in 1991 and named after Czech linguist and translator Josef Jungmann, is regarded as the country's most prestigious literary translation award, the guild said. It is presented annually for the best translation of a foreign-language work into Czech, with this year's winner to be announced on Sept. 30, International Translation Day. Northwest Rain employs techniques such as “rewinding, repeating, skipping and delaying to reassemble fragments about death and family history,” the Ministry of Culture said. Tung teaches at the Taipei National University of the Arts, it said, adding that his work often explores themes of death and memory.



                                                                                Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr arrived in Taiwan last night to kick off his first  visit to the country since beginning his second term earlier  this year.
After arriving at Taoyuan International Airport at around  6:30 pm, Whipps and his delegation were welcomed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍).
Speaking to gathered media, the Palauan leader said he  was excited and honored to be back in Taiwan on his first  state visit to Taiwan since he was sworn in this January.
Among those traveling with Whipps is Minister of State  Gustav N. Aitaro, Public Infrastructure                                    



                                                                                President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday thanked Palau for its continued support of Taiwan's international participation, as Taipei was once again excluded from the World Health Assembly (WHA) currently taking place in Switzerland.

""Palau has never stopped voicing support for Taiwan"" in the UN General Assembly, the WHO and other UN-affiliated agencies, Lai said during a bilateral meeting with visiting Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr.

""We have been profoundly touched by these endorsements,"" Lai said, praising the Pacific island nation's firm support as ""courageous.""

Lai's remarks came as Taiwan was excluded for the ninth consecutive year from the WHA, which is being held in                                    


RESOLUTIONS DEBATE:
                                        Taiwan's allies said that UN and WHA resolutions cited by China and other nations ‘do not determine Taiwan's participation in WHO activities'                                        A proposal to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) was rejected on Monday, resulting in Taipei's absence from the annual meeting for a ninth consecutive year, although partners spoke up for Taiwan's participation at the first day of the meeting.
The first agenda item after the opening was a “two-on-two debate” on a proposal to invite Taiwan to participate at the WHA as an observer.
Similar to previous years, two countries made statements in favor of the proposal, while two others expressed their opposition.
Philippine Secretary of Health Teodoro Herbosa, president of the 78th WHA, accepted the WHA General Committee's

The incident happened at about 4pm when a car rammed into pedestrians at an intersection near Bei Da Elementary School.
Witnesses said the sedan, being driven at a high speed, ran a red light, knocking scooters out of the way and hitting students crossing the road before careening into a median near the intersection of Guocheng and Guoguang streets.
The incident resulted in three deaths and 13 injuries, including the driver, a 78-year-old man                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump with his predecessor, Joe Biden.SAUL LOEB/Reuters

Gus Carlson is a U.S.-based columnist for The Globe and Mail.

Popular culture is littered with references to the gullibility of the average consumer, from the apocryphal declaration that there's a sucker born every minute to the infamous movie line “What the American public doesn't know is what makes them the American public.”

To be sure, U.S. companies have grown rich by finding ways to sell people things they don't need at prices they can't afford. And they will look for every excuse to improve profit margins by raising prices.

The latest case in point: U.S. President Donald Trump says big companies, particularly retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, but also manufacturers such as Ford and Mattel, are using tariffs as a convenient excuse to raise prices. 

In a shot across the bow, he said, “I'll be watching,” then suggested they should “eat” the tariffs rather than pass on any pain to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Mr. Trump's detractors say he picked this fight and that any knock-on effects of his tariff policy are self-inflicted. In short, he has no one but himself to blame. 

His supporters counter that any price gouging and attendant whining simply make his strategic point – that tariffs are meant to encourage more U.S. manufacturing, more sourcing of materials and products domestically and, as a result, lower prices, more job creation and broader economic prosperity.

Big retailers say that until U.S. manufacturing comes online at scale, they have no choice but to go offshore for goods to meet demand. Especially for companies such as Walmart WMT-N, price is everything; their business model is rooted in offering low-priced goods at high volumes to value-minded Americans. 

More businesses weigh tariff surcharges as trade wars drag on

The gap between what Mr. Trump sees as a new era of homegrown prosperity and the current reality is a valley of death for consumers, especially those on tight budgets. 

Research from the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America circulating on Capitol Hill tries to make the point. It shows how a theoretical pair of children's shoes made in China and sold in the U.S. for US$19 would cost US$24 post-tariff. With U.S. retailers ordering millions of pairs of shoes, that US$5 per pair adds up.

The math is simple. Importers must pay the tariff, and the most obvious way to recoup the cost is to pass it along to consumers. 

Despite his widely controversial tariff policy, Mr. Trump is not the first U.S. president to wrestle with the corporate sector over consumer prices and inflation levels, which are consistently among the top issues among voters.

Joe Biden claimed – and his vice-president, Kamala Harris, echoed in her 2024 presidential campaign messaging – that big U.S. retailers were price gouging, using high inflation as cover for price hikes. During Mr. Biden's term, inflation averaged about 5 per cent and was often much higher.

The real question is this: Are tariffs really hurting companies to the point where they need to raise prices? 

Many economists suggest the impact of tariffs at the retail level won't really be felt until the summer or later in the second half of the year because most big retailers are still selling pre-tariff inventories. 

That point of view supports Mr. Trump‘s concern that companies are already looking to gouge consumers now by using tariffs as a convenient excuse to jack up prices.

Most interesting in the latest standoff on pricing is that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, while at opposite ends of the spectrum on most issues, and while dealing with different root causes of consumer dissatisfaction, are aligned on how to deal with companies who raise prices unfairly. 

Mr. Trump is reported to be considering several tactics from Mr. Biden's policy toolbox – from having the Federal Trade Commission launch industry-wide investigations to more targeted probes into specific products and company profits and new legislation. Even price controls imposed by executive order are an option, harking back to Mr. Nixon's Economic Stabilization Act of 1970.

Whether government intervention can counter the effects of tariffs, real or imagined, remains to be seen. In the meantime, consumers are caught in the middle, waiting to see if Mr. Trump's strategy of reigniting domestic manufacturing will catch fire quickly enough to offset tariff-based pricing pressures.

Until then, the biggest opportunity in this land of opportunity remains duping the consumer.

An Italian tourist was tortured by a crypto investor who allegedly dangled him from the fifth floor of a Manhattan townhouse to steal his Bitcoin passwords.

Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, 28, told police he had been held captive in a $30,000 per month, eight-bedroom home for the past three weeks where he was beaten and electrocuted.

The Italian eventually handed over his passwords after his captors threatened to kill him and his family. He managed to escape while the men's back were turned and alert the police.

John Woeltz, 37, known as “the crypto king of Kentucky” with an estimated worth of $100 million, has been arrested for the alleged torture.

He faces four charges, including assault and unlawful imprisonment. He denies all of the offences.

The arrest comes as after a wave of cryptocurrency-linked kidnappings by criminals desperate to cash in on the coveted “digital gold”, including two men in France who were found with severed fingers, and a broker who escaped from his captors in Spain.

Michael Mattson, an assistant district attorney, told a Manhattan court that the victim was abducted on May 6 when he went to Mr Woeltz's Soho flat after travelling from Italy to New York City.

It is not clear why Mr Carturan went to the apartment or what his relationship to the accused is.

When he got there Mr Woeltz allegedly snatched the Italian man's electronic devices and passport before demanding that he turn over his Bitcoin password.

When he refused, the victim told officers he was bound by the wrists with electrical wire and tortured.

At one point, the captors “carried the victim to the top flight of stairs of the apartment in the compound and hung the victim over the ledge, after threatening to kill the victim if [he] did not provide the defendant with the victim's Bitcoin password”.

Prosecutors also alleged that the victim was urinated on and forced to take crack cocaine during the ordeal. They also cut his leg.

Sources told the New York Post that Mr Carturan was fitted with an AirTag that tracked his movements. But he made a “daring escape” on Friday just after 9.30am, as he ran out of the townhouse in the Nolita neighbourhood of Manhattan and toward a traffic agent nearby.

Police found cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armour, night vision goggles, ammunition and Polaroid photos of the victim with a gun pointed to his head during a search of the townhouse.

The victim was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries that Mr Mattson said were consistent with his descriptions of being bound and assaulted.

On Saturday, Mr Woeltz, who is being held without bail, was ordered to surrender his passport as prosecutors said he had the means to flee, including a private jet and a helicopter. He is due back in Manhattan criminal court next week.

A second man, who has only been named as an “un-apprehended male”, is also alleged to have taken part.

An Italian woman, identified as Beatrice Folchi, Mr Woeltz's assistant, was reportedly arrested and charged in the case. But, she told the New York Post on Saturday that she had not been arrested.

It is the third reported case of kidnappings targeting those linked to cryptocurrency fortunes.

In early May, the pregnant daughter and grandson of a cryptocurrency boss escaped abduction in Paris in broad daylight by a group of hooded individuals who sought to drag the mother and son into a delivery van.

Pierre Noizat, the French cryptocurrency boss, later praised his “heroic” son-in-law and a neighbour armed with a fire extinguisher for thwarting the attempted kidnapping.

A 60-year-old Frenchman had a finger chopped off by attackers who demanded his crypto-millionaire son pay a ransom. Le Parisien reported that the attackers had demanded a ransom of €5-7 million (£4-6 million), which was not paid.

After being held for more than two days, armed police freed him from a house south of Paris.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Tens of thousands of Poles took part in dueling patriotic marches in Warsaw on Sunday, led by the two men vying for the presidency in a June 1 runoff election which is expected to be both close and consequential for the nation's future.

Many of those who joined Sunday's marches had traveled from across Poland, a country of nearly 38 million people, not just to support a candidate but to rally behind sharply divergent visions for the nation's future.

At the head of one march was Rafał Trzaskowski, 53, the pro-European Union mayor of Warsaw who supports abortion rights and LGBTQ+ inclusion. He is a close political ally of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has led a centrist coalition government since late 2023.

During a speech to a huge crowd Trzaskowski laid out his vision for a Poland that is inclusive and vowed to work to help develop Polish industry as the nation continues an economic transformation into a regional economic and military power.

In another part of Warsaw, Karol Nawrocki, 42, addressed his supporters. A conservative historian and former boxer, Nawrocki is backed by the national conservative Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. He heads the state-run Institute of National Remembrance, which under Law and Justice became known for promoting nationalist versions of Polish history.

His supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values — a man who, like U.S. President Donald Trump, promises to restore what they call “normality.” Many voiced opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, saying Nawrocki reflects the values they grew up with.

“I am a Pole who understands the hardships of everyday life,” Nawrocki told the crowd. “I stand before you and I am fully convinced that I am your voice.”

Earlier this month, the White House released photos of Nawrocki meeting Trump in the Oval Office — a tacit but unmistakable show of support from the U.S. president.

But Nawrocki's candidacy has also been dogged by controversy. Allegations recently surfaced that he swindled an elderly man out of an apartment — claims many of his supporters dismiss as politically motivated. 

Reports also emerged that he participated in a brawl involving football hooligans in 2009, something he did not deny, saying in that in his life he took part in “various forms of noble combat.” 

His behavior during a presidential debate on Friday also generated a lot of attention and controversy: at one point Nawrocki appeared to discreetly put something in his mouth. He later said it was a nicotine pouch.

Trzaskowski argued in his speech that Nawrocki was not fit to represent the nation as its president.

“It's high time for truth, honesty to win, for the future to win, and that's exactly what's at stake in these elections,” Trzaskowski said. “On June 1, we will all make a decision that may be one of the most important in our lives. A decision that will affect the fate of our children, the fate of our grandchildren.” 

Trzaskowski previously ran for president in 2020, narrowly losing to incumbent Andrzej Duda, whose second and final five-year term ends this summer.

The runoff follows a first-round vote on May 18 that narrowed the initial field of 13 candidates to Trzaskowski and Nawrocki. Recent polls show them running neck-and-neck, within the margin of error, making the outcome impossible to predict.

Both men are now courting voters who backed the hard-right libertarian Sławomir Mentzen, who won nearly 15% in the first round. 

Trzaskowski supporters believe their candidate would better protect the country's interests by strengthening ties with European partners such as France and Germany. In their view, those alliances are vital to Poland's security, especially in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine and fears that a victorious Russia could seek to reassert control over parts of Central and Eastern Europe.

During its eight years in power, Law and Justice was accused by the European Union of undermining democratic norms, particularly judicial independence and press freedom. Trzaskowski has pledged to support Tusk's efforts to restore the independence of Poland's judiciary — something that the conservative Duda has stymied.

Romanian President-elect Nicusor Dan, a pro-EU centrist who pulled off an upset in Romania's presidential election to beat out a hard-right nationalist, traveled to Warsaw, and joined Trzaskowski's march.

Former NYPD inspector Paul Mauro discusses the New Orleans prison escape and more on ‘Fox News Live.' 

Police made four more arrests in connection with a prison break in New Orleans this weekend, Fox News has learned.

The four arrests make a total of 11 people who have been accused of helping the inmates either before, during or after their escape from the New Orleans Jail last week.

The arrests include 18-year-old Patricia Vanburen, 27-year-old Tyshanea ""Minnie"" Randolph, 47-year-old Lenton Vanburen Sr., and 40-year-old Angel McKey. A source confirmed to Fox News that Vanburen Sr. is the father of one of the escaped inmates, Lenton Vanburen.

Authorities executed a search warrant at a residence in New Orleans' 7th District in hopes to find the fugitive Vanburen, but he was not there.

The four individuals arrested this weekend were accused of specifically assisting the younger Vanburen in evading the police.

The arrests come days after police apprehended another suspect accused of helping inmates on Friday. Police say Emmitt Weber, 28, helped two of the inmates after the jailbreak at the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility.

As of Sunday, five of the 10 escaped inmates remain at large.

The most recent arrest was made when Corey Boyd was taken into custody Tuesday.

The other inmates recaptured are Kendell Myles, Robert Moody, Dkenan Dennis and Gary Price.

Two others — Casey Smith and Cortnie Harris — have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees. Another woman, Connie Weeden, 59, allegedly gave cash to Donald via a cellphone app.

She is charged with one felony count of accessory after the fact.

The following fugitives are still at large:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Repeal the FACE Act","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3420036/repeal-the-face-act-abortion/","Sun, 25 May 2025 04:01:00 GMT","

In the summer of 2022, FBI agents armed with long guns and bulletproof vests raided the home of Paul Vaughn, president of Personhood Tennessee, who was the father of 11 children. He had participated 18 months earlier in a peaceful protest at an abortion clinic, the Carafem Health Center Clinic in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, where he and some 20 other pro-life activists prayed, sang hymns, read scripture, and counseled women.

Police arrested some of the activists on-site because they did not move away from the entrance when asked to do so. Vaughn remained on the sidewalk, and a police negotiator later testified that Vaughn was helpful, collaborative, and peaceful throughout the event. Nevertheless, agents with drawn assault weapons arrested Vaughn in front of his frightened wife and children. 

The Department of Justice later indicted him for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, a felony. A court convicted him and sentenced him to three years of supervised release.

The law was signed by former President Bill Clinton in 1994, and it criminalized actions that block access to or vandalize abortion clinics, places of worship, and pregnancy centers. But after the constitutional excresence of Roe v. Wade was excised in 2022, the DOJ in former President Joe Biden's administration weaponized the law to target anti-abortion advocates almost exclusively. 

Of the 25 FACE Act cases Biden's DOJ brought to court, 23 were against pro-life campaigners — the other two involved abortion activists who vandalized pro-life pregnancy resource centers. The discrepancy is outrageous given the wave of attacks against Catholic churches and pro-life centers documented by the Family Research Council after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. The Family Research Council found 236 attacks on Catholic churches and 94 on pregnancy centers from May 2022 to September 2024. These included vandalism, firebombings, and graffiti by groups such as Jane's Revenge. Examples include highly publicized events such as the June 2022 firebombing of a pregnancy resource center in Longmont, Colorado. 

The FACE Act was not intended to be used, as it is, against people because they hold beliefs that most people in our civilization traditionally believed but happen to be out of favor with the Left. Congress created this problematic law and should repeal it. 

Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) has emphasized the urgency of doing so while Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House. Now is the time to act to prevent future administrations from abusing it as a weapon against pro-lifers. In January, Roy, citing cases such as Vaughn's, reintroduced legislation to repeal the law, arguing that the Biden DOJ had destroyed the case for keeping the bill. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) introduced the Senate version of the bill soon after. 

“Over the past four years, we have witnessed the weaponization of the justice system, using the FACE Act to jail Americans fighting for the right to life,” Roy said Monday. “It is not enough to merely end Biden-Harris era discrimination — we must act to reverse course, ensuring selective and unfair political prosecutions are never again possible under this statute.”

This week, the House promised to take steps toward repealing the FACE Act. On Wednesday, a coalition of pro-life leaders sent a joint letter to the Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of a bill that would repeal the act.

ABORTION PILL REVERSAL SHOULD BE TRUMP'S NEXT POLITICAL MANEUVER

“There is no question that future pro-abortion administrations will weaponize the law to target peaceful pro-life protesters. You must ensure that this does not happen,” the letter read. 

We applaud President Donald Trump's January decision to pardon 23 pro-life activists whom the DOJ prosecuted under the FACE Act. We encourage Republicans in both chambers to do everything necessary to pass legislation as a part of a broader effort to end the abusive weaponization of the Justice Department.

Leaked news of the probe amid a heated mayoral campaign raises more skepticism about the case than about the former New York governor.

Who stands to gain?

A reputation for integrity takes a lifetime to build and an instant to lose. Four months into the Trump administration, if the Department of Justice's reputation is not yet lost, it is wandering in the wilderness.

That's why this week's New York Times report of a DOJ investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo raises more skepticism about the case than it does about him.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Warren Buffett is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of this year — but he may not actually stop working.

Instead of sitting at home, the 94-year-old plans to spend his post-CEO days regularly going into Berkshire Hathaway's Omaha, Nebraska, headquarters to keep contributing his investment ideas and decision-making skills, he told the Wall Street Journal on May 14.

""I'm not going to sit at home and watch soap operas,"" said Buffett. ""My interests are still the same.""'

Before Berkshire Hathaway's most recent annual shareholders' meeting, on May 3, Buffett hadn't publicly announced plans to retire. Internally, he'd decided to ""remain CEO as long as I thought I was more useful than anybody else ... And it surprised me, you know, how long it went,"" he said.

In May 2021, Buffett named his eventual successor as Greg Abel, the company's vice-chairman of non-insurance operations. Recently, he compared his energy levels to Abel's, and decided that his successor had surpassed him in terms of ability to be the company's CEO, he told the Journal.

""The difference in energy level and just how much [Abel] could accomplish in a 10-hour day compared to what I could accomplish in a 10-hour day—the difference became more and more dramatic,"" said Buffett. ""He just was so much more effective at getting things done, making changes in management where they were needed, helping people that needed help someplace, but just all kinds of ways.""

But even as Buffett occasionally loses his balance or has trouble recalling a person's name, as the Journal reported, his ability to make smart decisions in turbulent markets hasn't faltered, he said.

""I will be useful here if there's a panic in the market because I don't get fearful when things go down in price or everybody else gets scared,"" said Buffett. ""And that really isn't a function of age.""

Buffett's quasi-retirement isn't unprecedented. A small but quickly growing number Americans are choosing to work past the age of 75, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Continuing to work seems like an especially prevalent mindset among business leaders, from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal. ""My friend Warren Buffett still comes into the office six days a week,"" Gates, 69, told CNBC Make It in September 2024. ""So, I hope my health allows me to be like Warren.""

Sinegal, 89, stepped down from his own CEO role in 2012 — and still goes into the office some Tuesdays, The Wall Street Journal reported on April 16. He always viewed running Costco as more of a hobby than a job, and wanted to continue that sense of enjoyment even after leaving the CEO role, he told the Journal.

Sinegal's sentiment echoes a notable piece of advice that Buffett wrote in his 2022 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: Job seekers should look for a role that ""they would select, if they had no need for money."" The mindset is good for your career, and helps you live a longer, happier life, Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's most recent shareholders' meeting.

""I think a happy person lives longer than somebody that's doing things they don't really admire that much in life,"" said Buffett.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Sunday said Tokyo aims to advance tariff talks with the United States, with the goal of achieving an outcome during the Group of Seven summit next month.

Japan's top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa held a third round of Japan-U.S. talks in Washington on Friday.

Speaking to reporters in Kyoto, Ishiba said there has been progress in negotiations, pointing to discussions on trade expansion, non-tariff measures and economic security.

""We will continue to further refine our discussions with the G-7 summit in mind,"" he said.

Ishiba on Friday held a 45-minute phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss security, diplomacy, and tariffs, and said they exchanged hope for an in-person meeting at the G-7 summit.

On Sunday, Ishiba expressed Japan's willingness to cooperate in shipbuilding. He said the U.S. has shown interest in the possibility of repairing U.S. warships in Japan and that Japan would like to assist.

He said Japan has an advantage in icebreakers, such as those used on Arctic trade routes, which could become an area of cooperation with the U.S.

In Tokyo, Akazawa on Sunday said the schedule for the next Japan-U.S. talks is being arranged and that he hopes to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his next visit to the U.S.

Speaking to reporters at Haneda Airport following his return from Washington, Akazawa said an agreement will be reached only when all elements are settled as a package, meaning that until everything is agreed upon, nothing is agreed upon.

""Therefore, I won't comment on how far we've progressed,"" he said.

In a groundbreaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.

The government recently decided to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country's financial landscape.

The federal government appointed entrepreneur Bilal Bin Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the council.

A statement by the Finance Division says this ambitious initiative is spearheaded by the PCC — a government-backed body under the Ministry of Finance — as part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.

Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that this strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan's digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.

“Pakistan is uniquely positioned — both geographically and economically — to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,” the statement says.

It said that since the inception of the PCC, there has been tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited the country for exploratory discussions, and following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks.

“Pakistan's underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset. AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provide an ideal use case for this surplus.

“Redirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,” the statement added.

PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib emphasised the transformative nature of this initiative and explained that with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration, Pakistan can become a global crypto and AI powerhouse.

Saqib said that this energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in US dollars through Bitcoin mining.

Additionally, as regulations evolve, Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet — marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging digital assets for economic stability.

By offering stable and affordable energy, the statement said Pakistan presents a highly competitive environment compared to regional counterparts like India and Singapore, where rising power costs and land scarcity limit scalability.

Pakistan's strategic advantage is further underscored by the global context as while AI data centre demand has soared to over 100 gigawatts (GW), the global supply remains around 15GW. This massive shortfall creates an unprecedented opportunity for countries like Pakistan with surplus power, land and an emerging regulatory framework, it added.

The statement further said the country's digital connectivity has also been significantly strengthened by the landing of the world's largest submarine internet cable. The Africa-2 Cable Project, a 45,000-kilometre global network connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, has now landed in Pakistan.

This milestone enhances Pakistan's internet bandwidth, latency and resilience through redundant fiber routes — key for ensuring high availability and operational continuity for AI data centres.

With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but will also enhance cybersecurity, improve digital service delivery, and empower national capabilities in AI and cloud infrastructure.

These centres are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data sciences.

The statement adds that this announcement marks only the first phase of a broader, multi-stage digital infrastructure rollout. Future developments are expected to include renewable energy-powered facilities — leveraging Pakistan's immense wind (50,000MW potential in the Gharo-Keti Bandar corridor), solar, and hydropower resources — as well as strategic international partnerships with leading blockchain and AI companies, and the establishment of fintech and innovation hubs.

These efforts will be complemented by proposed incentives such as tax holidays, customs duty exemptions on equipment, and reduced taxes for AI infrastructure developers, it added.

“Pakistan's combination of surplus power, geographic advantage, advanced subsea cable connectivity, renewable energy potential, and a large, digitally engaged population creates a compelling case for becoming a regional epicentre of Web3, AI, and digital innovation.

“With the right incentives, strategic investments, and collaborative partnerships, Pakistan is positioning itself not only as a destination for global digital infrastructure but also as a sovereign economy that can accumulate digital assets, export digital services, and lead in the next generation of technological transformation.”

The Ethereum market price rose by a net 3.16% in what proved to be another historic week for the crypto market as Bitcoin registered a new all-time high price. Notably, the prominent altcoin has largely benefited from the general market resurgence in the past month, resulting in a 44.69% price increase over this period. 

Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Ted Pillows has tipped Ethereum to maintain this positive performance based on a bullish chart pattern.  Related Reading: Ethereum Net Flows Turn Negative As Bulls Push For $3,500

Potential ETH Breakout Pattern Hints At $3,000 Mark – Analyst

In an X post on May 24, Ted Pillows shares that Ethereum's price movement is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the 12-hour daily trading chart, suggesting the altcoin may be due for a price breakout in the coming days. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is one of the classic bullish reversal patterns, signaling a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend.

Based on the Tradingview chart presented by Pillows, the left shoulder of this bullish formation of this bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern formed in February, when ETH sharply declined to around $2,000 before rebounding and entering a range-bound phase that persisted through the month.

In the following months, ETH would register deeper price falls to trade as low as $1,400 in early April to form the head of this pattern. Since then, altcoin has staged a strong recovery, climbing to around $2,700, before entering another consolidation phase that now forms the right shoulder of the pattern.

According to Ted Pillows' analysis, the $2,700 price mark represents the neckline of this inverse head and shoulders pattern. ETH bulls must achieve a decisive close above this resistance level to confirm any potential break, a task that has proven tough following two successive rejections in the past few weeks. 

However, if Ethereum convincingly breaks out above $2,700, Pillows backs the altcoin to swiftly reach the $3,000 price mark, indicating a potential 17.4% on the current market price. 

Ethereum Market Overview

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,500 after a 0.34% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset's daily trading volume is down by 58.22% and valued at $12.35 billion. 

According to on-chain analytics firm Sentora, the Ethereum blockchain also recorded a 23.9% decline in network fees over the past indicating a decline in transactions and general network use. Meanwhile, $74 million in ETH were deposited in exchanges, representing the first inflows in over four months. Nevertheless, Ethereum's price has shown much resilience with no significant decline in response.

Vivek Raman, co-founder of Etherealize and former Wall Street banker, is leading an unprecedented charm offensive. He now presents Ethereum as the “digital oil” destined to revolutionize traditional financial institutions.

Vivek Raman, former banker at Nomura and UBS, launched Etherealize in January 2025 with a clear mission.

This co-founder is leading a charm offensive with financial institutions to convince them to adopt Ethereum. “I still call it digital oil“, he confides.

We believe that with the evolution of the crypto ecosystem, people will want to hold this asset as a reserve.

This analogy is directly inspired by bitcoin, often called “digital gold.” It makes Ethereum accessible to Wall Street newcomers.

The idea is simple: just as oil fuels the global industry, ETH fuels the blockchain network. It serves as fuel for all transactions and smart contracts.

However, fundamental differences emerge. Unlike oil, whose supply remains elastic according to demand, Ethereum has a maximum issuance of 1.5% per year.

“Rather than a fixed total supply cap, there is a fixed annual issuance cap“, clarifies Danny Ryan, co-founder of Etherealize and former researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. This predictability reassures institutional investors used to assets with clear rules.

The most striking advantage of Ethereum lies in its ability to generate income. Unlike oil stored in reserves, ETH “staked” on the network currently yields 3% per year. This passive income naturally attracts institutions seeking regular returns.

The real revolution of Ethereum lies in the tokenization of traditional assets. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have already taken the step by tokenizing several of their funds on this blockchain. This institutional adoption is expected to accelerate under Donald Trump, known to be favorable to cryptocurrencies.

Admittedly, competitors like Solana are nibbling away market share. Kraken has even chosen this blockchain for some of its offerings. But Ethereum maintains a lead thanks to its maturity and proven security.

Raman goes further in his vision. “In this ecosystem where all global assets are tokenized, the only neutral and global asset that connects all these assets is ETH“, he asserts. This perspective turns Ethereum into the backbone of the digital financial system.

Concretely, ETH would serve as a universal exchange currency between different tokenized assets. Stocks, bonds, commodities: all these traditional assets could be traded via Ethereum. This interconnection would create a truly global digital economy.

The “digital oil” analogy finally makes complete sense. Just as oil revolutionized industry in the 20th century, Ethereum could well transform 21st-century finance. Experts anticipate that tokenization of stocks will surpass $1 trillion in the medium term. Wall Street is gradually discovering this infrastructure, which will likely become the backbone of tokenized finance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin holds key support as HYPE, XMR, AAVE, WLD lead altcoin rally","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-holds-key-support-as-hype-xmr-aave-wld-lead-altcoin-rally","Sun, 25 May 2025 19:00:10 GMT","

 Bitcoin's price rally takes a breather over the weekend, but a bullish weekly close could translate to gains from HYPE, XMR, AAVE and WLD. 

Key points:

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 

Bitcoin's demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

While the long-term picture looks promising, traders need to be careful in the near term. The failure to swiftly push the price back above $109,588 could attract profit-booking by short-term traders. If Bitcoin pulls back, several altcoins could also give up some of their recent gains.

Could Bitcoin rise back above $109,588, pulling altcoins higher? If it does, let's look at the cryptocurrencies that look strong on the charts.

Bitcoin dropped back below the breakout level of $109,588 on May 23, and the bears thwarted attempts by the bulls to push the price back above the overhead resistance on May 24.

The bulls will again attempt to drive the price above the $109,588 to $111,980 overhead resistance zone. If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the target objective of $130,000.

The 20-day exponential moving average ($104,199) is the critical level to watch out for in the near term. If the support cracks, the pair could plummet to $100,000 and later to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,916).

The bears have pulled the price below the 50-SMA. The 20-EMA has started to turn down, and the relative strength index has dipped into negative territory, signaling that the bears have the upper hand. If the price sustains below the 50-SMA, the pair could descend to $102,500 and later to $100,000.

Buyers will regain control if they push and maintain the price above the $109,588 resistance. The pair could then challenge the $111,980 level. A break above $111,980 could open the doors for a rally to $116,654.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) has broken above the $35.73 resistance, indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure.

If the price sustains above $35.73, the HYPE/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to $42.25. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $42.25, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket to $50.

Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below the breakout level of $35.73. If they do that, the pair could drop to the $32.15 support, where buyers are expected to step in. 

The pair bounced off the 20-EMA and cleared the overhead barrier at $35.73. If the price remains above $35.73, it suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The pair could then attempt a rally to $42.25.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the 20-EMA. That could trap several aggressive bulls, pulling the pair to $32 and subsequently to $28.50.

Monero (XMR) soared above the $391 resistance on May 21, indicating that the bulls remain in control.

The sharp rally of the past few days has kept the RSI in the overbought zone, suggesting that the bulls remain in command. If buyers maintain the price above $412, the XMR/USDT pair could resume its uptrend toward $456.

Sellers will have to yank the price below the $375 level to weaken the bullish momentum. That could attract selling by short-term buyers, pulling the pair to the 20-day EMA ($347). A break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests a short-term trend change.

The pair is finding support at the 20-EMA, indicating that the bulls remain in control. If the price rises above $412, the uptrend could start the next leg of the uptrend to $456.

Alternatively, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could tug the price to the 50-SMA, which is likely to witness buying by the bulls. A bounce off the 50-SMA could face selling at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a break below the 50-SMA increases. The pair could then tumble to $332.

Aave (AAVE) successfully held the retest of the breakout level of $240 on May 23, indicating demand at lower levels.

The rising 20-day EMA ($231) and the RSI in the overbought zone show that the bulls have the edge. The AAVE/USDT pair could rally to the $285 level, which is expected to behave as a strong resistance. If buyers overcome the barrier at $285, the up move could extend to $300 and later to $350.

Any pullback is expected to witness solid buying at the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to pierce the overhead resistance. The bears will be back in the game on a break below the 20-day EMA. 

The pair has pulled back to the 20-EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $285. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $300.

Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, the pair could slide to the 50-SMA and later to $240. A bounce off $240 is expected to face selling at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-EMA, it increases the risk of a drop to $217.

Worldcoin's (WLD) recovery is facing selling at $1.65, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1.20).

The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. If the price turns up from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to shove the price above the $1.65 resistance. If they can pull it off, the WLD/USDT pair could rally to $2.50. There is resistance at $1.89, but it is likely to be crossed.

This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.99).

The bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA, indicating the start of a deeper correction toward the 50-SMA. The bulls will try to start a rebound off the 50-SMA but are likely to meet stiff resistance at the 20-EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-EMA and breaks below the 50-SMA, the pair could plunge to $1.09.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the downtrend line. The pair could then rise to $1.52 and subsequently to $1.65.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Bitcoin To Hit $176K By October & 100x Tipped Mantix Re-Defines The Crypto Market As ICO Goes Live","https://financefeeds.com/bitcoin-to-hit-176k-by-october-100x-tipped-mantix-re-defines-the-crypto-market-as-ico-goes-live/","Sun, 25 May 2025 17:12:03 GMT","

The recent bullish optimism across the crypto space this May has been highlighted by Bitcoin reclaiming pole position and surging past its $109,000 all-time high from earlier in the year. While the market continues to see dominance by AI altcoins, bots, and revived ETF optimism for many top altcoins, savvy investors are looking for the next 100x crypto ICO to invest in for massive gains.

The lucky ones who bought Bitcoin at a discounted price following its last pullback in April are once again searching the market for the next 100x prospect. This time, they are focused on the best ICO prospects and believe Mantix, powered by the Ethereum blockchain, is one to consider. As its $600,000 token presale takes flight in its first stage where it's currently selling at $0.02, experts tip this project's ICO as a potential 100x ERC20 crypto. But that it is still under the radar makes now the best part to accumulate the coin before it booms!

After over $300 million in leveraged crypto positions got liquidated in four hours following a sudden Bitcoin plunge, no thanks to new tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, the momentum is changing rapidly.

At press time, BTC has a market cap of $2.15 trillion and a price of $107,510. According to the charts, Bitcoin's price has risen by 4.48% this week after $3.06 billion went into the U.S. Spot ETFs and news of Morgan Stanley starting direct crypto trading emerged.

Crypto analysts believe that Bitcoin's growth to $176,000 by October 2025 might be possible if support holds strong at $100,000. However, should the price drop below $97,000, the pressure from a short-selling frenzy might grow, pushing Bitcoin further below toward $90,000.

Mantix is fast gaining widespread momentum and enjoying attention across the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and the digital economy. Its new high-flying crypto ICO is setting the tone for a project threatening to dominate the DEX market. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Mantix allows users to utilize its native $MTX crypto to trade, stake and participate in perpetual trading with up to 1000x leverage.

A major feature that differentiates Mantix is how it prioritizes real-world utility and user-centered value over hype. With incredibly low transaction fees, deep liquidity and capacity for cross-chain trading, this project is effortlessly accessible to a vast range of crypto users.

Such positioning explains why the Defi project is where analysts believe the next big crypto bag is coming for investors who prioritize growth. They tipped MTX to be the next 100x crypto ICO to invest in for its imminent astronomical rise.

Phase 1 of the Mantix presale has recorded over $600,000 in total presale funding, with $MTX tokens currently selling for a low cost of $0.02. As an early-stage investment opportunity, Mantix is drawing in experienced Bitcoin investors, retail traders, and institutional investors seeking massive returns. Mantix tokenomics also provides a revenue-sharing model where holders enjoy passive income without having to provide liquidity directly. That's a share in the future of a value-driven project set for incredible growth.

Cardano (ADA) price is in the spotlight amid the broader shift in the crypto market evolution. The industry is seeing an influx of nation-states. The potential of the technology underlying the digital currency is being amplified.

The use case of blockchain technology is diverse. New avenues to utilize these innovations to enhance public system processes are emerging daily. 

Based on this, different projects are pushing to gain the upper hand as a preferred chain to drive this adoption trend.

Cardano is one of the frontrunners in this regard, a sentiment that is positively impacting the ADA price.

The original idea of blockchains, as designed by Satoshi Nakamoto, is to help bring transparency to financial markets. With Bitcoin serving as a means to fuel transfers among users, a new level of accountability has emerged.

With blockchains, government agencies can store records onchain, helping to solidify their integrity. Over the years, innovators have modified this immutability feature to enhance different aspects of public records.

In addition to storing records, blockchains or distributed ledger technologies (DLT) are used to store voting records, boost procurement, and enhance the tokenization of government bonds.

Beyond utility, the underlying digital currencies from blockchains, like Bitcoin, are now top investment assets backed by nation states. 

US President Donald Trump recently signed an Executive Order to establish a national crypto reserve. Other nations are also looking to join the trend.

The evolution of blockchains is just 15 years in, showing how relatively young the innovation is. As time passes, there is a high likelihood that new use cases will emerge for different aspect of government administration.

Amid the pursuit of new crypto innovations, Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson spotlighted the engagement of the President of Sri Lanka with Intersect Board Director Kavinda Kariyapperuma.

The engagement hinged on discussing blockchain's potential, sharing the Intersect Development Report, and highlighting efforts to drive education, awareness, and real-world adoption through Cardano ADA.

While the details of the partnership is still evolving, the ultimate recognition of the Cardano protocol is obvious. Over the past few months, the Charles Hoskinson has lead different innovations to emerge on the chain. First, there was a shift to community governance through the Chang hard fork upgrade.

Intersect played a key role as one of the core development units of the Cardano entity. Beyond Sri Lanka, there has been indications of a potential partnership between Cardano and other government entities over the past year. 

One of this is Argentina as the community has a somewhat close ties with President Javier Milei. As per recent rumors in the industry, Elon Musk may consider Cardano as a chain to host the database of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). 

Other blockchains like Algorand, Avalanche and Polygon are popular, however, industry participants hold Cardano technology in high regard.

Most of the Cardano chain consideration is likely to drive more adoption of its native digital currency. This will ultimately put enormous pressure that can fuel a Cardano price surge.

At the time of writing, the top altcoin has jumped mildly by 2.2% to $0.7469. The coin has seen a massive volatility growth in the past week. BTC price jumped to an all-time high of $111,970.16.

Bitcoin is gaining the biggest traction as the reserve asset among nation states. Yet, Cardano may lead the utility charge in the coming years.

 World claims to offer financial inclusion through identity verification, but critics warn it may sacrifice decentralization, privacy, and self-sovereignty. 

The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman's World, formerly known as Worldcoin.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project's biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.

At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

“Decentralization isn't just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It's a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World's biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”

El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World's reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.

“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.

When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.

The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”

Evin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World's biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.

El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI's large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World's collection of biometric information.

He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.

“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”

In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.

In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.

World, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.

The scrutiny also extends to World's user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.

However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don't understand the risks involved with ‘selling' this personal data,” El Damaty warned.

Several global regulators have pushed back on World's operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users' biometric data.

In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.

As biometric systems like World's gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.

“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”

World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.

There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.

World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user's activity to their biometric data.

The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.

“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”

The urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn't without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.

“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID's McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.

“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.

Going after executives might be a lot more viable, though. Generally they have much more direct power than major shareholders (since ""sell"" is usually the only option they have)

Isn't that already the case? If an executive ordered a hit on someone, that doesn't become magically legal because he was doing it on behalf of the company.


reply



But also the problem isn't that it becomes ""magically legal"",the problem is that the corporate veil means that if a company takes illegal actions then often only the company is held accountable, instead of the people responsible for directing the company to take illegal actionsAnd it takes a high bar (like ordering a hit) to make the legal system try and hold individuals accountable for company actionsI am arguing that is absurd. I think individuals inside companies take advantage of this often to get away with illegal shit to enrich themselves at the company's expense

Another way forward is that the presumption of innocence should be a sliding scale based on the amount a person has benefited.  So if you made $100 million from the company, the bar is very low; you don't get to make $100 million unless everything is absolutely squeaky clean.  If you were just an average joe taking home a $50k paycheck, you get much more benefit of doubt.  So it's basically like making a lot of money off any endeavor is itself something that requires extra-good conduct; the default position is no one gets to make a lot of money at all.


reply



It makes sense because it maximises the hit-rate of finding a relevant precedent, and kind of creates a global system of common law.Countries with newer legal systems (like Canada) can bootstrap centuries of precedent this way. Nearly a third of Canadian Supreme Court judgements cite foreign precedent!

That's what bankruptcy is.Existing owners (stockholders) lose the company entirely. The company gets sold to entirely new owners.And while bankruptcy is usually due to mismanagement or bad luck, it can also certainly happen because a legal judgment or fine makes the corporation no longer viable.But if you're asking for the company to be destroyed to the extent where every single contract is cancelled and every single person gets laid off, that's not generally desirable. We don't want people to lose their jobs, or customers to stop receiving what a company produces, whenever possible. There's a lot of value in a functioning corporation that you don't want to just disappear. Better to let new owners reuse it.

But the main counterpoint is that there's literally no point to that. If you want to punish the owners, there's no difference between taking the value of their investment to zero, or going beyond that and destroying every contract and job. The owners don't care if a receptionist loses their job too, but the receptionist sure does.So bankruptcy already accomplishes everything you'd want from a ""corporate death penalty"". The company is gone as far as the previous owners are concerned.

However, I'm also amazed when these discussions generate calls for “corporate death penalty” powers being handed to the government and/or used for various transgressions. This entire discussion section is occurring under and article about the current administration abusing government powers for their own gain. How can people be so quick to call for even more levers for corrupt governments to use? “Nice company you got there. Would be a shame if it got the death penalty. On an unrelated note, my campaign fund could use another $100 million if you know anyone…”Let's leave the punishments as proportional to the damage/crime.

A similar dynamic is at play with Luigi. Someone finally pierced the corporate/legal abstractions of the healthcare cartel with some extrajudicial punishment on one of the more-visible cogs. We can all understand that, and it's downright cathartic...But when Krasnov calls Bezos and tells him to discontinue publicizing how much Krasnov's new import taxes are costing everyone, Bezos knows how popularly hated his corporate ownership class is. If Krasnov ends him tomorrow most people won't be horrified, rather there will be throngs cheering it on - the rule of law no longer protects him. And so he has little choice but to lash himself to the fascist's power and comply.I wish I knew how to reverse the trend.

The “corporate death penalty” would be seizing it and selling off assets at such small pieces that it would be hard to reassemble the whole.


reply



Typical companies operate with some debt load (financing, etc). That would have to be paid off with the proceeds of selling off their pieces.So in practice, even selling it off would produce zero or negative monetary return once debts were settled. You'd also be obliterating tens or hundreds of thousands of jobs overnight.

For a corporation, that would be like its operations totally ceasing, all employees are fired, shares might go to zero value, and individual assets sold off (like a will). That ""shares going to zero"" part would be important for accountability.


reply



Corporations aren't people though. For one, corporations are just groups of people, so it's hard to claim that it's irredeemable and must suffer the death penalty. If you take a corporation, replace its board, executives, and employees, is it even the same corporation?>operations totally ceasing, all employees are fired, [...] and individual assets sold off (like a will).What purpose does this serve?>That ""shares going to zero"" part would be important for accountability.That happens regardless of the ""death penalty"" though. The government dispossessing all shareholders has the same effect.

A corporation is just a group of people acting together, and it's pretty well established in international law that collective punishment isn't acceptable; and on the flip side, a corporation can neither ""act"" nor ""think"" independently, but rather does so via the humans involved.  (Perhaps this would change with corporate-owned AI?)In all the cases I've seen where a corporation is alleged to have engaged in criminal conduct, there was in fact a human -- or several humans -- who were broke the law.  As far as I'm concerned, that's where the buck should stop; it seems that prosecutors tend to target corporations simply because it's easier than doing their job properly and pinning down who specifically bears responsibility.

I guess it would also be ok to go after C-levels or whoever sets the policy. But, it will be hard, I think. High-level guidance can create an incentive structure to break the law without actually saying “break the law.”


reply



The creation of such an incentive structure should itself be illegal.


reply



If it's a person, then they might have to go after the corporation. Alternatively, each corporate crime might be a conspiracy charge.With limited liability, it's unclear how much one can discourage the bad behavior if there's distance between the owners and the punishment.I oppose both of these concept by default for criminal behavior. Power and accountability should always go hand in hand. Only people should be people, too.

This is ignoring that levels of complexity creates new emergent behavior. If you're willing to believe that ""AI"" could make a corporation think independently, then how is a pile of paperwork running on a substrate of human wetware not the same dynamic?> it seems that prosecutors tend to target corporations simply because it's easier than doing their job properly and pinning down who specifically bears responsibilityNo, the problem is exactly the sorting through the emergent complexity of the corporation to correctly assign blame. The low-level person who did the actual illegal action is likely sympathetic and mostly judgement proof, and was likely incentivized to break the law by corporate policies. Meanwhile the corporate policies are phrased in terms of abstract metrics that aren't illegal per se, especially how they're written down.Taking the fundamentalist view, that the individual would-be-fall-guy humans should take a hard line and refuse to break the law, doesn't solve the problem - it only increases the level of incentive required until someone is willing to do it. And focusing blame this way helps the higher up management escape accountability since they didn't actually break the law themselves.One correct answer would be to charge all of the involved parties like the criminal conspiracy it is, but the capital-wielding upper classes escaping accountability is a dynamic as old as time.

Sadly we couldn't convince it to work, even at 10 Mbit. My suspicion is salt water ingress into the vault. What we did manage to do, though… There were just enough tools installed on it that I could cross-compile zmodem at home, convert it to a hex file, upload the hex file by essentially just running cat > on the target, convert it back into a binary using… Perl I think? Or xxd? And then doing the daily data offload over zmodem every night instead of over TCP as was originally planned. It was a crazy weekend…

It's also important not to emit escape codes at all when TERM=dumb. (You'll get this behavior automatically if you implement color support by asking terminfo to the escape codes.)    const c = @cImport({

Since 2015, Daredevil has dominated the small screen across his two shows on Netflix and Disney+. Fans have kept the character going on TV for the past decade, and actor Charlie Cox thinks that same passion could get ol' hornhead back on the big screen.

In a recent interview at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, Cox said he was the “worst person to ask” about the chances of a Daredevil movie, since he knows jack all about it. Any questions or demands should go to “the grown-ups,” aka Disney and Marvel. “Write letters, just everyone write letters,” he urged. For him, the show's not too far removed from the cinematic experience, since the cast and crew got to watch the first two episodes of every season in theaters, something he thinks it absolutely “deserves” for everyone, not just the people who made it.

Now, Cox could probably be lying his ass off, a thing he's pretty good at doing when it comes to playing this character. If there were any time to bring him to the movies, fans think it'd be now: Deadpool & Wolverine reintroduced audiences to Jennifer Garner's Elektra (from the 2003 Daredevil and her own solo movie), and the recently delayed Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars are looking to bring the old X-Men back for one last hurrah. And if not there, there's always Spider-Man: Cox has already reprised the role for the animated Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Spider-Man: Brand New Day in 2026.

Wherever Daredevil shows up next outside of his own show returning in 2026, Cox is happy to tell Matt's story and remains “so thrilled to be here.” And if this is any indication, fans are ready to follow him anywhere.

Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli refuses to answer when asked about Antonio Conte's return, confirming only they are ‘very happy' with Igor Tudor's work, while intense talks are in progress for the Club World Cup squad.

The trip to Venezia kicks off at the Stadio Penzo at 19.45 UK time (18.45 GMT, 20.45 CET).

You can follow all the build-up and action as it happens from today's six Serie A games on the Liveblog.

The Bianconeri have the upper hand in the fight for fourth place, so will this evening's result ultimately decide how their entire season is judged?

“Outside judgment is always of interest, but we still have clear ideas,” Giuntoli told DAZN.

“We rebooted, knew it would be a complicated campaign by cutting the average age of the team, lowering the salary bill and making many changes. Unfortunately, there was also a remarkable number of injuries, which made it much tougher.

“Being here this evening, we still have it in our hands to qualify for the Champions League despite it all, which would be an extraordinary result. We know that it is a complicated game, but we have clear ideas, feel the squad has a great future ahead of it and with a few additions can be competitive very soon.”

Juventus already confirmed that Tudor will remain at the helm for the Club World Cup in the USA this June and July, but if they qualify for the Champions League, will that mean he stays on the bench for next season too?

“As we said when we presented him, we will evaluate at the end of the season. We are very happy with his work and the impact he had on the team. It is a decision we will make later, but we are very, very happy with his work.”

Sky Sport Italia report today that Conte is leaving Napoli after winning the Scudetto, so could his next destination be a return to Juventus?

“I will just congratulate Napoli for having a great season and that is all,” replied Giuntoli.

The Club World Cup poses a problem for the clubs who have a lot of players on loan, like Juventus, because it runs from mid-June to mid-July, so contracts will expire halfway through.

Giuntoli confirmed he is working hard to bolster the squad with some figures returning and others kept on for a little bit longer.

“Considering the emergency situation, we are thinking of bringing Kostic and Rugani to the Club World Cup, so are discussing it with Fenerbahce and Ajax. We are very advanced in talks with Porto for Francisco Conceicao, also talking to Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea for Kolo Muani and Veiga.

“Seeing as we have so few players at our disposal, we want to keep them for that tournament.”

Gleison Bremer has resumed training after his knee ligament surgery, so will he be at the Club World Cup for Juventus?

“He is doing well, he will train with us, but I don't think he will play.”

It's official—the U.S. government will expedite visa processing for those attending the 2026 World Cup

World Cup is just around the corner, and as you well know, the FIFA World Cup 2026 will take place in our country, and of course, the state's efforts to ensure that supporters from each country can enter the country during the sporting event are titanic.

For that, Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained before the Homeland Security Subcommittee that double shifts and new technologies will be implemented in key embassies. The reason? To guarantee visas for everyone, according to them, their priority is that no one misses this event due to a possible bureaucratic delay.

The context is unprecedented: they hosted the 2024 Copa América and the 2025 FIFA World Cup. Now, with the 2028 Olympic Games on the calendar, the country faces a logistical challenge like never before.

But… meanwhile, the Trump administration is tightening its immigration policies, which makes the visa process more closely monitored than ever (and also more cynical than ever). Even so, the message the U.S. wants to show the world is that it wants to open its doors to the world… as long as the paperwork is in order.

The soccer fever is already starting to be felt in the United States. And with it, a wave of visa applications from every corner of the planet. The government, aware of this, has decided to act before collapse hits.

Rubio explained that double shifts will be implemented in many embassies to reduce wait times. He pointed to the case of Colombia as an example, where, without these measures, many applicants wouldn't arrive in time for the World Cup.

In addition, reinforcement will be prioritized in countries with high ticket demand to avoid the chaos seen in other editions where hundreds of fans were unable to travel.

One of the most striking announcements is the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the processing of renewals. This tool will allow repetitive tasks to be automated and free up human resources for new applications, shortening deadlines without compromising security.

No, the 1994 World Cup was already hosted here, in which, by the way, attendance records were broken and national interest in the sport was sparked. And yes, of course we remember how Roberto Baggio missed the decisive penalty that gave victory to Brazil, earning their fourth star on the jersey.

Now, with a more robust infrastructure and the experience of having hosted other global events, the country is preparing for the biggest World Cup in history: more teams, more venues, more matches… and millions of people trying to cross its borders.

President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino agree on one thing: the image of the country is at stake. A disorganized World Cup or one full of bureaucratic hurdles would be a disaster. That's why legal and controlled access is now a matter of state.

Not everything is celebration. While channels are being opened to facilitate sports tourism, the same Trump government maintains its pressure on irregular immigration. This means that the filter to enter will be more exhaustive than ever, and the processes will be under stricter control.

The United States has sent a clear message to the world: come to the World Cup, but prepare ahead of time. With reinforcement in embassies and the use of AI, everything points to faster procedures. But also more rigorous ones.

So if you want to be there, screaming your team's goal live and in person and not from the couch, the first thing you need to do is move now. Because this time, the World Cup starts at the embassy.

While many tennis fans may not have taken notice of them yet, the Czech duo steadily collected titles and climbed the rankings with remarkable consistency.It was only at the beginning of 2024 that the two 26-year-olds from Prague officially joined forces—but their impact was immediate. In their very first tournament together, they lifted the trophy on hard court in Nottingham, Great Britain. It was the perfect debut, and it didn't stop there: titles followed in Tenerife (also on hard court) and then on clay in San Marino, Sevilla and Bad Waltersdorf.Breakthrough on the ATP TourIn April this year, Nouza and Rikl made another major leap forward by winning their first ATP Tour title at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech. The success not only added another trophy to their cabinet but also propelled both into the highest rankings of their careers. Patrik Rikl holds a career-high of World No. 65 in the ATP Doubles Rankings, while Petr Nouza, who captured six Challenger titles in 2023 with different partners and broke into the Top 100 for the first time, sits just a few places behind at No. 69.

So, what's the secret behind their success?“I don't know if there's a secret to winning,” Rikl says. “The most important thing is that we're friends, not just on court, but off it, too. That's key in doubles. We play the same tournaments, and we stay at the same hotels. You need to get along, or it just won't work.”Nouza echoes the sentiment: “As he said, we get along really well. Our playing styles complement each other nicely, and we both serve pretty strongly. There's still a lot of potential to improve, but we're working every day to get better.”All-in on doublesOriginally, both had set their sights on singles careers, but injuries forced them to pivot. “We both struggled with injuries,” explains Rikl, who has undergone two knee surgeries. Nouza adds, “At this point, probably every body part has taken a hit, especially our wrists. I also had hip issues. Playing doubles is just physically easier.”But it's not just about health, there's a thrill to doubles, too.“There's the adrenaline,” Nouza says. “Doubles matches are often super close, the rallies are exciting. It's fast, it's a completely different game compared to singles. It's fun to play, and hopefully fun to watch, too.”

Their biggest dream? Conquering the Grand Slams together. “Right now, I'm really happy with our partnership,” Nouza said last year. “Hopefully we keep growing and reach the Slams together. That's our biggest goal.” In January, they competed in the main draw of the Australian Open but lost a tight first-round battle to France's Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul. At Roland-Garros, the goal is to go one step further and reach the second round for the first time.After their breakthrough in Morocco, the pair returned to the Challenger Tour to prepare for the clay-court season, with mixed results. They reached the semifinals in Estoril but bowed out in the opening round in Bordeaux.

Away from the court, downtime is limited. “There's often not much time to switch off,” Rikl admits. “If you have a late match, you end up waiting around all day. That makes it tough to really relax outside the tournament venue.”Still, they try to enjoy their time on the road and even share a few interests. “We follow a lot of sports,” says Nouza. “Maybe I follow more than he does. Patrik prefers video games (laughs). I'm a fan of Sparta Prague and Chelsea.” Rikl adds, “I like Sparta and Real Madrid.”Bundesliga rivals?Interestingly, the two could face each other in Germany's prestigious Tennis Channel Bundesliga - at least in theory. Nouza represents TC 1860 Rosenheim: “It's nice to be part of a team in tennis for a change. I always look forward to the Bundesliga season in Germany. We've got a great group of guys. The money's a bonus, but it's mainly just a really good time.”Rikl plays for TC Augsburg, who were relegated last season. Now they're fighting for a quick return to the top flight. Should they succeed, a clash between the Czech duo on opposite sides of the net may not be far off.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Federer on Nadal: ‘He is so incredible'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-nadal-roland-garros-2025","Sun, 25 May 2025 19:16:48 GMT","

One of the most special parts of the memorable ceremony honouring Rafael Nadal Sunday at Roland Garros was that Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray was their to celebrate their rival and friend.

The Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry between Federer and Nadal became not just iconic in tennis, but throughout the sports world. The Swiss superstar had nothing but the most positive things to say about the Spaniard's legacy at the clay-court major.

“It's amazing how dominant he has been here,” Federer told Mary-Joe Fernandez on TNT. “He is so incredible, and I am so happy that he got the plaque forever, not just for a year or something like that. And I think it meant a lot to Rafa. So, I am very honoured that I had the chance to play against Rafa on this court.”

Federer was referencing the final surprise for Nadal during the ceremony. Gilles Moretton, the president of the French Tennis Federation, revealed a plaque next to the net with Nadal's footprint on it. It was an emotional moment to close the show.

“I think farewells are important when you have his level. And he is a giant of the game and if we can add a little something by being here with Novak and Andy and we tied a knot all together, I think it's a nice thing,” Federer said. “I know it meant the world to me that I had all my guys, my players around me when I retired, and I think it's also good for closure. 

“[It is] respect as well from me personally towards Rafa and his family and his team. We played so long and so good and hard against each other that I was not going to miss it when they asked me to be here today.”

The 103-time tour-level titlist Federer explained that the dynamics of rivalries in professional tennis have changed over time, but that it was nice how well he got along with Nadal, Djokovic and Murray.

“That's nice to see that me, Novak, Andy and Rafa, we all get along really well. You can put us into a room together, and we are going to have a good time,” Federer said. “I think it also sends a nice message out to the world. But then when it is go time, it is strictly rivalry. We want to win. Sure, we're going to do it fair and how it is supposed to be done. But it is important to also keep that element of big-time rivalry, ‘I want to really beat you'. But then I think after the match we can be very friendly again.”

The first year Nadal lost on the Parisian clay, in 2009, Federer was able to complete his career Grand Slam and lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires.

“It meant a lot to me, because it was the last Grand Slam that I was still missing. For me, I had won all the others by 2004, so I had to wait a good five, six years maybe to win the French Open,” Federer said. “So of course, when I won it finally, on a rainy day here in Paris and I came through in the final, it was a beautiful moment.” 

But it was Nadal who almost always reigned supreme on the terre battue. The 14-time Roland Garros champion defeated Federer in all six of their showdowns at Roland Garros, including in four finals and two semi-finals. 

“The pressure was immense [the year I won] because I knew, ‘Okay, maybe I don't have to go through Rafa',” Federer recalled. “That's how tennis works sometimes. But the relief was incredible and I never got the chance again. Rafa was there at the door and said, ‘Sorry pal, it is my turn again'.”

We'll be back tomorrow to cover day two at Roland Garros, when the first of the British players will get their tournaments under way. 

Catch you then!

Aryna Sabalenka wasted no time in securing her place in the second round, taking just 60 minutes to win in straight sets against Kamilla Rakhimova.

Elsewhere, Elina Svitolina has cruised through her first match in just 72 minutes, winning 6-1 6-1 against Zeynep Somnez of Turkey.

However, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has lost to Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland, who triumphed 3-6 6-0 6-4.

Can anyone in the men's draw prevent the Carlos Alcaraz v Jannik Sinner final most would expect at the end of this fortnight?

Well, former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash believes Britain's Jack Draper is the only player on the men's tour who poses a serious threat to the dominance of Spaniard Alcaraz and Italian Sinner.

This video can not be played

French Open: Jack Draper only one who can catch top players -  Pat Cash

On the men's side, this year's French Open is going to feel rather strange. It is the first Roland Garros since Rafael Nadal - the man who won 14 singles titles and is synonymous with the tournament - retired.

His abdication means there is a chance for someone to make a sustained attempt at becoming the new 'King of Clay' - a title to which Spain's Carlos Alcaraz has long been the heir apparent.

The 22-year-old defending champion is a natural clay-courter with a 15-1 win-loss record on the surface this year - and, perhaps crucially, more match practice than rival Jannik Sinner.

Italy's Sinner is the other standout candidate. The world number one has dominated over the past 18 months but only recently returned from a three-month doping ban.

Sinner dropped just one set in reaching the Italian Open final, including a ruthless quarter-final thrashing of two-time French Open runner-up Casper Ruud.

But Sinner was put in check by world number two Alcaraz in the final, with many expecting a repeat of it in the Paris showpiece on 8 June.

It will be all eyes on Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff in the next couple of days to see how they begin their tournaments after that impressive display by Aryna Sabalenka.

Meanwhile, in the men's draw...

World number one Aryna Sabalenka, speaking to Marion Bartoli on court at Roland Garros: ""I'm super happy to be back in Paris, I love playing in front of all you guys. I hope I can do really good here. It's hard in round one to play someone you really like, but I'm happy to have got the win.""

On taking photos with a polaroid camera after securing victory: ""The idea was to take some good moments in my life - I started in December and I already have a pretty big album. When I feel sad, I go through the album and remember the good moments, they give me good vibes. The album is full of my team, which is annoying sometimes but it is good fun.""

On the upcoming ceremony in hour of Rafa Nadal and whether she will stick around to watch: ""Whenever someone asks me about Rafa, I think of a really hard worker. He is such an inspiration to young players. I will try and stick around to watch the ceremony, and ask him, please do you have advice on how to win this tournament!""

More news from notable names around Roland Garros, and we're afraid it is not good for Petra Kvitova.

The two-time Wimbledon champion has been beaten in round one by Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland, who triumphed 3-6 6-0 6-4 on court seven.

This is Kvitova's first slam since maternity leave, but she was unable to find a first win as a mother at a major tournament. The Czech will move on to Wimbledon, on her more favoured grass surface.

Sabalenka 6-1 6-0 Rakhimova

One hour is all it took for the title favourite to stroll through to the second round.

That was super impressive. She'll play Italy's Lucrezia Stefanini or Swiss player Jil Teichmann next.

Aryna Sabalenka serves up a bagel and a breadstick as she announces her arrival in Paris in style.

*Sabalenka 6-1 5-0 Rakhimova

Ace.

Match point.

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds

Early in the year for Rakhimova, she had a lot of first round losses. Then in Rome, she got a lucky loser passage and a couple of wins, plus she took out Emma Raducanu at Indian Wells.

But this was not a good draw for her.

*Sabalenka 6-1 5-0 Rakhimova

A double fault by Aryna Sabalenka puts Kamilla Rakhimova 0-30 up. 

The world number one is so far ahead in this match that there are one or two signs she's just struggling to stay completely focused until the very end.

*Sabalenka 6-1 5-0 Rakhimova

Just too good. Aryna Sabalenka is bamboozling Kamilla Rakhimova with a mix of power and finesse.

It's been an exceptionally tough 55 minutes for Rakhimova but it should at least be over very, very soon.

The world number one breaks for a third time in this set and will now serve for the match.

Katie SmithBBC Radio 5 Live in Paris

It's a great crowd at Roland Garros - it is feisty, they make themselves known, and they do not like to be told no.

Sabalenka 6-1 4-0 Rakhimova*

Aryna Sabalenka eventually comes through on serve after facing a couple of break points and surely ends any hope Kamilla Rakhimova had of forcing a way back into this.

*Sabalenka 6-1 3-0 Rakhimova

Perhaps the biggest threat to Aryna Sabalenka is herself. Clearly keen to get this done as quickly as possible, she's showing signs of frustration when a point doesn't go well - despite her commanding position.

A couple of unforced errors give Kamilla Rakhimova a first break point of the contest. Sabalenka shuts down the first, but another poor miss gives her opponent another chance.

*Sabalenka 6-1 3-0 Rakhimova

Kamilla Rakhimova is ranked 78th in the world, but the gulf between these two feels much, much bigger today.

Aryna Sabalenka, in this mood, is going to take some stopping at Roland Garros. A statement opening day performance.

Russell FullerTennis correspondent on BBC 5 Live and BBC Sounds

I love covering these Grand Slams, but with this opening day schedule it's a bit of a slow start.

You need an equal spread of stars on the opening three days, otherwise this opening day can feel like a test event.

*Sabalenka 6-1 3-0 Rakhimova

A shake of the head from Aryna Sabalenka as a fourth break point comes and goes.

Fifth time lucky?

No luck about it, in truth. Sabalenka hammers a forehand away to move three games from victory.

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds

I'm not sure why Sabalenka threw that drop shot in at that point. It has given Rakhimova confidence, that error.

Djokovic is just too good a player (it sounds surreal to say that), and too experienced, not to have a few more shots to fire across the bow of rivals. It would be a mistake to look beyond Mackie McDonald in the first round, especially in light of Djokovic's recent struggles. After that, the hype machine kicks in.

Sinner could face Djokovic in the semifinals, but both will have to get past a slew of in-form opposition in the top half of the men's draw.

However, I can imagine that Jelena Ostapenko will stop her from achieving her goal in the round of 16, paving the way for herself to go far in Paris. As a former Roland Garros champion (2017), the Latvian has already proven how dangerous she can be in on clay—plus, she often brings her best tennis against top players.

PARIS, France—Has Canadian tennis found its new golden girl? At just 18 years old, Victoria Mboko made a dazzling entrance onto the world stage Sunday at Roland Garros.After powering through three rounds of qualifying—without dropping a set—Mboko delivered again, this time in her Grand Slam main draw debut.Born in North Carolina to Congolese parents and raised in Toronto, Mboko played with fearless precision and emotional poise to defeat New Zealand's Lulu Sun 6-1, 7-6 (4) on Court 9.“I mean, it's been my first Grand Slam ever, so there's a lot of emotions going on,” she gushed in her post-match press conference. “I'm also just very excited to be here, to qualify, honestly just to win my first round in the main draw.“I'm super content right now and I'm super happy with the way I've been playing. Hopefully I can continue on doing the same thing.”

“I remember asking one of the people on the Wilson team, like, Hey, what does the kit look like for French Open?” Mboko recalled in Paris. “They sent me back a sketch of what it was going to be, and I was like, Oh this is really pretty!""I tried it on for the first time with my mom on the phone, and my sister was there watching too. They both said, that was made for you!”Her look features a rib-knit sleeveless polo and high-rise pleated tennis skirt—both in the “Golden” colorway—as part of Wilson's Roland Garros collection, inspired by “the iconic terre battue en 1999.” Wilson also sponsors Marta Kostyuk, Peyton Stearns, and Alycia Parks. Mboko signed a head-to-toe deal with the brand in January 2024.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Canadian teen Victoria Mboko wins Grand Slam debut at French Open and looks for more","https://www.cbc.ca/sports/tennis/victoria-mboko-wins-first-grand-slam-match-1.7543320","Sun, 25 May 2025 17:31:47 GMT","

Victoria Mboko is still just 18, still rather new to the top level of professional tennis, and yet with a big serve, a terrific backhand and enviable court coverage, the Canadian is making the most of her first season on tour, including a victory in her Grand Slam debut on Sunday at the French Open in Paris.

When it was mentioned that her 6-1, 7-6 (4) elimination of 2024 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Lulu Sun meant Mboko has claimed all eight sets she's played over the past week-plus on the red clay at Roland-Garros — including six in a trio of triumphs in the qualifying rounds — the Toronto teen laughed, revealing the braces on her teeth.

""This does, obviously, feel really quick for me. Although it feels quick, I feel like I'm also adapting very quickly. I want to be in this level,"" said Mboko, represented by talent agency IMG since the age of 12. ""To adapt really fast is really important to me. The more I feel like I make it seem normal to me, the more normal it's going to be in these tournaments.""

Against the left-handed Sun, Mboko's serve — which she considers her game's greatest strength — played a significant role in the outcome.

With her father and two of her older siblings in the stands at Court 9, a short walk from Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Mboko reached a top speed of 115 mph and delivered seven aces. She won all 10 of her service games, saving all seven break points accumulated by Sun.

""I love to dictate points on my serve, and I love to use that as an opportunity to be more aggressive and be up in the score,"" said Mboko, who is currently ranked 120th. ""Especially in women's tennis, having a good serve and holding all the time is pretty crucial. It helps me get out of a lot of sticky situations.""

Her favourite player as a kid — not all that long ago, actually — was Serena Williams, whose 23 Grand Slam titles often came with the help of top-notch serving.

""I always modelled myself on the idea of her game. Of course, not everything I do is the same. But she had such a powerful game, and that's something that I would love to replicate and love to present my game off of that,"" Mboko said. ""It's great to have a role model like that and try to do something like she did.""

Mboko began to really get noticed in the world of tennis at the start of this year, when she won 22 matches in a row — all in straight sets — to earn four lower-level International Tennis Federation titles. Her first WTA match arrived at the Miami Open in March, and she won that debut, too.

She's been impressing opponents along the way, including 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff. Mboko pushed the American, who is ranked No. 2 right now, to three sets on clay at the Italian Open this month.

""She's playing top-level tennis,"" Gauff said after that win. ""For sure, on the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that. As far as the other parts of her game, she's obviously a big hitter, can play well, moves pretty well, has a nice backhand, same on the forehand.""

Mboko grew up playing mostly on indoor hard courts in Canada and calls that her ""favorite surface for my whole life.""

That said, she's starting to get used to — and enjoy — the clay used at the French Open.

""In the future? I guess we'll see. You never know. I feel like I've been doing pretty OK on the clay so far, even though it was my least favorite surface and I thought it was my worst surface, too,"" Mboko said. ""But you never know.""

The French Open begins Sunday, with plenty of intrigue. Iga Swiatek has won the past three titles in a row, but didn't make the finals in any of the three clay tournaments she entered this spring. Meanwhile, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff are looking as prepared as ever.

On the men's side, all signs point to a Carlos Alcaraz-Jannik Sinner showdown, but who will prevail? Alcaraz is the defending French Open champion, while Sinner won the Australian and US Open -- the past two Grand Slam titles.

We polled our experts for their picks to win, and for their best betting tips.

Pam Shriver: It's a top-heavy women's draw that is anchored by Sabalenka, who is still my pick to win her first Roland Garros. Sabalenka by far has been the best player over the past 12 months, winning many clutch matches. The player who seems to benefit most from being on the weaker bottom half is Gauff, who continues to struggle with her forehand and serve sometimes in important matches. If those two vulnerable shots hold up late in the tournament, Gauff could walk away with her second major. Despite Swiatek's dominance at Roland Garros in the past few years, I don't see her as one of my two picks.

Bill Connelly: Sabalenka. She's just always there in the late rounds. She has reached six finals in her eight events in 2025, and she has reached the finals in five of her past eight Slams as well. It feels odd going against Swiatek, but it's more that I'm going for the world No. 1.

D'Arcy Maine: Gauff. She has proved just how good she can be on clay in the past and had strong results at Roland Garros previously, but it feels like she's better than ever on the surface with a 10-2 record in the month of May alone. She reached the final in Madrid with straight-sets victories over Mirra Andreeva and Belinda Bencic, and then absolutely dismantled Swiatek 6-1, 6-1 in the semifinals. Gauff then went on to reach the Italian Open final, with wins over Andreeva, Emma Raducanu and Zheng Qinwen (in over three and a half hours!) along the way. She has come away trophy-less in Europe so far this season but that should change in Paris.

Tom Hamilton: Apologies for being predictable, but I'll go for Swiatek. She has this Rafa Nadal-esque ability of throwing form and logic aside, to string together something remarkable on the Parisian clay. Jasmine Paolini has a decent shot, as do Sabalenka, Andreeva and Gauff, but Swiatek will end up getting her fifth Roland Garros title.

Simon Cambers: I think it will be Paolini. The experience of reaching the final last year and most recently winning Rome bodes well for her chances, and she has no reason to fear anyone, especially with Swiatek vulnerable this year.

Shriver: It seems like we could see our first major final between Sinner and Alcaraz. Even with Sinner's three months off serving the suspension, Rome proved the two players who have won all the majors the past 18 months are currently the best two players in the world. Alcaraz is the favorite to defend his title to win his fifth major. Alcaraz has been making smarter tactical decisions on the court as he matures. His fitness seems to be peaking too.

Connelly: Sinner. If we end up with a Sinner-Alcaraz final, give me Alcaraz, but I think Sinner's more likely to get to the final. He has the more manageable draw, and Alcaraz is still prone to earlier-round glitches at times -- he fell to David Goffin in Miami, and he has lost nine matches to players outside the top 10 in the past year. (Sinner: 41-0 against players outside the top 10 in the past year.) Sinner found a strong rhythm in Rome despite his lengthy absence/suspension, and he has won three of the past five Slams. Make it four of six.

Maine: Alcaraz. Sure, Sinner wasn't eligible to return to competition until the Italian Open, but there has been no one on Alcaraz's overall level or as consistent this spring on clay. He won in Monte Carlo, reached the final in Barcelona, and then defeated Sinner 7-6 (5), 6-1 in the Rome final. Seemingly at full health after sitting out of Madrid with a hamstring injury and with momentum very much on his side, I fully expect the reigning champion to repeat at Roland Garros and win his fifth major title.

Hamilton: Alcaraz will win his second Roland Garros title. He's in great form, hitting peak fitness and knows what it takes to triumph on the Parisian clay. Sinner will push him close, but Alcaraz is playing tennis at a different level to anyone else at the moment.

Cambers: Alcaraz. He has the best form, having won Monte Carlo and Rome, and for me, he won last year's title without ever quite hitting the heights we know he can. Fully fit after injury, he has everything he needs to win a fifth slam title.

Pamela Maldonado: Mirra Andreeva +600. I said long ago she would win Roland Garros, so I am sticking to that. Andreeva has the clay-court instincts, variety and shot tolerance to frustrate even the best. Sabalenka brings the power and Swiatek owns this surface, but Andreeva's ability to absorb pace, redirect and extend rallies makes her a real threat to both. She recently beat them back-to-back in Indian Wells and looked completely unfazed. On this surface, with her feel and composure, she's built to shock the field.

Andre Snellings: Iga Swiatek +325. Swiatek is having a down season and is seeded fifth in the tournament, her lowest seeding in Paris in years. But this is Roland Garros, and Swiatek reigns supreme at Roland Garros. She has won four of the past five French Open championships, including three in a row. While her play this season has been scratchy by her standards, Swiatek still made the semifinals at the Australian Open and in three of the six WTA 1000 level tournaments she has entered this season. Some of her recent losses, including on clay, may have shaken her confidence a bit, but once she gets on the red clay at Roland Garros I expect her to find her level and win her fifth championship.

Maldonado: Carlos Alcaraz at +115 is the pick to win because no one matches his blend of athleticism, creativity and endurance on clay. He just won in Rome, dropping only one set the entire tournament and beating Sinner in straight sets in the final. Plus, Alcaraz is already a Slam champion in Paris and has the rare ability to adapt mid-match without losing intensity. His movement on the surface is elite, his shotmaking is fearless and his discipline in five-set battles is beyond his years. He's not just the favorite; he's the most complete player in the field.

Snellings: Carlos Alcaraz +105. Alcaraz enters this French Open as the defending champion and favorite. He and rival Sinner have won the past five consecutive majors, and with Djokovic having a down season, the impression is that there is a gap between Alcaraz and Sinner and the rest of the field. After winning last year's French Open, Alcaraz also won the silver medal in men's singles at the 2024 Summer Olympics that were played at Roland Garros. And Alcaraz is having a scorching season on clay, with a 15-1 win-loss record that includes championship wins at both ATP 1000 level events he has played on clay at Monte-Carlo and the Italian Open. Alcaraz defeated Sinner to win the latter.

Maldonado: Not a wager you can find, but one I would take a big bite of: Iga Swiatek to not win Roland Garros. 35-2 overall in six appearances and four French Open titles. If she doesn't win, it's not a knock on her talent, it's a reflection of her uneven season. She has had flashes of dominance but hasn't sustained it. She lost to Ostapenko in Stuttgart, Gauff in Madrid and Collins in Rome, all in matches where she looked a step off rhythm or flat in key moments. Sure, she's capable of finding her best tennis in Paris, but the question is whether she actually will. This year, she hasn't shown the same aura of inevitability, and in a draw this deep, that's a problem.

Snellings: Mirra Andreeva to reach the final +240. Andreeva is one of the most exciting young players on the tour, entering this season's French Open at only 18 years old. Last year, at 17, she advanced to the semifinals at the French Open for her best finish at a major while defeating Sabalenka along the way. She also teamed with Diana Shnaider to win the silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Andreeva is a former world No. 1 junior, and this season won her first WTA 1000 championships at Dubai and Indian Wells. At this French Open, Andreeva is on the opposite half of the draw from both top-seeded Sabalenka and four-time French Open champion Swiatek, giving her a legitimate path to the final if she plays to her level.

Maldonado: Jannik Sinner to win Quarter 1. Having Jack Draper in his quarter is scary on paper, but break it down. Sinner is 1-9 against top-five opponents on clay. Draper is world No. 5. Context matters. Those losses came against clay dominators: Nadal, Djokovic, Alcaraz, Zverev, Tsitsipas. They weren't upsets but instead they were expected battles against the very best on their best surface. Draper, as talented as he is, isn't in that tier yet, especially not on clay and not in best-of-five. Sinner is too clean, too consistent, and in the best form of his career (12-1 in 2025).

Snellings: Novak Djokovic to reach the final +450. Djokovic has had a down season as he has recovered from the injury that forced him to withdraw from the Australian Open. But he is still Novak Djokovic, and this is still a Grand Slam tournament, which he has won more than any player in history. Djokovic made only the quarterfinals at the French last year, but he has won two of the past four French Open championships. He also won the Olympic gold medal at Roland Garros last summer. If health permits, Djokovic is still very dangerous, and could be value to make the final at +450.

Maldonado:  Jasmine Paolini +1400. She just won the Italian Open, beating legit names such as Gauff and Ostapenko, and she's coming off a runner-up finish at last year's French. Her game fits clay: It's smart, patient, tough and she's playing with confidence. Everyone's watching Swiatek and Sabalenka, but Paolini's sitting right there with the form and the draw to crash the party.

Snellings: Jasmine Paolini +1600. Paolini was a finalist at the French Open last season, succumbing to four-time champion Swiatek. Still it was a monster run for Paolini, who also made the final at Wimbledon last season and paired with Sara Errani to win the gold medal in doubles in the 2024 Olympics. Paolini is the fourth seed in this year's French Open, a career-best seeding, and comes in having won a WTA 1000-level clay tournament in the Italian Open. While I wouldn't favor her to win, at 16-to-1 she is getting a lot of juice for a player with this résumé and a legitimate shot to take her first major.

Maldonado: Alexander Zverev at +1400 is the long shot worth backing. His odds may not shout long shot, but his path to victory certainly does. It helps that he won Munich, but Zverev has the physicality, serve and backhand to thrive on clay over five sets. His path is brutal with potentially Cerundolo (0-3 head-to-head), Djokovic, and Sinner in his way, but he's built for grind-it-out matches and is battle-tested in this environment. If he holds his nerve, he has the game to break through and win his first Slam.

Snellings: Casper Ruud +2200. Ruud has quietly been one of the best clay-court players of the past few years, but he was overshadowed by the bigger names of Nadal, Djokovic and now Alcaraz. But Ruud has two finals and a semifinals appearance in the past three French Opens, and has the chops to win the event if things break well for him. Ruud enters the tournament playing well, having won the Madrid Open on clay earlier in the season. At 22-1, Ruud is strong value as a player who could win at very long odds.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

 PARIS, - American men have reduced the gap with European players in the last decade but Grand Slam success will remain the gold standard to measure tennis greatness, United States number two Tommy Paul said at the French Open on Sunday. 

 Paul's compatriot Taylor Fritz had a chance to end his country's wait for a first men's major since Andy Roddick's 2003 U.S. Open triumph, but he was soundly beaten in last year's Flushing Meadows final by Jannik Sinner. 

 That defeat raised fresh questions about the U.S. men, with Italian Sinner and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz now extending European superiority after two decades of dominance by Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. 

 ""We haven't closed the gap because none of us have won a Grand Slam. There's still a lot of really good Europeans ranked ahead of us. I wouldn't say the gap has closed. Over the past six years or so, we've definitely made it smaller,"" Paul said. 

 World number 12 Paul, one of four Americans inside the world's top 20, said Fritz's run to the New York final should give his peers the motivation they need to end the drought. 

 ""We've been hearing our whole lives how we haven't had a Grand Slam champion in so long,"" Paul added. 

 ""To have him in the finals there was huge for U.S. tennis, huge for him and for all of us in terms of belief. Seeing him there, we all believe we can be there. I think it's great for the sport."" 

 Paul, who reached the semi-finals of the Italian Open earlier this month, beat Elmer Moller 6-7 6-2 6-3 6-1 at the French Open on Sunday to book a clash with Marton Fucsovics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Inside Sinner's return: The stat that should scare the rest of the Tour","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/jannik-sinner-infosys-atp-beyond-the-numbers-may-2025","Sun, 25 May 2025 14:23:12 GMT","

Jannik Sinner went more than three months without match action before returning at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. The results were positive: the 23-year-old made the final at the Foro Italico for the first time. But what did we learn about Sinner's performance beyond wins and losses? 

An Infosys ATP Beyond The Numbers analysis shows that his return performance in Rome will raise the alarm for opponents.

Sinner won more than 39 per cent of his return games across his six matches in the Italian capital, which is well above his career average (27.6%), his average on clay (32.6%) and the 2024 season on clay (33%). More impressively, in his first five matches of the tournament, the four-time ATP Masters 1000 champion won 48 per cent of his return games.

Sinner On Return



But it is critical to perform your best under the brightest spotlight, which for Sinner was in the final against Carlos Alcaraz. With the trophy on the line, he did not break the Spaniard's serve once in 10 return games.

Nevertheless, for his first tournament after a period away from competition, it was a positive sign for the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. To put the effort into context, only one player has won close to the same rate of return games on clay this season and that is Alcaraz, with the exact same 39.3 winning percentage.



In just one tournament, Sinner performed well enough to lead the ATP Tour's 2025 clay leaderboard in first-serve return points won (40.8%) and second-serve return points won (57.8%). 

His second-serve return performance does not necessarily stand out compared to his typical output. Sinner, who has won 54 per cent of second-serve return points in his career, is known for his powerful baseline strokes. The usual second serve — a kick serve that sits up or a slower delivery to avoid a double fault — is like a beach ball for the Italian, who is always ready to pounce and take control.

What was impressive was his first-serve returning. After time away, it would have been understandable if it took time for him to get used to not only putting first deliveries back in play, but doing so well enough to eventually win the point. 

Sinner's Return Performance In Rome

The Rome finalist has won 35 per cent of first-serve return points on clay during his career. That means his first-serve returning success improved by more than 15 per cent in the Italian capital.

In five of his six matches, Sinner won more than 40 per cent of his first-serve return points. Entering the final, his win rate was 44 per cent. No player on record has broken the 40-per cent mark for his career on clay.

That does not mean there is not plenty of room for improvement, though. 

“For sure there are some things like we saw today [that] we have to improve if we want to do good in Paris,” Sinner said. “I am closer than expected in a way [for] everything. But in the other way, it was good. It was a great week for me. Some matches [went] incredibly well, some matches could be better. But this is tennis. It's a lot of ups and downs.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Meet Victoria Mboko, the teenager who just won't stop winning","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4261652/meet-victoria-mboko-the-teenager-who-just-wont-stop-winning","Sun, 25 May 2025 19:07:16 GMT","

With a 33–3 record in 2025, a growing toolkit, and a cool head, Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko has surged from the ITF circuit into the WTA spotlight.

ROME -- During a sunny afternoon on the terrace at the Foro Italico, Victoria Mboko pauses mid-sentence. Three tables away, a burst of chatter and laughter erupts -- and, in an instinctively Canadian moment, the teenager immediately apologizes.

But while the 18-year-old from Toronto is an unfailingly polite conversationalist, there's nothing apologetic about her imposing game -- or her phenomenal rise. Mboko began the year ranked No. 333, and in January, she headed off to play her first events of the season -- a pair of ITF W35s in the Caribbean. She won them both. And then she kept on winning, and winning. Her overall record in 2025 is an eye-catching 33 wins to just three losses; her ranking is up to No. 156.

The trophies mounted up -- from Rome, Georgia to Manchester, England to Porto, Portugal. Getting them home was a struggle -- the large metal plates frequently caused consternation at airport security. Mboko had started the year in a positive physical and mental state. 

""Just needed to be more confident in myself,"" she said.

Each match and tournament fed into a growing cycle of confidence. 

It didn't go unnoticed. Mboko received a Miami wild card, where she notched her first Top 100 win (and first tour-level victory), over Camila Osorio. She then pushed Paula Badosa all the way in a 7-5, 1-6, 7-6 (3) second-round barnburner.

This week, she made good on another wild card opportunity, defeating another pair of Top 100 players -- Cristina Bucsa and Kamilla Rakhimova -- to come through qualifying. A first-round defeat of wild card Arianna Zucchini has landed Mboko with a primetime date when she takes on No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the Friday night session on Centrale.

Mboko's qualifying wild card was a last-minute surprise -- she was training in Biarritz, France and preparing to play in an ITF event this week when she found out -- and she's giddy with excitement simply to be at a main tour event.

""Look around!"" she said. ""It's such great vibes. The facilities are so beautiful. I'm in Rome!""

But while Mboko's emergence has been so sudden that she still can't quite believe it, she's not here just to be a tourist. Get to know more about her below.

Mboko's first instincts on court are all about big hitting.

""I like to be very powerful and I like to take control of the point,"" she said. ""I like things at my own pace, I don't like people rushing me.""

But while some aggressive players lean into extreme versions of that style, Mboko is already learning a broader tennis philosophy.

""Not every match I'm going to be in control, so we also work a lot on my defensive game and counterpunching a lot,"" she said. ""I'm sure there are so many girls out there who can hit way harder than me, so to be able to move well is also very important. In order to take control, you gotta build it first, run a bit and have some stamina.""

Who better to teach a wider repertoire than Nathalie Tauziat, the serve-and-volleying former No. 3 who excelled on grass? Mboko first crossed paths with the Frenchwoman as a junior, when Tauziat worked with Tennis Canada. But it wasn't until this year that the 1998 Wimbledon finalist was specifically assigned to travel with her.

""I'm very used to her and she's very used to me,"" Mboko said. ""I feel very relaxed and calm with her.""

Tauziat has also been stretching Mboko tactically.

""She's pushing me more to use all aspects of my game, because that's how she used to play,"" Mboko said. ""I feel like she has been using her expertise very well -- she knows the game and she knows what I'm able to produce. Sometimes we work on my slices. She wants me to come more to the net and be more all-around, so that if any situation comes up in the match, I'm there and I'm prepared for it.""

Tauziat will also be a handy figure to have around when Mboko makes her Grand Slam qualifying debut at Roland Garros in just over two weeks' time. She reached the quarterfinals of her home major in 1991, and she'll be back on court this year for the Legends event.

""She's French, she knows the ambience,"" Mboko said.

Mboko is the youngest of four tennis-playing siblings. Her sister, Gracia, and oldest brother Kevin both competed at college level. Her other brother, David, had to stop due to eye problems. Given the sport's prominence in her family, it's not surprising that she first picked up a racquet at only 3 years old.

""I just remember watching them from the sidelines and not wanting to be left out,"" Mboko said.

Though she's now gone the furthest in the game of the four -- these days, Mboko's siblings are among her most valued supporters -- there's still a family pecking order that they haven't let her rectify.

""I've actually never beaten any of them,"" she said. ""I never like to lose a lot. I played my sister once in a tournament and I lost 0 and 0. I was absolutely devastated. They still hold that over me to this day!""

Mboko's parents, Cyprien Mboko and Godee Kitadi, emigrated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1999 because of political turmoil, but they've instilled a love of their heritage in their children. Mboko has yet to visit the DRC, but all her grandparents still live there and it's high on her bucket list. For the moment, her favorite means of appreciating the Congolese culture is via her mother's cooking -- particularly one dessert treat.

""Beignets are these little balls made out of dough -- it's a French translation of 'doughnut' -- and I could eat so many of them,"" Mboko said. ""For an athlete, they're not great to eat. But when I come home she always makes a bunch of them, because she never gets to see me.""

The Rogers Cup in Toronto was Mboko's home tournament growing up, and all of her first tennis memories involve it in some way.

""I remember going there as a kid and watching all the great players playing,"" Mboko said. ""We were watching a lot of Serena and Venus, and that's where I took a lot of inspiration, because Serena was literally the greatest of all time. I used to see how the pros are and I used to be in so much awe of them. And now I'm seeing them like right beside me. It's crazy how life works, it's such a great feeling.""

One particular pro isn't just competing alongside her, but offering her advice. Mboko calls 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, the first Canadian woman to win a major, an ""inspiration"" -- and an effusive Andreescu, who won her first-round match in Rome on the same day, repaid the kind words.

""I'm always rooting for Vicky,"" Andreescu said. ""I messaged her and said, 'Hey, if you want to talk, let me know.' At the end of the day, we're the only ones who can relate to each other, so if we can help each other that's the main thing. But she has a very strong game style, she's very aggressive and she can play defense. She's just starting out, so she's really hungry. It's going to be a great match [against Gauff].""

With a 33–3 record in 2025, a growing toolkit, and a cool head, Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko has surged from the ITF circuit into the WTA spotlight.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The Internationaux de Strasbourg draw is set. Top seed Jessica Pegula and four Grand Slam champions are in the mix at the year's last WTA 500 clay-court event.

The main draw for the year's final WTA 500 clay-court event, the Internationaux de Strasbourg, was revealed on Saturday.

Strasbourg: Draws | Scores | Order of play | Everything you need to know

World No. 4 Jessica Pegula is the top seed of the marquee field, which also includes Grand Slam champions Emma Raducanu, Elena Rybakina, Barbora Krejcikova and Sofia Kenin.

Just ahead of Roland Garros, the year's second Grand Slam, Strasbourg play begins on Sunday, May 18 and runs through the finals on Saturday, May 24.

The Top 4 seeds have first-round byes in the 28-player main draw.

Here is a quick breakdown of the main draw highlights:

Fourth-ranked Jessica Pegula comes in as the No. 1 seed and one of the winningest players on tour this year. She has won the second-most WTA main-draw matches in 2025 -- her 28 victories only trail Aryna Sabalenka's 34.

After her bye, Pegula will face either Anna Kalinskaya or a qualifier. Pegula is 0-2 in Strasbourg, having lost in the first round in 2019 and 2021.

At the other side of this quarter, No. 6 seed Daria Kasatkina will face wild card Emma Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion. Kasatkina heads into that meeting 3-0 against Raducanu.

The winner of that match will play the winner of an all-American clash between 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin and last year's Strasbourg runner-up Danielle Collins. Collins made the 2024 Strasbourg final before losing to Madison Keys.

One of the three Top 10 players in the field, World No. 10 Paula Badosa leads this quarter as the No. 3 seed. Badosa will be making her Strasbourg debut.

Badosa will face either Alizé Cornet or a qualifier in the second round. Wild card Cornet is back on tour after a year-long retirement, and this will be her first event on home soil since her return last month.

Liudmila Samsonova is the other seed in this quarter, and she will face Linda Noskova in the first round.

Elena Rybakina heads this quarter as the No. 4 seed and will face Wang Xinyu or a qualifier in the second round. 2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina was a Strasbourg finalist in 2020 before falling in the final to Elina Svitolina.

At the other end of this quarter is No. 7 seed Barbora Krejcikova, who will play her first match of the year after injuries kept her off court all season. The reigning Wimbledon champion brings a 3-0 head-to-head record into her first round vs. Magda Linette.

Krejcikova won her first WTA singles title at Strasbourg in 2021 -- then won her first Grand Slam singles title two weeks later at 2021 Roland Garros.

Two-time Strasbourg champion Elina Svitolina was here as the No. 5 seed, but she withdrew from the draw due to a lower back injury. 

Beatriz Haddad Maia slots into her spot in the draw as the No. 9 seed. World No. 22 Haddad Maia has a tough first-round match against No. 23 Clara Tauson, who is now the highest-ranked unseeded player in the draw.

World No. 9 Emma Navarro sits at the bottom of the draw as the No. 2 seed. A Strasbourg quarterfinalist in 2023, Navarro will face either Magdalena Frech or a qualifier in the second round.

The Internationaux de Strasbourg draw is set. Top seed Jessica Pegula and four Grand Slam champions are in the mix at the year's last WTA 500 clay-court event.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Sabalenka owned Madrid, and there's no reason to doubt what comes next","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4258560/sabalenka-owned-madrid-and-theres-no-reason-to-doubt-what-comes-next","Sun, 25 May 2025 12:31:18 GMT","

When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory.

And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. That equals the record total of Petra Kvitova and, not insignificantly, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as well.

Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. Sabalenka's earned that confidence because -- by an uncommonly wide margin -- she is the best player in the sport.

On Monday, the World No. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the PIF WTA Rankings. That gap is likely to grow. With Swiatek defending titles in Rome and Paris, she'll also be defending 3,000 points across the next month. And because Sabalenka missed Wimbledon last year, this year's result will be a ranking points windfall.

Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. 2 Madison Keys in the PIF Race to the WTA Finals in Riyadh. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players.

This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. How has her game evolved?

“I feel like she just got a lot better in everything,” Gauff said. “I think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.”

Examine the timeline and you'll find that the catalyst for all of this, oddly enough, was a loss.

Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. She left the Middle East in something of a funk, having lost an unheard of three of four matches.

But then, she rallied and reached four straight finals -- Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart and Madrid -- winning two of them. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances.

A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com:

Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome?

Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. And I think, February I was kind of trying to figure my way. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Kind of explains to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.

Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all … how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments?

Sabalenka: I'm super happy that I was able to bring the level in those key moments. Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. 

Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but … against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points?

Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game.

Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets – their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka … what do you think of that?

Sabalenka: I … don't know. I mean, they are legends. They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them … it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud.

Of all the ups and downs you've experienced, how good do you feel about your game right now?

Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. But I think the key for me was that I was always looking for something to improve. And now, still, I want to get better.

Three Madrid titles … the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?

Sabalenka: [Laughing]. I mean, in my mind, in my dreams, yes I can. But sometimes the reality is different. I will definitely go out there and compete and fight and see if my dream will be the same in real life.

Djokovic is just too good a player (it sounds surreal to say that), and too experienced, not to have a few more shots to fire across the bow of rivals. It would be a mistake to look beyond Mackie McDonald in the first round, especially in light of Djokovic's recent struggles. After that, the hype machine kicks in.

Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz, and Reilly Opelka all won junior major titles in 2015, this year marking the 10-year anniversary of Paul and Fritz's Roland Garros boy's singles final.

Pascal plays Reed Richards, aka Mister Fantastic, in the upcoming Marvel film.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Pedro Pascal had some competition for his Reed Richards, aka Mister Fantastic, role.


	During a recent conversation at MCM Comic Con, David Tennant was asked by a fan about which superhero he would like to play in a film, and he revealed that he had his eyes on the role Pascal ultimately landed in Marvel's forthcoming The Fantastic Four: First Steps.




	“In terms of superheroes, I did slightly have my eye on Reed Richards and unfortunately, it looks like they've gone in a different direction,” the Doctor Who star said. “Although if it has to be someone, I'm very happy for it to be Pedro Pascal, frankly.”

The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which hits theaters on July 25, also stars Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm, Julia Garner as the Silver Surfer and Ralph Ineson as Galactus. In the film, the Fantastic Four must defend Earth from a ravenous space god, Galactus, and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer, all while balancing their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond.


	Later during the MCM Comic Con chat, the moderator also asked Tennant if he had seen the viral Vanity Fair lie detector test video, where Pascal calls himself “the bigger daddy” compared to Oscar Isaac. After saying that he had yet to see it, she then said, “I was gonna ask you who's the bigger daddy, you or Pedro Pascal?”


	“What's the criteria?” the Broadchurch actor asked in response before adding, “I mean it will definitely be him, he's Mister Fantastic, so in every sense of the word. I think Pedro Pascal is great. I'm very, very pleased that he exists.”

The latest film from the Chilean director ('A Fantastic Woman,' 'The Wonder') is a musical drama inspired by a protest movement that swept Chile in 2018. 


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


	In 2019, a year after swells of protests swept through universities in Chile, a group of women, many of them blindfolded, took over the streets of Valparaiso, a coastal city in the country, to dance and sing a song that would go on to become an anthem. The performance was organized by LASTESIS, an interdisciplinary and trans-inclusive feminist collective, and it was their way of joining the global reach of the #MeToo movement. The lyrics to the song translated roughly to “A Rapist in Your Path” and even if you can't understand the words, the demonstration is powerful.

	There are similarly affecting scenes in Sebastián Lelio's The Wave, a spirited musical film about the 2018 university protests. The feature, which premiered at Cannes outside the main competition, chronicles the fictional experiences of a student named Julia (Daniela López), who wrestles with the realities of a recent sexual assault within the context of this burgeoning movement.

The Bottom Line

	
	A catchy anthem that at times rings hollow.
	



Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Cannes Premiere)Cast: Daniela López, Lola Bravo, Avril Aurora, Paulina CortésDirector: Sebastián LelioScreenwriters: Sebastián Lelio, Manuela Infante, Josefina Fernández, Paloma Salas

								2 hours 9 minutes			






The Wave is an ambitious spectacle, with Lelio (A Fantastic Woman, The Wonder) combining energetic songs and dance sequences with surrealist touches to tell a story of women's empowerment. Aesthetic flourishes abound, which make it an entertaining viewing experience, but one does wish that the narrative was a touch more complex. Lelio embeds some compelling meta-textual moments — ones that mostly address that fact that he's a man tackling this subject — but the actual story of Julia can feel secondary to the melodic pageantry.


	Still, with the stateside popularity of Emilia Perez, which premiered at Cannes last year, The Wave could find a meaningful audience in the U.S. should it get distribution. Lelio's film is more coherent in its politics than it is dramatically, and could resonate on that level with younger arthouse viewers. 


	When we meet Julia, she's going home with her TA, Max (Lucas Sáez Collins). How their evening ends remains a mystery (Lelio films the couple stumbling into Max's apartment and the door closing to us), but it haunts Julia. The following day at school, the women and nonbinary students marshal their peers to join a demonstration condemning how the university handles sexual assault cases. The protests takes the school by storm, and soon more women feel empowered to speak up about their experiences.

	











	Julia, somewhat reluctantly, joins the organizing efforts and becomes a member of a working group tasked with collecting survivor testimonies. Hearing all of these testimonies, which Lelio stitches together with the help of editor Soledad Salfate, compels Julia to come forward with her own story. 


The Wave, which was written by Lelio, Manuela Infante, Josefina Fernández and Paloma Sala, tackles many aspects of the #MeToo movement — and dynamics within organizing communities more broadly — with good intentions. That said, the results can be shaky. Part of the issue stems from the fact that Julia isn't a sturdy enough anchor; her character at times feels flat. 


	The university student initially struggles to speak up because she's working-class and on scholarship, while her assaulter comes from relative wealth. There's a compelling thread concerning these class differences, as well as the fact that Max considers himself to be a good guy. This complicates the otherwise straightforward narrative by imbuing it with higher stakes. One wishes that The Wave further embraced this type of gray area and the challenges that crop up in real-world cases involving sexual violence. 


	Unfortunately, for the most part, especially early on, The Wave sticks to the surface, offering a story that can feel like Feminism 101. There's also an overplayed metaphor about using one's voice that tips into cliché over the course of this 2-hour-plus film. To his credit, Lelio does take more risks in the second half of The Wave, when he breaks the fourth wall and adds surrealist touches that effectively blur the lines between Julia's reality and her memories. 

	











	In an exciting turn, the director also focuses on tensions that form within organizing communities because of competing goals or comfort levels with certain actions. Julia eventually falls into a sororal relationship with Rafa (Lola Bravo), Luna (Avril Aurora) and Tamara (Paulina Cortés), three other women who encourage her to confront her memories and report Max to university administrators. 


	Even when it falls short, The Wave boasts a commitment to its entrancing maximalist aesthetics (Benjamín Echazarreta serves as DP, Estefanía Larraín is the production designer and Muriel Parra does costumes). Lelio gathers an ensemble of more than 100 performers to stage dramatic dances (with choreography by Ryan Heffington) to rousing musical selections (music is by Matthew Herbert) about the difficulty of speaking up as a survivor, the manipulative tactics used by assailants, as well as the violent ineptitude of university administrators. The big numbers are anthemic, and just as affecting as LASTESIS' enduring protest song.

	Keith Caulfield



Morgan Wallen's latest studio effort, I'm the Problem, debuts atop the Billboard 200 chart (dated May 31) with the year's biggest week for any album — 493,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending May 22, according to Luminate. It also easily lands the largest streaming week for any album in 2025.

	It's the third No. 1 for Wallen on the Billboard 200, following 2023's One Thing at a Time (19 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1) and 2021's Dangerous: The Double Album (10 weeks at No. 1, all consecutive). The latter two titles both debuted at No. 1 and have never left the weekly top 50 of the chart. On the latest chart, One Thing at a Time is a non-mover at No. 4 (making Wallen the only act with two concurrent albums in the weekly top five in 2025), while Dangerous shifts 11-12.

I'm the Problem was officially announced in mid-March, and was preceded by eight charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100 over the past 10 months, all of which reached the top 20 of the ranking, including six top 10s (the most top 10s ever from an album prior to its release). Among them were the No. 1 “Love Somebody,” which debuted atop the list last November, and the album's title track (No. 2 in February).




			Trending on Billboard		







	Also in the latest Billboard 200 top 10, Jin notches his highest-charting effort as Echo launches at No. 3. The BTS member previously hit the top 10 as a soloist with Happy (No. 4) in 2024.


	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new May 31, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on May 28, one day later than usual due to the Memorial Day holiday in the U.S. on May 26. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	Of I'm the Problem's 493,000 first-week equivalent album units, SEA units comprise 357,000 (equaling 462.63 million on-demand official streams of the set's 37 tracks; it debuts at No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 133,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 3,000.

	











I'm the Problem is the fifth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2025, of 14 total, to also simultaneously be No. 1 on both Top Album Sales and Top Streaming Albums, following Sleep Token's Even in Arcadia (May 24), Lady Gaga's MAYHEM (March 22), Kendrick Lamar's GNX (Feb. 22) and The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow (Feb. 15).


I'm the Problem captures 2025's biggest week by equivalent album units earned. The last bigger week was the opening frame of Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department over a year ago. It bowed at No. 1 with 2.61 million units on the May 4, 2024-dated chart.


	With 357,000 SEA units equaling 462.63 million on-demand official streams of I'm the Problem's 37 tracks, the set logs the largest streaming week of 2025 for any album, and the biggest since The Tortured Poets Department's first week, which snared 891.37 million. I'm the Problem also tallies the second-biggest streaming week ever for any country album, trailing only the opening week of Wallen's last album, One Thing at a Time, which bowed with 498.28 million clicks.


	Meanwhile, with 133,000 copies sold in its first week, I'm the Problem captures Wallen's biggest sales week ever, the biggest sales week for any country album in 2025 and the fourth-largest sales frame in 2025 among all albums. The last country set to post a bigger sales week was Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter, when it debuted with 168,000 sold (April 13, 2024-dated chart). I'm the Problem's sales were helped by its availability on vinyl in its first week. Wallen's last album, One Thing at a Time, didn't get its vinyl release until its fourth week on sale.


	During its first week, I'm the Problem was available to purchase across five vinyl variants (standard black vinyl, a “first pressing” black vinyl, bone white-colored, coke bottle clear-colored [all exclusively sold in Wallen's webstore] and a Target-exclusive opaque brown-color edition with a collectible insert), four CD variants (standard, a deluxe boxed set containing a branded T-shirt, a signed CD and a Target-exclusive edition with a collectible insert) and a standard digital download. All variations of the album had the same 37 tracks. All told, of I'm the Problem's first-week sales, digital downloads comprise 51,000, vinyl comprise 48,000 (Wallen's best week on vinyl ever, and the largest week for a country album in 2025) and CDs comprise 34,000.

	











SZA's chart-topping SOS rises one spot to No. 2 on the latest Billboard 200, earning 47,000 equivalent album units — down 8%.


	Jin nabs his highest-charting effort on the Billboard 200 as Echo arrives at No. 3. It's the second charting solo set for the BTS member, who previously hit the chart with the No. 4-peaking Happy in November 2024.


Echo debuts with 43,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, album sales comprise 35,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 6,000 (equaling 8.92 million of the album's tracks) and TEA units comprise 2,000. Echo's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across 13 CD variants (all have the standard seven-song tracklist and contain collectible branded paper ephemera) and five download album variants (a standard wide version, a version exclusive to Jin's webstore containing a bonus voice memo track and three widely available deluxe editions each containing two different remixes of the album's “Don't Say You Love Me”).


	Nos. 4-9 on the new Billboard 200 are all former No. 1s. Wallen's One Thing at a Time is steady at No. 4 (42,000 equivalent album units; down 13%); Kendrick Lamar's GNX rises 7-5 (41,000; down 5%); Sleep Token's Even in Arcadia falls 1-6 in its second week (38,000; down 70%); Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet steps 8-7 (just over 37,000; down 6%); PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake's $ome $exy $ongs 4 U drops 5-8 (37,000; down 21%); and Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos climbs 10-9 (nearly 37,000; down 3%).


	Fuerza Regida's 111XPANTIA closes out the top 10, falling 6-10 with 32,000 equivalent album units earned (down 26%).

	Alejandro Sanz is on the cover of Billboard, and the Spanish singer shares how his new song with Shakira, “Bésame,” came to life. 


	Read the full story here.


	Narrator:


	How do Alejandro Sanz and Shakira write a song? Alejandro Sanz, the Spanish idol, reunited with his friend Shakira to write “Bésame,” the lead single from his new album ‘¿Y Ahora Qué?' Shakira and Sanz were unable to meet in the studio to record the song because both have incredibly busy schedules. As a result, the composition and recording process took place long-distance. Given that both artists are perfectionists, the WhatsApp conversations were “intense,” says Sanz.


	Sanz spoke exclusively with Billboard for the cover story of Billboard Español and shared how it was to work with Shakira, Grupo Frontera and Manuel Turizo. He also talked about his new tour and the process of creating an album that has reignited his enthusiasm and passion, making him feel great again.

Former talk show host Rosie O'Donnell is showing off her dramatic weight loss in a new Instagram post.

The former moderator of “The View” and star of her self-named talk show posted the picture on May 23 showing a much slimmed-down figure. She's wearing dark pants and a light green sweater and appears to be a standing on a stage talking into a microphone. In the caption, she writes, “i cant believe this is me now #mounjaro #weightloss #bodydismorphia“

A post shared by Rosie O'Donnell (@rosie)

One of the hashtags in the post references the injectable weight loss drug Mounjaro that has been used by a number of celebrities to lose weight, including Meghan Trainor and Elon Musk.

In an earlier TikTok video, Rosie referenced losing weight since beginning the drug for her type two diabetes. But she also credited no longer employing a chef since moving from Los Angeles to Dublin, Ireland several months ago, saying she now does all the cooking.

In another TikTok video on March 11, 2025, she revealed to fans that she and her daughter Clay had moved to Ireland saying, “I moved here on January 15. It's been pretty wonderful, I have to say. The people are so loving and so kind, so welcoming. And I'm very grateful.”

O'Donnell says she's in the process of getting her Irish citizenship, and in fact has Irish grandparents. In a recent video, she talked about having cousins who live in Northern Ireland.

The 63-year-old has continued her comedy career in her newfound home. According to her Instagram account, she has a number of shows coming up at International Bar on Wicklow Street in Dublin.

The comedian has said she's had to go shopping in Dublin to get new clothes that “fit better” after her weight loss. But her new look is taking some time to get used to.

“I'm one of those people who always had a weight issue and now that I'm a size large — instead of an XL or a XXL — I find it shocking,” she told her TikTok followers. “I really do. I find it completely shocking.”

							By 

	Peter Wade



	Federal judges, worried that the president could withdraw the U.S. marshals protecting them in retaliation for ruling against his administration, are considering managing their own security force as threats to the judiciary are rising.


The Wall Street Journal reports that judges discussed the idea of creating their own security detail behind closed doors at the semiannual meeting of the Judicial Conference, national policymaking body for the federal courts, in early March. Security committee members described increased threats in the wake of Trump's attacks.


	The judiciary's fears of Trump's reprisal are not unfounded. The president has withdrawn security protection in the past from those he perceives as his enemies, including his former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and former national security advisor John Bolton. Trump also recently ended Secret Service protection for former president Joe Biden's adult children.


	Democrats in Congress share the judges' concern. Led by Sen. Cory Booker, they introduced a bill last week that would transfer control of the U.S. Marshals from the executive to the judicial branch, allowing the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Judicial Conference to appoint a director.

	











	“President Trump has made it abundantly clear through his words and actions that he does not respect the law, court orders, the safety of our judges, or our institutions,” Booker said in a statement. “Congress must act to move the bureau into the judicial branch. Our U.S. Marshals are critical to protecting the rule of law, and they must be able to do their jobs without political interference.”


	According to a Reuters investigation, at least 11 federal judges' families have dealt with threats of violence or harassment following rulings against the Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth has received several death threats to his house. Someone sent a SWAT team to the home of U.S. District Judge Judge John Coughenour after he overturned one of Trump's executive orders, the Journal reported. An email to Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett's sister claimed a pipe bomb was in her mailbox, although that message turned out to be a hoax. Police said that other households related to Barrett have received attempted pizza deliveries. Many judges and their families have experienced harassment in the form of pizza deliveries to their homes, which they interpret as a message that their detractors know where they live. According to a Reuters investigation, at least 11 federal judges' families have dealt with threats of violence or harassment following rulings against the Trump administration.

	Threats to judges and their families “are ultimately threats to constitutional government. It's as simple as that,” U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan told Reuters.


	Top figures on the far right — including the president, Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, and Republican lawmakers — have openly attacked judges and their families when judges have issued rulings against the administration. 


	The Trump administration has even targeted a judge directly, arresting Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan under the accusation she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested that Dugan is “deranged” and believes herself to be “above the law.”


	A Justice Department official said that federal marshals “will continue to protect the safety and security of federal judges.”


	“Any suggestion to the contrary is not only absurd but wrong,” the official said in a statement to the Journal from the White House.

	Despite rising threats, funding and staffing for the U.S. Marshals has remained stagnant over the last several years. Courthouse security also needs more funding, judges told the Journal. 


	Threats toward prosecutors and judges have been escalating ever since the 2020 presidential election. Death threats, intimidation, doxxing, and harassment are becoming increasingly commonplace. Ronald Davis, a former director of the U.S. Marshals, told ABC News in February that threats against judges have grown at an “alarming rate.” 


	According to data from the U.S. Marshals, the number of judges receiving threats more than doubled between 2019 and 2024. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote of “a significant uptick in identified threats at all levels of the judiciary” in his 2024 year-end report. Since then, Trump and his acolytes have only increased their ire toward the judiciary as judges issue rulings against the administration's immigration policies, attempts to decimate the federal bureaucracy, and more.

	Anti-judicial rhetoric online rose by 327 percent between May 2024 and March 2025, according to a study by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) published earlier this month. The study's findings “suggest that a rise in anti-democratic language from prominent American figures on the far right likely influenced extremists on social media to also attack the judiciary, leading to large increases in violent language and calls for impeachment targeting judges on several platforms.”

	











	Threats against the judiciary on TikTok, GPAHE found in a study published in March, increased by 90 percent in the first two months of this year. Threats on Truth Social, the platform owned by the president, nearly doubled (94 percent increase).

	“The America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” Bruce Springsteen declared from a Manchester, U.K. stage May 14. At the kick-off show of his newly rechristened Land of Hope and Dreams Tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen framed his criticism of Donald Trump in patriotism: “The America that I've sung to you about for 50 years is real, and regardless of its faults, is a great country with a great people. And we will survive this moment.” 
















	As discussed in the latest episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, Springsteen's multiple onstage speeches, punctuated with on-message songs (“Land of Hope and Dreams,” Bob Dylan's “Chimes of Freedom”) were arguably a masterclass in opposition messaging. His insistence on the existence of another, better version of the country should be instructive to many floundering Democrats — especially considering the extent to which his words captured Donald Trump's attention. To hear the whole episode, which breaks down the Trump/Springsteen war of words and much more, go here for the podcast provider of your choice, listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or just press play above. 


	Two days after Springsteen's remarks, Trump took to Truth Social to call his critic a “dried out prune of a rocker” whose “skin is all atrophied” and warned him to “KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country,” with the ominous addendum, “then we'll all see how it goes for him!” The threats escalated at 1:34 a.m. May 19, the night before his scheduled call with Vladimir Putin about Ukraine, “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” he wrote. “I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter.”

	Trump also demanded investigations into Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey, and somehow even Bono — who, as Rolling Stone‘s Andy Greene points out in the new episode, “played no role in the election whatsoever.” As discussed in the episode, Trump had it backwards: campaigns are actually required to pay fair market value for production costs to avoid undisclosed contributions. (When Rolling Stone asked the White House about the baseless threats this week, a spokesperson shot back, “accountability for a class of people who act as if they're above the law may be uncomfortable for Rolling Stone, but it's refreshing to the American people.”)


	Of course, it wasn't just Springsteen's eloquent framing of his opposition that irritated Trump — as his inclusion of Swift, Beyoncé, and Winfrey in his threats suggests, he is a creature of fame and showbiz who is exquisitely sensitive to the power of celebrity. He's won two elections, but still faces the irksome reality that pop culture is far from still fully MAGA-fied.

	The episode also ponders why musicians have been relatively quiet about the Trump Administration since January, suggesting a combination of an atmosphere of fear, a sense that 2017-style Resistance messaging failed, and the fact that it's still more socially acceptable for younger acts to criticize Democrats from the left than to mention Trump. Still, artists including Neil Young and Eddie Vedder have offered support for Springsteen's remarks, and MJ Lenderman covered “Darkness on the Edge of Town” in an apparent show of solidarity.

The object was initially spotted flying over Colombia on March 2

 Scientists are currently studying a mysterious sphere that they believe to be an unidentified flying object (UFO).


 The metal item was initially spotted flying over Buga, Colombia, on March 2, before later being recovered in the area, according to a video from scientists that was shared online.


 Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers studying the sphere, said the mysterious object appears to have ""no welds or joints” — both of which would typically indicate human manufacturing. The sphere also appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface, he added.


 Velazquez and his team said they used an X-ray on the object and found that it consists of three layers of metal, along with nine “microspheres” in the interior.


 “It is a very rare piece … I've never seen a piece like this,” Velazquez said.


Getty

 Julia Mossbridge — a member of the University of San Diego Department of Physics and Biophysics, and the founder of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT) — told Fox News that she is skeptical of the sphere's origins.


 ""It looks to me like a really cool art project,"" she told the outlet.


 ""Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project,"" Mossbridge continued, referring to the international research project founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to vet and study potential extraterrestrial artifacts through rigorous scientific research. 


 The researcher added that similar findings might say more about the current state of humanity than about the universe at large.


 “We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had,"" she told Fox News. “If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us.”


 And while Mossbridge is skeptical of the recent find in Colombia, she doesn't necessarily believe that all UFO sightings or artifacts are a hoax.


 “Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them,” she said.


 Mossbridge also stressed the importance of using non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP studies.


 “They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things,” she said. 


 “Because, for instance, the sphere in Colombia is in a different country. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?” added Mossbridge.


 In a statement to PEOPLE, Mossbridge also said: ""The natural human response to the unknown is fear. But we need to start noticing that fear doesn't actually keep us safe; what keeps us safe is the willingness to understand and explore what is really going on — and to react appropriately to what we discover.""


 ""That willingness is supported by self-transcendence, the ability to look beyond ourselves and recognize that there are things that are bigger than us,"" she continued.

Listen to Story

Scientists have uncovered a mysterious sphere in Colombia that has sparked widespread speculation about its possible extraterrestrial origin. The sphere was first spotted flying over the town of Buga on March 2, according to social media page Truthpole, before it landed.

Researcher Jose Luis Velazquez, who is studying the three-layered object, pointed out that the sphere shows “no welds or joints”, features typically associated with human manufacture. This detail has strengthened his belief that the sphere might be of alien origin.

However, Julia Mossbridge, founder and board chair of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT) and a physicist at the University of San Diego, expressed scepticism about the sphere's extraterrestrial claims. Speaking to Fox News, Mossbridge described the object as “a really cool art project” and urged caution before jumping to conclusions. 

She framed the discovery as part of a larger challenge for humanity to confront its limitations. “We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had,” Mossbridge told Fox News, adding that past “grandiose” beliefs in total mastery often blind people when something “doesn't fit our model of the world”.

Mossbridge also highlighted that sightings of unexplained objects have persisted for decades. “Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them,” she said.

She praised various groups, including the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies, the UAP Disclosure Fund, and the Galileo Project, for their efforts to gather rigorous information about these phenomena. “They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government,” Mossbridge further said.

The physicist raised questions about international cooperation, noting that the sphere was found in Colombia, which introduces complexities about how such discoveries are handled globally.

Mossbridge acknowledged that experts can determine if the material is “clearly non-human-made”. While she remains doubtful about the Buga sphere's alien origins, she emphasised that this does not discount the existence of other objects of extraterrestrial origin.With inputs from Fox NewsPublished By: Akshat TrivediPublished On: May 25, 2025ALSO READ |  Mysterious sphere discovered in Colombia, sparks UFO debate

The patio at Joe T. Garcia's in Fort Worth is a popular celebrity hot spot. The most recent guest to stop by the popular restaurant is Jared Padalecki, the native Texan (and current Austin resident) famous for his stints on “Supernatural,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Walker” and “Fire Country.”

Padalecki was spotted on the patio, and Joe T.'s posted the photo on Facebook on Saturday, May 24.

“You never know who you might run into at Joe T's … even a Texas heartthrob like Jared Padalecki,” the Joe T. Garcia's Facebook post reads. “From iconic margaritas to Hollywood moments, there's always something special in the air on our patio.

“Thanks for stopping by, Jared, come back anytime!”

Padalecki's ties to Texas run deep — he was born and raised in San Antonio, owns a home in Austin and co-owns several Austin businesses. He also supported Beto O'Rourke for the 2018 Senate election in Texas, as did his “Supernatural” co-stars Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins. You can currently see Padalecki as SoCal firefighter Camden Casey in season 3 of “Fire Country” on CBS.

Padalecki is in talks to star in a “Fire Country” spinoff, tentatively called “Fire Country: Surfside.”

Padalecki is teaming up with his “Walker” executive producer/showrunner Anna Fricke to develop an untitled, hour-long medical drama about rural medicine, set in Texas, according to Deadline. Padalecki will star as “a headstrong, devoted country doctor who practices his unique style of improvisational medicine alongside his new protégé, a young doctor running from her past, as they operate a mobile clinic and heal the bodies and souls of their underserved community in the medical desert of rural Texas,” according to the description.

It got me thinking about something I read some time ago about a Merkaba being a ‘vehicle' for the soul to enter and travel about in our world. Interested to have the communities thoughts and also if anyone can share more on the Merkaba / UAP link.

Some states are allowing private companies to decide which people in prison are allowed to contact their family members.

Some states' departments of corrections are outsourcing to private companies their decision-making about who can and who cannot communicate with people in their prisons. These decisions cut families and loved ones off, sometimes permanently.

The Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) has said it does not maintain any records of who has been blocked from communications with people incarcerated in the state. According to the department, these lists are maintained by the private company Securus, which manages phone, e-messaging and video calls for the state.

In a denial of an open records request submitted by Truthout, the department said: “The records you request from the Securus messaging system are not public records, created, used or maintained by the department and; therefore, are not disclosable under the Public Records Act, RCW 42.56. You may submit your request directly to Securus.” Neither Securus nor its parent company Aventiv responded to any requests from Truthout for further information.

As a private company, Securus is not subject to open records laws in Washington State or anywhere else in the U.S. Prisons are public agencies, and increasing privatization of communications options has contributed to decreased transparency.

People in prison exist in a state of highly restricted communication with the outside world. They cannot have cellphones or access the internet. They can place outgoing phone calls but cannot receive calls, and they can exchange e-messages accessed at a kiosk or on an individual tablet. Unlike email, each of these messages costs money to send and they require both parties to have an account with the messaging service.

Phone and messaging services in prisons across the country are managed by private companies like Aventiv and Global Tel Link. These companies charge people in prison and their loved ones up to 50 cents per message for their services. Out of these fees, they also often offer a commission back to the prison itself, creating a system in which both the state and the private company make money off some of the poorest people in the U.S.

The same companies provide video call services (also for a fee), which in many facilities have been allowed to replace in-person visitation. Increasingly, the ability to receive snail mail from loved ones has been restricted as well; since 2017, at least 16 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons have moved to scanning all incoming mail and providing recipients with the electronic scan in lieu of the original paper. People in prison have spoken extensively about how they are harmed by this practice, which eliminates the smells and physical traces of their loved ones from letters and replaces it with a sometimes inadequate scan. Mail scanning creates a massive surveillance database, with few companies offering clarity on what happens to the private data collected or how long it is retained.

In all forms of communication, prison staff insist they “have to know who's on the other end,” Jim Kopriva, spokesperson for the Washington Department of Corrections, told Truthout. From the prison's perspective, such monitoring is critical to catching and squashing criminal enterprises that are conducted from within the prison walls. This is why most prisons have strict rules prohibiting any third-party contact, meaning relaying a message to or from another person who is not directly on the phone, message or visit.

Knowing who is “on the other end” means the prison also maintains control over who can (and cannot) communicate with people in prison. Certain people outside the prison are blocked from communicating directly, as a result of rule violations, court orders and sometimes even administrative mistakes.

Without notification from the prison about what rules have been violated and what remedies are available, people can find themselves permanently blocked from contact with a loved one behind bars.

Take third-party contact: Since incarceration disproportionately impacts Black and poor communities, it is likely that many people know more than one person in prison. Prison rules in Washington (DOC policy 200.00) dictate that outside supporters can only deposit money to one account, punishing those with more than one loved one inside. The rule forces people to choose who they can support or risk running afoul of the rules and being blocked altogether.

Similarly, nonprofits and advocates who communicate with large rosters of people in prison, often sharing vital information or doing essential newsgathering, are open to being blocked altogether if prison officials decide that their activities constitute third-party contact.

The privatization of communications increases the risk of people being blocked with very little oversight. These companies directly advertise a set of automated tools to more effectively surveil and control communications. The contract between Securus and the Washington Department of Corrections, for example, says Securus offers software benefits such as the Threads application which “allows authorized users to analyze corrections and communications data to generate targeted investigative leads,” and the “Investigator Pro” application which “help[s] investigators find correlations among calls.”

One prison staffer familiar with mail review procedures told Truthout that a lot of communication bans come “from the company itself doing it instead of the facility doing it…. Most people that were restricted come down to the company JPay actually restricting them.”

The staff member, who spoke anonymously in order to protect their job, added that as a corrections officer reviewing e-messages, “I couldn't even see who was restricted and who wasn't restricted.”

The process that occurs when someone is blocked is opaque. People on the outside are not always notified by the DOC when there is a problem, and there is no clear appeal process for those not within the system. Emails obtained by Truthout show officials at the Washington DOC acknowledging that the gap in their notification process is a problem, but Kopriva said he was not aware of any updated processes.

Without notification, people on the outside find that their messaging accounts just suddenly stop working. Answers from Aventiv, the parent company of both JPay and Securus, are very hard to come by. Typical of corporate helpdesks, these companies offer generic email addresses and 1-800 numbers for customers with any issue, including being blocked. Most responses are automated, and human assistance is tricky to obtain. In this author's experience, for example, the only way to be directed to a live person on the JPay helpline appeared to be pressing buttons on the automated phone tree for at least three minutes.

Without notification from the prison about what rules have been violated and what remedies are available, people can find themselves permanently blocked from contact with a loved one behind bars. The ability to communicate with loved ones, whether birth family or otherwise, has critical mental health impacts for those in prison and can even decrease violence within the prison. Permanently blocking contact with someone in the outside world can be extremely damaging, yet prisons are allowing private companies to do just that.

Kopriva says the Washington Department of Corrections does everything it can to promote a “core mission of rehabilitation,” and that “includes contact with the outside world and loved ones and support networks.” This must be balanced, he told Truthout, with “interrupting negative behavior,” and particularly reducing drug trafficking in the prison.

Kopriva says drug-running is the main reason that people who want to be in touch are blocked, citing specifically the skyrocketing rate of overdoses as a main concern. But others argue that there are many other actions the department could take to more effectively curb overdoses and drug use inside.

A recent piece in the Prison Journalism Project describes addiction treatment in Washington State prisons as “scarce and confusing.” Treatment programs that are advertised are often hard to access in practice, with extremely limited availability. Another prison journalist, writing for Filter magazine, reported on the repeated failure of guards in his Washington State prison to use Narcan to reverse overdoses. The failures were due to a false belief that Narcan is not effective in the case of a fentanyl overdose (it is), lack of Narcan availability and a general hesitancy on the part of guards to administer the drug themselves.

In his discussion with Truthout, Kopriva highlighted Suboxone abuse as a major problem in prison. This is itself a demonstration of the prison's focus on control rather than safety and well-being: Suboxone is the prescription medication used to treat opioid addiction. It does not lead to overdoses, because it contains naloxone (Narcan) within it.

Prison staff have a long history of overstating the benefits of mail scanning and other severe limitations to communication while providing little evidence of their success. A Prison Policy Initiative report shows that there is no solid evidence that mail scanning limits the flow of drugs or decreases the risks of overdose. Meanwhile, addiction treatment beyond peer-support groups in prisons is exceedingly scarce across the United States.

As with book-banning, drugs are a justification that can be used to paper over communication bans issued for all kinds of reasons. Outsourcing these decisions to private companies eliminates the transparency and public accountability that can limit prisons from targeting activists and outspoken family members, or engaging in other forms of retaliation.

MONACO (AP) — Lando Norris realized a childhood dream as he won the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday, and boosted his chances of achieving an even bigger goal, the Formula 1 title. 

Norris took his first Grand Prix win since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix — though he did win a sprint race in Miami this month — and reduced his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri's lead from 13 points to three.

Starting on pole position, Norris locked up a wheel into the first corner but still managed to hold off last year's winner, Charles Leclerc of Ferrari.

“It feels amazing. It's a long, grueling race, but good fun,” Norris said. “This is what I dream of. This is what I did dream of when I was a kid.”

Leclerc was second after closing in on Norris late in the race — though he wasn't able to attempt a pass — while Piastri was third and defending champion Max Verstappen fourth, with seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton a distant fifth.

Verstappen was the leader on track until the second-to-last lap but only because he had yet to make his mandatory second pit stop under a rule change introduced in an attempt to spice up the Monaco Grand Prix, where overtaking is almost impossible. 

Verstappen was almost certain to end the race fourth, no matter when he stopped, so he eased off, slowing down Norris and allowing Leclerc and Piastri to catch up. Verstappen seemed to be trying to pressure Norris into a costly mistake, or maybe hoping for a red-flag stoppage which could have allowed him a free tire change while keeping the lead.




Norris said the end of the race was a “little bit nervous with Charles close behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco, so it doesn't matter how you win, I guess.”

Despite predictions it could allow some teams and drivers to spring a surprise, the rule had little overall impact on the results, except for a few cases of teams seemingly slowing down one car to benefit a teammate. 

“We lost the race yesterday,” was Leclerc's verdict, referring to the importance of qualifying on pole in Monaco, his home race.

It was McLaren's record-extending 16th win in Monaco and its first since a victory for a young Lewis Hamilton in 2008. Hamilton went on to win his first championship that year.

McLaren leaves Monaco with six wins from the first eight races of 2025 as its two drivers battle for the title. Even with just a third of the season gone, a second successive constructors' title for McLaren looks all but assured, as the team's 319 points are more than double the total of any other team.

Piastri was on the podium for the second year running in Monaco, and being disappointed with third was a sign of the progress he's made in those 12 months. Second place a year ago was only the third career podium finish for the Australian, who had yet to win a Grand Prix. Third place Sunday was Piastri's seventh podium finish in a row.

“If this is a bad weekend,” Piastri said, “then it's not going too badly at all.”

The bare walls of my bedroom—bedecked as they are with sporadic small prints but devoid of lights—demand I add some flair to my usually nerdy living space. The Govee Gaming Pixel Light seemed to fit the bill a little too well when I saw it back at CES 2025. The specialized display doesn't support enough colors to show all my favorite 8- or 16-bit artwork at their best quality, and it won't produce strong enough audio for anything more complicated than classic chiptunes. If the digital art and speaker for my desk didn't sport cringey decals and a frame that would make visitors assume I chugged Mountain Dew Game Fuel for breakfast, it would be the perfect antidote to my dull apartment.

Govee sent me a pair of pre-release Gaming Pixel Lights long before the company finally made them available on May 19. It sat on my desk for ages, showing me a 32-pixel version of Samus from Super Metroid. Her staunch, visored visage helped me get through the hectic days. Both the $120 32×32 and $140 52×32 pixel frames don't take much effort to set up, though the digital wall or desk art lacks a battery and needs to be plugged into an outlet. Once it's connected through the Govee Home app, you'll have a wide variety of default and user-made effects to add to the screen. Yes, you can stick a static image on the screen, but the real fun comes from displaying GIFs of scenes from your favorite 8-, 16-, or perhaps a few 32-bit retro games.

Govee Gaming Pixel Light

It does what it needs to do, but limited colors limits what it can show.

Pros

Cons

Depending on how complicated your image is, the pixel light may have a harder time displaying every pixel with perfect color accuracy. The smaller device contains 1,024 lights, while the 52×32 version sports 1,664. The $155 Divoom Pixoo-64—a competing pixel light with a 64×64 pixel field—supports 4,096. Considering the limited lights, a 32×32 pixel image of ET might look great on the smaller Pixel Light, but a fan-made 8-bit portrait of Arielle from The Little Mermaid that appears fine on my phone lacked the color definition necessary to show fine features on her nose or hair. The more stark the colors, the better each image or GIF will appear. The screen is bright enough on its highest settings, but you can set it to dim or turn off on a timer if you want to sleep without a rainbow of pixelated light shining at you.

Images look marginally better on the larger display thanks to its wider range of colors, but you'll still need to try out various images until you find one that fits your style. You can also upload your own artwork to the Govee app, though any of your photos you take from your phone will turn out splotchy and incoherent on the Pixel Light. You may find that uploading your own pixel art could produce mixed results. I had to try several different versions of Samus before I found a Metroid image that didn't look half bad. The GIFs play at 30 fps, which made a GIF of Sonic's classic spinning leg running animation look extra smooth. Divoom's similar offering runs at 24 fps.

The device includes a rear 3W DSP speaker made for pairing your favorite chiptunes with this artwork. The built-in speakers aren't enough to fill a room with sound, but even without much bass, it's just enough to offer a retro feel, as if I was listening to a game on the age-old mono Game Boy speaker. The device itself has a single button for controlling volume and no physical mute button, which means you're forced to load into the app just to adjust your sound. All this meant I was more likely to eschew music entirely. After all, if you're planning to use your Govee Pixel Light to spruce up your gaming room, you'll end up listening to the game you're playing anyway.

If you're the type to pick up a brush, you could create your own art and animated GIFs with the sketch mode. It's certainly easier to use with a stylus, but I don't have the time, patience, or ability to sketch something that will look any nicer than the artists who do pixel art for a living. The device has almost too many modes, from a clock feature to a stock ticker. There's even a counter to tell you the current price of bitcoin, as if you really need to pay attention to crypto prices on your fun, cute pixel monitor.

The Pixel Light seems to think gamers want a very specific aesthetic, one full of cyberpunk-esque hard-edged contours with decals reading “loading” and “game.” A black frame is all I really need. The art is the reason you buy Govee's first real gamer product. But damn me if I enjoy it blaring the Magmar Caverns theme from my desktop, as if my bedroom had any more need for even more Metroid artwork.

Musetti has been in strong form on clay, reaching at least the semifinals in the past three Masters tournaments at Rome, Madrid and Monte Carlo, where he lost in the final to four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz. But he was hampered by a right-leg injury in that match.Musetti did not look troubled on Sunday, however, and cupped his ear to the crowd after making an improbable forehand winner down the line from Hanfmann's drop shot during the third set.After winning his match, Musetti got a huge ovation from the crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier.Was it because Musetti won Italy's first Olympic tennis medal in 100 years with the men's singles bronze at the Paris Games last year? Or perhaps because, as a 19-year-old, Musetti was once up by two sets against Novak Djokovic in the fourth round before losing a five-set thriller in 2021. Unlikely.

Lorenzo Musetti marked his return to Court Philippe-Chatrier with a dazzling first-round performance on Sunday at Roland Garros.

The eighth seed, competing at the iconic venue for the first time since winning the bronze medal at last year's Paris Olympics, delivered a stylish all-court display to move past qualifier Yannick Hanfmann 7-5, 6-2, 6-0. With his opening win at the clay-court major, Musetti improved to 23-5 on the surface since July, including a run to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 final in Monte-Carlo last month.

“There was pressure being the first man to start this year [on Court Philippe-Chatrier],” said Musetti. “It's an incredible honour, I've played many beautiful matches and have incredible memories on this court.

“This month has been incredible, I've reached many of my goals, but the best is yet to come. I've managed to find a way to make the click that I needed to make a step forward in my level, and I'm here to show it, so hopefully I will.”



At a career-high No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Musetti has enjoyed a significant breakthrough during the European clay swing. In Rome earlier this month, he became the first Italian in history to reach the semi-finals at all three Masters 1000 events on the surface in one season.

Having lost his previous Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Hanfmann in Madrid in 2023, Musetti was eager to mark his recent rise with an impressive first-round performance, and he did so after a testing opener. The 23-year-old countered Hanfmann's big serving with ease, highlighted by a stunning backhand return winner in the seventh game of the second, one of five straight points Musetti won from 40/0 to break for a 5-2 lead.

Overall, Hanfmann won just 49 per cent (31/63) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys Stats, during the two-hour, seven-minute match. By improving to 9-4 at Roland Garros, Musetti set a second-round meeting with lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan, who overcame local wild card Valentin Royer in a five-set epic.

Musetti is seeded for a fourth-round meeting with Holger Rune, whom he trails 0-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Elena Rybakina returned to the winner's circle for the first time in over a year, while 19-year-old Maya Joint captured her first WTA title -- all as players sharpened form and rankings in time for the French Open.

Last week on the Hologic WTA Tour, one familiar champion ended a title drought while another captured her first career trophy, all as players made their final preparations for Roland Garros.

Elena Rybakina captured her ninth career title at the WTA 500 event in Strasbourg, her first tournament win since Stuttgart in April 2024. The victory lifts her one spot in the PIF WTA Rankings, up to No. 11.

In Rabat, 19-year-old Maya Joint made a statement of her own. The Australian powered to her first title at the WTA 250 event, winning all five matches in straight sets and conceding just 22 games all week. It was only her 11th WTA main-draw appearance.

Joint began 2024 ranked No. 684 and has climbed rapidly since. She went 62-28 last year, reached her first WTA 125 final in Warsaw and made her tour-level debut at the US Open, reaching the second round as a qualifier. She cracked the Top 100 in early March and now rises another 24 places, from No. 78 to a career-high No. 53.

Jeanjean breaks Top 100 for first time, Parry returns

In the week before Roland Garros, France has tripled its number of Top 100 players from one to three. Former No. 48 Diane Parry, who slipped out of the Top 100 in March after an injury-struck start to her season, upset Leylah Fernandez to reach the second round of Strasbourg. Parry is back up 12 places from No. 105 to No. 93.

Meanwhile, there's a long-awaited milestone for 29-year-old Leolia Jeanjean, who inches up three places to make her Top 100 debut at No. 100 despite being inactive last week. After a successful college tennis career -- in which Jeanjean also earned three degrees from Baylor University, the University of Arkansas and Lynn University -- she made waves on her tour-level debut by upsetting Karolina Pliskova at Roland Garros 2022.

Jeanjean broke into the Top 200 after her 2022 Roland Garros breakthrough and, aside from one week, has stayed there ever since, peaking at No. 102 in January 2023. The past seven months, though, have marked the most consistent stretch of her career.

At the end of last season, she won back-to-back ITF titles on home soil before closing her season by reaching the Florianopolis WTA 125 semifinals. This year, Jeanjean added three more ITF finals, another WTA 125 semifinal run in Saint-Malo and her first tour-level quarterfinal in Bogota.

Liudmila Samsonova, +1 to No. 18: Samsonova reached her ninth career final, and first on clay, last week in Strasbourg. The 26-year-old has now made WTA finals on every surface.

Camila Osorio, +4 to No. 51: Bogota champion Osorio made her second semifinal of the season in Rabat and is up to her highest ranking since April 2022.

Jaqueline Cristian, +14 to No. 60: Cristian reached her second career final (following Linz 2021) in Rabat last week. The Romanian is now just three spots below her career high of No. 57.

Bianca Andreescu, +3 to No. 99: Former US Open champion Andreescu fell in Roland Garros qualifying last week but returns to the Top 100 for the first time since January 2024.

Alina Charaeva, +35 to No. 207: The 2020 Roland Garros junior finalist captured her first ITF W75 title last week in Kursumlijska Banja, Serbia. The 22-year-old hit her career high of No. 197 last November.

Maria Mateas, +30 to No. 216: The 25-year-old American reached her first career WTA quarterfinal in Rabat, a run that also included her first Top 100 win over Arantxa Rus. Mateas made her WTA main-draw debut at Stanford 2016 but had not won a match at that level until last week.

Oleksandra Oliynykova, +18 to No. 217: The 24-year-old Ukrainian has won 16 of her past 17 matches since April, collecting two ITF W35 titles in Santa Margherita di Pula and, last week, her first ITF W50 in Portoroz. Oliynykova climbs to a new career high.

Jazmin Ortenzi, +40 to No. 228: The 23-year-old Argentinian put together an eight-match winning streak over the past two weeks encompassing the Bastad ITF W35 title and Portoroz ITF W50 semifinals.

Sada Nahimana, +34 to No. 233: Nahimana made national history last week in Rabat, qualifying and then becoming the first player from Burundi to win a match in a WTA main draw. The 24-year-old rises to a new career high this week.

Teodora Kostovic, +117 to No. 395: The Junior No. 7, Kostovic qualified for her first WTA main draw in Madrid last month and continued to make waves at pro level by reaching the Kursumlijska Banja ITF W75 final last week. The 17-year-old Serb enters the Top 400 for the first time.

Anastasija Sevastova, +137 to No. 406: Former No. 11 Sevastova reached the quarterfinals of her first two tour-level events back from maternity leave at the start of 2024, before an ACL injury sidelined her for over a year. But last week in Rabat, in the fourth tournament since coming back, the 35-year-old Latvian added another WTA quarterfinal.

‘It was the only option' – Verstappen explains alternate tyre strategy in Monaco after going from P1 to P4 on final lap

Lewis Hamilton admits that the Monaco Grand Prix was a ""miserable"" experience as he was left ""in no man's land"" en route to a fifth-placed result.

The Ferrari driver had shown an up-turn in form prior to Sunday's race, Qualifying fourth for his best Saturday result this season ahead of a Grand Prix.

But the seven-time World Champion was demoted three-places on the grid for impeding Max Verstappen, which dropped him to a seventh-placed start in the Principality.

Well-timed pit stops, with all drivers required to make two in a first for the Monaco race, allowed Hamilton to move ahead of Isack Hadjar and Fernando Alonso come the chequered flag, which he believes was the maximum possible.

Hamilton finished fifth but 51 seconds behind winner Norris

""I think from where I was, a three-place grid penalty moving forwards back to fifth, I think was decent – the best I could do,"" said Hamilton.

When asked if the experience of racing at Monaco had been enjoyable, Hamilton replied: ""No, it was miserable.

""The races here are generally, unless you're first and in the lead, even when you're in the lead, it's not that fun. Just a nice reward at the end but other than that, anything but first is kind of empty.""

Despite finishing fifth, Hamilton was 51 second behind race winner Lando Norris as Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc finished just a few seconds in arrears as the runner-up.

Hamilton was left unable to give an answer as to why the gap had been so large, stating ""it just happens"" to Sky Sports F1.

""For me, I was kind of in the middle of nowhere,"" Hamilton added.

Hamilton satisfied with ‘decent' result in Monaco after making up two places

""Obviously I started with the penalty I had down in seventh, was obviously behind two cars for some time and then managed to clear them and then I was kind of just in no man's land after that. I think the gap was relatively big and I wasn't racing anyone.

""I needed the Safety Car or something to come into play but it didn't happen so it was just pretty straightforward from there.""

Hamilton was also left frustrated by radio communications with his engineer, at one point being told to push, which left the Briton confused.

""The information wasn't exactly that clear, I didn't understand 'this is our race' [comment],"" said Hamilton.

""I didn't know what I was fighting for. Was I fighting for the next spot ahead or... but in actual fact when I look at the data, I wasn't anywhere near the other guys up front so I used my tyres a lot in that moment but I was so far away from them.""

Hamilton brands his Monaco race 'miserable' after being left 'in no man's land'

Max Verstappen believes he and Red Bull secured the most on offer to them in Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix after adopting an offset tyre strategy in a bid to impact the podium positions.

Verstappen qualified fifth-fastest around the streets of Monte Carlo but started fourth following Lewis Hamilton's grid penalty, with the Dutchman initially trailing Lando Norris, Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri.

While Norris, Leclerc and Piastri pitted close together as they ticked off the required two stops, Verstappen extended both of his stints and led the race heading into the closing laps – seemingly in the hope of a red flag being thrown.

Verstappen eventually stopped for a second time on the penultimate lap and dropped back down to fourth place, but the reigning four-time World Champion feels it was “the only option” to potentially spring a surprise.

“Honestly, there was not much for us to improve on, because I had a big gap behind,” said Verstappen, who still crossed the line some 30 seconds clear of fifth-placed Hamilton.

“So, for us to just stay out and maybe hope for a red flag or whatever, it was the only option. We could have pitted sooner, but then you just sit there in fourth anyway.”

Race Highlights: 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

Verstappen admitted after Qualifying that Monaco had exposed Red Bull's low-speed “weakness” and hopes the team will return to form – following their victory in Imola – at next weekend's Spanish Grand Prix.

“This is not our track – it's as simple as that,” he stated. “Hopefully it'll be better [in Spain]… hopefully a bit closer to what we had in Imola, but we'll see next week.”

Verstappen remains third in the Drivers' Championship after Round 8 of the season, 25 points off leader Piastri, while Red Bull are third in the Teams' battle – one point ahead of Ferrari and four behind Mercedes.
