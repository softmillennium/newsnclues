                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The object was initially spotted flying over Colombia on March 2 Scientists are currently studying a mysterious sphere that they believe to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The metal item was initially spotted flying over Buga, Colombia, on March 2, before later being recovered in the area, according to a video from scientists that was shared online. Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers studying the sphere, said the mysterious object appears to have "no welds or joints” — both of which would typically indicate human manufacturing. The sphere also appears to have mysterious symbols carved on its surface, he added. Velazquez and his team said they used an X-ray on the object and found that it consists of three layers of metal, along with nine “microspheres” in the interior. "It looks to me like a really cool art project," she told the outlet. "Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," Mossbridge continued, referring to the international research project founded by Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, which aims to vet and study potential extraterrestrial artifacts through rigorous scientific research. Well, I think it's partly the same reason. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us.” And while Mossbridge is skeptical of the recent find in Colombia, she doesn't necessarily believe that all UFO sightings or artifacts are a hoax. “Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them,” she said. “They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters, and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things,” she said. So, what are the rules about how we deal with something that's interesting that's found there?” added Mossbridge.</p>

My telescope, set up for astrophotography in my light-polluted San Diego backyard, was pointed at a galaxy unfathomably far from Earth. It sparkled on the screen in front of us. The name is derived from its shape – albeit this pinwheel contains about a trillion stars. My wife wondered: "Doesn't light get tired during such a long journey?" Her curiosity triggered a thought-provoking conversation about light. Ultimately, why doesn't light wear out and lose energy over time? I am an astrophysicist, and one of the first things I learned in my studies is how light often behaves in ways that defy our intuitions. Light is electromagnetic radiation: basically, an electric wave and a magnetic wave coupled together and traveling through space-time. That point is critical because the mass of an object, whether a speck of dust or a spaceship, limits the top speed it can travel through space. But because light is massless, it's able to reach the maximum speed limit in a vacuum – about 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, or almost 6 trillion miles per year (9.6 trillion kilometers). To put that into perspective: In the time it takes you to blink your eyes, a particle of light travels around the circumference of the Earth more than twice. Light from the Sun, which is 93 million miles (about 150 million kilometers) from Earth, takes just over eight minutes to reach us. In other words, the sunlight you see is eight minutes old. So by the time you see it in the night sky, its light is just over four years old. Or, as astronomers say, it's four light years away. With those enormous distances in mind, consider Cristina's question: How can light travel across the universe and not slowly lose energy? This happens when it bounces off something, such as interstellar dust, and is scattered about. When light travels unimpeded, it loses no energy. Here's another concept: Picture yourself as an astronaut on board the International Space Station. You're orbiting at 17,000 miles (about 27,000 kilometers) per hour. Compared with someone on Earth, your wristwatch will tick 0.01 seconds slower over one year. If you're moving really fast, or close to a large gravitational field, your clock will tick more slowly than someone moving slower than you, or who is further from a large gravitational field. Now consider that light is inextricably connected to time. Everyone on Earth would clock you at the speed of light, but from your reference frame, time would completely stop. In other words, for the photon, space gets squished. —New theory could finally make 'quantum gravity' a reality — and prove Einstein wrong —Black hole paradox that stumped Stephen Hawking may have a solution, new paper claims Which brings us back to my picture of the Pinwheel galaxy. Because space is squished, to the photon the journey was infinitely fast and infinitely short, a tiny fraction of a second. But from our perspective on Earth, the photon left the galaxy 25 million years ago and traveled 25 million light years across space until it landed on my tablet in my backyard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A haunted doll collector who houses 54 'spirits' has weighed in on the debate surrounding the allegedly paranormal Annabelle doll being taken on 'tour.' While they warned that she should never be moved, Annabelle is now currently touring the US alongside other items from the Warrens Occult Museum collection – leaving people online up in arms. Now, haunted doll collector Teej, who has over 50 paranormal items in her possession, has weighed in on the controversial Annabelle tour. She insisted, however, that we shouldn't be so quick to make snap judgements about the toy, and said that she believes the haunted doll is misunderstood. 'Do I believe that Annabelle is responsible for all of the tragedy that she is being blamed for right now? 'Most of the stories tied to her are unverified and don't have any evidence to back them up. 'Honestly, I believe that Annabelle deserves a fresh investigation with an unbiased investigation team, to figure out what is actually going on with her.' A haunted doll collector who houses 54 'spirits' has weighed in on the debate surrounding the allegedly paranormal Annabelle doll being taken on 'tour' While they warned that she should never be moved, Annabelle is now currently touring the US alongside other items from the Warrens Occult Museum collection. 'The Warrens Occult Museum has been closed to the public since 2019, so she [was] not at home – she was in storage. Teej pointed out that the doll has spent her entire 'afterlife' on display in a museum being 'gawked at, disrespected, and sensationalized for money' – without any way to 'defend' herself from the claims. 'Imagine being the center of basically an entire country's fear without any voice of your own, and no one to look out for and defend you,' she continued. 'Spirits like Annabelle are not props – no spirit is.' Teej explained that all purported spirits should be treated with 'dignity, respect and kindness' – no matter the rumors that have dogged them over the years. Now, haunted doll collector Teej, who has over 50 paranormal items in her possession, has issued a stark warning about the Annabelle tour In Annabelle's case, the doll dates back to 1970 when she was gifted to a nursing student, who was told by a psychic medium that the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a deceased girl named Annabelle. 'We don't even know Annabelle's true story,' Teej said. Annabelle reportedly moved on her own and at one point attacked the fiancé of one of its owners. Annabelle then became one of the most well-known haunted items following the Conjuring and Annabelle movie franchises. Teej explained that all purported spirits should be treated with 'dignity, respect and kindness' – no matter the rumors that have dogged them over the years Teej started collecting haunted dolls in 2020 – but will only house ones with positive intentions It was really dark, and if we hadn't moved, there's a good chance we could've been hit. 'That moment stuck with me, not just because it was my first clear experience, but because it felt like a spirit was trying to help us. 'That was the first time I felt like a spirit interaction was actually positive, and that's something I've kept in mind ever since. 'It's a big part of why I'm now interested in haunted dolls, specifically ones with positive energy. She started collecting haunted dolls in 2020 – but will only house ones with positive intentions. 'I spent a lot of time researching and reading about them, trying to understand what made each case unique. 'I choose to work only with positive spirits in my home because of the relationships that naturally develop over time. She said: 'We treat them with respect, and in return, they do the same. 'We treat them with respect, and in return, they do the same. Our interactions are often lighthearted and much of the paranormal activity in our home is playful, sometimes even meant to make us laugh. 'By setting clear boundaries, I'm able to stay open to paranormal experiences while still protecting the comfort and peace of our home.' She added of the recent news about Annabelle: 'While I know Annabelle is currently on tour and it's easy to fall into the trap of assuming all haunted dolls behave like the famous ones, it's important to remember that every spirit is unique 'Making broad generalizations that all haunted dolls are dangerous or negative can be harmful and misleading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rising over 8,000 feet, Mount Hayes sits within the so-called Alaska Triangle, a region notorious for unexplained disappearances and paranormal activity. Locals have reported streaks of colored lights, orbs traveling at high speed, and mysterious vanishing people. One report came from Jared Augustin, a former security officer, who claimed he saw a glowing orb hovering in the night sky near Mount Hayes before it suddenly split into three. 'It was a UFO, of extraterrestrial origin,' Augustin told DMAX UK, adding that he stood frozen, shaking as the bizarre sight unfolded. Some conspiracy theorists claim there's missing satellite data over Mount Hayes, allegedly to hide the base's location. Mount Hayes is located within an area known for unexplained disappearances and paranormal activity. Locals have aimed trail cameras at Mount Hayes, hoping to capture proof that the area is a UFO hotspot. In an episode of History Channel's Missing in Alaska, a local resident named Wilbur shared footage he believed showed an alien craft. The video captured a glowing green light hovering over Mount Hayes. Within seconds, it appeared to vanish behind the mountain. Investigators said the object had 'hovering capabilities like a helicopter, but could also reverse direction instantly' — something no known aircraft can do. Notable incidents include the 1972 disappearance of a plane carrying US House Majority Leader Hale Boggs, which vanished en route from Anchorage to Juneau. Despite an extensive 39-day search covering 325,000 square miles, no wreckage or remains were ever found. In December 2023, Brian Erickson was reported missing after departing the village of Healy Lake on a green Polaris Ranger side-by-side vehicle. The Alaska State Troopers have been actively seeking assistance in locating Erickson. Locals have suggested that these disappearances and many more are due to UFO activity near the mountain. However, Mount Hayes is situated within an area stretching between Anchorage, Juneau and Utqiagvik. The report, titled 'Description of Personnel Associated 'ET' Bases,' detailed a session in which a remote viewer was given unknown targets and asked to describe what they perceived. The program began in the early 1970s and officially shut down in 1995 after being deemed scientifically unreliable and operationally ineffective for intelligence gathering. During a remote viewing session, participants typically sketched what they 'saw' and jotted down brief notes about their perceptions. The 12-page document includes several drawings believed to depict the locations of these ET bases—one sketch appears to resemble a rocky mountain.

Around the U.S., about 90,000 tons of nuclear waste is stored at over 100 sites in 39 states, in a range of different structures and containers. A 1987 federal law named Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, as a permanent disposal site for nuclear waste — but political and legal challenges led to construction delays. The 94 nuclear reactors currently operating at 54 power plants continue to generate more radioactive waste. Public and commercial interest in nuclear power is rising because of concerns regarding emissions from fossil fuel power plants and the possibility of new applications for smaller-scale nuclear plants to power data centers and manufacturing. I am a scholar who specializes in corrosion; one focus of my work has been containing nuclear waste during temporary storage and permanent disposal. There are also small amounts of other radioactive waste, such as that associated with medical treatments. Related: How do you decontaminate objects exposed to radioactivity? Remnants of the chemical processing of radioactive material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, often called "defense waste," will eventually be melted along with glass, with the resulting material poured into stainless steel containers. For now, though, most of it is stored in underground steel tanks, primarily at Hanford, Washington, and Savannah River, South Carolina, key sites in U.S. nuclear weapons development. Before it is used, nuclear fuel exists as uranium oxide pellets that are sealed within zirconium tubes, which are themselves bundled together. In a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions fueled by the uranium in those rods emit heat that is used to create hot water or steam to drive turbines and generate electricity. After about three to five years, the fission reactions in a given bundle of fuel slow down significantly, even though the material remains highly radioactive. The spent fuel bundles are removed from the reactor and moved elsewhere on the power plant's property, where they are placed into a massive pool of water to cool them down. After about five years, the fuel bundles are removed, dried and sealed in welded stainless steel canisters. These canisters are still radioactive and thermally hot, so they are stored outdoors in concrete vaults that sit on concrete pads, also on the power plant's property. As of December 2024, there were over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in the U.S., and over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground, located at current and former power plants across the country. Even reactors that have been decommissioned and demolished still have concrete vaults storing radioactive waste, which must be secured and maintained by the power company that owned the nuclear plant. One threat to these storage methods is corrosion. Because they need water to both transfer nuclear energy into electricity and to cool the reactor, nuclear power plants are always located alongside sources of water. When those salt and water particles settle on metal surfaces, they can cause corrosion, which is why it's common to see heavily corroded structures near the ocean. Generally, stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, which you can see in the shiny pots and pans in many Americans' kitchens. But in certain circumstances, localized pits and cracks can form on stainless steel surfaces. The general findings are that stainless steel canisters could pit or crack when stored near a seashore. A more permanent solution is likely years, or decades, away. —This ‘glow in the dark' battery runs on nuclear waste —China's 'artificial sun' shatters nuclear fusion record by generating steady loop of plasma for 1,000 seconds Not only must a long-term site be geologically suitable to store nuclear waste for thousands of years, but it must also be politically palatable to the American people. In addition, there will be many challenges associated with transporting the waste, in its containers, by road or rail, from reactors across the country to wherever that permanent site ultimately is. Perhaps there will be a temporary site whose location passes muster with the Supreme Court. This edited article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The patio at Joe T. Garcia's in Fort Worth is a popular celebrity hot spot. “You never know who you might run into at Joe T's … even a Texas heartthrob like Jared Padalecki,” the Joe T. Garcia's Facebook post reads. “From iconic margaritas to Hollywood moments, there's always something special in the air on our patio. Padalecki's ties to Texas run deep — he was born and raised in San Antonio, owns a home in Austin and co-owns several Austin businesses. He also supported Beto O'Rourke for the 2018 Senate election in Texas, as did his “Supernatural” co-stars Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins. You can currently see Padalecki as SoCal firefighter Camden Casey in season 3 of “Fire Country” on CBS. Padalecki is teaming up with his “Walker” executive producer/showrunner Anna Fricke to develop an untitled, hour-long medical drama about rural medicine, set in Texas, according to Deadline. Padalecki will star as “a headstrong, devoted country doctor who practices his unique style of improvisational medicine alongside his new protégé, a young doctor running from her past, as they operate a mobile clinic and heal the bodies and souls of their underserved community in the medical desert of rural Texas,” according to the description. →Hail, severe weather on the way for Memorial Day weekend →A Fort Worth lunch full of trendy items for under $25</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jamie Foxx has shut down conspiracy theories that say Sean ‘Diddy' Combs tried to kill him. While his illness still remained a mystery, some internet commentators suggested that Diddy had been involved. “I'm in fucking perfect shape,” he told the publication. “[I saw things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me.' When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These bitch-ass motherfuckers are trying to clone me? The Oscar-winning actor admitted that he was heavily sedated with drugs during his hospital stay and doesn't remember weeks of that period. During that time, he says he snuck a cell phone in and began indulging in the multiple rumours surrounding his health. “I was doing so many jokes in the hospital,” he continued. “That's the only way I could get through it. I'm a comic, so even when I was heavily sedated, and they gave me OxyContin, Dilantin and morphine at the same time.” jamie foxx addresses the diddy rumors in his new netflix special: “the internet was saying puffy tried to kill me… hell naw… i left them parties early” pic.twitter.com/DIJwpuUQcp Because something don't look right, it's slippery in here.” Foxx appeared to be referencing the fact that during police raids of Diddy's home in March, authorities recovered items including AR-15s, narcotics and “more than 1000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant”. He also revealed in the special that his unspecified medical emergency was actually a bleed on the brain that led to a stroke. I didn't see the light.” He then joked: “It was hot in that tunnel. Shit, am I going to the wrong place in this motherfucker? After the procedure, Foxx explained that the doctor told his sister Deidra Dixon that he “may be able to make a full recovery, but it's going to be the worst year of his life”. Diddy's sex trafficking and racketeering trial began this month and has so far seen his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, testify against him in court, alleging that he had spent years subjecting her to brutal sexual violence and abuse. Months later, CNN obtained CCTV footage of Diddy dragging, kicking and hitting Ventura in an LA hotel, lending credence to her allegations. Diddy was later arrested and charged with crimes including sexual trafficking and racketeering, the trial for which began earlier this month. Diddy has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, and has denied all other allegations of misconduct levelled against him. He has also pleaded not guilty to five criminal counts, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Justin Bieber also recently shut down rumours that he was one of Diddy's alleged victims, with a representative for the singer saying: “Although Justin is not among Sean Combs' victims, there are individuals who were genuinely harmed by him,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The infamous Annabelle doll, known from horror stories and movies, has once again caused a stir on social media. Recently, many people claimed that the doll had disappeared during a paranormal tour in Louisiana. This panic came just days after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Plantation, now called Nottoway Resort, in White Castle, Louisiana. Although no one was hurt, some social media users started rumours and conspiracy theories linking the fire to Annabelle being displayed nearby. It has been part of a paranormal tour across America. Locals in Louisiana said they were not able to see the doll during the tour and began to worry that it had gone missing. One person wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), “I just saw a post on Facebook that they LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL? BRAH?” A third tweet read, “wdym the annabelle doll is missing??? Dan Rivera from NESPR, a paranormal research group, posted a video from inside the Warrens Occult Museum showing the Annabelle doll safe and sound. As one person wrote after sharing the video, “Some wild and crazy internet rumors this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost and here's Dan Rivera with NESPR proving she is back home inside the museum in Connecticut.. for now. And no, Annabelle is not supposed to be in Chicago.” Since then, Annabelle has become one of the most famous haunted objects, inspiring films and countless tales of terror. As paranormal researcher Dan Rivera said, “Annabelle may be scary, but she isn't going anywhere — at least, not without the Warrens' permission.” Stay updated with the latest Trending,  India ,  World and  United States news.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there's one thing Stephen King is undeniably skilled at writing, it's horror, for obvious reasons. Much of the time, that horror is supernatural in nature, and that's good and all, but King's written dozens of novels, and for him to solely rely on supernatural threats 100% of the time would eventually make his stories stale. Also, that kind of heightened horror can be scarier when it exists alongside terrifying individuals who behave in alarming yet more everyday ways. The following characters hopefully demonstrate King's knack for writing strong villains who don't have fantastical abilities or supernatural powers. Some exist in stories that do feature such fantastical things, while others are villainous in stories that don't feature fantasy and/or supernatural elements. In the end, though, none of them needed otherworldly abilities to be effective antagonists or secondary villains. The first novel of Stephen King's that was published (in 1974), and the first to get a major film adaptation (in 1976), Carrie is a supernatural horror story, in a way, but it's also got some comparatively mundane villains. But it's the titular character who has the supernatural powers, and they're unleashed in a devastating way after she deals with abuse both at school and at home. Chris is the one who orchestrates much of Carrie's misery at school, while her mother makes her life hell at home. It's the prank Chris pulls at prom that makes Carrie snap, though the more prolonged abuse Margaret White subjects her to makes her eligible for a dishonorable mention here. Carrie herself causes the widespread death and destruction, but ultimately feels like a victim, given how these two treat her. 11/22/63 is one of the best Stephen King novels to not be a work of horror, even though it's pretty intense and occasionally unsettling in places. But he has to make sure Oswald was really behind the killing, and that involves monitoring him without impacting how he acted on the titular day in 1963. And the story does not paint Oswald in a positive light by any means, since he takes out so much of his anger on his wife, physically, and then does prove to be the lone gunman behind the JFK assassination. The main villain in The Stand, Randall Flagg, has his fair share of otherworldly abilities (and that's putting it mildly), but this is a massive book, and certainly has room for other villainous characters. Smith can see flashes of the future when he comes into contact with people, and much of The Dead Zone revolves around him trying to take Stillson, an aspiring politician, down, since one vision of the future seemed to show Stillson becoming President and starting a nuclear war. The villain here stands to wield an extraordinary amount of power, and has a chance of ending the world, but in a rather mundane way, compared to some other supernaturally gifted Stephen King antagonists. So, the villain here stands to wield an extraordinary amount of power, and has a chance of ending the world, but in a rather mundane (and thereby arguably more unnerving) way, compared to some other supernaturally gifted Stephen King antagonists. It might all sound a bit far-fetched, but King makes it work, with The Dead Zone being an engaging read and, like 11/22/63, has a high-concept premise executed well. The Green Mile is not lacking in characters who've done terrible things, since it's set on Death Row and the prisoners who aren't John Coffey are said to have committed genuinely horrific crimes. Also, Percy Wetmore is a guard who abuses his power and causes more suffering than needed, making him stand as one of many noteworthy bullies King has written about. Like The Green Mile, The Mist had a film adaptation directed by Frank Darabont, and it was also a Stephen King story that had more than one villain. She builds up a decent following within the store, and is one of those quintessential “maybe humans are the real monsters” kind of characters. There's a lot more than just the titular antagonist (that often takes the appearance of a clown) to fear in It, since this one, like The Stand, ends up being an epic novel with plenty of room for multiple villains. In typical King fashion, many of these are bullies, with Henry Bowers ultimately serving as the secondary antagonist of the story. He doesn't upstage IT itself, but no one really could. To be fair, Henry is under the influence of IT for at least some of the novel, but the stuff he does isn't necessarily supernatural or anything more damaging than what a bully could feasibly do. He's someone who's already villainous, but becomes more so because of the central antagonist here, but he's still such a definitive bully within King's body of work that he's worthy of mention regardless. The Body and Stand by Me are about as far from horror/fantasy as Stephen King ever got, but Ace is still a completely monstrous character who comes close to feeling over-the-top, but never crosses that line, staying effectively menacing and wholly intimidating, as a result. There might exist people who don't like The Shawshank Redemption, but good luck finding them. This is considered not just a great Stephen King film adaptation, but one of the greatest movies of all time in a more general sense, and perhaps the definitive prison film, too. Warden Norton abuses his power and often relishes the opportunities to cause misery in an already miserable place, and is immensely hateable in the process. Stephen King's 1987 novel, Misery, is one of his most uncomfortable and intense works, and was adapted into a similarly grueling (but engaging) film in 1990. The premise here is simple, and the number of key characters is low, seeing as most of Misery is centered on an author who's confined to an isolated cabin, held prisoner by Annie Wilkes, who's a lonely nurse and the author's self-appointed number 1 fan. Wilkes is a constant source of, you know, misery, and might well do the most psychological damage of any Stephen King antagonist who doesn't have supernatural powers. Hell, even compared to the ones who do, few put a Stephen King protagonist through anywhere near as much living hell as author Paul Sheldon goes through. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. If we must have Disney live-action movies, let's at least get the perfect cast.</p>
