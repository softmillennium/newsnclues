                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As those guns stopped, the sound of drone motors approaching was audible, getting quickly louder before the briefest moment of silence and then a sudden detonation. But, after two days of heavy Russian air raids that hit civilian buildings across Ukraine, the response has been silence from Donald Trump. In the space of just over a week, since the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since March 2022 broke up inconclusively with no sign of a ceasefire, the failure of his intervention has become clear. Boasting before his inauguration as US president that he could end the war in 24 hours, he has instead emboldened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, by declining to impose pressure for an immediate ceasefire – backed by Europe – or meaningful sanctions. Since Trump's two-hour call with Putin last Monday, the Russian leader has made clear his disdain even as Trump's own Defense Intelligence Agency predicted that Moscow would continue fighting through this year. Strikes on civilian targets only seem to be accelerating, culminating in two straight days of air raids, including Saturday night's – the heaviest aerial bombardment of the war so far, with almost 300 drones and nearly 70 missiles. Ukrainian and western officials anticipate that Russia will once again attempt a large-scale offensive during the summer, even if they are highly sceptical that it will be effective given Moscow's punishing losses. As it has become ever larger, with Russian and Ukrainian factories turning out thousands of new drones, it has become more sophisticated with Moscow's employment of big numbers of decoys and systems designed to fool air defence systems. While Ukraine has targeted bases and factories, including those producing fibre optic cable for a new generation of small combat zones, the purpose on Russia's side appears aimed solely at undermining morale on the home front. His words raised a more critical question: whether Trump, as he has long threatened, has already walked away from his perfunctory efforts to end the war. “The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. “On Monday the great charade we have been seeing for months came to an end,” wrote O'Brien this weekend. The reality was always that Trump was trying to bludgeon Ukraine into making major concessions to Russia and help Putin achieve many of his strategic goals.” If Trump has already disengaged, that raises a number of difficult questions for Kyiv: will the US continue supplying military aid in sufficient quantities? More crucially, can Europe step into the diplomatic and military void provoked by that disengagement? What is clear to Ukrainians, despite the several weeks of headlines over the potential for a breakthrough in peace talks, is that without pressure from Washington, or hugely accelerated aid from Europe, the war will grind on. And there will be more nights like Saturday's in their future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But Project Esther's authors make clear that their war on the Gaza solidarity movement is just a Trojan horse for a far more ambitious project: destroying the American left. At the center of Project Esther's crosshairs are the people and organizations it dubs the “Hamas Support Network,” or HSN, though there's no evidence that the entities it's targeting actually support Hamas, or that they are even organized in any sort of a network. The playbook proposes a slew of recommendations for dismantling this fictional network, including deporting international students, purging pro-Palestine faculty from educational institutions, defunding organizations, increasing criminalization and promoting social ostracization of people that speak out in support of Palestinian rights. There is no “vast network” of funders behind the grassroots uprising for Palestine — unlike Project 2025, which was crafted by 100 conservative organizations and, as DeSmog reported, bankrolled by six billionaire families. By attempting to frame the Gaza solidarity movement as a well-funded and cohesive network, Project Esther clearly aims to implicate any and all organizations on the left — a target that includes, but is not limited to, people and organizations that have spoken out in defense of Palestine. That goal is demonstrated in Project Esther's repeated claim that the so-called HSN is seeking to destroy capitalism, which carries clear echoes of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch hunts of the 1950s. The project goes so far as to ludicrously equate Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto, Soviet agitprop and Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. The proposals offered up by Project Esther can also be traced back to these witch hunts. One of Project Esther's suggested tools for quashing pro-Palestine activism is the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a law enacted in 1938 to combat Nazi propaganda, which requires that agents of foreign countries register with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and periodically disclose their political activities, and creates criminal and civil penalties for noncompliance. Although FARA was intended to provide transparency around foreign lobbying, it was coopted for McCarthyist suppression in the ‘50s to paint left activists as agents of communist regimes. In one egregious abuse of power, the DOJ used FARA to prosecute renowned civil rights leader and historian W.E.B. That case was dismissed, but Project Esther is now urging federal leadership to pull from the same playbook, painting leftist activists and groups as “Hamas supporters” to tee up its own weaponization of FARA. And Republicans have already expanded their use of the “foreign agent” rhetoric beyond Hamas: Last month, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) accused The People's Forum, a New York-based community center, and CODEPINK, an antiwar group, of ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and urged the DOJ to investigate the groups for FARA violations. Citing a “pro-Hamas” campus environment, an accompanying letter from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the administration is barring Harvard from enrolling international students. But pointing out Project Esther's hypocrisy does little to undermine its mission, which hinges on equating anti-Zionism with anti-Americanism. Even more concerning than FARA, however, is Project Esther's recommendation that the government use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to prosecute activists. By weaponizing RICO against the pro-Palestine movement, the Trump administration could ensnare people and groups across the left in a massive policing dragnet, attempting to paint everyone from anti-capitalists to Black Lives Matter activists as Hamas supporters. We have already seen RICO weaponized in Georgia against the Defend the Atlanta Forest movement, where Attorney General Chris Carr indicted 61 protesters on flimsy racketeering charges. Prosecutors claimed in legal filings that the fight to stop a massive police training center began during the nationwide protests against George Floyd's murder by police in 2020. Project Esther's authors also invoke George Floyd's name, making clear they perceive all mass mobilizations against injustice as threats: The document claims that the pro-Palestine movement is using Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel as a “George Floyd-style event to spring onto center stage and grab a giant microphone.” Crucially, while Project Esther claims to be about combating antisemitism, no major Jewish organizations participated in its drafting, and the blueprint targets progressive Jewish groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. Only one of the four people on the project's leadership task force is Jewish, while two are evangelical Christian Zionists, and the document, notably, does not make any mention of right-wing antisemitism. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. A Russian military commander has claimed that President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was "at the epicenter" of a Ukrainian drone attack on May 20 in Russia's Kursk Oblast. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this claim, and the commander did not provide any evidence. "We were simultaneously engaged in an air defense battle and ensuring airspace security for the president's helicopter flight," Yury Dashkin, commander of an air defense division, said, as cited by the Russian news agency RBC on May 25. Ukrainian observers noted that the claims could be an attempt to garner support for the Russian president by painting him as more closely involved in the fighting. Putin visited Kursk earlier this week, marking his first known visit to Kursk Oblast since Russian forces took back most of the Ukrainian foothold in the region in March. Ukraine launched its cross-border incursion into Kursk Oblast in August 2024, marking the first large-scale invasion of Russian territory by foreign forces since World War II. It held a significant portion of the territory until a successful counter-offensive by Russia in March, which was carried out with the help of North Korean troops. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leslie O'Neal of Georgia pulled over college student who then spent more than two weeks in federal immigration jail A Georgia police officer has resigned from his job after erroneously pulling over a teenager, causing her to spend more than two weeks in a federal immigration jail, and leaving her facing deportation. The officer, Leslie O'Neal, was employed at the police department in Dalton, a small city more than an hour north of Atlanta. Though no reason for O'Neal's resignation was provided, his arrest of college student Ximena Arias-Cristobal not only led to a domino effect that could lead to her deportation – it also engendered anger and criticism, especially given the circumstances of her immigration-related detention. The officer accused her of improperly making a false turn – but those charges were later dropped after the police force admitted to mistaking her car for another. Ice agents then transferred her to an immigration jail in the state. Others – including the far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – agitated for Arias-Cristobal to be deported. “In Mexico, today, there's over 1.6 million United States of America citizens, living and thriving in Mexico, and I'm sure she and her family will be able to do the same,” Greene said during an interview with Georgia's Local 3 News. The White House's attempts to engage in “mass deportations” during Donald Trump's second presidency has led to an increase in arrests throughout the country. Immigration enforcement operations have been aided by local jurisdictions that partner with Ice, under what are known as 287(g) contracts. These contracts deputize local officials to carry out immigration enforcement arrests, collaborating closely with Ice. The Whitfield county sheriff's office, which runs the local jail for people arrested in Dalton, has a 287(g) contract with Ice. Additionally, a law signed last year by Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, requires local law enforcement, in the entire state, to apply to enter into 287(g) contracts with Ice. The Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, for instance, said it would lead to “racial profiling, terrorize immigrant communities and waste local resources”. Arias-Cristobal's father, José Arias-Tovar, had also been detained by Ice weeks earlier after another traffic stop for speeding. Five days later, Arias-Cristobal paid a $1,500 bond, leading to her release. She was home with her family by Thursday evening. Arias-Cristobal's arrest has prompted some to rally for her release, whether in person or online. A GoFundMe campaign launched for her legal defense has raised more than $90,000. It is a run privately in Lumpkin, Georgia, by CoreCivic under a contract with Ice and for years has been accused of violating rights and maintaining horrific conditions.</p>

MOSCOW, May 25. /TASS/. Russia will refer a note of protest to Sweden following a drone attack on the Russian embassy in Sweden, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS.

"Tomorrow, Stockholm will receive a note of protest. Sweden must tame its ultras, take control of the situation and strictly observe the Vienna Convention," she said.

The Russian embassy in Stockholm said earlier that on May 25 it was attacked by a drone, which dropped a container with paint near the building's entrance.

The embassy recalled that such attacks have been continuing for more than a year. It repeatedly urged the Swedish police and foreign ministry to take measures to avert such attacks and ensure the implementation of the country's commitments under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</p>

MOSCOW, May 24. /TASS/. EU politicians were silent after the massive Ukrainian attacks on civil targets in Russia, but now they are "squealing wildly" because of Russia's allegedly disproportionate use of force, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said on Telegram.

There were several explosions in Kiev this night.

"After massive UAV raids on our country and its capital on the eve of the Victory Day to intimidate foreign guests, there was a grave silence in the European centers. After 500 drones that were launched at civilian targets in Russia in recent days to intimidate our people, there is silence again," Medvedev said.

Now, he continued, public figures "in Paris, Berlin and London will raise a wild squeal about the disproportionate use of force, the urgent need for a 30-day truce and new sanctions against Russia."

Medvedev called on them to destroy Bandera's "parasites" on their bodies.

"And remember: as a last resort, the nurses destroy the lice with fire, burning all sources of a long-standing pediculosis!" - the politician emphasized.</p>

I want to be in this level,” said Mboko, represented by talent agency IMG since the age of 12. The more I feel like I make it seem normal to me, the more normal it's going to be in these tournaments.” With her father and two of her older siblings in the stands at Court 9, a short walk from Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Mboko reached a top speed of 115 mph and delivered seven aces. “I love to dictate points on my serve, and I love to use that as an opportunity to be more aggressive and be up in the score,” said Mboko, who is currently ranked 120th. “Especially in women's tennis, having a good serve and holding all the time is pretty crucial. Her favourite player as a kid – not all that long ago, actually – was Serena Williams, whose 23 Grand Slam titles often came with the help of top-notch serving. “I always modelled myself on the idea of her game. Of course, not everything I do is the same. Mboko began to really get noticed in the world of tennis at the start of this year, when she won 22 matches in a row – all in straight sets – to earn four lower-level International Tennis Federation titles. Her first WTA match arrived at the Miami Open in March, and she won that debut, too. She's been impressing opponents along the way, including 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff. 2 right now, to three sets on clay at the Italian Open this month. “She's playing top-level tennis,” Gauff said after that win. As far as the other parts of her game, she's obviously a big hitter, can play well, moves pretty well, has a nice backhand, same on the forehand.” Mboko grew up playing mostly on indoor hard courts in Canada and calls that her “favourite surface for my whole life.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, settles a $20 billion lawsuit brought by U.S. President Donald Trump, it could face another lawsuit from a leading press freedom organization. FPF addressed its letter to Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder. Paramount's leadership has reportedly discussed settling the Trump lawsuit for up to $20 million. “I am writing to demand that you institute an immediate litigation hold, as FPF plans to file a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of Paramount in the event of a settlement by Paramount,” wrote Seth Stern, FPF's director of advocacy. “We expect that other long-term shareholders will join the suit.” “Any damages award would go to Paramount, not FPF,” the group added. “I'm proud that @freedom.press is doing what CBS's corporate owners won't — standing up for press freedom and against authoritarian shakedowns. The lawsuit warning comes after a trio of U.S. senators cautioned that Paramount “may be engaging in potentially illegal conduct” by pursuing a settlement with Trump in exchange for approval of the Skydance merger. ), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in a May 19 letter to Redstone. Internally, Paramount executives have acknowledged that settling the Trump suit “could expose directors and officers to liability in potential future shareholder litigation or criminal charges for bribing a public official,” the Journal reported in February. In a statement on Friday, Stern said that “corporations that own news outlets should not be in the business of settling baseless lawsuits that clearly violate the First Amendment and put other media outlets at risk.” “Not only would it tank CBS's reputation but, as three U.S. senators recently explained, it could put Paramount executives at risk of breaking the law.” When you run a news organization, you have the responsibility to protect First Amendment rights, not abandon them to line your own pockets,” Stern added. “We hope Paramount will reconsider the dangerous path it appears to be contemplating but, if not, we are prepared to pursue our rights as shareholders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I don't use social media much anymore, but, just like every other personal trainer in search of an audience, every now and then I'll share videos offering technique tips for various exercises. These videos typically end with me in my body's default state of repose: a deep, butt-to-heels squat or seated on the floor with my legs crossed in a quasi lotus pose, where I'd recap some key takeaways. These positions come naturally to me – still, in the comments for these videos, people would chime in with praise for my ability to simply sit. This feedback on my sitting form proved to be the catalyst that led to my eureka moment. It hit me, then and there, that strong muscles are nearly useless unless you can move your body in a graceful, pain-free manner. At 79 years old, fitness influencer Joan MacDonald is the strongest she's ever been Now, I know when it comes to grand revelations, this one isn't quite up there with Archimedes figuring out the principle of water displacement, but simple ideas can still have a profound impact. Ever since I started prioritizing movement and mobility over the pursuit of muscle mass, all of my clients have reported seeing greater results. Same goes for the typical aches and pains that tend to plague people over 40. Just as important, our training sessions became more fun. Developing high-quality mobility doesn't have to be a complicated process, nor does it have to be a separate entity removed from strength training. My approach involves taking two basic positions – the A-frame and the squat – and spicing them up with some added movements. Here are two of my favourite variations on these familiar standards. Full length of woman practicing yoga in living room. She is in good posture at home.HRAUN/iStockPhoto / Getty Images You'll feel a nice stretch in the hamstrings and calves, too. Add in some thoracic rotation and an overhead reach, and you've got one of the most productive, total-body movements. Work within the range of motion that's comfortable for you, making use of props for extra support if needed. Once you've found a suitable depth, reach one arm toward the ceiling while rotating your torso in the same direction. Keeping the opposite arm on the ground (or your prop) will help to generate some leverage and will also keep you balanced. Now switch sides and keep repeating the sequence for 30-45 seconds. You'll likely notice right away that reaching directly overhead from this position is a tall order. Try not to force things into place; if you hit a sticky spot, stop, switch sides, and then see if you can go a little deeper on the next repetition. You can even toss them into your weight training routine as a form of active rest between lifts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto king of Kentucky arrested for assault and unlawful imprisonment An Italian tourist was tortured by a crypto investor who allegedly dangled him from the fifth floor of a Manhattan townhouse to steal his Bitcoin passwords. Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, 28, told police he had been held captive in a $30,000 per month, eight-bedroom home for the past three weeks where he was beaten and electrocuted. John Woeltz, 37, known as “the crypto king of Kentucky” with an estimated worth of $100 million, has been arrested for the alleged torture. He faces four charges, including assault and unlawful imprisonment. The arrest comes as after a wave of cryptocurrency-linked kidnappings by criminals desperate to cash in on the coveted “digital gold”, including two men in France who were found with severed fingers, and a broker who escaped from his captors in Spain. Michael Mattson, an assistant district attorney, told a Manhattan court that the victim was abducted on May 6 when he went to Mr Woeltz's Soho flat after travelling from Italy to New York City. When he got there Mr Woeltz allegedly snatched the Italian man's electronic devices and passport before demanding that he turn over his Bitcoin password. But he made a “daring escape” on Friday just after 9.30am, as he ran out of the townhouse in the Nolita neighbourhood of Manhattan and toward a traffic agent nearby. The victim was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries that Mr Mattson said were consistent with his descriptions of being bound and assaulted. On Saturday, Mr Woeltz, who is being held without bail, was ordered to surrender his passport as prosecutors said he had the means to flee, including a private jet and a helicopter. He is due back in Manhattan criminal court next week. A second man, who has only been named as an “un-apprehended male”, is also alleged to have taken part. An Italian woman, identified as Beatrice Folchi, Mr Woeltz's assistant, was reportedly arrested and charged in the case. It is the third reported case of kidnappings targeting those linked to cryptocurrency fortunes. In early May, the pregnant daughter and grandson of a cryptocurrency boss escaped abduction in Paris in broad daylight by a group of hooded individuals who sought to drag the mother and son into a delivery van. Pierre Noizat, the French cryptocurrency boss, later praised his “heroic” son-in-law and a neighbour armed with a fire extinguisher for thwarting the attempted kidnapping. After being held for more than two days, armed police freed him from a house south of Paris.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been described as the world's most dangerous race, and it's certainly one of the most ridiculous – a 200-yard dash after a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese. To win, all you have to do is chase it down a grassy hill and cross the finish line before anyone else; however, that's much easier said than done. The hill is so steep that it could give you vertigo on the start line and there is absolutely no guarantee that you will make it down to the bottom in one piece. Anderson won his first of his record 23 races in 2005 and broke his ankle in the celebrations, but the excruciating pain and eight weeks in a cast didn't put him off. “That was a bit of a blur,” he noted, recalling that he'd banged his head on the way down. It might have started as a pagan ritual to bless the farmers' crops, or perhaps they were originally rolling barrels down to test their integrity – a cooper is, after all, a barrel maker. But it's a tradition that the locals have fought to preserve and it's one they are intensely proud of. “I used to go up there camping with my friends,” Anderson said. “We used to get drunk and throw each other down.” Looking down from the top, it initially seems like a sheer drop and many runners have changed their minds at the last minute when they realize what they're in for. “The first 10 meters are, like, near vertical,” Anderson explained to CNN. Ideally, Anderson prefers the ground to be soft, but not wet. Few competitors are able to remain upright for very long, some are anxiously trying to maintain control by sliding on their bottoms, while others have lost all dignity, careening down in various states of distress. Still images captured by photographers at the bottom present a confusing tableau, as if a giant has tipped a box of action figures out onto the hillside, bodies are upside down, or airborne sideways, and limbs are flailing everywhere. “It was so fun to watch people flying and falling,” he reminisced, adding that it wasn't all fun and games. Serious injuries are practically guaranteed, one year Anderson witnessed three broken ankles, two of which belonged to international runners who missed their flights home because of emergency surgery. Ankle injuries are common – some have witnessed feet out of alignment by 180 degrees – as are concussions; 2023 women's champion Delaney Irving was knocked out just before the finish line and only learned of her triumph when she was told about it in the medical enclosure. On the Netflix docuseries “We Are the Champions,” women's record holder and four-time winner Flo Early revealed a protrusion of her right shoulder, a permanent disfigurement, caused by a collar bone that was broken on the hill. It's therefore no surprise that many runners might need a splash of alcohol in order to run. Now, runners in need of some Dutch courage just start drinking earlier. Anderson told CNN Sports he prepares in moderation by drinking a single can of lager on the walk up. “I always saw that if you were drunk and you broke something, there's not a great deal they can give you for the pain, so I always try to do it as sober as possible,” he said. Signs posted all over the hill make it clear that runners are participating at their own risk, the local enthusiasts who stage the event say they are not official organizers – in case of injury, there is nobody to sue, and the event is uninsured. Anderson told CNN that he never had any intention of breaking the record of 21 cheese wins, which was set in 1991, but once he got to 13, he decided to keep going. At the age of 37, he's recovering from a long-term hip injury – and he is “supposed to be retired” – but if his 16-year-old son decides to compete then he could be tempted back onto the hill, partly to make sure he does it right. “I'd be happy for him to run,” he said, “but I've told him if you're not gonna commit, there's no point in even doing it.” The veteran cheese-chaser knows that there are many ways to be hurt on the hill. “The most dangerous thing is going slow and getting hit from behind. And if he ever decides to run again, he said it won't be for the cheese: “I actually don't like it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Ukraine brought home 303 prisoners of war on May 25 in the final phase of a 1000-for-1000 prisoner exchange with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. The prisoner exchange took place in three phases carried out over three days and was agreed on during peace talks held in Turkey on May 16, the first direct negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in three years. "I thank the team that worked around the clock to successfully carry out this exchange. We will definitely bring back every single one of our people from Russian captivity," Zelensky wrote in a post on X. The returning prisoners included members of Ukraine's Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Guard Service, and State Special Transport Service, Zelensky stated. The coordination headquarters added that 5,757 Ukrainian prisoners had been returned through negotiations and exchanges since March 2022, while another 536 Ukrainians had returned through other means. Ukraine and the United States have been pushing for Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire, but Russia "categorically" rejected the appeal in Turkey, according to First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Serhiy Kyslytsia, who attended the talks as a member of the Ukrainian delegation. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From day to day, Donald Trump's second term often seems like a roman candle of grievance, with the administration spraying attacks in all directions on institutions and individuals the president considers hostile. Hardly a day goes by without Trump pressuring some new target: escalating his campaign against Harvard by trying to bar the university from enrolling foreign students; deriding musicians Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift on social media; and issuing barely veiled threats against Walmart and Apple around the companies' responses to his tariffs. Trump's panoramic belligerence may appear as to lack a more powerful unifying theme than lashing out at anything, or anyone, who has caught his eye. While debates about the proper boundaries of presidential authority have persisted for generations, many historians and constitutional experts believe Trump's attempt to centralize power over American life differs from his predecessors' not only in degree, but in kind. At various points in our history, presidents have pursued individual aspects of Trump's blueprint for maximizing presidential clout. Yuval Levin, director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, also believes that Trump is pursuing the most expansive vision of presidential power since Woodrow Wilson over a century ago. But Levin believes Trump's campaign will backfire by compelling the Supreme Court to resist his excesses and more explicitly limit presidential authority. “I think it is likely that the presidency as an institution will emerge from these four years weaker and not stronger,” Levin wrote in an email. Other analysts, to put it mildly, are less optimistic that this Supreme Court, with its six-member Republican-appointed majority, will stop Trump from augmenting his power to the point of destabilizing the constitutional system. He's marginalized Congress by virtually dismantling agencies authorized by statute, claiming the right to impound funds Congress has authorized; openly announcing he won't enforce laws he opposes (like the statute barring American companies from bribing foreign officials); and pursuing huge changes in policy (as on tariffs and immigration) through emergency orders rather than legislation. He's asserted absolute control over the executive branch through mass layoffs; an erosion of civil service protections for federal workers; the wholesale dismissal of inspectors general; and the firing of commissioners at independent regulatory agencies (a move that doubles as an assault on the authority of Congress, which structured those agencies to insulate them from direct presidential control). He's arguably already crossed the line into open defiance of lower federal courts through his resistance to orders to restore government grants and spending, and his refusal to pursue the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the undocumented immigrant the administration has acknowledged was wrongly deported to El Salvador. And while Trump so far has stopped short of directly flouting a Supreme Court order, no one could say he's done much to follow its command to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return. Trump has trampled traditional notions of federalism (especially as championed by conservatives) by systematically attempting to impose red state priorities, particularly on cultural issues, onto blue states. Most unprecedented have been Trump's actions to pressure civil society. He has sought to punish law firms who have represented Democrats or other causes he dislikes; cut off federal research grants and threatened the tax exempt status of universities that pursue policies he opposes; directed the Justice Department to investigate ActBlue, the principal grassroots fundraising arm for Democrats, and even ordered the DOJ to investigate individual critics from his first term. “This ability to just deter other actors from exercising their core rights and responsibilities at this kind of scope is something we haven't had before,” said Eric Schickler, co-author with Pierson of the 2024 book “Partisan Nation” and also a UC Berkeley political scientist. In Vought's telling, liberals “radically perverted” the founders' plan by diminishing both the president and Congress to shift influence toward “all-empowered career ‘experts'” in federal agencies. Trump summarized this view more succinctly during his first term, when he memorably declared, “I have an Article II (of the Constitution), where I have  to the right to do whatever I want as president.” Whatever else can be said about the first months of Trump's second term, no one would accuse him of faltering in that belief. Henry opposed ratification, mostly because he believed the Constitution provided too little protection against a malign or corrupt president. “If your American chief, be a man of ambition, and abilities, how easy is it for him to render himself absolute!” Henry declared. If a president sought to misuse the vast authorities placed at his disposal, Henry warned, “what have you to oppose this force? What will then become of you and your rights? Even those who supported the Constitution shared some of Henry's misgivings. To Madison, one of the document's chief virtues was that it divided power in a manner that made it difficult for any single individual or political faction to assume absolute power. Madison thought the Constitution created a second line of defense against despotism. The Constitution always had faults, most glaringly its tolerance of slavery. But as Pierson and Schickler argued in “Partisan Nation,” the separation of powers generally worked as intended through most of US history. “For almost a quarter of a millennium,” they wrote, “the operation of American government tended to frustrate the efforts of a particular coalition or individual to consolidate power, dispersing political authority and encouraging pluralism.” The founders' strategy, though, was showing signs of strain even before Trump emerged as a national figure. While Madison and his contemporaries thought that other officials would focus primarily on defending their institutional prerogatives, in modern politics, state and federal officials, and even judicial appointees, appear to prioritize their partisan identity on the Democratic or Republican team. That's steadily diminished the willingness of other power centers to push back in the way Madison expected against a president from their own side overstepping his boundaries. Trump is both building on that process and escalating it to an entirely new level of ambition. Brettschneider's book traces the history of public resistance to presidents who threatened civil liberties and the rule of law, including John Adams, Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. He says those precedents offer reason for optimism, but not excessive confidence, that the system will survive Trump's offensive. “We have these past victories to draw on,” Brettschneider said. “But we shouldn't be naïve: The system is fragile. We just don't know if American democracy will survive.” He agrees Congress is unlikely to muster much resistance to Trump's claims of unbounded authority: “The weakness of Congress, and the vacuum that weakness creates, is the deepest challenge confronting our constitutional system, even now,” Levin wrote. But he believes the Supreme Court ultimately will constrain Trump. Analysts to Levin's left are much less confident the same Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority that voted to virtually immunize Trump from criminal prosecution for official actions will consistently restrain him – or that it is guaranteed Trump will comply if it does. They tend to see Trump's second term as presenting an almost unparalleled stress test for the Constitution's interlocked mechanisms to preserve freedom and democracy. “What I would say is: We shouldn't be too confident. Less certain is whether officials from the other branches of government, leaders in civil society, and even ordinary Americans, will show the same determination to defend them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Romanian presidential candidate George Simion has called on supporters to engage in peaceful protest against what he claims was a fraudulent election, warning that the country narrowly avoided a “bloodbath” caused by “demonic plans” allegedly orchestrated by his Western-backed political opponents. The conservative EU critic lost a run-off vote last Sunday to pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Simion has contested the outcome, alleging “external interferences by state and non-state actors,” but Romania's Constitutional Court rejected his petition. In a video message to supporters streamed on social media Friday night, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) described Dan as a “puppet of France” who won the election through manipulation and fearmongering after “mobilizing the entire Soros network, all the NGOs” to undermine his campaign. “This fight is not lost,” Simion told supporters, claiming that “the right of Romanians to take to the streets” must be exercised – while stressing that any demonstrations must remain peaceful. I will say this every time, because they want to put us in prison,” he said, alleging that his political opponents were attempting to provoke violence in order to justify a crackdown on the opposition. “That's what they wanted on election night,” he said, claiming that the opposing camp planned to manipulate his supporters into a “bloodbath” akin to Ukraine's 2014 coup – and allegedly had “some people who participated in the Euromaidan in Kiev.” They had the crowd prepared – to have Romanians turn against each other again and for a civil war to erupt in Romania. We were one step away from the country being torn apart due to the demonic plans they had,” he added. Simion said he has stayed away from protests and would continue to do so to avoid escalating tensions, but urged supporters to “fight in the name of truth, democracy, freedom, peace, and in the name of God.” Fight for Romania, because they are truly afraid of us,” he said. Romania's Constitutional Court overturned the results, citing electoral irregularities and allegations of foreign interference – including claims of Russian involvement, which Moscow has denied. Telegram founder Pavel Durov claimed on Sunday that Nicolas Lerner, the head of French foreign intelligence, personally urged him to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of the election.

The White House confirmed a call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the key issues they discussed on May 22.

“President Trump and President Sheinbaum discussed economic and security issues,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly wrote in an email to The Epoch Times.

“And we continue to talk about trade issues, nothing in particular, but we continue to negotiate, and with a good relationship and good communication,” the Mexican president said.

Sheinbaum said she has held seven calls with trump so far.

“In the beginning, we continued talking about trade and tariffs. Remember that we, in the case of the automotive industry, have a very preferential situation for Mexico, although we would still like more, but we have a preferential situation,” she said.

Sheinbaum said they discussed other issues, without specifying which ones, and noted that both governments are continuing to work on the steel and aluminum issue, but clarified that “I would not like to say much more until we can reach an agreement.”

The call between the two presidents took place after Sheinbaum's meeting with the new U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ronald Johnson, for the presentation of credentials at the National Palace on May 19.

“We invite them to come to Mexico on this occasion,” Sheinbaum said.

“We've been primarily focused with Mexico on two things ... one is on trade, which is not my department ... and then the other is on security cooperation,” Rubio said.

On May 22, the Mexican president announced that, as part of the negotiations between the two countries, Mexican Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will travel to Washington for a meeting.</p>
