Supporters of conservative presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki take part in a march one week ahead of a decisive election in Warsaw Poland, Sunday, May 25, 2025. WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Tens of thousands of Poles took part in dueling patriotic marches in Warsaw on Sunday, led by the two men vying for the presidency in a June 1 runoff election which is expected to be both close and consequential for the nation's future. Many of those who joined Sunday's marches had traveled from across Poland, a country of nearly 38 million people, not just to support a candidate but to rally behind sharply divergent visions for the nation's future. In another part of Warsaw, Karol Nawrocki, 42, addressed his supporters. A conservative historian and former boxer, Nawrocki is backed by the national conservative Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. His supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values — a man who, like U.S. President Donald Trump, promises to restore what they call “normality.” Many voiced opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, saying Nawrocki reflects the values they grew up with. But Nawrocki's candidacy has also been dogged by controversy. Allegations recently surfaced that he swindled an elderly man out of an apartment — claims many of his supporters dismiss as politically motivated. His behavior during a presidential debate on Friday also generated a lot of attention and controversy: at one point Nawrocki appeared to discreetly put something in his mouth. Trzaskowski argued in his speech that Nawrocki was not fit to represent the nation as its president. “It's high time for truth, honesty to win, for the future to win, and that's exactly what's at stake in these elections,” Trzaskowski said. “On June 1, we will all make a decision that may be one of the most important in our lives. Trzaskowski previously ran for president in 2020, narrowly losing to incumbent Andrzej Duda, whose second and final five-year term ends this summer. Trzaskowski supporters believe their candidate would better protect the country's interests by strengthening ties with European partners such as France and Germany. In their view, those alliances are vital to Poland's security, especially in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine and fears that a victorious Russia could seek to reassert control over parts of Central and Eastern Europe. During its eight years in power, Law and Justice was accused by the European Union of undermining democratic norms, particularly judicial independence and press freedom. Trzaskowski has pledged to support Tusk's efforts to restore the independence of Poland's judiciary — something that the conservative Duda has stymied. Romanian President-elect Nicusor Dan, a pro-EU centrist who pulled off an upset in Romania's presidential election to beat out a hard-right nationalist, traveled to Warsaw, and joined Trzaskowski's march.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McLaren driver Lando Norris of Britain, left, celebrates on the podium with Zak Brown, McLaren chief, center, and McLaren driver Oscar Piastri of Australia after winning the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix race at the Monaco racetrack in Monaco, Sunday, May 25, 2025. MONACO (AP) — Lando Norris realized a childhood dream as he won the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday, and boosted his chances of achieving an even bigger goal, the Formula 1 title. Norris took his first Grand Prix win since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix — though he did win a sprint race in Miami this month — and reduced his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri's lead from 13 points to three. Starting on pole position, Norris locked up a wheel into the first corner but still managed to hold off last year's winner, Charles Leclerc of Ferrari. It's a long, grueling race, but good fun,” Norris said. Leclerc was second after closing in on Norris late in the race — though he wasn't able to attempt a pass — while Piastri was third and defending champion Max Verstappen fourth, with seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton a distant fifth. Verstappen was the leader on track until the second-to-last lap but only because he had yet to make his mandatory second pit stop under a rule change introduced in an attempt to spice up the Monaco Grand Prix, where overtaking is almost impossible. Verstappen was almost certain to end the race fourth, no matter when he stopped, so he eased off, slowing down Norris and allowing Leclerc and Piastri to catch up. Verstappen seemed to be trying to pressure Norris into a costly mistake, or maybe hoping for a red-flag stoppage which could have allowed him a free tire change while keeping the lead. Norris said the end of the race was a “little bit nervous with Charles close behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco, so it doesn't matter how you win, I guess.” Despite predictions it could allow some teams and drivers to spring a surprise, the rule had little overall impact on the results, except for a few cases of teams seemingly slowing down one car to benefit a teammate. “We lost the race yesterday,” was Leclerc's verdict, referring to the importance of qualifying on pole in Monaco, his home race. Hamilton went on to win his first championship that year. McLaren leaves Monaco with six wins from the first eight races of 2025 as its two drivers battle for the title. Even with just a third of the season gone, a second successive constructors' title for McLaren looks all but assured, as the team's 319 points are more than double the total of any other team. Second place a year ago was only the third career podium finish for the Australian, who had yet to win a Grand Prix. Third place Sunday was Piastri's seventh podium finish in a row. “If this is a bad weekend,” Piastri said, “then it's not going too badly at all.”</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they've become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well). Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it's still found in the iPhone SE series. Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us: "Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?" While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they're not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to my free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up! There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods. Hackers exploit the concept of "masterprints," which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at NYU Tandon developed "DeepMasterPrints" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings. Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you've touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn't crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn't necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn't work on them. Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone's secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants. Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don't need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea. Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures. Choose trusted phone brands: If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Don't rely only on your fingerprint: Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn't be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in. Be careful about who handles your phone: If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don't know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It's safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity. Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they're compromised. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don't need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn't work, so both systems often go hand in hand. With the increasing sophistication of methods to bypass fingerprint security, what should companies be doing to stay ahead of these threats and better protect user data?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Alaa al-Najjar left her ten children at home on Friday when she went to work in the emergency room at the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza. They were Dr. Najjar's own children, killed in an Israeli airstrike on her family's home, Gaza Civil Defense said. Only one of her ten children, 11-year-old Adam, survived. Dr. Najjar's husband Hamdi, himself a doctor, was also badly injured in the strike. Civil defense and the health ministry say that the family's home, in a neighborhood of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, was targeted by an Israeli airstrike. In response to a CNN request for comment, the Israeli military said aircraft had “struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis.” It said it was reviewing the claim civilians had been killed. We will deploy every tool at our disposal to bring the hostages home, dismantle Hamas, and dismantle its rule,” Zamir told troops, adding that the the military needs to now take down Hamas' Khan Younis brigade. It showed medics lifting an injured man onto a stretcher as other first responders try to extinguish a fire engulfing the house. Dr. Sahar al-Najjar, a niece, told CNN that Hamdi, 38, had dropped his wife at the hospital and gone to get food for his children. He rushed inside to rescue his children but was hit by a second Israeli strike. Sahar said Dr. Alaa broke down when she showed the last bottle of breast milk she had expressed for her infant daughter, Sidra, whose body remains under the rubble. “Every day at work, Dr. Alaa pumped milk to provide for Sidra, and today she showed me the last bottle she prepared for her.” She is only praying for her son and husband to recover.” When Adam, the sole surviving child, came out of the operating room, he called out for his sister Eve, saying, “There's blood on the tree.” One of Adam's arms is severely injured, and he will need another surgery in a few days. “This horrific crime is not an isolated incident, but part of a systematic targeting of medical personnel and institutions, aimed at breaking the will of those standing steadfast in Gaza,” it said. Munir al-Boursh, Director-General of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said that Dr. Najjar's husband had just returned home when the home was struck. “Nine of their children were killed: Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman, and Sidra,” Boursh posted on X. “This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. In Gaza, it is not only healthcare workers who are targeted—Israel's aggression goes further, wiping out entire families,” Boursh said. Related video ‘His death broke us:' A girl's life under siege Ahmad al-Farra, a doctor at the Nasser Medical Complex, told CNN that Dr. Najjar continued to work despite losing her children, while periodically checking on the condition of her husband and Adam. Youssef Abu al-Reesh, a senior official at the Health Ministry, said Dr. Najjar had left her children at home to “fulfill her duty and her calling toward all those sick children who have no place but Nasser Hospital.” Reesh said that when he arrived at the hospital, he had seen her “standing tall, calm, patient, composed, with eyes full of acceptance. Dr. Najjar, 38, is a pediatrician, but like most doctors in Gaza, she has been working in the emergency room during Israel's onslaught on the territory. As southern Gaza comes under renewed attack, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Sunday that two of its team members were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis on Saturday. “Their killing points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza,” the ICRC said in a statement posted to X.

A British government minister says she's "not squeamish" about the idea of chemical castration for male sex offenders, and wants to make it mandatory. The UK is considering a range of options from a new report, which aims to cut the country's prison population by 10,000 inmates to help alleviate chronic overcrowding. "Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offense under certain circumstances," the new report states. Prisons in the south-west of England have been involved in a pilot program of chemical castrations since 2002, and Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood from the ruling Labour Party told lawmakers in parliament on Thursday that the program would expand to 20 more prisons in two other regions of England.

(photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images) Prisoners would be given two drugs as part of the treatment: one limits sexual thoughts, while the other reduces testosterone and "problematic sexual arousal." Inmates would also have ongoing counseling to treat their psychological issues, such as a desire for sexual power and control. One recent study found that reoffending rates were up to 60% lower for prisoners who had received the treatment. "For some, offending relates to power, but for another subset of offenders, the combination of chemical suppressants and psychological interventions can, we believe, have a big and positive impact," Minister Mahmood told parliament. Initially, the option for chemical castration treatment would be only voluntary, and medical ethicists say it could be a problem to force doctors to treat an inmate who doesn't want to have it done. A Serco security van enters HMP Wandsworth prison in London, England, on Thursday, Sept. 5, 2024. The UK's new government said it will release low-risk prisoners after they have served 40% of their sentences, compared with 50% currently, as part of a plan to address an overcrowding crisis in the country's jails. (Photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images) The new report cautions that chemical castration "should never be used as a risk management tool or standalone rehabilitative offer, and it is only appropriate for a limited number of sex offenders". Chemical castration is already being used in some other European prisons to treat sex offenders. Authorities in Sweden have been carrying out limited clinical trials on volunteers at a Stockholm prison, while in Germany and Denmark it is more widely used but still on a voluntary basis. Thursday's report, written by a former government minister from the Conservative Party, also made four dozen recommendations to try and ease prison overcrowding. These include giving fewer people jail sentences under 12 months and encouraging other types of punishment instead, such as community service or fines; developing new policies for early release with good behavior for inmates, and tagging all offenders who committed crimes of abuse against women and girls. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood during a visit to HMP Bedford in Harpur, Bedfordshire, as she announces plans to address prison overcrowding amid fears jails will run out of space within weeks. "This is a gift to criminals, who will be free to offend with impunity," the party's justice spokesman Robert Jenrick told reporters. "The government is taking an important step forward by accepting most of the recommendations from this important review," says Chief Executive Andrea Coomber, but she cautioned that "the prisons crisis will not be solved by half-measures." Senior police officers have cautioned that if there will be fewer prisoners behind bars, they need more resources to manage the risk that offenders pose outside of jail.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Francisco Ayala and his wife have canceled the cruise they planned to take to see the Northern Lights this year. But given reports of people — even with legal status — being detained and questioned at US borders, Ayala said taking a trip out of the country for fun doesn't seem worth the potential risk. Travel advisers are seeing the impact of that uncertainty. More than 80% of the 460 advisers surveyed recently by TravelAge West were “very” or “somewhat” concerned about the impact of a possible economic downturn on their business, and more than half were “very” concerned about the impact of government policies. “You can't just take one angle and say, ‘Oh, the economy is having an issue. So let's find something less expensive,'” said Beci Mahnken, CEO of MEI-Travel. One shaft of light at the end of that tunnel could be savings on last-minute summer trips as travelers increasingly take a wait-and-see stance with their plans. Mahnken and her travel agency staff started getting phone calls from clients, calling to cancel vacations they had booked or seeking refundable trips. She said they were fearful because their 401(k)s and other investments had taken a dive. That uncertainty, she says, made them pause on discretionary spending like a summer trip. Until that moment, Mahnken said, the frenzy of heightened “revenge travel” activity that started after pandemic restrictions lifted had not slowed over the course of four years. “We were still on this incredible high,” Mahnken said. Flight analytics firm Cirium pulled flight booking data from online travel agencies from the end of January through early May, when people typically book summer trips. That data, which Cirium shared with CNN, indicates that bookings for travel in June, July and August are down nearly 10% when looking at flights from major US airports to favorite European destinations, compared to the same period last year. That substantial drop is unusual, according to Jeremy Bowen, CEO of Cirium. Related article The top 10 US beaches for 2025, according to ‘Dr. Data on US travelers booking summer trips to Asia is a bit more mixed, with increased bookings to destinations like Hong Kong and Tokyo, but decreases in flights booked to other major cities in the region. But it's what Mahnken calls a “bouncing ball” that could change again tomorrow. Mahnken, who has been in the travel industry since before 9/11, remembers how travelers behaved after terrorist attacks, during the 2008 recession and post-Covid. But the challenge this time, she says, is a combination of those experiences, including economic unpredictability and geopolitical forces. In fact, Deloitte data released on May 20 shows a 5% increase in Americans planning to take leisure trips this summer, but they may be taking cheaper trips than ones planned just months ago. That could mean more road trips, rather than dealing with flights that would have to be canceled in case the whole trip is scrapped, Mahnken said. That's especially true for anyone concerned about their job stability, or people worried they might have to scale back on discretionary spending if markets take another tumble. “We have people (who) are tending to now book closer in, rather than booking farther out, because … they feel more comfortable with their situation over the next four to six months, as opposed to the next eight to 12, which is a normal booking window for big vacations,” she said. For Ayala, this environment means being strategic about which trips are worth taking. “I actually don't believe that we're going to have a full-blown recession,” Ayala said. “But we are definitely going to have a slowing down of the economy, at least … If you can save yourself a hassle and save yourself the money, this would be the year to do it.” He and his wife canceled their cruise to Alaska, departing from a Canadian port, after seeing several European nations issue warnings to their citizens about potential problems entering the United States. Still, Ayala said he fears being profiled coming back from those trips just because of his name, even if there is no malice on the side of the border agent. I do think that there is a non-zero chance that I will have to call my employer and say, ‘Hey, guess what? The difference in the way people are booking summer travel, and where they're going, could create opportunities for people looking for a last-minute deal. Tiffany Funk, co-founder of point.me, a travel points optimization site, said people with loyalty points should use them, because they're worth more now than they will be in the future. Funk said people can be surprised at how much farther points will take them internationally than on domestic trips. “There's actually some deals to be had in places like New England and the coast of Maine, where typically you would have had to book in some cases years ago, in order to secure availability there. But we're seeing some good deals there,” Funk said. “Florida, you have the Gulf Coast, where you can get some pretty decent pricing on very popular family-friendly destinations that are usually just horrifically expensive for summer vacations,” she said. Mahnken said as cruise lines continue to launch megaships that were in production long before the current economic turbulence, they will need to fill rooms. “I am seeing a lot of cruise lines do incredibly good sales for their closer-in [dates],” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American penny isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The US Treasury Department announced Thursday that it plans to start winding down production of the one-cent coin it has been minting for more than 230 years. But the penny will still remain legal tender, and will still be in use at thousands of retailers around the country for sometime to come. “If we look at the experience in Canada, for the first year after they stopped making pennies, there's really no change in transactions,” Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores, told CNN. Convenience stores do more cash transactions than any other group, about 32 million a day, or about 20% of the total number of purchases by their customers, Lenard said. The National Retail Federation, which represents most major US store chains as well as thousands of small retailers, also said it anticipates its members will use pennies even after production stops at some point early next year, although it does anticipate that many will round cash transactions to the nearest nickel once the supply of pennies at banks starts to run short. “Retailers' primary goal is serving customers and making this transition as seamless as possible,” said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations for NRF. There are an estimated 114 billion pennies currently in circulation, but they are “severely underutilized” according to the Treasury department. The math says that all those pennies could fill a cube roughly 13 stories high. Many people don't even take them as change, tossing them into the leave-a-penny-take-a-penny dishes at store checkouts. Lenard said the large number of pennies in circulation means that retailers won't necessary run out of them for a while. But eventually stores won't be able to get new rolls of pennies from their banks and will start rounding transactions up or down to the nearest nickel. The decision when to do that will rest with each retailer, not official government policy. Electronic transactions such as credit and debit card purchases, will continue to be down to the penny, Lenard said, with only cash transactions being rounded. Canada's finance ministry said pennies retain their value for transactions “indefinitely” despite the fact that it stopped making the coin in 2012. I think if someone wants to pay with pennies, most retailers will err on the side of making those customers happy.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

As the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in federal funding to scientific research, thousands of scientists in the U.S. lost their jobs or grants — and governments and universities around the world spotted an opportunity. In this photo provided by the University Health Network, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, center, stands with other government and UHN officials in custom hockey jerseys during the announcement of the “Canada Leads” program in Toronto on Monday, April 7, 2025. Australia's “Global Talent Attraction Program,” announced in April, promises competitive salaries and relocation packages. Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities. “The Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration's projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people's priorities and continue our innovative dominance,” said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. — but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent. “There are threats to science ... south of the border,” said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada's leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the “Canada Leads” recruitment drive. Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom. French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen attend the “Choose Europe for Science” event at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Monday, May 5, 2025. Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution's “Safe Place for Science” program. “Our American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,” he said of applicants. “What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.” It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives. But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to “Safe Place for Science” — 139 out of 300 total — came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists. Modern and traditional architecture is seen at the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research in Muelheim, Germany, Friday, May 23, 2025. Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend. Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., “we are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.” Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. “I've never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,” said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. Still, she wasn't sure of her next move. “It's no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,” she said. “Science is a global endeavor,” said Patrick Cramer, head of the Max Planck Society, noting that datasets and discoveries are often shared among international collaborators. Researchers worldwide will suffer if collaborations are shut down and databases taken offline, scientists say. “The U.S. was always an example, in both science and education,” said Patrick Schultz, president of France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology. So the cuts and policies were “very frightening also for us because it was an example for the whole world.”</p>

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the Trump administration's hopes to change birthright citizenship amid some pushback, on 'America Reports.' The Supreme Court heard a case this month centered on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end so-called birthright citizenship, in one of the most closely watched and potentially impactful cases heard by the court in recent years. Though the case itself was used largely as a means of challenging lower court powers to issue so-called universal or nationwide injunctions, justices on the high court did inquire about the merits of the order itself, "Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship," which Trump signed on the first day of his second White House term. Despite the Supreme Court's focus on universal injunctions in hearing the case, deep and unyielding concerns persist about Trump's attempt to undo more than 100 years of legal precedent. U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts (R) as Melania Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump look on after being sworn in during inauguration ceremonies in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Chip Somodevilla/Pool via Reuters/File Photo (Reuters) The ACLU included in its lawsuit the story of one couple from Indonesia but living in New Hampshire whom they said would be affected by the order. "They arrived in 2023, applied for asylum, and their application awaits review," ACLU attorneys said of the couple. "The mom-to-be is in her third trimester. "Under this executive order, their baby would be considered an undocumented noncitizen and could be denied basic health care and nutrition, putting the newborn at grave risk at such a vulnerable stage of life," they added. And such problems would persist throughout their lives, lawyers for the group noted. These persons would not be able to obtain necessary identification, such as drivers' licenses, and would not be able to vote, hold some jobs or serve on juries. Though Trump had spoken in detail in his first term and on the campaign trail about wanting to end birthright citizenship, his executive order sent shockwaves through the nation. It was met by a wave of lawsuits from Democrat-led states and immigrants' rights groups. Demonstrators hold up signs during a "Hands Off!" Roughly 150,000 children are born annually in the U.S. to parents of noncitizens. If the order were to take force as Trump envisioned, experts warned the impact would be catastrophic. ​​"President Trump's attempt to unilaterally end birthright citizenship is a flagrant violation of our Constitution," New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, who joined 17 other Democrat-led states in suing to block the order, said earlier this year. "For more than 150 years, our country has followed the same basic rule: Babies who are born in this country are American citizens," Platkin added.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera has the latest on the legal dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard University over foreign enrollment on ‘Fox Report.' President Donald Trump on Sunday criticized foreign countries for paying "nothing" toward the education of their citizens who are attending college at Harvard and other U.S. institutions. "Why isn't Harvard saying that almost 31% of their students are from FOREIGN LANDS, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay NOTHING toward their student's education, nor do they ever intend to," Trump wrote early Sunday morning on Truth Social. President Donald Trump criticized foreign countries for paying "nothing" towards the education of their citizens who are attending college at Harvard and other U.S. institutions. "We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, but Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming," he continued. Harvard has $52,000,000, use it, and stop asking for the Federal Government to continue GRANTING money to you!" "It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students," Harvard wrote in its complaint. A Graduate School of Arts and Sciences flag on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, on Wednesday, April 16, 2025. The Department of Homeland Security moved to terminate Harvard's visa program after the university allegedly failed to provide extensive behavioral records of student visa holders the agency had requested. The records sought include any footage of protest activity involving student visa holders, even if it's not criminal, and the disciplinary records of all student visa holders in the past five years. Requested records also include footage or documentation of illegal, dangerous or violent activity by student visa holders, any records of threats or the deprivation of rights of other students or university personnel. DHS had moved to terminate Harvard's visa program after the university allegedly failed to provide extensive behavioral records of student visa holders the agency had requested. Harvard called the new policy "pernicious" and accused the administration of departing from "decades of settled practice" and coming "without rational explanation." At least a dozen Harvard students have had their student visas revoked over campus protest activity. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said before Congress on Tuesday that the administration has probably revoked thousands already and would "proudly" revoke more. The administration has already frozen close to $3 billion in federal funding to the university, largely dedicated to research, over claims that Harvard has not adequately responded to alleged campus antisemitism in protests and has not moved to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion practices.

Fox News Digital spoke with Julia Mossbridge, the founder and board chair of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT), about a mysterious metal sphere that was discovered in Buga, Colombia. Scientists have made a remarkable discovery of a sphere that some believe to be an unidentified flying object (UFO). The sphere, according to social media page @Truthpolex, was spotted March 2 flying over the town of Buga, Colombia, before it landed. Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers studying the three-layered sphere, noted that it shows "no welds or joints," characteristics normally indicative of human manufacture, which further bolstered his belief in its extraterrestrial origin. "It looks to me like a really cool art project," she said, urging caution in drawing immediate conclusions. Mossbridge framed the mysterious object as part of a "bigger picture" in which humanity must confront its own limitations. "We are entering a time when we don't have the control that we thought we had," she said, noting that prior "grandiose" beliefs in total mastery blind us when "something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world. Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies, what's in our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us," she said. She says sightings of unexplained objects have been around for decades. "Frankly, we've been looking at UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) for decades, and the federal government has admitted that there are things that we don't understand, but we are investigating them," she said. "They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters and actually trying to get international cooperation around these things," she said. Mossbridge urged thorough vetting before declaring anomalies in mysterious discoveries. "Before you decide something's anomalous or a UFO, bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project," she said. She said experts can determine if the material is "clearly non-human-made." Despite her misgivings about the discovery in Buga, she said it doesn't "discount all the other objects that are of extraterrestrial origin."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This 5-foot tall stone slab bearing the Ten Commandments stands near the Capitol in Austin, Texas, in this July 29, 2002 file photo. AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas would require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a Republican proposal that cleared a major vote Saturday and would make the state the nation's largest to impose such a mandate. If passed as expected, the measure is likely to draw a legal challenge from critics who consider it a constitutional violation of the separation of church and state. Greg Abbott, who has indicated he will sign it into law. “The focus of this bill is to look at what is historically important to our nation educationally and judicially,” said Republican state representative Candy Noble, a co-sponsor of the bill. Two other states, Louisiana and Arkansas, have similar laws, but Louisiana's is on hold after a federal judge found that it was “ unconstitutional on its face.” Those measures are among efforts, mainly in conservative-led states, to insert religion into public schools. The vote in Texas came after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively ended a publicly funded Catholic charter school in Oklahoma on Thursday with a 4-4 tie following a string of high court decisions in recent years that have allowed public funds to flow to religious entities. Texas lawmakers also have passed and sent to Abbott a measure that allows school districts to provide students and staff a daily voluntary period of prayer or time to read a religious text during school hours. “We should be encouraging our students to read and study their Bible every day,” Republican state Rep. Brent Money said. But critics, including some Christian and other faith leaders, say the Ten Commandments and prayer measures would infringe on the religious freedom of others. The Ten Commandments bill requires public schools to post in classrooms a 16-by-20-inch (41-by-51-centimeter) poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, even though translations and interpretations vary across denominations, faiths and languages and may differ in homes and houses of worship. Democratic lawmakers made several failed attempts Saturday to amend the bill to require schools display other religious texts or provide multiple translations of the commandments. A letter signed this year by dozens of Christian and Jewish faith leaders opposing the bill noted that Texas has thousands of students of other faiths who might have no connection to the Ten Commandments. Texas has nearly 6 million students in about 9,100 public schools.
