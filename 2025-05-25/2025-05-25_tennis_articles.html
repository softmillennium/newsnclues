                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Sabalenka, kicked off Sunday's slate of play on Paris' main stage.ByAssociated PressPublished May 25, 2025 copy_link PARIS (AP) ‚Äî Lorenzo Musetti and Aryna Sabalenka eased into the second round of the French Open without dropping a set on Sunday's opening day.The eighth-seeded Musetti won 7-5, 6-2, 6-0 against qualifier Yannick Hanfmann of Germany, after the top-ranked Sabalenka earlier beat Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-0. Musetti has been in strong form on clay, reaching at least the semifinals in the past three Masters tournaments at Rome, Madrid and Monte Carlo, where he lost in the final to four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz. But he was hampered by a right-leg injury in that match.Musetti did not look troubled on Sunday, however, and cupped his ear to the crowd after making an improbable forehand winner down the line from Hanfmann's drop shot during the third set.After winning his match, Musetti got a huge ovation from the crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier.Was it because Musetti won Italy's first Olympic tennis medal in 100 years with the men's singles bronze at the Paris Games last year? Or perhaps because, as a 19-year-old, Musetti was once up by two sets against Novak Djokovic in the fourth round before losing a five-set thriller in 2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Czech pair are highly motivated to compete at Roland Garros after their first ATP Tour triumph in Morocco.ByFlorian HeerPublished May 25, 2025 copy_link Despite receiving little media attention, Petr Nouza and Patrik Rikl quietly emerged last season as one of the most consistent and successful doubles teams on the ATP Challenger Tour. It was the perfect debut, and it didn't stop there: titles followed in Tenerife (also on hard court) and then on clay in San Marino, Sevilla and Bad Waltersdorf.Breakthrough on the ATP TourIn April this year, Nouza and Rikl made another major leap forward by winning their first ATP Tour title at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech. The success not only added another trophy to their cabinet but also propelled both into the highest rankings of their careers. Patrik Rikl holds a career-high of World No. 65 in the ATP Doubles Rankings, while Petr Nouza, who captured six Challenger titles in 2023 with different partners and broke into the Top 100 for the first time, sits just a few places behind at No. It was only at the beginning of 2024 that the two 26-year-olds from Prague officially joined forces‚Äîbut their impact was immediate.

You need to get along, or it just won't work.‚ÄùNouza echoes the sentiment: ‚ÄúAs he said, we get along really well. Our playing styles complement each other nicely, and we both serve pretty strongly. There's still a lot of potential to improve, but we're working every day to get better.‚ÄùAll-in on doublesOriginally, both had set their sights on singles careers, but injuries forced them to pivot. ‚ÄúWe both struggled with injuries,‚Äù explains Rikl, who has undergone two knee surgeries. Nouza adds, ‚ÄúAt this point, probably every body part has taken a hit, especially our wrists. Playing doubles is just physically easier.‚ÄùBut it's not just about health, there's a thrill to doubles, too.‚ÄúThere's the adrenaline,‚Äù Nouza says. ‚ÄúI don't know if there's a secret to winning,‚Äù Rikl says. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that we're friends, not just on court, but off it, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS, - American men have reduced the gap with European players in the last decade but Grand Slam success will remain the gold standard to measure tennis greatness, United States number two Tommy Paul said at the French Open on Sunday. Paul's compatriot Taylor Fritz had a chance to end his country's wait for a first men's major since Andy Roddick's 2003 U.S. Open triumph, but he was soundly beaten in last year's Flushing Meadows final by Jannik Sinner. That defeat raised fresh questions about the U.S. men, with Italian Sinner and Spain's Carlos Alcaraz now extending European superiority after two decades of dominance by Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic. I wouldn't say the gap has closed. Over the past six years or so, we've definitely made it smaller," Paul said. "We've been hearing our whole lives how we haven't had a Grand Slam champion in so long," Paul added. "To have him in the finals there was huge for U.S. tennis, huge for him and for all of us in terms of belief. I think it's great for the sport." Paul, who reached the semi-finals of the Italian Open earlier this month, beat Elmer Moller 6-7 6-2 6-3 6-1 at the French Open on Sunday to book a clash with Marton Fucsovics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Victoria Mboko is still just 18, still rather new to the top level of professional tennis, and yet with a big serve, a terrific backhand and enviable court coverage, the Canadian is making the most of her first season on tour, including a victory in her Grand Slam debut on Sunday at the French Open in Paris. When it was mentioned that her 6-1, 7-6 (4) elimination of 2024 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Lulu Sun meant Mboko has claimed all eight sets she's played over the past week-plus on the red clay at Roland-Garros ‚Äî including six in a trio of triumphs in the qualifying rounds ‚Äî the Toronto teen laughed, revealing the braces on her teeth. "This does, obviously, feel really quick for me. I want to be in this level," said Mboko, represented by talent agency IMG since the age of 12. The more I feel like I make it seem normal to me, the more normal it's going to be in these tournaments." Against the left-handed Sun, Mboko's serve ‚Äî which she considers her game's greatest strength ‚Äî played a significant role in the outcome. With her father and two of her older siblings in the stands at Court 9, a short walk from Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Mboko reached a top speed of 115 mph and delivered seven aces. "I love to dictate points on my serve, and I love to use that as an opportunity to be more aggressive and be up in the score," said Mboko, who is currently ranked 120th. "Especially in women's tennis, having a good serve and holding all the time is pretty crucial. Her favourite player as a kid ‚Äî not all that long ago, actually ‚Äî was Serena Williams, whose 23 Grand Slam titles often came with the help of top-notch serving. "I always modelled myself on the idea of her game. Of course, not everything I do is the same. Mboko began to really get noticed in the world of tennis at the start of this year, when she won 22 matches in a row ‚Äî all in straight sets ‚Äî to earn four lower-level International Tennis Federation titles. Her first WTA match arrived at the Miami Open in March, and she won that debut, too. She's been impressing opponents along the way, including 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff. Mboko pushed the American, who is ranked No. 2 right now, to three sets on clay at the Italian Open this month. "She's playing top-level tennis," Gauff said after that win. As far as the other parts of her game, she's obviously a big hitter, can play well, moves pretty well, has a nice backhand, same on the forehand." Mboko grew up playing mostly on indoor hard courts in Canada and calls that her "favorite surface for my whole life." That said, she's starting to get used to ‚Äî and enjoy ‚Äî the clay used at the French Open. I feel like I've been doing pretty OK on the clay so far, even though it was my least favorite surface and I thought it was my worst surface, too," Mboko said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) ‚Äî Tommy Paul was pleased to come back to win his first-round match at the French Open on Sunday, of course, but perhaps not as thrilled as he was to discuss regaining the truck that was repossessed back home in Florida when he accidentally missed some payments. The 12th-seeded Paul kept on truckin' with his clay-court results at Roland-Garros by eliminating Elmer Moller of Denmark 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 at Court Simonne-Mathieu on a day that alternated a light rain and heavy wind with sunshine. I didn't know it happened like that. I didn't know how quick they would come and grab it ‚Äî like in the middle of the night,‚Äù Paul said. To be in Europe while it happened is even crazier. He found out that the truck was gone when his trainer ‚Äî who was back in Florida ‚Äî asked Paul to check his security camera footage to see whether there were any packages that had been delivered to the house and needed to be picked up. ‚ÄúI'm like, ‚ÄòWhat the hell is going on? There's a tow truck coming and taking my car!' I thought it was stolen at first,‚Äù he said. When he figured it out, Paul took to social media and posted the black-and-white footage of his property being towed away from his driveway, adding a soundtrack of Celine Dion's ‚ÄúMy Heart Will Go On.‚Äù Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner went more than three months without match action before returning at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia. But what did we learn about Sinner's performance beyond wins and losses? An Infosys ATP Beyond The Numbers analysis shows that his return performance in Rome will raise the alarm for opponents. More impressively, in his first five matches of the tournament, the four-time ATP Masters 1000 champion won 48 per cent of his return games. But it is critical to perform your best under the brightest spotlight, which for Sinner was in the final against Carlos Alcaraz. Nevertheless, for his first tournament after a period away from competition, it was a positive sign for the No. To put the effort into context, only one player has won close to the same rate of return games on clay this season and that is Alcaraz, with the exact same 39.3 winning percentage. In just one tournament, Sinner performed well enough to lead the ATP Tour's 2025 clay leaderboard in first-serve return points won (40.8%) and second-serve return points won (57.8%). Sinner, who has won 54 per cent of second-serve return points in his career, is known for his powerful baseline strokes. After time away, it would have been understandable if it took time for him to get used to not only putting first deliveries back in play, but doing so well enough to eventually win the point. The Rome finalist has won 35 per cent of first-serve return points on clay during his career. That means his first-serve returning success improved by more than 15 per cent in the Italian capital. In five of his six matches, Sinner won more than 40 per cent of his first-serve return points. Entering the final, his win rate was 44 per cent. ‚ÄúI am closer than expected in a way [for] everything. But in the other way, it was good. It was a great week for me. It's a lot of ups and downs.‚Äù No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John McEnroe is a tennis legend, with seven Grand Slam titles to his name, including three Wimbledon championships and four US Open crowns. Since retiring from the game, McEnroe has embarked on multiple different career paths, including music, punditry and commentating, but also briefly took a coaching position with a former Wimbledon finalist. Ahead of Roland Garros, which is now underway, he recently hinted at a return to coaching when, in an appearance on ‚ÄòInside the NBA', McEnroe indicated there was a player on the ATP tour he could help. When asked on the show to pick which American has the best chance of winning a Grand Slam title, McEnroe said: ‚ÄúBen Shelton to me. The American legend added: ‚ÄúHis Dad coaches him. But he would be the best [hope].‚Äù McEnroe thinks he could help Shelton get over the line at Grand Slams, where the young star has come close before. Shelton made his main draw debut at a major in 2022, when he appeared in the first round of the US Open. In the same season, Shelton had his best Grand Slam campaign to date, when he made the semi-finals of the 2023 US Open, before ultimately bowing out to Novak Djokovic. Shelton will now look to make a deep run at Roland Garros this year, where he is the 13th seed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The past fortnight has been a whirlwind of emotion for Arthur Rinderknech, and the ride isn't over yet. Fresh from his wedding to partner Hortense Boscher in Brittany last week, the 29-year-old Frenchman prepares for a pivotal moment at Roland Garros. Rinderknech will take on the No. I got married hardly a week ago, so this is a beautiful part of my private life that is taking place, and I want to continue surfing on this wave,‚Äù Rinderknech said in his pre-tournament press conference on Saturday. ‚ÄúObviously the first round is not going to be easy. ‚ÄúAfter all, some people say it's better to play him [Sinner] in the first round than the finals. I would have liked to play him in the finals, but I respect him very well. He's a great player, I'm impatient. Rinderknech will hope to continue that wave against a player he has notched success against in the past. Aiming to forge another memorable win on the surface, Rinderknech will have the backing of a raucous home crowd on his side when they step foot on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Rinderknech first competed against Sinner in 2021 and then played him twice more over the next eight months, so is well placed to comment on the Italian's development. I saw him develop and blossom, and he's a guy I have a lot of respect for,‚Äù said Rinderknech. It's very nice when a player like him says hello to everyone when he comes into the lockers. I believe we have a very good relationship.‚Äù If Rinderknech is successful against Sinner, he will face a second-round meeting with Terence Atmane or Richard Gasquet, who is retiring at the conclusion of the tournament. ‚ÄúI can picture myself there already,‚Äù said Rinderknech, who owns a 2-5 record at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. ‚ÄúI saw that I was lucky enough to play against Richard here at Roland Garros two years ago. He's a great guy, and I hope for both of us that we play the second round. It [would] be a great pleasure.‚Äù A post shared by Arthur Rinderknech (@arthurrinder) Rinderknech will hope to continue that wave against a player he has notched success against in the past.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The final round of press conferences will also wrap up, with Novak Djokovic set to face the media following his triumph in Geneva yesterday. There are no British players in action on day one, where world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka gets proceedings underway on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Rafael Nadal will also be honoured on the main show court where he won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Rafael Nadal said farewell to Court Philippe-Chatrier for the final time with a special guest after being honoured in an emotional tribute ceremony. Federer, Djokovic and Murray have left Court Philippe-Chatrier but Nadal has been asked to stay behind to receive his own send-off. Rafael Nadal addressed Federer, Djokovic and Murray after they came out for his special celebration on Court Philippe-Chatrier. We became tennis players, we played in the most important tennis stadiums," he told his rivals in an emotional address. They remained on the court as Nadal received a special trophy from tournament director Amelie Mauresmo and FFT President Gilles Moretton. Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have walked onto the court to honour their old rival, Rafael Nadal. A video montage of Big Four highlights played in the stadium before Federer, Djokovic and Murray shared a video message. Some dancers performed in front of him before a group of French Open support staff took to the court, and he started sobbing. "This is a combination of dancers and ballkids who have come onto the court to form a human 'merci' for Rafael Nadal," commentators said. "Now they're joined by a collection of people who have helped and supported Rafa Nadal and all the players here at Roland Garros for many, many years. Rafael Nadal became tearful as he thanked his uncle Toni, who started coaching him when he was a young boy and only left his team at the end of 2017. Rafael Nadal is addressing the crowd inside Court Philippe-Chatrier with a speech. "In 2005 I was finally able to play here for the first time. My first major experience was the match that I played against my childhood friend and rival, Richard Gasquet," he said. "From that day on, I fully understood what Roland Garros meant. "I've had incredible rivals like Andy, Novak, and, of course, Roger. Rafael Nadal's ceremony has only just started and he's already looking teary. The 14-time champion in Paris is currently watching on as a video plays on the screens inside Court Philippe-Chatrier showing all of his highlights at Roland Garros. Fans are decked out in custom shirts and Merci Rafa signs have been projected across the court. His uncle Toni is also here along with around 90 members of his friends and family, and he looks just as emotional. Nadal's wife and son are also watching on. Rafael Nadal has stepped out onto Court Philippe-Chatrier for a special tribute ceremony. Everyone in the 15,000-strong stadium is wearing a special, clay-coloured t-shirt saying "merci Rafa". Musetti wrapped up the final set to love and says he felt the pressure because of everybody anticipating Nadal. Musetti is a double break ahead in the third set, leading Hanfmann 7-5, 6-2, 3-0. Fans are starting to get excited for what could be Rafael Nadal's final appearance at Roland Garros for a while. Emma Raducanu's former coach Philippe Dehaes has shared a sure-fire way for somebody to be sacked while working with the 2021 US Open champion. Long before that Grand Slam success, the Brit was working with Dehaes, who has also coached Daria Kasatkina, Elise Mertens and Greet Minnen. And in a new book, he revealed why Raducanu may be so fussy with her mentors. "You cannot send her to play a match without giving her a lot of information about the opponent,‚Äù he said. But if you started the job and you don't know that she loves to know a lot of info, after three weeks you'll be fired, that's for sure.‚Äù The Russian led qualifier Anastasiya Konstantinovna Soboleva 5-0 in the first set when she suffered a huge collapse and lost six games in a row, allowing her opponent to serve for the set. Shnaider then had three break-back points when she fell and immediately had to stop playing, calling the physio. She had a medical time out and play resumed almost six minutes later. Medics have rushed to Court Philippe-Chatrier during Lorenzo Musetti's clash with Yannick Hanfmann. They're flying through the matches on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Olympic gold medalist Qinwen Zheng has beaten Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4, 6-3. We are awaiting the conclusion of Lorenzo Musetti vs Yannick Hanfmann and then Rafael Nadal will make his way on court. Ahead of Rafael Nadal's planned tribute ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier, organisers have been handing out special t-shirts to those in the stands. Lorenzo Musetti is not a name on many pundits' lips when predicting who will win the French Open title. Musetti reached the Monte-Carlo Masters final, and semi-finals in Madrid and Rome, in the build-up to Roland Garros. "I arrived Paris with an ambition to win Roland Garros," he said. I'm ready to chase big titles and consider myself a contender for the title. And play has resumed on the outside courts. It's been a bleak day at Roland Garros weather-wise but the fans aren't letting that stop them from enjoying the action. The rain is letting up and the outside courts are being uncovered, with spectators flocking back to their seats before matches resume. There's a buzz around the grounds today with 14-time champion Rafael Nadal already back on site ahead of his tribute ceremony later this afternoon. An absolutely stacked day two schedule has just been released and Carlos Alcaraz, the defending champion, has not been selected for the biggest court. The Spaniard has been given a daytime slot. Top seed Aryna Sabalenka raced through her opening match at the French Open, but she still believes she needs some extra help. Ahead of Rafael Nadal's tribute ceremony later today, the world No. 1 said she wanted to seek him out and get some advice to help her finally claim the trophy in Paris. "Whenever someone asks me about Rafa the first thing which comes to my mind is a really hard worker. Everything he's achieved is through really hard work and he's been an inspiration to me, an inspiration to so many players so I'm really grateful for a great example," she said on court. The world No.1 has destroyed Kamilla Rakhimova 6-1, 6-0 on Court Philippe-Chatrier Five aces and 71% of first serve points won sees Aryna Sabalenka cruise into the second round. Elina Svitolina has made a flying start, beating Zeynep Sonmez 6-1, 6-1. The first seed has also fallen with Peyton Stearns, seeded No. ‚ÄúI love the fact that she has been out on the match court week in, week out and playing a busy schedule. ‚ÄúWhat is good is that she has invested that commitment and she has been getting the rewards. Sometimes it can take time for success to come. The fact that Emma is such a good player means we are seeing the results and progress come quickly for her.‚Äù Matteo Berrettini, Kei Nishikori, Emil Rusuvuori, Roberto Carballes Baena and Raphael Collignon also withdrew. Naomi Osaka dropped down to Challenger level to compete at the WTA 125k Saint-Malo earlier this month - and she won the title. "I would say yes, there was a lot of pressure," she explained. We're not on about the iconic daytime TV show here. Aryna Sabalenka has revealed that she loves being the world No.1 because it puts a huge target on her back. "Honestly, I just love it so much, knowing there's someone chasing me," she said. Every time I go out there, it's like, 'OK, let's see who's ready for the pressure moments'." Novak Djokovic has claimed that Andy Murray and Roger Federer are planning to join him in honouring Rafael Nadal during the Spaniard's ceremony. "Along with Federer and Murray, we will be there for the ceremony. Rafael Nadal will be during at a ceremoney on Court Philippe-Chatrier today. ‚ÄúHe will not be playing this year at Roland Garros, but he will be very present by our side for this 2025 edition,‚Äù said Ronald Garros tournament director and Olympic silver medallist Amelie Mauresmo. ‚ÄúRafa has an important bond with Roland Garros; we want it to be a surprise.‚Äù "These days, social media is more important than anything else," Zverev explained. For us tennis players, the insults we are exposed to daily online and on social media are extreme, because a lot of it happens via hidden messages, direct messages and the like. I would probably have been accused of just taking the money and leaving after one match. That I wasn't taking the tournament seriously, and so on. Tennis has a strong culture of blame among fans and also on social media." Novak Djokovic may have won the Geneva Open title yesterday, but Mats Wilander thinks he has a big problem at the French Open. Wilander said: "Once you get to five-set tournaments, where he's won so many of them, I think [his] confidence will come soaring back. Good morning and welcome back to our coverage of the French Open. Play gets underway on the outside courts at 10am BST, with the show courts kicking off an hour later. John McEnroe believes Andy Murray will stop coaching following his split with Novak Djokovic. The American shared his thoughts on the duo's partnership before arguing that Murray will quit coaching now to spend more time at home instead with his children. So I'm guessing he doesn't want to do that.‚Äù It all begins tomorrow at Roland Garros, and we're in for a very exciting fortnight. Aryna Sabalenka is among the big-name stars getting their French Open campaigns underway tomorrow. Here is a quick look at some of the biggest matches from tomorrow. Ben Shelton v Lorenzo Sonego (from 7:15pm UK time) It will be an emotional day as the French Open organisers have planned a special ceremony for the retired Rafael Nadal tomorrow. Jasmine Paolini has assessed her chances of glory at the French Open. Ahead of the tournament getting underway, Paolini has named four rivals who stand in her way at Roland Garros - them being Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Zheng Qinwen and Mirra Andreeva. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has criticised the ceremony Rafael Nadal received at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga in November last year. I think they had planned that ceremony later in the event and were surprised by the elimination of Spain on Day 1. Every tournament in the world should pay tribute to him, including Roland Garros. Rafa has made the history of this tournament more than any other player, which is why it will certainly be a beautiful moment." Hubert Hurkacz was very gracious in defeat after his final loss to Djokovic. "It's really inspiring how you present yourself on the court and off the court, it's really incredible what you have achieved so congratulations for that and what you are doing for the whole sport of tennis." It was a bitter defeat for Hubert Hurkacz to take after he went a set ahead, and Djokovic apologised after claiming victory. Novak Djokovic has sealed glory in Geneva, coming from a set behind to beat Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2). It's his 100th singles titles and he becomes just the third ever player to reach that milestone. Not bad preparation ahead of the French Open... Flavio Cobolli overcame Andrey Rublev in straight sets to claim the Hamburg Open title. And afterwards, he said he'll be having some celebratory drinks this evening ahead of his French Open campaign beginning on Monday. He said during his winning speech on the court: "I just want to hold the trophy and maybe drink a little bit tonight for this amazing day." Novak Djokovic has stayed alive in the Geneva Open final after claiming the second set in a nail-biting tie-break against Hubert Hurkacz. All to play for in the final set... Naomi Osaka has revealed she endured a 'scary' wake-up call at 5am in Paris to be drug tested. She was targeted by anti-doping control before the French Open. Yeah, for me, anti-doping is like - I don't have a great relationship with them, just because they always come and take blood and urine, which I don't know if that disgusts people to say, but whatever, and my veins are, like, very notoriously hard to find. "One person once told me it was like a Japanese thing. Yeah, so they come at 5am and 'stick' me multiple times. "And today was kind of scary, because the last year I was here they also came at 5:00am, and the lady couldn't find my veins at all. "I had huge bruises on my arms for a while. And yeah, today was a success because luckily I had to use the bathroom when they woke me up, so..." Jacob Fearnley is on a Scottish revenge mission against the Swiss star who beat Andy Murray here last year. But the British No.2 admits he still gets star-struck by meeting tennis superstars. He said: ‚ÄúWe can see it like a Scottish revenge mission. I couldn't remember if it was last year or not, but yeah, definitely we could see it like that. Hopefully I can get the revenge for Scotland!‚Äù Hubert Hurkacz has taken the first set against Novak Djokovic! What a turn-up for the books this could be. Daniil Medvedev has warned his French Open rivals that he has never felt in better form on the red dirt. ‚ÄúOn clay I personally feel like I'm playing, honestly, the best level of my life on clay, even considering Rome title [in 2023],‚Äù the former world No 1 said. ‚ÄúOn hard courts it's easier for me to answer that, yes, I'm far from the Daniil that I was on hard courts. ‚ÄúThat's good for Roland-Garros because I'll try to show it.‚Äù Emma Raducanu is fighting her fear of needles to get fit for the French Open. The former US Open champion admitted she is not ‚Äú100%‚Äù after suffering a back spasm in her defeat in Strasbourg this week. And the British No.1 is undergoing acupuncture to be ready to face China's world No.42 Wang Xinyu in the first round here. ‚ÄúI had a spasm in Strasbourg, and just been trying to manage it as best I can doing treatment. I've been on the practice court last night and this morning. "It is similar to the problem I had in Australia, I would say the one before Australia was worse. So I think the treatment is a lot of it with the physios, a lot of it with heat. That's how I've kind of been trying to manage it.‚Äù Jodie Burrage has admitted her boyfriend missing out on Lions selection has hit her form in the build-up to the French Open. Scotland scrum half Ben White was devastated not to be picked by Andy Farrell in his 38-man squad for the tour to Australia next month. "I've been a bit preoccupied mentally, just with a few other things, and I think that's taken more out of me than I thought the last few weeks," she said. When you're in a relationship you've got to be there for your other half and he did that a lot for me last year when I spent six months out and it probably took a lot of effort for him to deal with me during that time. "So I've tried to be there for him the last few weeks, keep him positive and happy and it probably did take more than I thought out of me but at the end of the day there's always going to be things going on off the court, that just happened to be now." Katie Boulter said staying British No.1 is ‚Äúnot my goal‚Äù before she bids to win her first ever singles match at the French Open. She is now world No.38 with Emma Raducanu (43) and Sonay Kartal (53) close behind. But Boulter, who has struggled with a foot injury this year, said: ‚ÄúI've been in this space for a long time now. If my ranking is going in the right direction, I'll remain there. I want that because ultimately it means I've got to get my ranking up to hold that spot." Paula Badosa has very low expectations head into the French Open. Of course, I could get excited and excited about being close to another Grand Slam, but this isn't the reality. "Maybe at Wimbledon the situation will be different, but here I arrive having completed one tennis match in the last two months. The goal in Paris is to play as many matches as possible; every minute on the court will mean a lot to me. Stefanos Tsitsipas says he is glad that he never had to face Rafael Nadal on the Spaniard's favourite court. The Greek star said: "I was lucky not to play against him on the Chatrier, because I don't think it would have been a fun experience. "I played against him on clay, he has a knack for it, a talent, as he has done for years. "In fact, it's strange to see him stop competing and live a different life than he lived for years." Novak Djokovic gets his Geneva Open final underway and Hubert Hurkacz in around 90 minutes time. Ahead of that tie, the Serb explained how he continuously needs to adapt to stay at the top of his game. You need that mentality to get in tune with the young players. ‚ÄúI look for a lot of things every day with my team to change my approach to training and tournaments. The situation wasn't ideal before arriving here. But after the first match, I felt confident. Richard Gasquet is ready to embrace his final French Open - 20 years after first appearing at his home Grand Slam. ‚ÄúI'm feeling, of course, it's my last tournament, so it's a bit particular, a bit emotional,‚Äù Gasquet reflected. ‚ÄúBut I try my best of course when I'm going on the court to try to win, so we will see what will happen. I just know I try my best to win the match and we will see what will happen. I know what that represents, to play in a tournament like this. Nick Kyrgios has withdrawn from the doubles draw. His partner, Jordan Thompson, will instead compete alongside fellow Australian Jason Kubler. Iga Swiatek has not won a title since her French Open triumph last year and there are concerns over the Pole's form heading into the clay Slam. "Well for sure after Rome, I had a lot of time to think about how I played and what my attitude was,‚Äù Swiatek said. ‚ÄúAnd then obviously I got tight a little bit when I played with Danielle, but yeah, these are things that any athlete needs to work on, I would say." World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka kicks things off on Court Philippe-Chatrier against Kamilla Rakhimova. Ben Shelton headlines the night session when he takes on Lorenzo Sonego at 7.15pm BST. Kei Nishikori has withdrawn from the French Open meaning Carlos Alcaraz has been given a new first-round opponent. The defending champion will instead take on 23-year-old Italian Giulio Zeppieri , who is ranked No. Jack Draper is planning to talk with Andy Murray ahead of Wimbledon - but he has no plans to hire the three-time Grand Slam champion as his coach. Murray is a free agent after parting with Novak Djokovic and has long been linked with coaching a British player. ‚ÄúI'll definitely pick Andy's brains here and there. Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff were among the players present for showdown talks with Grand Slam chiefs at the French Open. Top-10 stars on the ATP and WTA Tours have made a series of demands, which include increased prize money. In March, players including Sinner, Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Aryna Sabalenka signed a letter addressed to the four Grand Slams. The letter requested an in-person meeting with tournament bosses to discuss prize money, player welfare, and allowing players a stronger say in key decisions. Jannik Sinner has been warned he faces a hostile reception when he takes on Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in his opening match at Roland Garros. Sinner returned from his doping ban at the Italian Open last week and was treated kindly at his home event. But Andy Roddick fears it won't be the same in Paris. He said: "I'm just telling you as nice as the reception was for Sinner when he had kind of that soft landing in Rome, where he was getting standing ovations by the press when he speaks to the media. "It's like two Frenchmen straight out of the gate, that's a guarantee and then Arthur Fils, he is going to hear it from the French crowd in Paris for the first week of his this year's French Open." Boris Becker says he is "lost for words" over Novak Dokovic's split with Andy Murray. "I really wanted to see them both at Wimbledon, actually. Andy knows a thing or two about winning Wimbledon, he's very popular there. I thought it would be an advantage for Novak to have Andy in his corner. I'm a little bit lost for words [as to] why they've broken up just before the second Grand Slam," Becker said. Alexander Zverev opening his press conference on Friday by admitting that his plane was struck by lightning en route to Paris and was forced to make an emergency stop. We had to do an emergency landing back in Hamburg. "It made a little noise ‚Äî no real wobbling or anything. Emma Raducanu has decided against withdrawing from the French Open after picking up an injury in Strasbourg this week. The Brit complained about "long and intense" spasms in her back, leading to suggestions that she could pull out of the clay Slam to focus on Wimbledon. But it is understood that Raducanu will take to court to face Chinese world No42 Wang Xinyu in the opening round. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage from the French Open. We'll be building up to the tournament, that gets underway tomorrow. We'll also have live updates from Novak Djokovic's clash with Hubert Hurkacz in the Geneva Open final from 2pm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it was over and the ecstatic crowd at La Caja Magic jumped to its collective feet in applause, Aryna Sabalenka did not fall to the crushed red clay beneath her, didn't scream or pump her fists or even openly exult. She merely raised her arms in a perfect V -- for victory. And then, blowing kisses to the camera, strolled to her changeover chair, fished a camera out of her bag, crossed the court and snapped a picture of her team. After that thoroughly professional 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory over Coco Gauff on Saturday, Sabalenka is now a three-time Mutua Madrid Open champion. Winning is never guaranteed, but in Sabalenka's mind, this was expected. Her will manifested itself in the moments that mattered. 1 will become only the third woman to amass more than 11,000 ranking points and is nearly 4,000 ahead of No. Sabalenka is more than 1,600 points clear of No. She's the only player with three titles so far -- Brisbane, Miami and Madrid -- and has collected back-to-back WTA 1000 titles on vastly different surfaces. Her 31 match-wins are also the most among Hologic WTA Tour players. This was Gauff's 10th match against Sabalenka in six years. ‚ÄúI feel like she just got a lot better in everything,‚Äù Gauff said. ‚ÄúI think she just probably is more confident, so that's why the consistent results are happening.‚Äù Back in January, Sabalenka was going for her third consecutive Australian Open but Keys was simply too good in the final. For Sabalenka, who started the year 11-0, it was a devastating loss. Sabalenka's won 19 of her past 21 and even with the slow surfaces in Rome and Paris looming, she's going to like her chances. A few hours after the win in Madrid, Sabalenka fielded some questions from wtatennis.com: Looking back, how did losing that Australian Open final motivate you to produce the best start of your career heading into Rome? Sabalenka: Yeah, honestly, that final was the toughest one. I really struggled to accept that match, tough loss. Then I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder. Your last two matches, four of six sets went to seven games -- you won them all ‚Ä¶ how proud are you of the fact you competed so well in the most important moments? Super happy with the level I played this week and hopefully I can keep going the way everything is going. Your defense doesn't get a lot of attention, but ‚Ä¶ against Coco how important was it to stay in some of those long points? Sabalenka: It's very important to not only be an attacking player, but in those key moments to be a good defender and dig really deep in there, try to steal a few points. It definitely brings more confidence in your game. Only four women in 40 years won their first six matches against Top 10 players in straight sets ‚Äì their names are Martina Navratilova (1986), Steffi Graf (1994, 1995 and 1996), Serena Williams (2014) -- and Aryna Sabalenka ‚Ä¶ what do you think of that? They achieved so much, these players I look up to. Me, being in the same line with them ‚Ä¶ it just sounds crazy and I couldn't be more proud. Sabalenka: I definitely feel really good about my game. And now, still, I want to get better. Three Madrid titles ‚Ä¶ the way you're playing, in your mind, can you win in Rome or Paris for the first time?</p>
