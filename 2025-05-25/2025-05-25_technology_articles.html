There's a lot of old PC coolers, motherboard, graphics cards and more which you might recognize from back in the day – despite their cloaking in dust. See this old Gainward graphics card, for example, or this Asus Maximum III Formula-based system that was owned by a heavy smoker, and here's a dust-caked Abit Fatality FP-IN9 SLI system, too. In this writer's experience, laptops are even more prone to and more badly affected by dust ingress - due to users often placing them on soft furnishings and the relatively tiny cooling systems they use. Last year we reported on a similarly grotty looking PC system from North Carolina. However, we couldn't blame the owner for lax housekeeping, as their Fractal Design Define C housed system was devastated by the terrible Hurricane Helene. That system was too far gone for even a capable electric duster like the Wolfbox MF100, currently 40% off at Amazon, to make a meaningful impact.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Following the ban of its Hopper H20 accelerations in China, Nvidia is reportedly planning on launching new Blackwell-based solutions at a lower price this year, per Reuters. With mass production anticipated by June, we can expect these solutions to be widely available in the Chinese market by Q3 or Q4. Due to stringent U.S. export policies targeting China, the Hopper family has largely been a cat-and-mouse chase between U.S. regulators and Nvidia. Even before their official debut, the flagship H100 and H200 accelerators were already subject to export bans. Nvidia introduced the H800 to circumvent these regulations, which eventually faced a similar fate in October 2023. Further clarification by tipster Jukanlosreve at X, citing a report from China's GF Securities, suggests the RTX Pro 6000D will be dubbed B40 (likely a successor to the Ada Lovelace L40). Reuters classifies this as a server-class GPU which uses traditional GDDR7 memory instead of HBM, and notably avoids the use of TSMC's CoWoS packaging technology, likely signaling at its monolithic nature. There are two possibilities based on the available data. Nvidia's latest RTX Pro Blackwell servers employ up to eight RTX Pro 6000 GPUs, connected via ConnectX-8 SuperNICs with integrated PCIe 6.0 switches, for GPU-to-GPU communication. This setup is likely what we'll see for the B40, with scaling beyond eight GPUs expected to be handled by Nvidia's Spectrum-X networking platform.

International Blockchain Consulting Group founder Mario Nawfal first shared this info on his X (formerly Twitter) account, saying, “Why dig through link farms when you can just Grok it and get straight to the point?” Elon Musk then reposted this, adding the caption, “AI will obviate search @grok”. And even though Google sometimes tries to get the best results on the front page of search engine results pages, many “SEO specialists” game the system just to get their websites on top. There's also the issue of sponsored results, which can confuse people who just want the best answer to their queries. Instead, you must always ask it for sources so you can ascertain for yourself if the answer it returned is true or false. This might be an issue, though, if a user does not do this verification step and takes AI answers as gospel. More importantly, nothing in this world is free. AI companies are investing billions into research and development, so they have to some way, somehow, make money from it. So, unless everyone pays for an AI subscription, AI search might eventually be filled with ads, too, to offset operational costs. And who's to say that AI systems cannot be gamified? We've already seen 'experts' online telling people how to make content 'AI-friendly.' While we cannot blame people for offering services to website owners who want their pages to have a wider reach, would AI tech be smart enough to determine when a certain page is the best answer that a specific person is looking for? If AI search takes off and starts to replace traditional search, this will definitely be another can of worms that must be addressed, or else we risk killing the creativity that AI LLMs rely on for their training data and end up with useless results from AI searches based on AI-generated gloop.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1976, NASA's Viking mission successfully landed the first spacecraft on Mars. When the mission began sending images from Mars' surface back to Earth, scientists noted long, dark streaks on crater walls and cliff sides. Planetary scientists from Brown University and the University of Bern have used artificial intelligence to reveal that the enigmatic Martian streaks likely result from wind and dust, not water flow. Their results have important implications for future Mars exploration, as well as humanity's continuous search for habitable environments and life beyond Earth. Some slope streaks are long-lasting, while others—called recurring slope lineae (RSL)—are more ephemeral, continuously appearing in the same places during Mars' hottest times of the year. Although Mars is generally dry and cold (with temperatures as low as -225 degrees Fahrenheit, or -153 degrees Celsius) small amounts of water from potential ice, underground sources, or humidity could conceivably mix with enough salt to become liquid and flow down a slope. But some researchers aren't convinced, arguing that dry processes could have created those features instead. They then used the algorithm to scan over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images and compose a map of Martian slope streaks. “Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors,” Valentin Bickel, co-author of the study and a University of Bern Center for Space and Habitability fellow, said in a Brown University statement. Simply put, their results do not link slope streaks and RSLs with features indicating the presence of liquid or even frost. Instead, the researchers discovered that both slope streaks and RSLs tend to develop in areas with high wind speed and dust deposition. In other words, they are likely caused by a dry process in which dust layers abruptly slide down a slope, triggered by external forces. Rather than seeing these results as yet another failure in our search for extraterrestrial life, the planetary scientists explain that the study still carries weight for future Mars explorations. That's because scientists fear that spacecraft and rovers might still harbor terrestrial life, such as microbes, which could contaminate Martian habitats and interfere with our search for Martian life. In an industry that seems obsessed with finding water on Mars, the study stands as a reminder that not every scientific breakthrough needs to be about extraterrestrial life.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. There is nothing inherently wrong with the Galaxy S25 Edge, Samsung's ultra-thin Android phone. By that, I mean the Edge has a stunning display, excellent performance, and nice cameras. The software experience is rich in features, and it'll get 7 years of updates. I'm not going to delve deep into many of these specs because much of it remains the same as the Galaxy S25 series, which I reviewed early this year. But it's impossible to review this smartphone without looking at the full picture, and what the $1,100 asking price can get you these days. But it makes a crucial sacrifice to get there, one that I think most people will find baffling. At 5.8 mm thick, it's 2 mm thinner than the iPhone 16 Plus and weighs 36 grams less, despite both screens sitting at 6.7 inches. Compared to Samsung's own Galaxy S25+, which shares the same screen size, the Edge is 1.5 mm thinner and 30 grams lighter. Those are some real savings, and it's hard not to feel impressed when you first pick up the phone. I have large hands, so the edges of this phone feel a little too thin, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels a little more natural. One thing is for sure: If you frequently put a case on your phone for protection, the S25 Edge will feel even thinner. That's because you expect a case to make your phone feel bulky, but the few cases for the Edge I've tried oddly emphasize its thinness. I need to point out that while 5.8 millimeters is impressively thin, Samsung isn't shattering any records here. Nearly a decade ago, Motorola made the 5.2 mm Moto Z phone. The upcoming iPhone 17 Air is expected to be roughly 5.5 mm. Even earlier this year, I saw Tecno's 5.75 mm concept phone, which stuffed a massive 5,000-mAh battery inside. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Samsung has made some smart optimizations to maximize the battery life of this small cell, but there's only so much it can do. The Galaxy S25 Edge's battery life is not good enough for a $1,100 phone. When I was away from a charger, I consciously decided to avoid using the phone so as not to drain the battery. Mind you, with light to average use, this handset can last just about a day. In my 10 years of reviewing phones, I've frequently heard grumbles from the people around me when companies introduce thinner phones with smaller batteries. I have also heard complaints that phones are getting too big. It begs the question, who is this for? Devices like the Motorola Razr Ultra and the Galaxy Z Flip6 will match, if not offer slightly better battery life than the Edge, but you can fold them up and stow them in a pocket or purse even more nicely. But the Edge has more compromises than just having the worst battery life: it charges more slowly, there's no S Pen stylus, and there's no telephoto zoom camera. It does have a few perks over the cheaper S25 and S25+, though, such as the ability to capture 4K video at 120 frames per second. You won't find too much to complain about. It's rare to find a $1,000+ smartphone today without a 3x or 5x optical zoom camera, and it's sorely missed here. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. More annoying is the fact that this phone rocks a lot on a table due to the camera bump. You might say it's the same with most phones these days (except Google Pixel phones, where the long camera bar keeps it stable), but even with a case, the Edge won't stop rocking because case-makers want to maintain as much of that thinness as possible. My other concern was thermal performance, but this didn't turn out to be a big deal. A smaller phone means you likely won't have the same kind of cooling, right? Well, Samsung says the vapor chamber that dissipates heat is thinner but broader, and after an hour in Zenless Zone Zero, I didn't notice any abnormal thermal throttling on the phone. (My benchmark scores also turned out higher than the S25 Ultra.) You might find the extra few millimeters of the Ultra or S25+ are manageable if it means a day and a half of battery life. Not to mention, you can find the Galaxy S25 Ultra on sale these days for as little as $1,050, cheaper than the Edge. In my eyes, we shouldn't accept a phone with this kind of battery life today. Or bring back the 10x optical zoom camera from older Samsung phones. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

Math might be bulletproof, but wetware is very fragile. Now, people share the most intimate details of their daily lives. People just do not think about how the most benign of posts can be used for nefarious purposes by someone else. So we've gone from share nothing to over sharing everything. During covid some SWEs had pretty sweet gigs due to lowered expectations and a rush on talent. Make “life in the day of” videos that glamorize how cushy and easy-going it is, painting the whole group of SWEs as spoiled and entitled who make too much money. But, no, they had to hustle for internet points, even risking their job inadvertently. And I think it all boils down to the fact that some humans need to make noise about their successes so they feel validated. There are subtler and much more noxious failure modes here than merely getting beaned with a Swedish nut rounder. Making sure most people don't know about your holdings is nice and all, but ultimately key management is a really hard problem. With events like the recent Coinbase breach, is this even enough? Of course it would be easy to say one's never touched crypto, and not so easy to prove, as with any negative. Or because I said something someone failed to comprehend and so took insult at. Brains are severely out of fashion this decade, and I can't seem to help having some, so presumably someone will seek to scatter them sooner or later.

Side joke: with inflation the XKCD $5 wrench attack (https://xkcd.com/538/) is no longer possible. Seriously though, most B&E's will use tools stolen from some prior victim. Why spend money you don't need to, or something.

To torture the metaphor a bit, crypto is more like an iPhone competitor which markets itself around the supposed benefits of not having anti-theft features like factory reset protection. Although the crypto might be relevant being attacked is something that any asset owner has to worry about (even for assets like houses, oddly enough - I suspect big mansions would be something of a thief draw).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. He brought the idea to Kaden Hazzard, his academic adviser. “I said, I'm not sure I believe this can be true,” Hazzard recalled, “but if you really think it is, you should put all your time on this and drop everything else you're working on.” This January, Wang, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany, and Hazzard published their refined result in the journal Nature. They say that a third class of particles, called paraparticles, can indeed exist, and that these particles could produce strange new materials. According to quantum mechanics, an object or observer can be in multiple locations at once. A basic question is being reevaluated: What kinds of particles does our world allow? The defining characteristic of fermions is that if you switch the positions of two fermions, their quantum state gains a minus sign. The presence of that measly minus sign has enormous ramifications. When packed together, fermions cannot be compressed past a certain point. Zhiyuan Wang, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany. Groups of bosons will happily all do exactly the same thing. This is what makes it possible to build lasers, which emit many identical light particles. It's not obvious that fermions and bosons should be the only two options. That's in part due to a fundamental feature of quantum theory: To calculate the probability of measuring a particle in any particular state, you have to take the mathematical description of that state and multiply it by itself. contestant would have no way to know if the question was “What is 2 squared?” or “What is negative 2 squared?”—both possibilities are mathematically valid. The Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated his “exclusion principle” in 1925, when he was 25 years old. It says that two indistinguishable fermions can never have identical quantum states. But a minus sign may not be the only thing that disappears. In theory, quantum particles can also have hidden internal states, mathematical structures not seen in direct measurements, which also go away when squared. In the 1950s, the physicist Herbert Green made a few attempts, but further inspection revealed that these paraparticle models were really just mathematical combinations of typical bosons and fermions. A collection of theorems called DHR theory, after the mathematical physicists Sergio Doplicher, Rudolf Haag, and John Roberts, proved that if certain assumptions are true, only bosons and fermions are physically possible. One assumption is “locality,” the rule that objects can only be affected by things in their vicinity. The DHR proof also assumed that space is (at least) three-dimensional. The results discouraged new ventures into paraparticles for decades, with one exception. In the early 1980s, the physicist Frank Wilczek came up with a theory of particles called anyons that can't be described as either bosons or fermions. To get around the DHR theorems, anyons come with a big catch: They can only exist in two dimensions. Physicists now widely study anyons for their potential in quantum computing. But paraparticles in three dimensions that could form a solid still seemed impossible. While developing their model, Wang and Hazzard noticed that the assumptions behind DHR theory went beyond typical concerns of locality. “I think people overinterpreted what limitations or constraints were actually imposed by these theorems,” Hazzard said. Paraparticles, they realized, may be theoretically possible after all. In their model, in addition to the usual properties of a particle like charge and spin, groups of paraparticles share extra hidden properties. As with the minus sign that gets squared away during a measurement, you can't directly measure these hidden properties, but they change how the particles behave. When you swap two paraparticles, these hidden properties change in tandem. As an analogy, imagine that these properties are colors. When they swap places, rather than keeping these colors, they both change in corresponding ways, as prescribed by the mathematics of the particular model. This quickly turns into a complex game, where paraparticles affect each other in unseen ways as they move around. Meanwhile, Müller was also busy rethinking the DHR theorems. His team took a new approach to the paraparticle question. “Maybe if the particles are close by, I swap them, but if they are far away I do nothing,” Müller said. When these assumptions hold, the researchers found that paraparticles are impossible. Although Wang and Hazzard published their paper first, it's as though they saw Müller's constraints coming. While swapping two paraparticles has no effect on one person's measurements, two observers, by sharing their data with each other, can determine whether the paraparticles have been swapped. That's because swapping paraparticles can change how two people's measurements relate to each other. In this sense, they could tell the two paraparticles apart. This means there's a potential for new states of matter. Where bosons can pack an endless number of particles into the same state, and fermions can't share a state at all, paraparticles end up somewhere in the middle. They are able to pack just a few particles into the same state, before getting crowded and forcing others into new states. “I find their paper really fascinating, and there's absolutely no contradiction with what we do,” Müller said. If paraparticles exist, they'll most likely be emergent particles, called quasiparticles, that show up as energetic vibrations in certain quantum materials. “We might get new models of exotic phases, which were difficult to understand before, that you can now solve easily using paraparticles,” said Meng Cheng, a physicist at Yale University who was not involved in the research. Bryce Gadway, an experimental physicist at Pennsylvania State University who sometimes collaborates with Hazzard, is optimistic that paraparticles will be realized in the lab in the next few years. This separation of the positive and negative charge makes Rydberg atoms especially sensitive to electric fields. You can build quantum computers out of interacting Rydberg atoms. They are also the perfect candidates for creating paraparticles. “For a certain kind of Rydberg quantum simulator, this is kind of just what they would do naturally,” Gadway said about creating paraparticles. But for now, the third kingdom of particles remains wholly theoretical. “Paraparticles might become important,” said Wilczek, the Nobel Prize–winning physicist and inventor of anyons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most of what scholars know about Viking maritime networks, however, has to do with their start and end points. After all, they could have taken any number of routes in between. In order to reconstruct their seafaring itineraries, Lund University archaeologist Greer Jarrett sailed functional Viking-like boats along the Norwegian coast in a series of experimental voyages. In this way, he identified four natural harbors that could have served as pitstops hundreds of years ago. The thing I am interested in is what happened on the journeys between these major trading centres,” Jarrett explained in a statement. “My hypothesis is that this decentralised network of ports, located on small islands and peninsulas, was central to making trade efficient during the Viking Age.” Between September 2021 and July 2022, Jarrett and his crew undertook 15 sailing trials and two approximately three-week-long trial voyages in seven different Nordic clinker boats: traditional, small, open, wooden sailboats whose use in Nordic regions dates back almost 2,000 years. The experimental archaeologist decided that possible “havens” along maritime itineraries should have provided fresh water, shelter from swells and winds, and a good view of the sea. Furthermore, they had to be reachable in low visibility, big enough to host several boats, approachable and exitable from different directions, and located in a “transition zone”: coastal points between exposed regions and inner areas. Along with these criteria, Jarrett's investigation integrated a digital reconstruction of Viking Age sea levels, pre-established knowledge of large Viking maritime centers, and information about traditional 19th and early 20th century sailboat routes from sailors and fishermen. The archaeologist also clarified that his work regards long-range Viking expeditions rather than voyages for raiding and war purposes. In this way he claims to have identified four potential Viking havens. These remote locations along the Norwegian coast each have varying degrees of pre-existing archaeological evidence indicating past human presence. Presumably, Jarrett is the first to suggest they may have also been pit stops along Viking maritime journeys. “The list of possible Viking Age havens,” he explained, indicating a diagram in the study, “is intended as a working document, which can shape and be shaped by future archaeological surveys and excavations.” It remains to be seen whether his work will inspire future archaeological surveys.

A new study shows that pregnancies during the Viking Age were far from a private matter, closely tied to conflict, social status, and the harsh realities of life and death. Almost 2,000 years after Mount Vesuvius exploded, scholars continue to uncover extraordinary archaeological remains immortalized in ash and pumice. The 3,300-year-old monument has sat in the French capital's center for almost 200 years, but no one else noticed these strange encryptions. Researchers compared puncture marks on an 1,800-year-old skeleton in the UK to various animal bites, and concluded that the individual was likely bitten by a lion.
