                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli refuses to answer when asked about Antonio Conte's return, confirming only they are ‘very happy' with Igor Tudor's work, while intense talks are in progress for the Club World Cup squad. You can follow all the build-up and action as it happens from today's six Serie A games on the Liveblog. “Outside judgment is always of interest, but we still have clear ideas,” Giuntoli told DAZN. Unfortunately, there was also a remarkable number of injuries, which made it much tougher. “Being here this evening, we still have it in our hands to qualify for the Champions League despite it all, which would be an extraordinary result. We know that it is a complicated game, but we have clear ideas, feel the squad has a great future ahead of it and with a few additions can be competitive very soon.” Sky Sport Italia report today that Conte is leaving Napoli after winning the Scudetto, so could his next destination be a return to Juventus? “I will just congratulate Napoli for having a great season and that is all,” replied Giuntoli. The Club World Cup poses a problem for the clubs who have a lot of players on loan, like Juventus, because it runs from mid-June to mid-July, so contracts will expire halfway through. Giuntoli confirmed he is working hard to bolster the squad with some figures returning and others kept on for a little bit longer. “Considering the emergency situation, we are thinking of bringing Kostic and Rugani to the Club World Cup, so are discussing it with Fenerbahce and Ajax. We are very advanced in talks with Porto for Francisco Conceicao, also talking to Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea for Kolo Muani and Veiga.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's official—the U.S. government will expedite visa processing for those attending the 2026 World Cup World Cup is just around the corner, and as you well know, the FIFA World Cup 2026 will take place in our country, and of course, the state's efforts to ensure that supporters from each country can enter the country during the sporting event are titanic. For that, Secretary of State Marco Rubio explained before the Homeland Security Subcommittee that double shifts and new technologies will be implemented in key embassies. To guarantee visas for everyone, according to them, their priority is that no one misses this event due to a possible bureaucratic delay. But… meanwhile, the Trump administration is tightening its immigration policies, which makes the visa process more closely monitored than ever (and also more cynical than ever). The government, aware of this, has decided to act before collapse hits. Rubio explained that double shifts will be implemented in many embassies to reduce wait times. He pointed to the case of Colombia as an example, where, without these measures, many applicants wouldn't arrive in time for the World Cup. In addition, reinforcement will be prioritized in countries with high ticket demand to avoid the chaos seen in other editions where hundreds of fans were unable to travel. This tool will allow repetitive tasks to be automated and free up human resources for new applications, shortening deadlines without compromising security. No, the 1994 World Cup was already hosted here, in which, by the way, attendance records were broken and national interest in the sport was sparked. And yes, of course we remember how Roberto Baggio missed the decisive penalty that gave victory to Brazil, earning their fourth star on the jersey. Now, with a more robust infrastructure and the experience of having hosted other global events, the country is preparing for the biggest World Cup in history: more teams, more venues, more matches… and millions of people trying to cross its borders. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino agree on one thing: the image of the country is at stake. That's why legal and controlled access is now a matter of state. While channels are being opened to facilitate sports tourism, the same Trump government maintains its pressure on irregular immigration. This means that the filter to enter will be more exhaustive than ever, and the processes will be under stricter control. With reinforcement in embassies and the use of AI, everything points to faster procedures. So if you want to be there, screaming your team's goal live and in person and not from the couch, the first thing you need to do is move now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are now fully focused on the FIFA Club World Cup after signing off on the 2024/25 La Liga season. Huge changes will take place in the coming weeks, as Carlo Ancelotti departs to take charge of the Brazil national team, and Xabi Alnoso steps in as his replacement. His first test comes via the Club World Cup in the USA as Los Blancos look to bounce back from a poor final season under Ancelotti. Barcelona stormed away to clinch a La Liga, Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup treble with Ancelotti's charges dumped out by Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals. Jude Bellingham has called on Real Madrid to rescue a 'weak' season at the Club World Cup and Alonso will name a strong travelling squad. Valverde completed 90 minutes, as Real Madrid sealed a La Liga campaign finale win over Real Sociedad, but a back issue was immediately flagged up for the 26-year-old. "After tests carried on Fede Valverde by the Real Madrid medical services, he has been diagnosed with lumbosciatalgia. The tournament kicks off on June 14, but Real Madrid's first game is not until June 18, against Al Hilal in Miami. Alonso will be hopeful that window gives Valverde sufficient time to recover but he is expected to be excused from international duty with Uruguay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>play videoAsamoah Gyan got past Per Mertesacker to put Ghana 2-1 ahead FIFA have paid glowing tribute to one of the most unforgettable matches in recent World Cup history, Ghana's pulsating 2-2 draw with eventual champions Germany at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. More than a decade later, the clash at Estadio Castelao still resonates as a shining example of drama, quality, and fearless football from the African giants. In a special throwback feature shared across their official platforms, FIFA hailed the Black Stars for their bold, high-energy display against one of the tournament's heavyweights. Ghana not only matched Germany stride for stride in Fortaleza's scorching heat, they went toe-to-toe and came within minutes of a famous victory. The match saw Germany take a 51st-minute lead through Mario Götze, whose awkward header-knee combination just beat goalkeeper Fatau Dauda. Just three minutes later, Andre Ayew soared to meet Harrison Afful's pinpoint cross, heading home to send the crowd into raptures. But Germany, brimming with talent and led by Joachim Löw, weren't finished. With his very first touch, Klose poked home from close range following a flick-on from Benedikt Höwedes in the 71st minute, a goal that made him joint top-scorer in World Cup history alongside Brazil's Ronaldo with 15 goals. Toni Kroos and Thomas Müller threatened for Germany, but Ghana held firm. The final whistle was met with exhaustion, applause, and respect, neither side deserved to lose, and the football world recognised that something special had unfolded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are four Inter Milan players in the Italy squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers, whilst Francesco Acerbi will be in on one condition. This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. The club season is only just coming to an end. They will be one of two teams representing Serie A in the competition along with Juventus. However, there is also time for another international break right after the Champions League final. The Corriere confirm that Italy coach Luciano Spalletti has called up Alessandro Bastoni, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella, and Davide Frattesi. Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma will also be in the Azzurri setup. Then, there is the possibility of a fifth Nerazzurri player being part of the Italy camp. Aside from Bastoni, Spalletti has called up Arsenal's Riccardo Calafiori, Napoli's Alessandro Buongiorno, and Fiorentina's Pietro Comuzzo. Therefore, if any of those pull out, then Francesco Acerbi will be in the Italy squad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harry Kane will head to the States hoping to add further silverware to his collection, having broken his duck by winning the Bundesliga title. Bayern's Club World Cup campaign will come amid a series of cost-cutting measures. Several staff members have reportedly been informed that they won't join the team at the tournament. This means that Kane's wife Katie Goodland can be sent to the States at Bayern's expense, despite her husband being one of the club's top earners. Bild's Bayern expert Christian Falk revealed: "The players' families have been invited." On the German outlet's podcast, Falk went on to add: "You have to say, a few employees were annoyed. "They're cutting costs everywhere, so only a small group of employees is allowed to go over, but the families are." The staff members thought to be affected include lower level roles like middle management and matchday stewards. Bayern boss Vincent Kompany is looking forward to the competition, which could net the winners a £100million prize kitty. "It's been quite a special season anyway so far. "You know, I think we're part of a club here with Bayern Munich where every trophy is important, so by the time we get to America, it will be a priority." Bayern will begin their Club World Cup campaign by facing New Zealand side Auckland City in Cincinnati on June 15, before a trip to Miami to take on iconic Argentine outfit Boca Juniors five days later. Ahead of the tournament, Kane said: "It's going to be unique, playing this type of major tournament with your club is different to what's been done in the past but I think it's going to be a great experience. "Going out to the US, as well, a year before the World Cup itself will be a great chance to get to know some of the stadiums and get to know the fans out there. "It's going to be a really great tournament. "As always, when it's the first of any type of tournament, people are wondering how it's going to go but I'm really excited for it." ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with Argentine journalist Andrés Cantor, Infantino was candid about the idea, emphasizing that while it poses challenges, it isn't entirely off the table. “Right now, we're organizing the first World Cup with 48 teams, which is already a big challenge. After that, we'll see what happens,” Infantino said with a chuckle, as Cantor playfully urged him not to entertain CONMEBOL's suggestion too seriously. Infantino went on to explain his broader vision for inclusivity in the World Cup. “If it were up to me as FIFA President, I'd organize a World Cup with 200 or 211 countries—let everyone in the world play in it,” he joked before clarifying, “But the World Cup is for the best teams, and they have to qualify, of course”. 2025 Club World Cup: FIFA president Gianni Infantino names MLS team as possible replacement for Leon “I want us to use all our creativity to ensure the entire world is part of this festival—the biggest and most popular event on planet Earth, the 2030 World Cup. No one should be left out of this celebration,” Domínguez said. While Spain, Portugal, and Morocco will host the majority of matches, South America will play a special role with Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay each hosting one match to commemorate the tournament's centenary. The push for 64 teams aims to increase South America's presence in the tournament, allowing Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay to host their group-stage matches on home soil. While such an expansion presents logistical challenges, FIFA has not ruled out the possibility of implementing CONMEBOL's ambitious proposal.
