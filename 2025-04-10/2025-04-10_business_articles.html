                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit The survey of 4,200 U.S. adults was conducted April 3 to 7. CNBC/Survey Monkey polls from 2023, 2024, and this year have found that, on average, more than 70% of Americans said that they are stressed about their personal finances. Consumers are, of course, increasingly stressed by rising prices for essentials like food, energy, and shelter. This is due to a number of factors, including rising inflation, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical events. In the new CNBC survey, 86% of Americans cite inflation as the top reason for their financial stress, while 75% pointed to interest rates and 66% cited tariffs. Despite this decline, the increased prices during 2022 have led to a loss of purchasing power for Americans, meaning they can buy less with the same amount of money than before. Here's a look at more stories on how to manage, grow and protect your money for the years ahead. It would take nearly $114 today to buy what would have cost $100 in January of 2022, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And while Inflation has eased, experts do say the fallout from President Trump's trade war threatens to put upward pressure on prices in the months to come. Tariffs are generally considered to be inflationary, economists say. This is because tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, which can then be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can lead to a temporary increase in the overall inflation rate. "We know that tariffs are inflationary," said David McWilliams, an economist, podcaster and author. "We know that's hitting on people's expectations of how much money they're going to have in their pocket in a couple of months time." So, when it comes to financial stress caused by tariffs, 59% of those surveyed by CNBC oppose President Trump's tariff policy, with 72% concerned about the impact on their personal financial situation. As a result, 32% said they have delayed or avoided making retail purchases, and 15% said they have "stocked up." What's more, 34% of those surveyed said they have made changes to their investments due to recent stock market volatility from tariffs. Many investors are concerned about their retirement savings, but financial experts say it's important for those with a long-term perspective to understand that short-term market volatility is a distraction that's better off ignored. To manage investments during the latest tariff volatility, for example, financial advisors urge investors to maintain a long-term perspective, review and potentially adjust their asset allocation, and consider diversification to mitigate risk. It's also smart to bolster emergency funds, review your risk tolerance, and explore opportunities for tax-loss harvesting. Evaluation before action or inaction is essential," said Michael Liersch, head of advice and planning at Wells Fargo, said in an e-mail to CNBC. "Getting specific on exact dollar targets, timelines around these targets, and their level of importance [priority] can create clarity around what should be done, if anything."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit The "vibecession" isn't just lingering — it's deepening. Even before the global tariffs threats from the Trump administration sent shockwaves through the stock market and economy, the feeling of financial security was slipping further out of reach for Americans across all income levels, according to a CNBC|SurveyMonkey Your Money poll. Nearly half (48%) of Americans say they are more stressed now than one year ago, with only one in three (32%) citing an improvement in their financial anxiety, and one in five (19%) citing no change. Inflation was cited as a top financial stressor, while high interest rates, tariffs, and looming layoffs all contribute to the mounting pressure. The cost of essentials like groceries, housing, and health care are reshaping household budgets and leaving even six-figure earners feeling like they're barely keeping up. Financial anxiety is the new normal, and unsurprisingly, it is highest among lower-income Americans (less than $50,000 in annual income). But across income levels, Americans are feeling the squeeze. Seven in ten (71%) Americans feel stressed about their finances today, with lower-income Americans experiencing higher levels of stress (81% for those making $50,000 or less annually) than those with higher annual household incomes (74% and 60% for $50,000-$99,000 and $100,000 or more, respectively). Financial hardship, specifically, is gripping more of the country. Almost half (46%) of Americans making $50,000 or less say they are struggling to keep afloat or falling behind, and only 12% are feeling comfortable. If there's a silver lining in the data, it's that there are many Americans who remain optimistic about their financial situation, with 45% expecting it to improve in the next year. A follow up survey conducted April 3-April 7 shows a significant level of concern about tariffs, specifically, and the impact on spending. Nearly three in four (72%) expressed concern over the impact of Trump's tariffs, with over half (56%) believing the trade taxes will negatively impact their personal financial situation. Thirty-two percent of Americans say they have delayed or avoided any purchases because of the tariffs, while 15% have stocked up or made purchases. One place you can see this attitude in action is how Americans are spending. Instead, there is less left over because they're paying more just to cover the basics, which constitute a growing share of household budgets. Of the non-essentials being sacrificed, eating out (59%), entertainment (51%), and clothing and personal items (50%) are the most common cuts. This isn't just about tightening budgets, it's about a deeper feeling that no matter how much someone earns, it never seems to stretch as far as it should. Not long ago, earning six figures was a hallmark of financial success. When asked how much they would have to make annually to feel financially comfortable, half of Americans (54%) cited at least $100K annually or more. One in three (31%) only need between $50 and $99K, and one in ten (11%) are fine with less than $50K a year. The psychological shift is clear: stability isn't just about income but whether that income is enough to withstand unexpected costs, plan for the future, and maintain a basic standard of living. For many earners, regardless of their tax bracket, the answer is no. Inflation, high interest rates, and economic uncertainty have created a reality where hardly anyone — from young professionals to retirees — feels truly secure. Many are cutting back on non-essentials, redirecting every available dollar toward necessities, yet the gap between what people have and what they feel they need to be financially comfortable keeps widening. And until Americans start feeling financially secure — regardless of how much they earn — that uncertainty isn't going anywhere.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit This is CNBC's live coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's rapidly evolving tariff regime. Trump says while discussing his tariff policies that he expects "there'll be a transition cost and transition problems," even while insisting, "we think we're in very good shape." The president also claims that the U.S. is raking in billions of dollars each day as a result of his protectionist policies, saying, "that makes us a very strong country." Trump made the comments at the start of a Cabinet meeting, as major stock indexes gave up much of their gains from yesterday's historic rebound rally. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is speaking out against Trump's chaotic tariff efforts, panning the protectionist push as "the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen ... imposed on a well-functioning economy." Yellen, who served under former President Joe Biden, tells CNN that even though it's a "relief" that Trump paused his so-called reciprocal tariffs, "the U.S. and global economies have suffered a huge protectionist shock." Yellen, a professor emeritus University of California, Berkeley, is also asked what grade she would give the administration so far. Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer called Trump's purported tariff strategy 'the art of stupidity.' Gotteheimer, during an interview with  MSNBC's Ana Cabrera, scoffed at a claim by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that Trump's decision Wednesday to pause stiffer tariffs on many countries above a 10% baseline was part of a plan, despite days of denying there would be such a pause. "I don't really understand their strategy because every day is a new day of chaos," said Gottheimer, D-N.Y. "I think it's the art of stupidity." Trump authored a book called "The Art of the Deal," and that phrase is routinely invoked by his supporters to suggest that various moves he makes are part of a well-thought-out plan to get a "deal" done. Gottheimer is the co-sponsor of bill with Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. The U.S. stock market fell to its lows of the session in midday trading, giving up more of Wednesday's historic rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lose about 1,640 points, or 4%. Trump's latest executive order hiking tariffs on Chinese imports also raises a separate U.S. duty on low-value packages imported from China — for the third time in eight days. Until this year, the so called de minimis tariff exemption had provided the China-based online retailers Shein and Temu with a major advantage over many of their competitors. Starting May 2, U.S.-bound packages from China valued at $800 or less will face a 120% tariff rate, according to the order. This is an increase of 30 percentage points over a previous executive action signed Tuesday, which tripled de minimis tariffs to 90%. The order signed Wednesday also increases the "per postal item" cost for those low-value shipments to $100 starting May 2, rising to $200 on June 1. Technology stocks declined, giving back gains from the previous session. The U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports now effectively totals 145%, a White House official confirmed to CNBC. Trump's latest executive order hikes tariffs on Beijing to 125% from 84%. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC that the company's third-party sellers could end up passing the cost of tariffs onto consumers. "I think they'll try and pass the cost on." The online retail giant has seen some evidence of consumers stocking up on items in anticipation of price hikes, "but it's hard to know if it's just an anomaly in the data because it's just a few days, or how long it's going to last," Jassy said. "There is a category of DC insider who wants to fight an actual war with China but also wants China to manufacture much of our critical supply," Vance writes in a post on social media platform X. Trump privately acknowledged that his plan for tariffs could push the U.S. economy into a recession but he wanted to avoid a depression, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with his conversations. While many economists were starting to predict a recession from Trump's original plan for sweeping global tariffs, none of them were saying it would lead to a depression. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he will demand that the White House tell him "who knew in advance" that Trump "was going to once again flip-flop on tariffs." There is just all too much opportunity for people in the White House and the administration to be insider trading, and you can't put it past them for a minute. Hours before Trump announced he was temporarily lowering his "reciprocal" tariff rates to a baseline 10% for all affected countries except China, he declared, "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! Schiff said he believes that "someone is knowing about these events in advance." "They may have an hour to know, or they may have a day, but someone knows," he said. "And the question is, are they trading on that information? Are people in the administration making money out of it?" National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett says that "we've already got offers on the table for more than 15 countries" for trade deals. The administration is looking at those offers and "deciding whether they're good enough to present to the president," he said on Fox News. Earlier on CNBC, Hassett said that the number of countries actively beginning negotiations with the U.S. is "closing in on 20." Hassett drew a distinction between those talks and the total number of countries who have reached out. Trump on Wednesday said more than 75 countries have contacted U.S. officials seeking to discuss their new tariff rates. Trump in a late-night Truth Social post basked in the afterglow of a massive stock market rebound that was prompted by his decision to pause his steep "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries. "What a day, but more great days coming!!!" Hassett says the 10% universal baseline tariff rate is likely to stay in place for most countries as part of any negotiated trade deals. "It is going to take some kind of extraordinary deal for the president to go below" that rate, he said. Hassett also said "closing in on 20" countries have offered the U.S. a trade deal. "We had two deals almost closed as of last week," he said. Getting them closed requires the lawyers to work forever and so on, and so getting them closed by yesterday was not quite going to happen." "Everything was moving forward in an orderly fashion," Hassett said. "There's no doubt that the Treasury market yesterday made it so that the decision that, you know, it is about time to move was made with, I think, perhaps a little more urgency. Traders said Japan and China may be dumping U.S. government bonds and that the developments could be concerning to the White House, according to Reuters. Long-term Treasury yields have moved lower since the tariff pause was announced, with the 10-year yield trading around 4.308% on Thursday morning. China is not looking to fight a trade war, but will not flinch if tariff hostilities escalate to that point, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters on Thursday, according to Chinese news outlet Xinhua. Beijing and Washington have been engaging in the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory measures since the U.S. kicked off its protectionist trade regime under Trump's second administration, triggering global fears of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. The European Union will pause the adoption of its retaliatory trade countermeasures against a spate of U.S. goods for 90 days, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said following the White House reprieve on most of its own tariffs. EU members had on Wednesday voted in favor of a package of retaliatory steps in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. "We want to give negotiations a chance," von der Leyen said on social media. "If negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in. As I have said before, all options remain on the table." The EU, a historically close transatlantic ally of the U.S., was further hit with 20% tariffs when Washington issued reciprocal duties on trade partners on April 2. The levy has been reduced to just 10% for 90 days following Trump's Wednesday announcement. U.S. tariffs on China imports could potentially knock off 0.5 percentage points off China's GDP growth, Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." Neumann said China's 5% GDP target is "certainly under pressure now," assuming that U.S. tariffs on China imports remain in force. Lower GDP would require "quite a significant increase" in stimulus to offset that weaker expansion, he said, adding that China does have tools at its disposal to offset those risks. The U.S. and China are "putting on a brave face at the moment and saying they're not going to budge, but it is clear that for both sides, there's plenty of disruption to come if these tariffs stay in place, and therefore one cannot rule out some negotiations behind the scenes," Neumann said. U.S. tariffs on aluminum, steel and vehicle imports could reduce the gross domestic product growth of export-reliant Germany by 0.1 percentage points in each of 2025 and 2026, German economic institutes warned on Thursday. They added that this impact could double as a result of the additional White House duties announced on April 2, while disclaiming that "specific effects are difficult to quantify," given the sharp hike in rates. Europe's largest economy has come under pressure since the announcement of U.S. tariffs, particularly in its languishing auto sector. Indonesia is considering higher U.S. imports, trimming taxes and easing import processes amid Washington's levies, Sri Mulyani said. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has been engaging on trade relations with officials in partner countries, including the European Union, Ireland, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, according to multiple social media updates. I think that's worth fighting for — and I'm up for that fight," Luxon said in a post on the X platform. New Zealand was struck with the White House's baseline 10% tariff under Trump's April 2 announcement. Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski welcomed the U.S. temporary suspension of most reciprocal tariffs. Less emotion, more focus on economic growth," he said in a Google-translated social media post. "We regard the U.S. as a longstanding and valued economic partner of ASEAN," the group said in a statement, adding, "We remain committed to safeguarding ASEAN's economic interests as well as maintaining strong and mutually beneficial trade relations with the U.S." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed Trump's decision to pause "reciprocal" tariffs against several nations, adding the bloc "remains committed to constructive negotiations" with the White House. "It's an important step towards stabilizing the global economy. Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function," she said in a social media post. "Tariffs are taxes that only hurt businesses and consumers. At the same time, the EU, which on Wednesday voted to approve its first set of retaliatory steps to counter U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, is focusing on diversifying its trade partnerships, von der Leyen said. In a note to clients on Wednesday evening, Deutsche Bank Research's George Saravelos noted that U.S. President Donald Trump had mentioned the bond market during his press conference at the White House that day. "Even if the tariffs are permanently suspended, damage has been done to the economy via a permanent sense of unpredictability in policy," Saravelos explained. China has been "isolated as a bad actor" as a result of mounting trade tensions and tariff impositions with the U.S., billionaire investor Bill Ackman said Thursday in a social media post. "Every American company is immediately moving their supply chains out of China back to the U.S. or to trading partners of the U.S. who are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the U.S. Time is not China's friend," he noted. Washington has doubled down on trade levies with Beijing, which has in turn resorted to countermeasures and complaints to the World Trade Organization. While granting most other nations a tariff reprieve on Wednesday, Trump raised duties against imports from the world's second largest economy to 125%. China had earlier in the day raised its own tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% in response to White House policies. South Korea will press ahead with efforts to lower tariffs rates in talks with Washington, after acting President Han Duck-soo's phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to South Korean outlet Yonhap. South Korea, which exported roughly $127.8 billion to the U.S. in 2024, had been slapped with a 25% tariff rate under the White House announcements of April 2, prior to Trump's temporary reversal of Wednesday. "As high-level talks have taken place, we will now prepare concrete proposals and begin negotiations on individual issues with relevant trade authorities," an official from the South Korean Prime Minister's Office told reporters on Wednesday. "Our foremost goal is to adjust (U.S.) tariff rates." On Wednesday, China's ministry of finance announced the 84% tariff rate after U.S. President Donald Trump had increased tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. to a net total tariff of 104%. Trump later raised the tariff on China again, to 125% at about 1.18 a.m. Thursday, saying it would take effect "immediately".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit The Trump administration recently announced it would begin a process of overhauling the country's $1.6 trillion federal student loan system. The potential changes could impact how millions of borrowers repay their debt, and who qualifies for loan forgiveness. "Not only will this rulemaking serve as an opportunity to identify and cut unnecessary red tape, but it will allow key stakeholders to offer suggestions to streamline and improve federal student aid programs," said acting Undersecretary of Education James Bergeron in a statement on April 3. Here are three changes likely to come out of the reforms, experts say. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the seven Republican-led states that filed a lawsuit against SAVE, arguing that Biden was trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping loan cancellation plan in June 2023. SAVE came with two key provisions that the legal challenges targeted: It had lower monthly payments than any other federal student loan repayment plan, and it led to quicker debt erasure for those with small balances. More from Personal Finance:Why the stock market hates tariffs and trade warsWhy Fed chair wears purple ties — 'we are nonpolitical'Don't miss these tax strategies during the tariff sell-off "It's difficult to see any scenario where SAVE will survive," said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a trade group for federal student loan servicers. That reprieve will likely end soon, forcing people to switch into another plan. Historically, at least, IDR plans limit borrowers' monthly payments to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. The IDR plans now open are: Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn and Income-Contingent Repayment, according a recent Education Department press release. As a result of the Trump administration's revisions, two of those plans — PAYE and ICR — no longer conclude in automatic loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, Buchanan said, noting that the courts have questioned the legality of that relief along with SAVE. The Trump administration, through its changes to the student loan system, is likely to make at least some of those temporary changes permanent, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Still, if a borrower enrolled in ICR or PAYE switches to IBR, their previous payments made under the other plans will count toward loan forgiveness under IBR, as long as they meet the plan's other requirements, Kantrowitz said. Some borrowers may opt to take that strategy if they have a lower monthly bill under ICR or PAYE than they would on IBR. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March that aims to limit eligibility for the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007, allows many not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of payments. According to Trump's executive order, borrowers employed by organizations that do work involving "illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property and disruption of the public order" will "not be eligible for public service loan forgiveness." As a result, it remains unclear exactly which organizations will no longer be considered a qualifying employer under PSLF, experts said. However, in his first few months in office, Trump's executive orders have targeted immigrants, transgender and nonbinary people, and those who work to increase diversity across the private and public sector. Changes to PSLF can't be retroactive, consumer advocates say. That means that if you are currently working for or previously worked for an organization that the Trump administration later excludes from the program, you'll still get credit for that time, at least up until when the changes go into effect.

The Trump administration has acknowledged the tariffs might have short-term negative effects, but says they will ultimately benefit the US economy by forcing companies to relocate manufacturing in the US. 

When President Donald Trump said last week that he was using tariffs to remake American trade policy and bolster domestic manufacturing, entrepreneur Evita Chu started calling around to see if she could source some of the yarn she buys from China and Europe in the US instead.

She stumbled upon a yarn mill in Wisconsin. “Oh wow, there are these mills and we'd never heard of them,” Chu said. “That's the positive side.” </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump promised to make Americans' grocery bills more affordable. But his sweeping tariffs on imports of everyday staples like fresh fruit, coffee, and seafood are expected to raise prices, food industry analysts and retailers said. Most of the fresh fruit, coffee, and fish Americans consume are shipped from overseas including Peru, Chile, and Indonesia, federal data shows. Vanilla, a key ingredient in pastries and other sweets, mainly comes from Madagascar. Some countries were hit harder than others, including a threatened 20% tariff on the European Union and a 46% tariff on Vietnam. "A 10% tariff is still likely to pose inflationary pressures on food prices, but with much less intensity and speed than the much higher rates included in the country-specific tariff list," Andrew Harig, vice president of tax, trade, sustainability, and policy development at the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group representing grocery chains and food manufacturers, told Business Insider. Harig added that while the 90-day pause is a good thing for retailers and consumers, the ongoing uncertainty over US trade policy will be challenging for them to navigate. "For a company to change where they source product, they really need to know what the market is going to look like on a broader time horizon than three months," Harig said. White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that "Chicken Little 'expert' predictions" didn't pan out during Trump's first term and will not during his second term when the president "again restores American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street." Before Trump's trade battles, grocery staples like eggs, coffee, and olive oil had already become more expensive over the last five years due to a combination of a bird flu outbreak, supply chain disruptions from COVID-19, weather disasters in some countries, and broader inflation. Fresh fruits like bananas, pineapples, and avocados could see price hikes quickly because they don't have a long shelf life. Suppliers can't build up large inventories of produce and try to sell them later if prices rise due to tariffs. For packaged foods, it could be months before costs go up. How much depends on whether importers, manufacturers, and retailers spread out the additional cost hikes, Harig added. He said one silver lining is that agricultural and other goods from Canada and Mexico that comply with those countries' free trade agreements with the US are exempt from higher tariffs. Here are five grocery items that likely will be more expensive: The US relies on Brazil, Colombia, and several other Central American countries for much of its coffee supply. "Coffee is seasonal, so at this time of year, coffees from Ethiopia and Kenya are in some stage of transport," Noah Namowicz, chief operating officer and partner at Cafe Imports, a Minneapolis-based company that sources coffee from 24 countries, told BI. Namowicz said the coffee industry was already experiencing unprecedented cost increases this year due to drought in Brazil and a typhoon in Vietnam that shrunk production. However, federal data shows that Guatemala, Ecuador, and Costa Rica are leading exporters of bananas. While broccoli and cauliflower are grown in California year-round, it isn't enough to meet all of the US demand. Wines and all other products imported from France and Italy — the two largest suppliers to the US — will be hit with 10% tariffs. Wines from Argentina, Chile, and New Zealand will likely be more expensive, as well. "Previously, when the cost of those wines went up, consumers switched to California wine," Harig said. "But then sometimes you see those costs go up, too, because there's more demand. Harig said wine has a many-step distribution process, including shippers, receivers, brokers, and distributors. The US relies on other countries to feed Americans' growing appetite for seafood. Do you have a story to share about how the tariffs are affecting your finances or business?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The budget resolution, which requires Senate committees to identify spending cuts totaling a low floor of $4 billion, includes controversial language that calls for the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut $880 billion in programs it oversees over the next decade. Speaking alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans want to find at least $1.5 trillion in cuts. Johnson pulled a vote on the legislation Wednesday evening amid uncertainty that it would pass. Before Thursday's vote, Johnson held a joint news conference with Thune. The pair sought to reassure House conservatives that the GOP will cut significant spending in addition to tax cuts. GOP lawmakers will now have to fill in the details of their sweeping proposal, including whether they will cut Medicaid and if so by how much. Johnson and GOP leaders have repeatedly stressed that their bill does not explicitly cut Medicaid, a healthcare program for millions of disabled and low-income Americans. However, Medicaid will likely get cut by or near $880 billion over a decade, as Medicaid and Medicare, which Trump has pledged not to cut, comprise most of the committee's budget. Josh Hawley, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, joined Democrats in an unsuccessful effort to strip that language out of the plan before it passed their chamber. Republicans will likely have no choice but to slash the program to reach the $880 billion in required cuts, much of which could hit Medicaid expansion. If that were to happen, Republicans wouldn't be able to ram their bill through the narrowly controlled Senate where Democrats can use the filibuster to stop most other legislation. Some Republicans have expressed uneasiness about potential Medicaid cuts. Hawley, a Trump ally, represents Missouri, where 20.3% of residents are Medicaid recipients. The president previously said he would "love and cherish" Medicaid. About 23.3% of all Americans, or over 79 million, receive either Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, a Business Insider analysis showed using July 2024 population estimates and October 2024 Medicaid enrollment data. States including New Mexico, California, and New York have over a third of residents on Medicaid, the analysis found. Nearly all states have at least 10% of residents on Medicaid or CHIP. If Medicaid does get cut, some Republican leaders have suggested adopting per-capita Medicaid caps to limit how much federal funding an enrollee could receive, which could save as much as $900 billion. Some have mulled adding Medicaid work requirements, while others have proposed cutting Federal Medical Assistance Percentages, the federal government's Medicaid spending share per state.</p>

The Audi Q5 is the German brand's top-selling vehicle in the US. It's also a prime example of how Donald Trump's drastic reordering of global trade is wreaking havoc on automakers.

The president's tariffs are hitting the $45,400 model thrice, rendering the sport utility vehicle unsellable, according to people familiar with the carmaker's thinking, who declined to comment on the record.</p>

The dynasty that owns the retail chain is shedding its traditional secrecy to attract more outside investors as it seeks to double assets under management.

The boom in e-commerce and online shopping disrupted C&A's growth.

The Brenninkmeijers have epitomized Europe's reclusive old money elite for more than a century: There's the secretive accounts of flagship clothing retailer C&A AG, a wariness of publicity and opaque corporate structure — all overseen from an anonymous office park in Switzerland's wealth hub of Zug. 

Then came the growing realization that one of the world's biggest dynastic fortunes needed a radical rethink as C&A struggled with online competition. A new generation of leaders is increasingly taking over the Brenninkmeijer business empire, accelerating a push to diversify assets and break away from a long-held tradition of just managing family wealth. There's a drive to attract more institutional money, selectively hire more external talent — and take riskier bets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long hours, hiring freezes, and a souring bonus outlook. This is the life of the Wall Street dealmaker right now as M&A stalls amid continued uncertainty over Trump's tariffs. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs, with the exception of China, which is now facing tariffs of up to 125%. While the reversal lifted stocks, resulting in the biggest single-day gain for the S&P 500 since 2008, it isn't expected to do much for M&A, which was already on the fritz leading up to Wednesday's announcement. In fact, some are predicting Trump's pause could make things worse. "We're going to have three more months of paralysis," said Alan Johnson, a finance industry compensation consultant. "Buyers and sellers are going to say, 'I'm going to wait,'" added the Johnson Associates founder. It's not just investment bankers who are sitting on the sidelines. Private equity deal pipelines are also on hold as investors and target companies try to understand how current and future tariffs could affect business revenues and supply chains. As one investor at a midmarket private equity firm put it: The news of the 90-day pause was well-received, but nothing to celebrate. "We pop bottles when we have great exits that earn our investors tons of money, not for short-term noise." The people who spoke to BI said they and their teams aren't going home any earlier. In fact, some are traveling more to stay in touch with skittish clients even as they predict year-end bonus declines. Davidson, told BI that far more of his time is being spent keeping clients updated. During a time like this, Stetler said, "just staying in front of clients" is paramount. "That's not to say that our new business development activity is pausing because we're still having a lot of conversations," he said. We're preparing businesses for sale, and looking at processes with our clients." The PE sector head said private equity deal teams are spending more time with their portfolio companies or updating their models with the latest tariff numbers. "The announced tariffs were more severe than what was expected, so we've been having to update Plan B, Plan C, and Plan D to make sure we can mitigate the effects," the executive said before Trump announced the 90-day pause. Hiring is largely frozen, according to a banker and Wall Street recruiter. "What I'm hearing is that it's kind of like, 'Maybe this is not a good week to push something through. Can we give it a week or two? Though the firms this recruiter communicates with had yet to invoke full-on hiring freezes — which are rigid postures that tend to presage layoffs — the word "freeze" had been mentioned in some conversations. "If things don't get better," the recruiter added, "there will be layoffs." As Stetler explained: "It takes roughly four to six months to run the sale process" on a live deal. Trump's tariff pause threatens to further dampen bonuses by pushing the timeline out even more — potentially to 2026, said Johnson, the compensation consultant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While working as a LinkedIn product manager, Philip Smart saw the opportunity of AI to solve problems in an industry close to his heart: immigration. Smart's father has worked as an immigration attorney for 25 years. "You see these applications that are all printed out, stacks of paper, and you have to diligently put it all together," Smart said. Parley's platform allows an attorney to upload documents such as a client's resume, college transcript, and job offer letter. It then assembles this evidence to draft an attorney's letter confirming the applicant's eligibility for a work visa. Smart said its platform has been adopted by a range of law firms, from solo practitioners to large shops with dozens of legal professionals, such as Erickson Immigration Group in Virginia and Murthy Law Firm in Maryland. Last week, the startup released a product for filing E-2 visas for investors, which means Parley's platform now covers most of the alphabet soup of work visas. It plans to roll out soon a product aimed at "requests for evidence," which the government issues and can cause delays or even lead to visa denials. Immigration has emerged as a hot spot for founders, with its high volume of simple or routine tasks. Immigration lawyers are used to the long, complicated, and often tedious process of applying for a visa. Now, they're juggling new directives that create fear and increase scrutiny for their clients. The executive orders that have come down have called for stricter "enhanced vetting" of visa applicants and those already in the country. Additionally, President Donald Trump has directed the Justice Department to seek sanctions against law firms that bring immigration lawsuits and other cases against the government that he deems unethical. "It's not easy to be an immigration lawyer right now," Smart told Business Insider. He said lawyers using Parley still work with their clients and teams of associates to craft each applicant's strategy. Parley helps by fleshing out the argument and offering feedback on where it falls short of certain criteria. The platform also organizes an applicant's documents into a logical sequence and enables the exhibits to be exported as a single PDF, saving an attorney hours in Adobe Acrobat. He said one law firm has been able to take on more clients because of Parley's time savings and even doubled its revenue over the past year. Those lawyers get to spend more time on growing their client base and working on case strategy, Smart said, instead of getting bogged down by paperwork. There's a debate raging in the legal industry over artificial intelligence's potential to improve productivity and cut billable hours. In immigration law, many attorneys, especially for standard services like visa applications, charge a flat fee rather than an hourly rate. "It's one of the reasons we started with immigration and one of the reasons that we've seen quick adoption," Smart said. "As an immigration firm, if you're charging a flat fee for a visa application that you're providing if you can do that faster and then be able to do even more of those applications, that's a really exciting premise for your firm."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday raised tariffs on China to 125%, but "Shark Tank" star Kevin O'Leary says he should go further. "The Trump administration just announced a 90-day pause on global tariffs, EXCEPT for China. Trump announced the tariffs on April 2, or what he called "Liberation Day." A baseline rate of 10% took effect on Saturday, while a higher set of tariff rates that varied by country went into effect on Wednesday. Trump, however, said the pause would not apply to China. The president imposed a 20% tariff on China last month. Last week, he said he would impose an additional 34% reciprocal tariff before hiking it further by another 50%, taking it to 104%. But Trump raised those tariffs again on Wednesday, this time to 125%. In a Wednesday Truth Social post, Trump said his decision was "based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets." O'Leary said in his post on Wednesday that while he still wanted to do business in China, he also wanted a "LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, one where American entrepreneurs can COMPETE FAIRLY and get access to their markets the same way they access ours." "China doesn't play fair, and it's time we stop letting them get away with it," O'Leary wrote on X hours after Trump's announcement. O'Leary's hawkish views on tariffs set him apart from many business leaders and experts, who have warned that further trade restrictions would hurt rather than help the US economy. "We are far from being out of the woods. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman said on Wednesday that China should stop retaliating and start negotiating with the US. Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, said on Wednesday that it was a good time for countries to "reconsider their approaches" on trade. "There are better and worse ways of handling our problems with unsustainable debt and imbalances, and President Trump's decision to step back from a worse way and negotiate how to deal with these imbalances is a much better way," Dalio wrote in a post on X. O'Leary and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.</p>
