                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The development of new antibiotics to treat superbugs and other bacterial infections is a global priority, with the rate of infections that cannot be treated with current antibiotics rising and presenting one of the biggest threats to human health. In line with that, new research has shown a daily dose of epidermicin NI01 – an antibiotic compound developed by University of Plymouth spinout company Amprologix – is as effective at removing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the current standard of care. In particular, they plan to advance tests exploring whether the compound can be incorporated within gel-type therapies that can be applied to the skin. Such treatments could be used to treat skin infections caused by MRSA and other bacteria on everything from accidental cuts to surgical wounds, preventing the need for prolonged courses of current antibiotics. Running from April 11-15, and taking place in Vienna, it will be attended by an audience of leading experts in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology. At the moment, there are antibiotics that can be used to treat skin infections caused by MRSA and other Staphylococcus strains, but these can come with a number of unpleasant side effects. There is also increased resistance to these treatments in many bacteria, meaning that therapies can fail. Our intention would be to continue to use these standard treatments for the more serious MRSA/Staphylococcus infections, like those in the bloodstream, but to develop other ways of treating more superficial infections, for example on the skin. The results we have achieved so far in our tests are very encouraging. They are a clear sign that epidermicin NI01 has the potential to be an effective treatment in this setting, and we now plan to scale up our work and get to a position where we can commence human clinical trials." Amprologix was launched in 2018 to commercialise his research and, through a partnership with the University's commercialisation partner Frontier IP, has pioneered a drug discovery programme focused on identifying the next generation of antibiotics. Based in the University's Derriford Research Facility, located on Plymouth Science Park, its work combines laboratory tests with the use of cutting edge machine learning technologies designed to accelerate research and improve antibiotic properties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asynt announce key change to novel parallel overhead stirring platform, DrySyn Vortex, enabling flexible use of common laboratory glassware for up to three flasks/beakers in a tiny footprint. Asynt have launched a comprehensive new range of DrySyn Vortex kits to enable use with common international glassware fitting sizes. Users can now choose from B24 or B29 fittings as standard throughout the range. Designed to combat common problems in the lab such as overhead stirring for more viscous materials or where heterogeneous systems are used, the DrySyn Vortex platform is also ideal for those using materials unsuitable for agitation with magnetic stirrer bars due to their grinding effect. All models of the DrySyn Vortex have a compact footprint and are compatible with standard glassware with B24 or B29 fittings, and with all major brands of overhead stirrer, enabling scientists to effectively triple the workload attributed to each overhead stirrer motor and work both more efficiently and sustainably. This space-saving design is ideal for reaction screening or performing multiple reactions simultaneously. The hardwearing DrySyn Vortex system works by utilizing a robust maintenance-free mechanical gearbox to engage a single motor, enabling it to stir in three positions simultaneously. This gearbox can be easily adjusted by the user to provide more powerful stirring via a reduction drive or achieve better performance when using lower power overhead stirrers. The DrySyn Vortex range encompasses three different models: Please use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report: Expansion of compact oil-free temperature controlled parallel overhead stirring system that's ideal for screening.

Hematologic disorders occur frequently in patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) and are characterized by one or several abnormalities in blood cells, including hemostasis, which is poorly documented. This was a retrospective observational study of patients recruited from 1 February 2019 to 25 June 2020 from Ebola Treatment Centers in Butembo and Katwa. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed with a significance level of 0.05. The analyses were carried out using Rstudio software. The mean age was 29.9 ± 18.6 years with a female-to-male ratio of 1.2. Only 13 patients (10 %) had been vaccinated against the Ebolazaire virus. The hematologic abnormalities included anemia (55.8%), hyperleukocytosis (36.4%), leukopenia (3.1%), thrombopenia (32.6%), and thrombocytosis (30.2%). Only anemia was statistically significantly correlated with increased viral load. Anemia (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.59-11.3) was shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with EVD based on multivariate analysis. EVD is responsible for major hematologic abnormalities that contribute to increased patient mortality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of disability and chronic pain worldwide, affecting an estimated 595 million people globally. Projections suggest that this number will rise to 1 billion by 2050. Despite its profound impact on individuals and societies, no disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Now, an international team of researchers led by Helmholtz Munich has made new discoveries by studying the genetics of osteoarthritis in nearly 2 million individuals, uncovering hundreds of potential new drug targets and opportunities for repurposing existing treatments. The research team conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) ever performed on osteoarthritis, uncovering over 900 genetic associations. More than 500 of these associations had never been reported before, providing fresh insights into the genetic landscape of the disease. By integrating diverse biomedical datasets, the researchers identified 700 genes with high confidence as being involved in osteoarthritis. Notably, ten percent of these genes encode proteins that are already targeted by approved drugs, opening the door to drug repurposing opportunities that could accelerate treatment development. Beyond identifying genetic targets with therapeutic potential, the study also provides valuable insights that could help tailor treatment strategies. "Our newly gained knowledge about them can enable improved patient selection for clinical trials and personalized medicine approaches." In addition to these genetic insights, the scientists identified eight key biological processes crucial to osteoarthritis development, including the circadian clock and glial cell functions. "Our discovery suggests that targeted interventions regulating one or more of these eight processes could play another significant role in slowing or even halting disease progression," Hatzikotoulas adds. "What we found in the largest osteoarthritis GWAS study not only advances our understanding of the disease but also lays the groundwork for developing more effective and personalized therapies that could transform osteoarthritis care", says Eleftheria Zeggini.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While some studies have suggested that having a mother with Alzheimer's disease may put you more at risk of developing the disease, a new study finds that having a father with the disease may be tied to a greater spread of the tau protein in the brain that is a sign of the disease, according to a study published on April 9, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study does not prove that having a father with Alzheimer's results in these brain changes; it only shows an association. The study also showed that female participants may be more at risk of a heavier buildup of tau protein than male participants. We were surprised to see that people with a father with Alzheimer's were more vulnerable to the spread of tau in the brain, as we had hypothesized that we would see more brain changes in people with affected mothers." Sylvia Villeneuve, PhD, study author of McGill University in Montreal, Canada The study looked at 243 people who had a family history of Alzheimer's disease but had no thinking or memory problems themselves at the average age of 68. Family history was defined as one or both parents with the disease or at least two siblings with the disease. Participants had brain scans and took tests of thinking and memory skills at the start of the study and then during the study as they were followed for an average of nearly seven years. During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that people with a father with Alzheimer's disease as well as female participants had a greater spread of tau protein in the brain. Female participants also had a heavier buildup of tau protein in the brain. Amyloid and Tau Pathology in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals With a Parental History of Alzheimer Disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A McGill University-led study found that people with cannabis use disorder (CUD) had elevated dopamine levels in a brain region associated with psychosis. This could help explain why cannabis use increases the risk of hallucinations and delusions, key symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders." While it was known that cannabis influences dopamine, this study clarifies where in the brain these changes occur. Cannabis use disorder is when someone has trouble controlling their cannabis use, continues despite negative effects, and may experience cravings or withdrawal. "For a long time, clinical researchers across the world have been searching for a link showing that cannabis affects the brain mechanism behind psychosis. We now show that a shared dopamine pathway could be the answer," Ahrens said. The study involved 61 people, including those with and without cannabis use disorder, as well as individuals with early-stage schizophrenia, some of whom also had CUD. Using a specialized brain scan called neuromelanin-MRI, researchers at Western University measured their neuromelanin signal, which reflects dopamine activity. People with CUD had an abnormally high neuromelanin signal, and the elevation was tied to the severity of their cannabis use. In contrast, those without schizophrenia or CUD did not show this increase. Understanding the drug's impact on mental health remains a pressing question. "The lack of clear biological evidence linking cannabis to psychosis has made it harder to persuade young people with psychotic symptoms to reduce their use," said Dr. Lena Palaniyappan, Professor of Psychiatry at McGill and Psychiatrist at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute. "Our findings could help doctors and mental health professionals better educate patients about the potential risks of frequent cannabis use, especially for those with a family history of psychosis," he said. Future research will explore whether long-term cannabis use leads to lasting dopamine changes and whether these effects reverse after quitting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over 77 million people globally have experienced lingering symptoms after recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet an effective and reliable prophylactic measure for long coronavirus disease (long COVID) remains elusive. In a recent preclinical study published in the journal Nature Communications, a team of researchers in Australia investigated a new antiviral compound that may prevent these long-term effects of long COVID-19. This novel antiviral compound, which targets the viral enzyme papain-like protease (PLpro), could potentially represent an early-stage preclinical candidate for the first direct treatment for long COVID-19, bringing hope to millions whose daily lives are impacted by this disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, has infected hundreds of millions worldwide, with effects reaching far beyond the initial illness. Many people who recover from mild infections continue to suffer from long-lasting symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, lung issues, and heart problems. This condition is known as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), affecting roughly one in three non-hospitalized patients. Although vaccines and current antiviral drugs reduce severe illness and death, they do not protect against these persistent symptoms. Most existing treatments focus on the virus's main protease (Mpro), but another viral enzyme, PLpro, also plays a crucial role in viral replication and suppressing the immune response. Despite this, PLpro remains an underused drug target. WEHI-P8's unique binding mechanism disrupts PLpro's ability to hijack human proteins, blocking both viral replication and its evasion of immune defenses—a dual-action strategy not seen in existing antivirals. To develop a new antiviral that targets the PLpro enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, the researchers screened over 400,000 small molecules using a high-throughput assay designed to detect PLpro activity. The team improved the most promising candidate, WEHI-P1, by altering its chemical structure to create WEHI-P4, which showed strong activity in lab-based biochemical, cellular, and antiviral tests. They determined the compound's binding mechanism through X-ray crystallography and found that it engaged a new binding pocket on PLpro not used by existing drugs. Further structural refinements led to WEHI-P8, which displayed favorable drug-like properties, including potent PLpro inhibition, good bioavailability, and minimal interaction with human enzymes that could cause side effects. The researchers then tested WEHI-P8 in preclinical mouse models of COVID-19, including models mimicking both mild and severe disease and a mouse model that closely mimics long COVID symptoms. Behavioral assessments and tissue analysis were also included in the study to evaluate cognitive function and organ-specific pathology following recovery from infection. The study found that targeting the viral enzyme PLpro with a new compound, WEHI-P8, significantly reduced both acute and long-term COVID-19 symptoms in preclinical models. Compared to standard treatment consisting of Paxlovid-like therapy, WEHI-P8 was more effective in reducing immune cell infiltration and cytokine production, even without requiring a booster drug like ritonavir. In a long COVID mouse model, animals that survived infection displayed prolonged lung hemorrhage, immune cell buildup, and tissue scarring up to three months later. The compound's design includes a strategically placed oxime group and cyclohexanol ring, which stabilize its interaction with PLpro while sidestepping interference with human enzymes linked to side effects. Notably, female mice, who showed worse symptoms, responded well to the treatment, reflecting the sex-specific differences that have also been observed in long COVID cases in humans. While these preclinical findings bring hope to the millions suffering from long COVID, they remain experimental and untested in humans. The novel antiviral compound also displayed cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, suggesting potential use for future outbreaks. However, some symptoms, such as heart and gut changes, were not fully reversed in the mouse models, highlighting the complexity of long COVID. Moreover, while WEHI-P8 showed promising results when given early, its effectiveness when administered later in the disease course was not tested, limiting the conclusions about treatment windows and emphasizing the need for more research. Overall, the results showed that the novel PLpro inhibitor, WEHI-P8, can reduce viral replication and prevent long-term complications of COVID-19 in animal models. It performed better than current treatments, such as Paxlovid, did not require additional drugs to work effectively, and had a lower risk of interference with other medications. By targeting a different viral enzyme, this compound offers a preclinical strategy to treat both acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and long COVID. Chinta Sidharthan is a writer based in Bangalore, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First, some good news: In late 2023 and early 2024, significantly fewer U.S. physicians reported symptoms of job burnout than they did a few years earlier. The not-so-good news: Their burnout rates remain stubbornly high compared with those of other American workers. It's concerning because we know from studies published by our research team at Stanford and elsewhere that objective turnover increases and that physicians are more likely to reduce their clinical work hours when burnout is higher. And it comes at a time when we're already projected to be facing large workforce shortages in medicine, including problems with access to care." Tait Shanafelt, MD, chief wellness officer at Stanford Medicine Shanafelt is the lead author of a study about physician burnout published April 9 in Mayo Clinical Proceedings. It's the latest in a series of studies that have provided a snapshot of physician burnout, depression and work-life integration in the United States every three years since 2011. For comparison, researchers evaluate a sample of other American workers at the same intervals. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts the United States will face a deficit of 86,000 physicians by 2036. Mitigating the effects of occupational stress in medicine has become a national priority, with the American Medical Association, National Academy of Medicine and the U.S. surgeon general all undertaking efforts to address its underlying causes. (That particular study did not compare the burnout rates with those of other American workers.) Since then, job satisfaction among doctors appears to be improving. Of 9,5079 doctors invited to participate in the survey, 7,643 responded. The physicians were scored on emotional exhaustion and depersonalization - the sense of being detached from work and unfeeling toward patients, respectively - using scales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, a scientifically developed measure of burnout. Of the respondents, 58.6% identified as men and 39.6% identified as women, a gender breakdown that approximately mirrors the profession nationally. Burnout rates differed between sexes, with female physicians at risk by about 27% more than male physicians after adjusting for age, specialty and other factors, the study found. Also, doctors in several specialties, including emergency medicine and general internal medicine, were at heightened risk for burnout. This is particularly concerning, Shanafelt said, given that these specialties are often patients' first point of contact with a health care system. After adjusting for age, gender, relationship status and work hours, physicians were 82.3% more likely to be experiencing burnout than U.S. workers in other occupations. "Many physicians still love what they do, but they just can't keep doing it at this pace in the current practice environment, with its administrative burdens and regulatory burdens, and the proliferation of asynchronous messaging with patients through the electronic health record," Shanafelt said, referring to patients' online correspondence with a doctor. "So physicians are, in essence, just saying, 'I can't keep working this way.'"
