                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This dramatic price drop comes after a major ETH sell-off by US President Donald Trump's World Liberty Finance, suggesting that the recent dump may have been a primary catalyst behind ETH's price collapse. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed on April 9 via X (formerly Twitter) that the wallet associated with World Liberty Finance, a decentralized finance protocol linked to Trump, recently dumped a significant amount of Ethereum. Interestingly, this sell-off came just before Ethereum's price crash, raising the question of whether it contributed to the unexpected decline. Launched in 2024, World Liberty Finance is Trump's controversial digital asset firm designed to rival centralized banking and facilitate the adoption of stablecoins. According to data from Lookonchain, Trump's World Liberty Finance, which was previously accumulating Ethereum at a low price, is now selling off a large chunk of its holding at a steep loss. Lookonchain flagged the transaction, noting that the wallet linked to World Liberty Finance had offloaded 5,471 ETH tokens worth roughly $8.01 million. Notably, World Liberty Finance's ETH sell-off move has raised eyebrows across the crypto community. According to Lookonchain, the wallet address linked to World Liberty Finance had accumulated a total of 67,498 ETH at an average price of $3,259. This means that the decentralized finance protocol spent a total of $210 million to amass such a large amount of ETH. At its sell-off price, this leaves the entity sitting on a staggering unrealized loss of around $125 million. Although the reason behind World Liberty Finance's unexpected ETH sell-off remains unclear, some believe that the dump was likely triggered by Ethereum's ongoing price decline, while others suggest it could signal a market bottom. Notably, Ethereum was not the only leading cryptocurrency that was affected by the market turmoil, as big players like Bitcoin also suffered losses. Currently, Ethereum seems to be recovering slightly from its previous low and is now trading at $1,591 after jumping 7.44%. Moreover, technical indicators from CoinCodex highlight that sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency is still deeply bearish, suggesting that further declines could be on the horizon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amidst growing regulatory scrutiny, the largest marketplace for NFTs, OpenSea, is pushing for a regulatory scheme that treats non-fungible tokens (NFTs) distinctly from cryptocurrencies and traditional financial instruments. OpenSea has been vocal on the need for a unique framework that will address the singular nature and uses of NFTs. Compared to fungible assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs represent exclusive ownership of digital or real-world items and are non-interchangeable. Such a fundamental difference, OpenSea argues, needs to be considered in regulating NFT platforms. The company has said that it's afraid applying securities or crypto-exchange rules over NFTs will stifle innovation, keep creatives at bay, and load NFT marketplaces up with unnecessary regulatory costs. One of the most significant ways OpenSea has been active is in resisting definition as a securities broker or exchange by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has increasingly suggested that many crypto platforms would fall into these categories and thus be subject to very strict regulation requirements. OpenSea contends that NFT platforms are unique and must not be treated as traditional financial intermediaries. The platform has requested the SEC to provide more tailored guidance on NFTs' status, noting that most NFTs are not investment-generating or acting like securities. OpenSea is accompanied by several industry players and legal experts in its call for tailored regulations. A definite regulatory framework would potentially go a long way in providing a clearer definition of the roles of NFT platforms, reducing legal uncertainty, and inducing more institutional money into the market. However, without regulatory clarity, NFT marketplaces would be more and more at risk of legal peril, which would slow the momentum of the industry. For now, OpenSea remains committed to taking a front-line position in policy discussions to ensure regulation serves both innovation and the public interest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bitcoin network is especially vulnerable to geopolitical tensions because of its physical hardware requirements, crypto executives said. Escalating geopolitical tensions threaten to balkanize blockchain networks and restrict users' access, crypto executives told Cointelegraph. On April 9, US President Donald Trump announced a pause in the rollout of tariffs imposed on certain countries — but the prospect of a global trade war still looms, especially because Trump still wants to charge a 125% levy on Chinese imports. Industry executives said they fear a litany of potential consequences if tensions worsen, including disruptions to blockchain networks' physical infrastructure, regulatory fragmentation, and censorship. “Aggressive tariffs and retaliatory trade policies could create obstacles for node operators, validators, and other core participants in blockchain networks,” Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO of Concrete & Glow Finance, told Cointelegraph. According to data from CoinMarketCap, cryptocurrency's total market capitalization dropped approximately 4% on April 10 as traders weighed conflicting messages from the White House on tariffs amid a backdrop of macroeconomic unease. Related: Trade tensions to speed institutional crypto adoption — Execs “Tariffs disrupt established ASIC supply chains,” David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets, told Cointelegraph. Chinese manufacturers such as Bitmain are key suppliers for miners. “If global trade breaks down and capital controls tighten, it may become harder for citizens in restrictive countries to acquire bitcoin,” said Joe Kelly, CEO of Unchained. “While the environment is challenging, it also creates an opening for crypto to prove its long-term value and utility on the global stage,” noted Fireblocks' executive Neil Chopra.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) leaned into its role as security infrastructure and the underlying blockchain for Layer 2 protocols, scaling the crypto ecosystem and losing its value throughout 2025. Traders and investors holding the largest altcoin ask the question whether Ethereum will ever accrue value or lose relevance in H1 2025. Since then ETH erased 71% of its value over four years. With lower volume of fees collected by the chain, while Ethereum is not deflationary, the supply is expected to grow less than a percent a year, according to the Ultrasound Money tracker. Crypto experts on X and traders across exchanges have questioned Ethereum's value proposition in light of its changed business model. With the drop in fees and migration of value and transactions to Layer 2s, a key metric, the transaction count of Ethereum shows a steep decline. U.S.-based Spot Ethereum ETFs failed to garner interest from institutional investors and inflows have been muted throughout 2025. Pectra will introduce Ethereum Improvement Protocols that streamline validator management, reduce congestion on the chain, improve validator deposit efficiency and give higher control to stakers over exit of validators. The Pectra upgrade will have a significant impact on Ethereum validators and stakers, introducing EIPs that streamline validator management, reduce network congestion, improve validator deposit efficiency, and empower stakers with more control over validator exits. Marko Ratkovic, CTO of Graphite Network, an enterprise ready monitoring tool and a Layer 1 blockchain, told Crypto.news, Since major L2 solutions rely on blobs, this makes L2s even more efficient and attractive.” Overall, Ratkovic says, Pectra is a big step forward. “Take EIP-7702, for example — it enables sending transactions without needing the native token. This solves a long-standing issue that used to require workarounds like the Gas Station Network, but now it's addressed natively at the protocol level. At the same time, Ethereum's upgrades remain technical in nature and don't directly tackle the broader gap between TradFi and DeFi. While Ethereum focuses on streamlining onboarding, reducing overhead, and improving throughput, institutional players are more concerned with legal clarity, user verification, and the prevention of illicit flows.” Dr. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive.xyz, a decentralized on-chain options platform, told Crypto.news: “As volatility continues to surge, we're seeing implied volatility (IV) for ETH jump from 71.5% to 122%, reflecting the market's uncertainty and fears of further chaos. Looking ahead, the likelihood of ETH falling below $1,400 by May 30 has nearly doubled from 18% to 33% as of April 8, signaling increased bearish sentiment in the market. Traders and investors should brace for more uncertainty in the weeks to come as the market navigates these turbulent waters.” The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists. Bitcoin staged one of the most dramatic comebacks in recent memory, crushing short sellers with a swift move above $81,000 and wiping out over $370 million in short positions within 24 hours. Volume on Binance's BTCUSDT pair mirrored Monday's levels, affirming that the market supports this key price level. Daily RSI also printed a reset, adding to the case for upward continuation. Single-day surges like this are often followed by corrections, a pattern that already played out once in early March. In late March, similar bearish divergence signals successfully foreshadowed the crash from $87,000. Bitcoin now has approximately 5% left before reaching the weekly TBO Fast line at $87,000. Weekly RSI has begun forming a higher low, another key indicator that the consolidation period is nearing its end. But bullish consolidation does not conclude until BTC closes and holds above the weekly TBO Fast line, which is still several weeks away based on current momentum. One positive milestone was the closing of BTC's CME gap around $81,000 during this surge. Stablecoin dominance fell nearly 8% yesterday but failed to close inside the daily TBO Cloud. Bitcoin dominance dropped slightly but remains strong and overbought above 70 RSI. Other dominance metrics such as Top 10 Dominance and OTHERS.D experienced mild recoveries, but both remain trapped below the TBO Cloud and continue to reflect a bearish backdrop. Crypto Market Cap Recovers Sharply, But More Volume Is Needed The total crypto market cap closed up 8.35%, stopping just short of a long-standing resistance fan line first tested on March 24. This cooling period could provide room for altcoins to recover, but the environment remains fragile following such an intense rally. Altcoins Deliver Explosive Gains, Led by SOL, XRP, and Others XRP gained over 14%, bouncing strongly without closing below its key level at 1.7711. SOL followed through by closing above overhead resistance and filling its CME gap, but the price must now hold and push into the daily TBO Cloud. ADA narrowly avoided a breakdown and closed up 13%, staying just above TBO support. LTC printed another TBT Bullish Divergence and shows early signs of reversal, while HYPE returned to the daily TBO Cloud with a 20% rally. ONDO posted an eye-catching 40% move with a surge in volume, and TAO climbed 18%, confirming prior bullish divergence signals from earlier this month. KAS printed its second TBT Bullish Divergence on a 13% move but remains just below the daily TBO Cloud. S jumped 23% and hit the daily TBO Fast line, while IP climbed 11%, coming close to that same threshold. PENDLE closed up 23% and touched 4-hour TBO resistance, signaling continuation is possible with volume confirmation. SPX6900 remains a reliable performer, bouncing repeatedly between 25% and 33% from 4-hour TBO Support. Many assets are still in bearish territory overall, and single-day recoveries rarely signal full reversals on their own. A longer period of accumulation and consistent bullish follow-through will be required to solidify these recoveries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As risk assets including cryptocurrencies struggled on Thursday amid tariff uncertainties, tokenized gold once again emerged as an outperformer in the carnage. The market capitalization of gold-backed tokens swelled to just under $2 billion on Wednesday, up 5.7% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Weekly tokenized gold trading volume surpassed $1 billion, the highest since the U.S. banking turmoil of March 2023, according to a report by digital asset platform CEX.IO. PAXG also experienced continuous inflows totalling $63 million during this period, DefiLlama data shows. The rally tracks the broader gains in physical gold, which posted double-digit increases in 2025 amid geopolitical uncertainty and inflation concerns. However, even gold wasn't spared during the market-wide sell-off triggered by U.S. tariffs, with prices briefly dropping 6% before quickly recovering to record highs. Since Trump's inauguration, tokenized gold has been one of crypto's top performing sectors, with its market cap up 21%, the report noted. “Tokenized gold is emerging as one of the key diversification strategies among crypto-native users, alongside bitcoin," wrote Alexandr Kerya, VP of product management at CEX.IO. "At the same time, the broader RWA narrative helps make gold exposure more accessible and intuitive for users who may not have considered it before," Kerya added.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Eric Semler, Chairman of Semler Scientific, shared how the company transformed its trajectory through a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Semler Scientific (SMLR) is not your typical Bitcoin treasury company. What followed was a radical shift in valuation, shareholder engagement, and long-term positioning. “We were the second U.S. public company to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve strategy. Michael Saylor obviously is the quintessential pioneer, but we're in that group.” I wasn't actually involved in the company until two years ago,” he said. What he found was a business generating cash but not being rewarded for it—“a zombie company,” as he put it. It looked eerily similar to MicroStrategy in August of 2020. A lot of our market cap was in cash. Rather than pursue an acquisition, Semler helped steer the company toward Bitcoin. “We needed to figure out a way to jump start our growth and we settled on Bitcoin, which was a great decision.” Since announcing its Bitcoin treasury strategy, Semler Scientific has experienced a significant shift—not just in valuation, but in momentum and perception. For companies with strong fundamentals but no growth narrative, Bitcoin offers more than asset appreciation—it offers signaling power, capital preservation, and a way to re-engage the market on new terms. For a company that had spent years overlooked by the market, Semler Scientific's pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy didn't just shift financial fundamentals—it dramatically raised the company's profile. I'm not into kind of exposing myself by social media,” he admitted. Semler Scientific has attracted a new, vocal shareholder base, and Semler himself has become a reference point for other executives weighing the Bitcoin path. While retail investors can access Bitcoin through spot ETFs or self-custody, many large institutional funds remain restricted by mandates that prohibit direct exposure. That dynamic creates a unique opening for publicly traded operating companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. “Most investment funds can't buy ETFs,” Semler explained. “For a large number of the huge funds in this country, we're really their only way to get exposure to Bitcoin in the stock market.” This limitation—little known outside institutional circles—has turned companies like Semler Scientific into proxy vehicles for Bitcoin exposure. And for fund managers who believe in the long-term thesis but can't touch the underlying asset, firms like SMLR offer a rare bridge. As more institutions seek asymmetric upside and diversified alternatives to fiat-debasing capital environments, Semler Scientific (SMLR) is increasingly part of that capital conversation—not because of what it sells, but because of what it holds. When asked what advice he would give to other companies considering Bitcoin, Semler didn't sugarcoat it. “We took almost all of our cash and bought Bitcoin in May. But instead of pulling back, they pushed forward—raising more capital and buying more Bitcoin through both ATM equity and convertible notes. Semler believes the long-term upside goes beyond “hodling.” As infrastructure matures and institutions like JPMorgan step deeper into the space, he sees potential to leverage Bitcoin for yield and financing. For now, the focus is clear: accumulate Bitcoin, manage volatility, and unlock value where others see risk. Disclaimer: This content was written on behalf of Bitcoin For Corporations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Liberty Financial (WLFI) on Thursday transferred $775,000 in USDC from its main wallet to a secondary wallet primarily used for purchasing altcoins, according to data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. World Liberty Fi just moved $775K from their main wallet, to the wallet that they typically use for buying altcoins. The transfer comes after the project acquired over 3.54 million Mantle (MNT) on March 23. The week prior, WLFI had added $4 million worth of MNT and AVAX tokens to its portfolio. In addition to MNT and AVAX, the project holds nine other digital assets including Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Ethena (ENA), MOVE (MOVE), Ondo (ONDO), and Sei (SEI). World Liberty Financial recently established a strategic collaboration with Sui blockchain, aiming to integrate Sui's technology into its ecosystem and explore next-generation blockchain applications focused on decentralized finance. The project, endorsed by President Trump, plans to add Sui tokens to its “Macro Strategy” reserve as part of the partnership. WLFI is launching USD1, a stablecoin for institutions and sovereign investors that will be redeemable one-to-one for US dollars. The team also conducted test transfers on its new stablecoin. The stablecoin, backed by US government treasuries, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents, will launch on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, with BitGo providing custody services and third-party accounting firm audits planned.</p>

Kraken, the popular cryptocurrency platform, has partnered with MasterCard, which will allow users to spend their crypto assets, from established best altcoins to new meme coins, directly at more than 150M merchants. This partnership can be a historic move in the payment industry, as it will allow users to pay for real-world goods and services with their crypto holdings, just like they spend cash. Read on as we explore the specifics of this announcement and talk briefly about the UK's changing relationship with crypto. We'll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy now. Crypto is transforming the payments industry, and we envision a future where global commerce and everyday payments are powered by crypto assets – David Ripley, Kraken Co-CEO MasterCard also published a link where Kraken customers can join the waitlist for this new crypto payment offering. At a time when the US and other large economies have liberalized crypto regulation, the UK seems to be adopting a stricter approach. As per reports, the FCA wants to regulate activities such as stablecoin issuance, crypto lending, exchange activities, and payment services. This decision also comes at a time when six UK digital economy trade bodies have written a letter to the UK Prime Minister to appoint a special team for crypto and digital asset regulation management in the country. It also presents retail investors like us with a great opportunity to invest in promising crypto assets. If you don't know where to look, here are three suggestions. It's the ONLY crypto right now offering free (and real) $BTC to token holders. Although this game plan already sounds like a surefire winner, the developers have further bolstered the token's future by scheduling regular token burns. These will artificially contract the total supply, and as investors rush to grab the few remaining $BTCBULL tokens, their price will most likely see an uptick. In fact, our BTC Bull Token price prediction suggests that the token could climb as high as $0.0096 by the end of 2026. The project has so far raised over $4.5M, and here's a detailed guide on how to buy $BTCBULL. A huge reason we believe SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) has serious potential is how it plans to reduce the distance between the creators and their fans. With AI live streams, direct chat, and the ability to request personalized content, $SUBBD will help fans get closer to their favorite creators, which was the point all along. What's more, as a $SUBBD token holder, you'll also receive subscription discounts, loyalty rewards, and the earliest access to new platform features. This means you'll be able to vote on matters, such as which features the developers should prioritize, which creators should/should not be onboarded, themes, etc. You can buy $SUBBD, one of the best new cryptocurrencies, for just $0.055125. And with $SUBBD price prediction targeting $0.668 by the end of 2026, early adopters may see a nearly 1,200% gain over the current price. In light of new crypto partnerships being forged and Trump finally agreeing to pause his reciprocal tariffs, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos. With full-blown degen energy backing this absurdly themed meme coin, it has jumped over 91% in the last seven days – and it's up 202% in just the last month. Built on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin came into existence as a result of Elon Musk's fascination with fart jokes. Currently trading at $0.6983, $FARTCOIN is in a pole position to rally higher. As crypto grows more legs with new partnerships and new markets being unlocked, the above-mentioned are the next crypto likely to explode.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Price Climbs Following Tariff U-Turn and Better Than Expected Inflation Report Ethereum has climbed 9% in the past 24 hours, following the Trump administration announcing plans to temporarily pause tariffs yesterday. It was also buoyed by Thursday morning's better-than-expected U.S. inflation report—but ETF flows show that many investors are still retreating from cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, which has gained 6.1% in the past day, has fared better than the broader crypto market, which saw its market capitalization grow 4.2% since yesterday, according to CoinGecko data. But despite Bitcoin's strong performance, $127.2 million left Bitcoin ETFs yesterday, with BlackRock's IBIT ETF, the industry's largest, leading the pack with $89.7 million in withdrawals, according to data from Farside Investors. Only one fund, Bitwise's BITB ETF, had a positive flow of capital, gaining $6.7 million. This marks the fifth consecutive day of outflows for Bitcoin ETFs. It would seem that institutional investors haven't been swapped by the crypto market's rebound following the U.S. tariff announcement. Ethereum funds also showed net outflows yesterday, despite the cryptocurrency rebounding even more than Bitcoin with an 8.1% rise. Investor sentiment for Bitcoin and Ethereum is bright Many investors are still betting on prices going higher.

Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a third-party sentiment analysis tool, is also showing signs of optimism returning. Some believe Atkins, who was President Donald Trump's pick, will bring a looser approach to crypto regulation than his predecessor Gary Gensler.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenSea presents a letter to the Crypto Task Force of the US SEC to urge clarity on NFT regulation. First and foremost, OpenSea informs the regulators that NFT marketplaces cannot be classified as either exchanges or securities brokers, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). On this topic, the lawyers of the marketplace Adele Faure and Laura Brookover, provide a series of regulated definitions that prove this statement. “OpenSea acts as an online marketplace that allows discovering NFTs and connecting with buyers and sellers. However, the actual transfer of value and assets is carried out on the blockchain through publicly available smart contracts.” This is a real encouragement to the Commission to eliminate the ongoing regulatory uncertainty that prevails in the NFT sector, and to protect the ability of US tech companies to be leaders in this sector. To succeed in this dual objective, the lawyers of OpenSea propose first and foremost that the SEC clearly declare that NFT marketplaces like OpenSea cannot be classified as exchanges and brokers under federal securities laws. In this sense, for the two lawyers of OpenSea, the NFT marketplaces are just exploration tools. This move by OpenSea comes after last February 2025, it emerged that the US SEC had decided to close the investigation into the famous marketplace. The previous US administration had issued a Wells notice against OpenSea last August 2024, indicating the intention to initiate legal action. However, with the current letter, OpenSea refers to what could be new regulatory guidelines on the topic of NFT marketplaces in the USA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HONG KONG, April  10, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XT.COM, a leading digital asset exchange, is pleased to share highlights from the HK VIP Party #BeyondTrade, held on April 6 in Central, Hong Kong. The event extended into the early hours of April 7, bringing together an eclectic community of investors, key opinion leaders, and passionate music lovers—underscoring XT.COM's long-standing commitment to fostering global connectivity and going #BeyondTrade. The HK VIP Party took place alongside the Hong Kong Web3 Festival, infusing fresh energy into a city already recognized as a global financial and cultural hub. Over 300 invited guests attended an exclusive gathering at a chic social lounge in Central, which was transformed for the evening to create an atmosphere of high-level networking and celebration. Throughout the event, participants exchanged insights on emerging trends in digital finance while enjoying memorable performances and lively discussions. Building on XT.COM's annual theme of “#BeyondTrade,” the night exemplified the platform's dedication to uniting diverse communities through more than just transactions. By hosting leaders from finance, technology, and the arts, XT.COM once again demonstrated its drive to bridge industries, champion inclusivity, and expand its brand presence worldwide. A standout highlight of the evening was the special performance by Hong Kong rock legend Paul Wong, who revisited classics from Beyond's timeless repertoire. The moment he struck his first chord, guests responded with enthusiastic cheers, many reminiscing about the powerful cultural impact these songs had across different eras. Wong's set ignited a wave of nostalgia and camaraderie, reflecting the city's pioneering spirit and demonstrating how cherished legacies can resonate across generations. Just as Beyond's music endures in collective memory, XT.COM's approach to digital asset exchanges is defined by an enduring vision that transcends short-term market fluctuations. Investors, entrepreneurs, and opinion leaders shared insights on how digital finance is evolving—particularly in the face of new technology shifts and changing global markets. They also explored ideas for building more robust, user-focused platforms that could promote innovation and inclusivity. The exchange strives to reach audiences outside the traditional crypto space, illuminating opportunities for cultural and economic growth through open dialogue and strategic partnerships. For XT.COM, the HK VIP Party served as another milestone in its commitment to community engagement and long-term growth. Over the past seven years, the exchange has adapted to market shifts and regulatory landscapes while remaining focused on broadening access to digital finance solutions. “Our mission goes beyond transactions,” said an XT.COM spokesperson. This is precisely what #BeyondTrade stands for: looking past short-term gains to foster a more inclusive and innovative environment.” As the final notes of Wong's performance lingered in the early morning air, attendees left with a sense of shared purpose and optimism. By maintaining its focus on global connectivity, user empowerment, and cross-industry collaboration, XT.COM intends to keep expanding the horizons of what a digital asset exchange can achieve—continuing to go #BeyondTrade in every sense.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain technology has revolutionised many industries, from finance to supply chains, and even art, with the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The energy-intensive nature of blockchain systems, especially those based on proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms, has sparked a debate about the sustainability of this technology. PoW is the consensus mechanism that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This process consumes enormous amounts of electricity, as miners must compete to solve puzzles faster than others in the network. A significant portion of this energy comes from non-renewable sources, further contributing to carbon emissions. In fact, Bitcoin mining alone accounts for approximately 0.5% of global electricity consumption. One of the most notable innovations in this area is the shift from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which are far less energy-intensive. Unlike PoW, PoS does not rely on miners solving complex puzzles. Instead, validators (or ‘stakers') are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to ‘stake' as collateral. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, has made significant strides in moving from PoW to PoS with the launch of Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade has been touted as a significant step toward reducing Ethereum's carbon footprint by approximately 99.95%. Other blockchain platforms, like Cardano and Polkadot, have already adopted PoS from the outset, highlighting the growing trend towards energy-efficient blockchain systems. For instance, Power Ledger, an Australian startup, uses blockchain to enable peer-to-peer trading of renewable energy. This allows consumers with solar panels to sell excess energy to others, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of clean energy. Similarly, energy providers are exploring blockchain to optimise grid management and increase the integration of renewable energy sources, reducing the need for non-renewable backup power. In addition to the transition to PoS and renewable energy integration, blockchain can also play a role in carbon offsetting initiatives. Several blockchain-based platforms are facilitating the purchase and tracking of carbon credits, ensuring greater transparency and accountability in the carbon offset market. For example, the platform Verra is developing a blockchain solution to track carbon credits, allowing businesses and individuals to purchase verified carbon offsets with greater confidence. By offering transparent and immutable records, blockchain can help prevent fraudulent claims and ensure that carbon offset projects deliver the environmental benefits they promise. Researchers and innovators are exploring additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint of blockchain, including: Blockchain technology has undeniably made a profound impact on the world, enabling new economic models, decentralisation, and greater transparency. However, its environmental impact, particularly through energy-intensive proof-of-work systems, remains a significant challenge. Thankfully, there is a growing commitment within the industry to develop more energy-efficient alternatives, such as proof-of-stake and green blockchain solutions. As the technology continues to evolve, blockchain could play an increasingly important role in promoting sustainability, whether through cleaner consensus mechanisms, support for renewable energy, or facilitating carbon offsetting initiatives. The future of blockchain is not only about decentralisation and innovation; it's also about ensuring that these advancements can coexist with a planet that thrives in harmony with sustainable practices.
