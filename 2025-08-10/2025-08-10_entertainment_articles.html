Eddie Murphy is an Academy Award-nominated actor — but, to him, that doesn't mean that you only have to make prestige pictures. Firmly established as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Murphy — who just premiered “The Pickup” on Amazon Prime — has always made exactly the kind of movie he wants to make in the moment. Hence why he followed up 2006's “Dreamgirls” — which netted not just an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, but five other nominations and two wins — with the widely panned “Norbit” in 2007. “I love ‘Norbit,'” Murphy said on Complex's interview series “360 With Speedy Morman” (via The Wrap). And I was like, ‘Come on now, shit ain't that bad. Related Stories Sharon Stone on the Moment Robert De Niro ‘Crossed a Line' Filming ‘Casino' George Clooney Says ‘Playing Yourself' Is ‘Hard to Do,' Calls ‘Jay Kelly' Co-Star Adam Sandler ‘Soulful Actor' In fact, he turned down one of the '90s biggest hit comedies (or one of the biggest ones Murphy wasn't already in). “They came to me, it was two scripts,” Murphy explained. We went to Miami and made a horrendous film, but it was easy. 1998's “Holy Man” was indeed one of the few Murphy movies to lose money, in addition to savage critical reviews. One other major project Murphy passed on was “Malcolm X.” Interestingly, it was a historic Oscar-winner who told Murphy to sit that film out. “They were talking about doing ‘Malcolm X,'” Murphy said in the Apple TV+ documentary “Number One on the Call Sheet: Black Leading Men in Hollywood.” “Norman Jewison was putting it together. They were going to use ‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X' by Alex Haley, and they approached me about playing Alex Haley. You are a breath of fresh air, and don't fuck with that!' […] I didn't know if it was an insult or a compliment. Alex Haley ended up not being a character in 1992's “Malcolm X,” which ended up directed instead by Spike Lee and starring Washington, who earned an Oscar nomination for his work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SPOILER: This post contains details about The Fantastic Four: First Steps Despite the intense media training and spoiler deterrents Marvel Studios has been rumored to inflict on its stars, Paul Walter Hauser played it fast and loose with his character reveal. The Golden Globe winner, who makes his MCU antihero debut as Mole Man in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, recently confessed that he wasn't as discreet as most of his Marvel peers about the surprise role. “For the most part I was zip-lipped, and everybody understands at this point. They all know if you do Star Wars, or Marvel, you can't talk about it,” he explained to GQ. “But if I'm being honest—and I pride myself on my honesty nowadays—I probably told 70 or 80 random people, be it family members or fans. Hauser continued, “But at the same time, they weren't blabbering it out, or giving it to news outlets. After the Russo Brothers have said they're cracking down on spoilers while filming Avengers: Doomsday, Hauser said he sees the strict MCU secrecy “kind of like jaywalking,” assuming they have bigger fish to fry. “It's like, you can get [arrested] for that, but it's like, hopefully they're catching the bad guys,” added Hauser. Now playing in theaters, one of The Fantastic Four: First Steps‘ multiple surprises is the introduction of Hauser as Harvey Elder (aka Mole Man), a former enemy of the Fantastic Four and leader of Subterranea who ultimately joins forces with the titular team against Galactus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bobby Whitlock, keyboardist in Eric Clapton's short-lived but acclaimed band Derek and the Dominos, has died at the age of 77. Whitlock's death early Sunday morning was confirmed by his manager Carol Kaye, who said in a statement to ABC Audio, “With profound sadness, the family of Bobby Whitlock announces his passing at 1:20am on Aug. 10 after a brief illness. In the late-Sixties, Whitlock would join the husband-wife duo Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett and an army of talented musicians in a group dubbed Delaney & Bonnie and Friends; some of those “Friends” included a post-Cream Eric Clapton, guitarist Duane Allman, bassist Carl Radle, and drummer Jim Gordon. Whitlock, who previously played on Clapton's 1970 self-titled debut album, co-wrote half of the songs that appear on Derek and the Dominos' 1970 studio album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, including the classic rock standard “Bell Bottom Blues,” “Anyday,” “Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?,” and opener “I Looked Away.” Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs would later be named be named one of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. However, it was not commercially successful upon release, and compounded with the 1971 death of Duane Allman as well as Clapton's drug addiction, Derek and the Dominos ultimately broke up in 1971 in the midst of recording their second album. While recording that failed sophomore album in London, Whitlock also worked on his own self-titled debut album, which featured his Derek and the Dominos band mates as well as George Harrison; Whitlock previously contributed organ and piano to the former Beatle's 1970 masterpiece All Things Must Pass, appearing on songs like “My Sweet Lord,” “What Is Life,” the title track, and the vinyl-length Apple Jam. Whitlock's second solo album, 1972's Raw Velvet, also featured Clapton and Harrison. However, by the turn of the millennium, Whitlock returned to recording, often accompanied by his wife and musician CoCo Carmel. Whitlock and Clapton also reunited in 2000 to perform “Bell Bottom Blues” together on Later With Jools Holland: Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Refresh for latest…:  Two new studio movies entered the marketplace this weekend, and both exceeded expectations. Combined with domestic, that takes the global debut to $70M. And, there's a new milestone afoot for Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth. Jamie Lee Curtis Calls Out 'Freakier Friday' Critic For Being "A Tad Harsh" Weapons' international opening, in like-for-like markets and at today's exchange rates, is tracking above Speak No Evil (+164%), Smile (+77%), The Black Phone (+59%), Evil Dead Rise (+34%) and M3GAN (+29%). Notably, in Europe, Weapons was tops for the region including UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Holland and Poland. In like-for-likes, the debut was ahead of Sinners (+33%), Smile (+46%) and Speak No Evil (+110%). Still, it was above The Black Phone (+17%), Evil Dead Rise (+22%) and M3GAN (+32%) on a reigional basis. In Asia, Weapons topped studio play, far ahead of the above comps and with Indonesia particularly notable at No. 1 amid local horror titles which, as we know, increasingly dominate. The Imax portion worldwide was $8.1M, including $1.9M from overseas. Turning to the other new opener, Disney's Lindsay Lohan/Jamie Lee Curtis reteam, Freakier Friday, the body-swap comedy saw overperformance in Latin America, landing a surprise No. Overall, the female and family-skewing pic opened bigger than 2003's Freaky Friday and 2024's Mean Girls in like-for-like markets at current rates. The film is yet to open in Korea, Japan and some smaller Asian territories.. Talent traveled to Mexico City and did a junket for Latin America which clearly helped — other Lat Am markets that debuted to No. In Australia, the comedy scored a No. The Top 5 overseas markets at open are: Mexico ($2.8M), UK ($2.4M), Australia ($1.4M), Argentina ($800K) and Colombia ($800K). In holdovers, and after three weekends, Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps has reached $434.2M worldwide, including $203.8M from the international box office (all markets are open). In Brazil and Chile, the fantastic family held No. Here are the Top 5 so far: UK ($25.5M), Mexico ($24.2M), France ($12.5M), Brazil ($11.6M) and Australia ($9.7M). The estimated offshore cume is $473.2M through Sunday with worldwide at $799.9M. Amid a 50% overseas drop during this 6th session, Mosasaurus & Co added another $16.1M in 83 markets. It's in line with 2015's Jurassic World, well above the 3-day openings of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and A Minecraft Movie, more than 3x The Fantastic Four: First Steps, and more than double Superman and F1. The weekend gross there, despite competition from local title Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, will surpass the total lifetime of Gladiator II and Captain America: Brave New World in the coming days. The Top 5 JWR markets to date are: China ($78.1M), UK ($45.3M), Mexico ($35.3M), Germany ($30.5M) and France ($26.6M). And, after becoming Brad Pitt's highest-grossing movie ever worldwide, Apple Original Films' F1, via Warner Bros, is still seeing incredible holds. Here's the Top 5 to date: China ($57M), UK ($28.9M), Korea ($28.2M), France ($27.9M) and Mexico ($19.6M). Several markets are still to come, including Brazil, China, Italy, Germany and Australia. Currently, the Top 5 are: UK ($9.9M), France ($4.7M), Mexico ($3.6M), Spain ($3.5M) and Korea ($2M). The sophomore session of Paramount's The Naked Gun picked up another $6.1M from 48 overseas markets, a holdover drop of 48%. The Top 5 markets through Sunday are: UK ($5.9M), Germany ($4M), Netherlands ($1.3M), Mexico ($1.2M) and Austria ($728K). As for Warner/DC's Superman, the 5th session added $5.8M from 78 overseas markets (a 49% drop). Here are the Top 5 offshore: UK ($35.2M), Mexico ($22.7M), Brazil ($16M), Australia ($15.4M) and France ($14.7M). Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Superman will end up 100 million short of breaking even. F1 and Superman are looking quite close in the end. Every smart movie fan knows that in order to calculate a film's success first you double the budget. You then assume it got 0 tax rebates and that the theaters take 20 percent more than they actually do. Once this is done you realize Weapons like most movies needs 700 million to break even. I feel like this post is intended to be read as tongue in cheek, presumably to mock the dozens of comments under every box office report claiming Superman needs $700M to break even. If you're that butthurt about Fantastic Four flopping then Avegers Doomsday will be the end of you😆 Weapons' budget was $38M… what are you talking about? Breakeven is $200M even if marketing was $62M (which I doubt). You seem to have that term confused with “broken calculator fan.” Can you blame Marvel fans for being bitter? The past few years have been floppy for Marvel but now EVERYTHING Marvel has released in 2025 has flopped! We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Thank you for making me aware," the reality star wrote on social media. On Friday (Aug. 8), the 46-year-old reality star — who shares Rocky with her husband, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker — posted a series of Instagram snapshots, one of which showed her young son on a boat without a life vest, sparking criticism online. Other photos in the post suggested the family was vacationing in Idaho, where state law requires children 14 and under to wear a life jacket while on a boat. Another urged, “Please, please put a life jacket on that sweet babe!” A third wrote, “You gotta make sure the kids are wearing life vests at all times! Just like you wouldn't drive them around without a seatbelt/car seat. Water is so unpredictable and can be devastatingly dangerous.” Honestly didn't think about some of the dangers. The original image showed Kardashian seated at the back of a boat while holding Rocky, whom she welcomed in November 2023 with Barker. The Lemme founder is also mom to three children with ex-partner Scott Disick: sons Mason, 15, and Reign, 10, as well as daughter Penelope, 13.

For Sharon Stone, the ultimate dream come true was working with Robert De Niro in “Casino.” She told Business Insider that she auditioned for De Niro movies “many times” before she was cast in the 1994 Martin Scorsese classic. Stone had even told an acting teacher years prior that her career goal was to “work with De Niro and hold my own.” But when Stone finally realized what she called “the apex,” De Niro ended up setting Stone off while shooting one of the movie's most electric verbal sparring sessions. The “Basic Instinct” actress recalled, “There's a scene in the movie where we're sitting across a table arguing, and he says to me, ‘You're a good actress, you know that?' I remember thinking, ‘Oh, you crossed a line today, mister.

It all paid off for Stone, who landed a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her work in “Casino.” Stone will next appear in Universal's “Nobody 2,” the Bob Odenkirk-starring action sequel that adds not just Stone, but also Colin Hanks and John Ortiz to its roster. In discussing her role, described as the film‘s antagonist, she said she came close to turning it down. “I just don't want to play a cookie-cutter villain, which is something that I really have a thing about,” she said. The hesitation comes after what she felt was typecasting after her turn as a sultry femme fatale in “Basic Instinct.” “But that was not cookie-cutter; it was a villain that touched upon the zeitgeist of the moment,” Stone said. In a statement to IndieWire, screenwriter Joe Eszterhas said, “To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: The rumors of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist. I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN and he lives somewhere deep inside me. Rumors suggest Stone might join for this new “anti-woke” “Basic Instinct,” as she did for its misbegotten 2006 sequel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's Saturday night in New Jersey and My Chemical Romance have set the MetLife stage on fire — literally. Flames engulf the stage floor and bright orange flares shoot up in bursts around lead singer Gerard Way, bassist Mikey Way, and guitarists Frank Iero and Ray Toro as the band delivers an electrifying performance of “Famous Last Words” worthy of the blaze that surrounds them. Gerard sings the final line, “Nothing you can say can stop me from going home” and in their hometown stadium, the lyrics couldn't ring more true. Saturday night marked My Chemical Romance's sixth stop on the Long Live the Black Parade Tour, which kicked off last month in Seattle. In fact, Courtney and Mike, two fans from Eastern Canada who arrived at noon on Saturday in order to secure their spots at the barricade, were adamant about getting tickets to the band's MetLife show. My Chemical Romance's show at MetLife marked the band's headlining debut there, and nearly every minute of their two-and-a-half hour set made sure to commemorate that very fact. It was only right to give Rickly, and the rest of Thursday, their due and have them join My Chemical Romance's headlining debut at MetLife. While not Jersey Boys, the additional special guests at MetLife were none other than indie staple, Death Cab for Cutie. It was a lineup made of early-aughts emo dreams. The show was coursing with Jersey energy till the very end, when My Chemical Romance closed out with an unexpected, and explosive cover of Bon Jovi's “Living on a Prayer,” or what Way called, “the New Jersey state anthem.” “Never once in the history of Belleville, have we ever handed a key to the city,” Belleville mayor Michael Melham said. By this point, My Chemical Romance were dressed as their alter-ego band the Black Parade, and Gerard refused to break character, even to receive the key. Instead, he gifted Mayor Melham wheat and a fake fish from the fictional city of Draag, which has played a role in the entire tour's storyline. Funnily enough, moments after receiving the key, Gerard briefly broke character when he yelped, “Oh wait! Let's fucking kill some people,” in a full North Jersey lilt. My Chemical Romance Debuts New Song 'War Beneath the Rain' From Unreleased Album Watch My Chemical Romance Cover Smashing Pumpkins' ‘Bullet With Butterfly Wings' Deftones, My Chemical Romance, and Blink-182 Headline 2025 Shaky Knees Fest (At one point in the show, a mock election was held where attendees were forced to vote with “Yea/Nay” reversible signs on whether or not they believe people should be executed. The world-building of Draag has been in play since last fall, when My Chemical Romance began teasing the tour on social media with cryptic Instagram posts and imagery that felt similar to Nazi Germany. There's a clown that blows himself up, and at one point, Gerard uses his one last gasping breath after being stabbed to launch a nuclear war. The band even tapped director Claire Marie Vogel to help create intricate tour visuals that fit the tour narrative. It all an astounding amount of creative output that makes for a stellar show. It's clear My Chemical Romance wanted to outdo themselves. The dedicated My Chemical Romance fans loved every second of the show, and welcomed their hometown heroes with their wide open arms. Swaths of attendees were dressed in outfits inspired by the Draag world and past MCR eras. From a B stage situated near the center of the stadium, My Chemical Romance commanded their hometown stadium with songs from the rest of their catalog and a raw, effusive energy that was contagious. My Chemical Romance even played a raucous rendition of “Boy Division,” a track from their scrapped material collection Conventional Weapons, which was released shortly before the band broke up in 2013.

But this was reality and My Chemical Romance reveled in the career-high. With each riff, Mikey, Toro, and Iero couldn't help but smile from ear-to-ear while Gerard continued to fling his body around and command massive singalongs. “I felt that one in my bones,” he said.

It's also the first time we've ever had fans on set for day one, so it's really exciting to share this with them.” Holland added, “We've got some familiar faces on set. I'm just gonna do my best, hopefully get it right. After greeting some cosplaying fans, Holland got wired up on top of a tank, filming a scene as he ripped off the top hatch of the vehicle while it drove through the city. Holland previously said that he's “over the moon and so excited” to film on location after filming Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) entirely on soundstages because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “So it's gonna feel like making [2017's] Spider-Man 1 again. It's been such a long time since I've done it, it's gonna feel like a breath of fresh air, and I think the fans are going to be over the moon with what we're putting together.” In October, Sony added Spider-Man: Brand New Day to its summer 2026 schedule with a July 24 release date, later revealing the title in March at CinemaCon. Helmed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Cretton, producers include Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige returning.

We are just a few months shy of when Noah Baumbach‘s ode to a fictional movie star is released, with one of our starriest film stars at its center playing said fictional movie star — George Clooney — and plenty more playing less famous characters. “Jay Kelly” will present a modern day Cary Grant (who is even referenced in the teaser trailer) as he struggles to juggle his life as a mega famous actor. And Clooney said he doesn't “give a shit” if people do think that. Related Stories Sharon Stone on the Moment Robert De Niro ‘Crossed a Line' Filming ‘Casino' ‘Garbo, by Joan Crawford' — Rare BBC Documentary Resurfaces: Here's How to Watch in the U.S. It's hard to do,” Clooney told Vanity Fair, co-opting a line from “Jay Kelly.” The “Ocean's Eleven” star pointed out that, “There aren't that many guys in my age group that are allowed to do both broad comedies like ‘O Brother [Where Art Thou?]' Clooney also defended Sandler, who he called a “beautiful, heartfelt, soulful actor.” “I kept telling the cast, ‘Don't call him ‘Sand Man.' Don't talk to him like he's just some goofy comedian. He's actually a really beautiful, wonderful actor… Because of what his paycheck is, which is doing big goofy comedies, when he does these other, beautiful, ‘Uncut Gems' kinds of movies, it reminds people of that. In the movie, Sandler is Jay Kelly's manager Ron. Explaining his role to Vanity Fair, Sandler said, “My character loves George's character so much, and I thought that would be fun to do and easy to do with George. The film showcases Jay and Ron going on an “unexpectedly profound journey through Europe,” or so Netflix's official synopsis reads. This seems to be a journey full of big names. The movie, co-written by Baumbach with actress Emily Mortimer, also features Mortimer with… big breath… Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Jim Broadbent,  Patrick Wilson, Eve Hewson, Greta Gerwid, Alba Rohurwacher, Josh Hamilton, Lenny Henry, Nicôle Lecky, Thedda Graham, and Isla Fisher. To compare Jay Kelly to Cary Grant is astute, considering that the legendary Old Hollywood actor — who spent the better part of three decades as a top box office star and continued to be a well-known personality through retirement — was on the record saying, “Everyone wants to be Cary Grant. Grant's persona ended up being, like Clooney's, versatile across a wide variety of genres, from action flicks like “North by Northwest” and screwball comedies like “Bringing Up Baby,” to epics like “The Pride and the Passion” and heartfelt dramas like “None but the Lonely Heart.” Clooney, similarly, has stretched his charm across every type of film and has even bridged into the theater.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With NFL season nearly upon us, Bryan — a diehard fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, who defeated the Chiefs in this past Super Bowl — decided to revive his feud with the Kansas City squad on social media. “Where are all the three peat people from last year,” Bryan tweeted, referring to the Chiefs' failed quest for three straight Super Bowl wins. Please understand I will never play in Kansas City https://t.co/VicevXBjda “Please understand I will never play in Kansas City,” Bryan warned. The beefing got so heated that one Chiefs fan told Bryan to remove “Fifth of May (Live from Kansas City)” from the singer's digital-only 24 live album. (As of Sunday morning, the track was still on streaming services.) “Bro all u have to do to piss off a chiefs fan is play a fair game of football,” he added. “Guys it's okay to talk trash to each other about football yall are weird as hell.” (Thankfully, this row with Chiefs fans didn't end with Bryan apologizing to Taylor Swift and deleting his Twitter.) While Bryan has promised to never perform in Kansas City again, he might have found a loophole for fans along the Missouri/Kansas border: “I miss you Bonner Springs coming to play next year,” Bryan tweeted Sunday, referring to the Kansas city that's a 30-minute drive from Kansas City.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Line's horror pic and Disney's family comedy delivered a double win for the late summer box office, as well as a victory for two challenged genres. Thanks to winning over critics and audiences alike, director Zach Cregger's buzzy movie came in more than $10 million ahead of expectations to win the weekend with $42.5 million in yet another notable victory for New Line and parent company Warner Bros., as well as for original stories. The genre doesn't usually travel well, but Weapons is an exception, scaring up strong results in normally horror-resistant markets in Europe and Latin America. Jamie Lee Curtis Responds to Negative 'Freakier Friday' Review: "A Tad Harsh" It's the seventh Warners release of the year to open in first place, an unrivaled feat, as well as its sixth title in a row to open to more than $40 million domestically, also an unrivaled record. In a double win for the late-summer box office, Disney's body-swapping comedy Freakier Friday landed on the high end of expectations with a $29 million domestic start to come in second and become the top August opening ever for a PG-rated pic (or G-rated film for that matter). Both new films ran circles around Disney and Marvel's superhero tentpole The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which suffered another steep drop in its second week, falling roughly 60 percent to an estimated $15.5 million for a troubled domestic total of $240.3 million and $434.2 million globally. Heading into the weekend, prerelease tracking showed Weapons and Freakier Friday opening in the $25 million to $30 million range, but the former quickly pulled ahead after landing an impressive 96 percent critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and an A- CinemaScore from audiences, an almost unheard of grade for a horror pic. Exceptions include Jordan Peele's seminal horror pic Get Out, which also earned an A- and made Peele one of the most sought-after directors overnight. New Line and Warners prevailed over rivals after plunking down $38 million, including a $10 million payday for Cregger, who made waves with his debut feature film, 2022's Barbarian, which he both wrote and directed. Weapons, skewing male, stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night at the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child, and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it. Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which has quite the twist. Rival studios say Warners' marketing campaign for Weapons was nothing short of brilliant, considering it didn't want to ruin the surprise and exploit the twist in marketing materials. All told, Imax and other premium large-format screens turned in a huge 34 percent of the opening gross. Parents gave the film a perfect five out of five stars on exit polling service PostTrak; ditto for kids (16 percent of ticket buyers were under 16). This time around, in a multigenerational twist, they find themselves swapping places with, respectively, the daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter of Anna. Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Rosalind Chao, Chad Michael Murray, Vanessa Bayer and Mark Harmon also star. Disney has enjoyed great success in tapping into nostalgia and luring young adults in their 20s and 30s who grew up on its library of films. Elsewhere on the box office chart, Universal and DreamWorks Animation's modestly budgeted Bad Guys 2 followed Fantastic Four to come in fourth, falling a respectable 53 percent in its sophomore outing to $10.4 million for a 10-day domestic tally of $43.4 million. While that film is considered more of a straight-up comedy, versus a family comedy such as Freakier Friday, it is good news for all that they both work. Naked Gun isn't only symbolic for showing that comedies can still work theatrically. It was also the last movie released by the prior Paramount regime before David Ellison's Skydance closed its $8 billion merger with Paramount Global on Aug. 7. (Skydance has been Paramount's longtime co-financing and co-production partner, but was not involved with Naked Gun.) DC Studios and Warners' Superman continued to show solid staying power in its fifth weekend. In past times, a pricey, marquee superhero pic earning $600 million would have left unhappy studio brass wanting much more, but times have changed. A weakening demand for comic book adaptations is especially problematic overseas, particularly in Asia. Whereas the international box office used to pony up 60 percent to 70 percent of the bottom line for superhero titles, both Superman and Fantastic Four have earned more domestically than overseas. Many in Hollywood were dubious as to whether Universal and Amblin's 2025 summer tentpole Jurassic World Rebirth — the umpteenth reboot of the franchise featuring a whole new cast — would work. In its sixth weekend, it placed seventh domestically after Superman with $4.7 million despite now being available at home on premium VOD. Apple Original Films and Warners' F1: The Movie still hasn't run out of gas either and remained among the top 10 performers in its seventh weekend. Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt, the Formula One action-adventure is one of the summer's biggest surprises and has earned nearly as much as Superman, or $570.7 million globally. The lion's share may come from overseas, or $392.1 million, but its domestic total to date of $178.8 million is impressive considering that Formula One-related movies have often stalled out in the U.S. The movie has since become infamous for sparking an ongoing legal battle between star/producer Blake Lively and Baldoni, who directed, produced and starred in the film, which was adapted from Colleen Hoover's wildly popular book.

Guillermo del Toro's dark reimagining of Frankenstein, featuring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth, a Netflix production, was recently unveiled as being part of the selection for the Venice Film Festival competition lineup. Earlier this year, he world premiered Kontinental '25, an absurdist comedy-drama about Romania's housing crisis and the country's conflicted middle class, at the Berlin Film Festival.

We're still a long way out from the arrival of the second season of Netflix's surprisingly charming live-action adaptation of long-running anime One Piece—to the point that the streamer itself won't get any more specific than “Coming in 2026.” But that hasn't stopped the company from tripling down on its enthusiasm for the show, announcing today that it's renewed the series for a third season way, way before it might have been expected to.

﻿

The news apparently coincides with what we're being assured is “One Piece Day”—very loosely timed to the anniversary of the series beginning its still-ongoing serialization in Shonen Jump back in 1997—with celebrations running in Japan. That includes Netflix popping by to show off a first look trailer for the show's second season, which includes a number of fan-favorite characters, including very big man Brogy (Brendan Murray), antagonistic Marine Smoker (Callum Kerr), and characters who are here identified as Miss Wednesday (Charithra Chandran) and Miss All Sunday (Lera Abova). (Can names be spoilers for plot points laid out in manga issues nearly three decades old at this point? We don't want to be the ones who get yelled at for finding out.)

The trailer also, of course, shows plenty of the cast of the first season, as Monkey D. Luffy (Iñaki Godoy) continues his pursuit of the titular treasure, and the title of “King Of The Pirates,” by heading out “Into The Grand Line.” The series also co-stars Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Romero Gibson, and Taz Skylar as the core members of Luffy's crew, and has attracted an increasing number of big-name guest stars, including upcoming appearances from David Dastmalchian and Joe Manganiello in season 2.
