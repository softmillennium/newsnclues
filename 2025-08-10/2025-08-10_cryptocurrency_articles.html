                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins - He dismisses Ethereum's recent $4,200 rally and ETF inflows as temporary "bear market" rebounds, noting its weakening price ratio against Bitcoin. Peter Schiff, the economist and chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, has reiterated his call for investors to divest Ethereum in favor of Bitcoin, despite Ethereum's recent price rally [1]. In his latest comments, Schiff argued that while Ethereum has shown signs of strength, its long-term prospects remain uncertain, and Bitcoin continues to serve as the preferred digital asset for its role as a store of value [1]. Schiff highlighted that Ethereum's recent gains, including a price rise above $4,200 and inflows into Ethereum ETFs exceeding $404 million, do not necessarily indicate a sustainable bullish trend [1]. According to Schiff, the Ethereum to Bitcoin price ratio has moved lower, reinforcing his view that Ethereum is weakening against Bitcoin in the short term [1]. While Ethereum has gained traction in the smart contract and DeFi spaces, Schiff contends that it is losing its original use case, which was to serve as a foundational platform for decentralized applications [1]. The Bitcoin dominance index currently stands at approximately 59.1%, a decline from its peak but still significantly higher than Ethereum's 13% market share [1]. Schiff emphasized that his preference for Bitcoin does not stem from a belief in the technology itself, but rather from its perceived stability and long-term resilience [1]. He acknowledged that both assets have flaws, but argued that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage and growing acceptance by institutional investors make it a safer bet in the current environment [1].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Competing visions for digital currency regulation reveal broader financial ambitions. This is a type of cryptocurrency that can maintain a fixed value by being pegged to other assets such as Bitcoin, or the US dollar, or the Chinese renminbi. In Hong Kong and Washington, bills to regulate stablecoins have recently become law. Hong Kong is attempting to reestablish a position in the global financial world by setting up an economic hub for stablecoins and other ventures in what is known as “Web3”, the next generation of the internet based on decentralisation and blockchain technology. Meanwhile the Trump administration is heavily involved with cryptocurrencies, bolstered by the support of “crypto bros” who funded President Donald Trump's campaign. Stablecoins could have far reaching consequences for the two economies, while also reshaping global finance. The Stablecoins Bill, passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council in May, is a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to regulate stablecoins that are pegged to traditional currencies. China appears keen to keep government-backed stablecoins in Hong Kong, while ensuring that stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies are kept outside of the mainland. Although not officially banned by the central government, Stablecoins and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are heavily restricted in mainland China. But Hong Kong has been allowed to enter the stablecoin market. The city will once again become another gateway for China, this time for Web3 and cryptocurrencies. While within the mainland crypto will remain suppressed, it will likely bloom in Hong Kong, allowing China to trade with them internationally. Domestic markets will be free from its volatility and anarchic nature. Last month, Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) into law. This bill similarly aims to create a “comprehensive regulatory framework” for stablecoins. It requires stablecoins to be pegged to the US dollar or other low risk assets, to be registered with regulators, and ensure that they meet audit requirements. Stablecoins are seen as more than just an investment but as a form of payment, with those pegged to the US dollar already rising in use, even in China's fintech sector. A pillar of Trump's support in his 2024 campaign was the “crypto-bros,” tech investors and executives with portfolios heavily based on cryptocurrencies and their connecting technologies. These figures, including Elon Musk, supported Donald Trump on the hope that he would in turn pass favourable legislation. The GENIUS act sees those hopes coming to fruition. His “$Trump” meme coin, launched three days before his inauguration, rose some 300% over the initial price, before dropping by half. The people behind the $trump coin (including Trump) reportedly made an estimated US$100 million in trading fees. It appeared to be a rug pull, where developers of a coin abandon the coin after making initial profits, leaving buyers with a useless asset. The GENIUS Act could see such schemes proliferate. As the new forms of digital currency become more like real world currency, with underlying regulations and stability, its integration into the global financial order will increase.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price today surged past $4,300 for the first time since December 2021, fueled by record institutional inflows, strong technical momentum, and renewed optimism around staking-inclusive ETFs. In the last 24 hours alone, ETH gained 7.5%, briefly trading above $4,300 before consolidating near $4,250. The latest rally is being driven by large-scale buying from both institutional investors and whales. Data from The Boss shows that SharpLink Gaming increased its ETH holdings to $2.12 billion after a major purchase on August 8. SharpLink Gaming adds $85M in ETH, total holdings now $2.12B, signaling rising institutional interest. Whale activity has intensified, with a notable $40.5 million over-the-counter acquisition of 10,400 ETH in recent days. Standard Chartered's Geoffrey Kendrick predicts that corporate treasuries could eventually hold 10% of Ethereum's total supply — a shift that could rival the impact of spot ETFs. Spot ETH ETFs themselves are enjoying unprecedented demand, posting twelve consecutive weeks of inflows totaling over $5 billion in July. On August 9 alone, ETH ETF inflows hit $461 million, according to analyst Ted. From a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum has cleared multiple resistance levels. After rebounding from strong support at $3,470, ETH broke above the $4,193 Fibonacci 1.618 extension — a level often associated with accelerated price moves. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.8, just below overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. The SEC recently clarified that liquid staking does not violate securities laws, paving the way for potential staking-inclusive ETH ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. At the ecosystem level, Ethereum Layer 2 growth continues to accelerate, with rising transaction volumes on Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. These scalability solutions are attracting new DeFi projects and NFT marketplaces, adding fresh demand for ETH. While some analysts warn of potential retracement after such a rapid climb, the overall sentiment remains bullish. On-chain trends, ETF momentum, and macro breakout patterns all point toward continued gains. Analyst Rekt Capital estimates Ethereum is only “50–60% through its macro uptrend,” leaving plenty of room for upside. If current momentum holds, ETH could challenge its all-time high of $4,868 in the coming weeks and potentially target $5,000 — with the more ambitious $12,000 forecast no longer seeming out of reach.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan remains bullish on U.S. stocks even as some observers warn that the economy is beginning to pay the price for President Donald Trump's tariffs. Instead, traders are focused on resilient corporate earnings and the subsequent economic recovery. Since President Trump fired the first tariff salvo on April 2, economists have downgraded full-year U.S. growth forecasts from 2.3% to 1.5%. The index has held steady despite recent economic data revealing softness in the labour market and consumption, as well as stickiness in manufacturing and service sector inflation. Over 80% of S&P 500 companies have recently reported their Q2 earnings, with 82% surpassing earnings expectations and 79% beating revenue forecasts—the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2021. According to JPMorgan, while Wall Street analysts initially projected earnings growth below 5%, the index is now on pace for an impressive 11% growth rate. Additionally, the market is now figuring out and pricing in which companies are getting hit most by U.S. tariffs. So far, it looks like mega corporations will be just fine. JPMorgan analysts explained that consumer-facing and smaller companies with restrained bargaining power against their trading partners and rigid supply chains are facing a stagnant earnings outlook. This ties to JPMorgan's last catalyst: Trump's tariff bark is proving worse than its bite for large firms, which are managing to secure exemptions and even turn the tariff policies, aimed at sparking a manufacturing boom, into a tailwind. Apple products are exempted from the latest tariff rates on Indian goods. Indeed, the company also announced an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing facilities. Tariffs are not happening in a vacuum," analysts explained. Big firms gain an additional advantage from the One Big Beautiful Act (OBBA), under which firms can claim 100% bonus depreciation for purchases of qualified business property and immediate expense of domestic research and development costs. According to some analysts, the depreciation policy could increase free cash flow for some by over 30%, which could incentivize more investment. The bank added that its investment strategy remains focused on large-cap equities, particularly in the technology, financials, and utilities sectors, which it believes are best positioned to navigate this new economic environment. Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that liquid staking, under certain conditions, falls outside the purview of Securities Law. The ruling has raised hopes for staking spot ether ETFs winning regulatory approval. Omkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor and analyst on CoinDesk's Markets team.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum bulls make a strong case for an ETH price rally toward $10,000 or above in the next six to eight months. Ethereum is breaking out across multiple bullish setups on the price chart. Analysts see ETH rising to $6,000 soon, with $20,000 possible within a year. Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has surged roughly 24% this week to above $4,330, its highest price since December 2021. Many analysts now eye a break above the record $4,950 level next. The ETH/USD pair has been trading inside a large accumulation range for months, steadily absorbing selling pressure. This phase often ends with a decisive breakout once buyers gain control, according to Wyckoff theory. That breakout appears to be underway, with ETH pushing above the $4,200 resistance zone, a stage known as the “Sign of Strength” (SOS). In Wyckoff's model, this is typically followed by a brief pullback, or “Last Point of Support” (LPS), to confirm the new uptrend. That is up by over 90% from the current price levels. Historically, such long-term breakouts on ETH's higher timeframes have preceded strong multimonth rallies, especially when confirmed by increasing volume and favorable macro sentiment. In April 2020, ETH broke out of a symmetrical triangle, surging more than 950% to hit its projected target, and climbing even higher as bullish sentiment intensified. Ethereum may be on track for a run toward $20,000 within 6-8 months from now, if historical price fractals play out. Analyst Nilesh Verma highlights the repeating pattern, where ETH rallies sharply after retesting a major bottom support. Both moves lasted roughly 12 months before topping out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, just two months later, that figure was slashed  to a mere 14,000 after unprecedented downward revisions totaling approximately 258,000 jobs across May and June, the steepest two-month drop since the non-pandemic era began in 1979. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.” As the jobs-data controversy swirled, billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya argued that the U.S. needed a wholesale rebuild of how employment numbers are collected and reported. Palihapitiya took to X, claiming  that the BLS system was “brittle” and “sloppy,” and called for a new “oracle-like data provider” for this critical information. “They are all over the place and add little directional signal. “The sampling techniques they use are brittle and don't work for a large and dynamic economy like the U.S.,” he added. “There needs to be a new, oracle-like data provider for this critical information,” he added. Are you suggesting a crypto like oracle that outputs employment data, every month, on the same day , be REQUIRED FOR EVERY BUSINESS ? Who is gonna pay for the implementations? Famed investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban fired back at the idea: Are you suggesting a crypto-like oracle that outputs employment data, every month, on the same day, be required for every business? “Who is gonna pay for the implementations? And of course there are gov agencies that have to respond as well. What do you have in mind for them? “Do you really think the implementation, maintenance, and response timing and rates will be better than the current survey?” Chamath countered Cuban with a three-tier proposal on how he believed taking the jobs market to the blockchain could succeed: Under Chamath Palihapitiya's proposal, payroll providers would automatically upload anonymized employment data in real time, allowing for instant verification and reducing reliance on delayed, sample-based surveys that are prone to large revisions. Because blockchain records are immutable, any changes to the data would be traceable and would eliminate any suspicion of political manipulation. A real-time feed could also provide policymakers and the public with up-to-date labor market information, reducing the shock of dramatic revisions seen recently. Critics, however, warn that implementing this at scale would be expensive and too complex from a system which already works. Suddenly it's garbage because you wanna be cozied up with the President. All of Trump's accusations were presented without any evidence. Speaking to NBC, Labor Secretary during the Biden administration Julie Su said : “The work is done largely by expert career staff who do their jobs with care and pride.” We never doubted the data, even with bad news. “Downward revisions aren't scandal — they're science,” he added. Koh said the agency worked closely with a Trump-appointed commissioner and “never doubted the data, even with bad news.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let's dig into the context behind this trend and the potential risks that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) could face by diversifying their portfolios. Altcoins have now been on top of Bitcoin for a whopping 31 consecutive days, the longest stretch we've seen in over a year. This has been driven by a resurgence in global trading flows and Ethereum's own rise to price levels we haven't seen since 2021. It's looking like we might have an altcoin season on our hands, and it's prompting investors to consider branching out from Bitcoin. The altcoin rally has significant implications for regulatory compliance in crypto banking across Asia and Europe. With altcoin trading on the upswing, there's a pressing need for clearer and more adaptable regulatory frameworks. This reflects a broader trend toward establishing detailed rules for stablecoins and other digital assets in order to maintain market integrity and protect consumers. Crypto banks have to step up their anti-money laundering (AML) controls, know-your-customer (KYC) processes, and transaction monitoring to deal with the increased complexity and risks that come with altcoin trading. Blockchain intelligence tools are becoming essential for compliance teams to detect illicit activities and manage risks effectively. While altcoins offer exciting opportunities, SMEs venturing into this volatile market could face significant risks. Let's break down some of the key risks here: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are notoriously volatile, which can put a strain on SME liquidity and financial stability. Unlike Bitcoin, altcoins can swing wildly, sometimes exceeding 100% changes in a single day. Regulatory Compliance Hurdles: Navigating the complex and fragmented regulations can be tough, especially without specialized legal expertise. The regulatory ambiguity surrounding many altcoins only amplifies this risk. Operational Complexities: Implementing altcoin payment systems requires robust compliance frameworks and a deep understanding of the tax implications, stretching SME resources. Broaden Cryptocurrency Holdings: Introduce both Bitcoin and select altcoins into financial strategies. This can help mitigate volatility risks and attract a larger customer base. Keep an Eye on Market Cycles: Stay informed about crypto market cycles (Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season) to time financial decisions and marketing efforts effectively. Stay Updated on Regulatory Changes: Keep abreast of evolving regulations to ensure compliance and adapt strategies accordingly. Understanding the implications of altcoin dominance, regulatory requirements, and associated risks is crucial for developing a solid strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum has soared to a multi-year high, touching the $4,330 level — its highest price since November 2021. This milestone not only reinforces ETH's dominant position in the crypto market but also marks the return of co-founder Vitalik Buterin to billionaire status, with his publicly known wallets now valued above the billion-dollar mark. Since April, Ethereum has delivered a staggering gain of over 200%, outpacing most major cryptocurrencies and reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. Analysts attribute the rally to strong fundamentals, including increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), the rapid growth of layer-2 scaling solutions, and rising institutional interest. The rally comes amid tightening supply dynamics, with exchange balances dropping to multi-year lows, suggesting that long-term holders and institutional players are accumulating aggressively. Many market watchers believe Ethereum is setting up for further gains, potentially challenging its all-time highs in the months ahead. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, Buterin holds approximately 240,000 ETH, alongside other digital assets such as MOODENG and DINU. At current market prices, his ETH holdings alone are worth around $1 billion, cementing his status as one of the wealthiest figures in crypto — at least on-chain. However, the latest breakout above $4,300 suggests strong underlying momentum. Institutional adoption is playing a crucial role, with public companies like Sharplink Gaming adding Ethereum to their balance sheets as part of their treasury strategy. With on-chain data pointing to robust network activity, the supply-demand dynamics appear favorable for continued gains. As institutions, public companies, and long-term holders continue to accumulate, Ethereum's bullish narrative remains intact — and Buterin's billion-dollar stake is now riding the wave. Ethereum (ETH) has surged to $4,242, marking its highest level since November 2021 and confirming a major breakout on the weekly chart. The breakout is supported by rising volume, signaling robust buying interest. ETH is now trading well above its 50-, 100-, and 200-week moving averages, which are all sloping upward — a classic sign of a strong uptrend. This alignment suggests that the medium- to long-term trend remains firmly bullish. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In February this year hackers targeted Dubai-based exchange Bybit, stealing digital assets worth an estimated $1.5 billion. It became a key reference for affected parties and users, helping reduce the spread of misinformation that could destabilize the crypto market. "They are probably the most knowledgeable people in the world when it comes to cyberattacks," Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, told VnExpress then. "I was surprised and impressed to learn they were from Vietnam." The Bybit case is one of many major blockchain-related attacks Verichains has helped investigate. These incidents often resemble digital crime scenes, with engineers working backward to uncover what happened, much like detectives. Verichains has been involved in investigating many of the world's most high-profile crypto breaches. In most hacking cases, the cause does not stem from core blockchain technology, but from supporting systems, non-decentralized elements such as human error, servers, wallets, and applications on phones or computers. Many crypto startups manage billions of U.S. dollars in assets but are often young companies that have scaled rapidly without the cybersecurity maturity or experience to defend against attacks. They are typically brought in after a breach to audit code, trace stolen assets, identify attack methods, and recommend solutions to prevent future incidents. "When we find a vulnerability, we also check whether any other projects using the same mathematical libraries might be at risk," Thanh says. Thanks to a proven track record, Verichains now works primarily with major crypto exchanges and digital asset investment funds. The first handles smart contract audits, a process that follows defined procedures. The second, more specialized group, deals with complex systems such as crypto exchanges and asset custody platforms. Thanh says the blockchain security industry faces a global talent shortage due to its technical demands. While no official statistics are available, he estimates that blockchain security engineers make up only a small fraction of the global cybersecurity workforce. Market demand is also cyclical, fluctuating with crypto investment trends. When crypto prices rise, more projects are launched and security needs increase. Professionals in this field often earn high incomes, especially when working directly with global financial institutions or major exchanges. "If you can prove your capabilities, clients will come." Nguyen Le Thanh, founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Verichains. At the GM Vietnam blockchain event held on Aug. 1 and 2 in Hanoi, Vu Ngoc Son, head of technology at the National Cybersecurity Association, said crypto exchanges now resemble banks due to the scale of assets they manage, but often operate without the regulatory safeguards of traditional financial institutions. This creates both cybersecurity challenges and opportunities for Vietnamese engineers.Vietnamese professionals are typically patient and detail-oriented, traits essential for analyzing thousands of lines of source code to detect hidden vulnerabilities, Son said. He added that most blockchain flaws are rooted in logic or mathematics, areas where Vietnamese talent tends to excel. "Vietnam has a real opportunity to become a global leader in blockchain security, provided we invest in the right policies and support systems." Vietnam's growing role in blockchain security may soon be reinforced by new national policies. The Digital Technology Industry Law, passed by the National Assembly in June and set to take effect in 2026, includes provisions aimed at developing digital workforce capacity. Under the law, the government will promote education, reskilling and upskilling in digital technologies through scholarships, subsidized student loans and stipends. It also sets out a framework for investing in educational infrastructure, developing online learning platforms and promoting suitable training models to support digital transformation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Crypto Presales - Bitcoin Energy Value Points to $183K — Analysts Highlight Altcoins With 81x Growth Potential The model uses inputs like mining difficulty, energy consumption, and supply inflation to calculate a more intrinsic price for Bitcoin. This gap between energy value and market price is the widest seen since 2020, when BTC sat near $10,000 ahead of its explosive rally. With Bitcoin's hashrate at a record 1.031 ZH/s, analysts say miner confidence remains strong despite recent volatility. In fact, the Hash Ribbons indicator just issued a bullish signal, often used by traders to time long-term entries. For institutions and long-term holders, this reinforces the thesis that Bitcoin remains structurally sound. But it also hints at something else: rising appetite for undervalued plays—especially high-upside altcoins ready to benefit from capital rotation. Meanwhile, institutional investment in Ethereum ETFs is climbing, and U.S. regulations like the Genius Act are adding clarity around stablecoins and digital asset retirement plans.At the same time, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefiting from this shift. Retail traders are showing renewed interest in narratives that combine meme appeal with structured launches. With token unlock calendars tightening and presale bonuses dwindling, demand for early entries is surging. With Bitcoin appearing discounted, top Solana and XRP holders are now joining MAGACOIN FINANCE for early positioning, seeking the next breakout asset ahead of broader market moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE, a low-cap token launched with political and cultural momentum, is drawing strong traction in presale channels. Wallet activity tied to known Solana and XRP whales shows early MAGACOIN allocations, suggesting strategic positioning for possible outsized returns. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its unique blend of community engagement, narrative appeal, and market timing. As traditional memecoins cool and mid-cap alts reach exhaustion, many traders are chasing fresh momentum. Some analysts have already placed MAGACOIN among 2025's best crypto presale plays, citing potential upside with massive ROI under current projections. Its early-stage pricing and strong network excitement make it a rare candidate in an increasingly mature altcoin cycle. With whales repositioning and altcoin season heating up, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the standout contenders for 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fundamental Global, a Nasdaq-listed financial services provider, filed a $5 billion shelf registration statement with the US SEC this week as part of its ongoing effort to scale its Ethereum accumulation strategy. Achieving this goal would make Fundamental Global one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum, in the company of BitMine, which holds $3.5 billion, and SharpLink, which owns $2.2 billion. This structure gives Fundamental Global the flexibility to raise funds over time, allowing the company to move quickly when market conditions are favorable. The remaining capacity could be issued as preferred stock, debt, or other securities. “This $5 billion shelf filing represents a significant step in our capital raising capabilities and positions us to move with speed and scale when capital deployment opportunities arise,” said Kyle Cerminara, CEO and Chairman of Fundamental Global, in a statement. “We believe this framework will enable us to capitalize on ETH accumulation opportunities and support our target of a 10% stake in the Ethereum Network.” According to Maja Vujinovic, head of the company's Digital Assets Division, institutional adoption of digital assets is accelerating, creating a favorable backdrop for Fundamental's capital deployment plans. The strategy is to capture multiple value drivers, including ETH price appreciation, staking rewards, and exposure to tokenized real-world assets built on Ethereum, she noted. Fundamental Global pivoted to Ethereum in late July with a $200 million private placement aimed primarily at purchasing Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset. Fundamental Global (FGF) shares plunged 48% at market close on Friday, per Yahoo Finance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Billionaire Adam Weitsman says he has acquired 5,000 Otherdeed non-fungible tokens from Yuga Labs, creators of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, for an undisclosed sum. “Today is a special day for me,” Weitsman said Monday on X. “I'm making a long-term investment in Otherside and acquiring over 5,000 Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas and Weapon Kodas direct from Yuga Labs to continue building my collection. I have also committed to making a series of acquisitions on the open market this year.” The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Otherdeeds are NFTs representing land deeds in Otherside, a 3D blockchain-based virtual world created by Yuga Labs. These Otherdeeds have a 100,000 supply, with Weitsman's recent purchase representing 5% of the total. But as with most other metaverse and NFT projects, interest in Otherdeed has plummeted following the 2022 cryptocurrency bear market. Weitsman cited this Otherside focus among his motivations for the recent NFT sweep. “I have recently seen Yuga refocus and prioritize Otherside,” he said Monday. “There is a lot riding on this project for the whole space and I will do my best to help make it a success for everyone.” This reputation shines through in the recent Yuga Labs deal. He told Now Media on Monday that his motivations were not financial, noting that as part of the contract, he can't sell the Otherdeed NFTs despite a “multimillion dollar commitment” on his part.

I just feel that this could be the greatest story.” In the future, Weitsman envisions Otherside as a place where children can find solace, get inspiration and learn. “I've got some ideas about kids playing this all over the world,” he told Now Media. He added that he would love to have an adviser for every 30 Otherdeeds that would teach the children to build and trade.
