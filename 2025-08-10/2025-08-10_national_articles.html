                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war in Gaza can “end tomorrow” if ”Hamas lays down its arms and releases all the remaining hostages.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israel's new military offensive in one of Gaza's most populated areas amid growing condemnation at home and abroad, declaring that this is “the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily.” Foreign nations continued airdropping aid in Gaza on Sunday following Israel's announcement of its plan to retake Gaza City in another escalation of the war. Smoke rises following an explosion in the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, Sunday, Aug. 10, 2025. JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.” A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas. The crowded camps — sheltering well over a half-million displaced people, according to the U.N. — had not been part of Israel's announcement Friday. It was not clear why, though Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be “safe zones,” but such designated areas have been bombed in the past. Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.” Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war. Israel wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites in Gaza, he said, but in a later briefing to local media, he asserted: “There is no hunger. Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war. He again blamed many of Gaza's problems on the Hamas militant group, including civilian deaths, destruction and aid shortages. “Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists,” he asserted, adding that Palestinians are “begging” to be freed from them. Hamas responded with a lengthy statement that summed up Netanyahu's remarks as “blatant lies.” It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false. China called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities.” We have frankly run out of words to describe it.” Israel faces growing action even by its closest allies. Netanyahu said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany had “buckled under” the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. Merz, for his part, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany and Israel were talking “very critically” but Berlin's overall policies of friendship haven't changed. At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. All accused Israeli forces of firing at crowds trying to reach food distributions or waiting for convoys. Fifteen people were killed while waiting for trucks near the Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.” Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital. Smoke rises following an explosion in the Gaza Strip, as seen from southern Israel, Sunday, Aug. 10, 2025. In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The AP could not independently confirm who fired. Awda hospital said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire. Six other aid-seekers were killed while trying to reach GHF sites in Khan Younis and Rafah, Nasser hospital said. The GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but operations have been marred by deaths and chaos. Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites. Two Palestinian children died of malnutrition-related causes on Saturday, bringing the toll among children to 100 since the war began. At least 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since June, when the ministry started to count them. Hostages' relatives have urged a labor strike in Israel next week over the plans to expand military operations, fearing it will endanger their loved ones. Dozens of people sat outside the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem to protest Israel's offensive. It's like deciding that we don't want (hostages) alive anymore,” said one, Milly Rothschild.</p>

Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab joins 'Fox & Friends' to examine a new study on the effects of pathogenic gut bacteria and tips for limiting exposure to harmful bacteria. James van der Beek has revealed the first warning sign of his colon cancer — and it's one that did not seem alarming at the time. The "Dawson's Creek" actor, 48, who announced his colorectal cancer diagnosis in November 2024, recently told Healthline that "there wasn't any red flag or something glaring." I was doing the cold plunge," he said. The one symptom that he did experience was a change in bowel movements, which the actor chalked up to an effect of his coffee consumption. "Before my diagnosis, I didn't know much about colorectal cancer," van der Beek said. He ultimately underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed that the actor had stage 3 colon cancer. James van der Beek has revealed the first warning sign of his colon cancer — and it's one that did not seem alarming at the time. Professor Eitan Friedman, M.D., Ph.D., an oncologist and founder of The Suzanne Levy-Gertner Oncogenetics Unit at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, confirmed that changes in bowel habits is the primary red flag that should raise the suspicion of colorectal cancer. Others include fatigue as a result of anemia, blood in stool, weight loss, loss of appetite and abdominal discomfort, Friedman, who has not treated van der Beek, told Fox News Digital. Dr. Erica Barnell, M.D., Ph.D., a physician-scientist at Washington University School of Medicine — and co-founder and chief medical officer at Geneoscopy — noted that van der Beek's experience of having no "glaring" signs is common. "Many colorectal cancers develop silently, without obvious symptoms," Barnell, who also did not treat the actor, told Fox News Digital. The "Dawson's Creek" actor, 48, who announced his colorectal cancer diagnosis in November 2024, recently told Healthline that "there wasn't any red flag or something glaring." Symptoms are "especially worrisome" for those 45 and older who have at least one first-degree relative with colon cancer or other GI malignancies, and those with active inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, added Friedman, who is also an advisory board member at SpotitEarly, a startup that offers an at-home breath test to detect early-stage cancer signals. The overall chance of an average-risk person getting colorectal cancer over a lifetime is 4% to 5%, according to Friedman. Unfortunately, Barnell noted, "screening compliance in the U.S. remains below national targets, and gaps are widest in rural, low-income and minority communities." "Most people don't like talking about bowel habits, but paying attention to changes can save your life," Barnell said. "Screening gives us the chance to find problems early — often before you feel sick — and that can make all the difference." Fox News Digital reached out to van der Beek's representative for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An aerial view of the seaside neighborhood of La Perla, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is seen on Aug. 25, 2017. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A U.S. tourist who was visiting Puerto Rico for Bad Bunny's residency was fatally shot early Sunday at La Perla, a popular seaside shantytown, police said. The victim was identified as Kevin Mares, a 25-year-old who lived in New York, according to a police statement. The shooting happened in the predawn hours at a nightspot called “Shelter for Mistreated Men” in La Perla, a coastal community that has struggled to shed its dark reputation. Arnaldo Ruiz said in a phone interview that the shooting took place when several people near Mares began arguing and one pulled out a gun and shot at least three people, including Mares. Two other men who live in La Perla were injured and remain hospitalized. He was with three other friends who told police they were in Puerto Rico for one of Bad Bunny's 30 concerts, which have attracted tens of thousands of visitors to the U.S. territory. Mares was shot on the left side of his abdomen and was taken to Puerto Rico's largest public hospital, where he died, authorities said. Ruiz said police don't yet know what the people were arguing about and don't have a description of the shooter. Ruiz added that Mares' three friends also were from New York. La Perla is located on the outskirts of a historic district popular with tourists known as Old San Juan. A couple hundred people live in the shantytown, which once served as Puerto Rico's biggest distribution point for heroin and was known for its violence. But violence eased when hundreds of federal agents raided the slum in 2011 and arrested dozens of people, including a well-known community leader who was later convicted. The neighborhood became even safer and more welcoming after Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featured it in their hit, “Despacito.” In February 2023, three tourists were stabbed after police said a person told them to stop filming inside the community. Police said the victims were trying to take pictures of La Perla after being warned not to do so. The island of 3.2 million people has reported 277 killings so far this year, compared with 325 killings in the same period last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gymnastics Championships in New Orleans, Saturday, Aug. 9, 2025. Gymnastics Championships in New Orleans, Saturday, Aug. 9, 2025. Gymnastics Championships in New Orleans, Saturday, Aug. 9, 2025. NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Frederick Richard is taking the fight to make men's gymnastics matter to a new front: his wardrobe. The charismatic 21-year-old Olympic bronze medalist switched out the stirrup pants that have long been a staple of the men's uniform for shorts with compression leggings at the U.S. Championships this weekend, firm in his belief that the three-tenths (0.3) deduction he receives every day of competition that he breaks the rules is worth it if it makes his sport more accessible. Even when those tenths add up. Richard edged Fuzzy Benas by less than a quarter of a point for second place behind two-time national champion Asher Hong. If Richard had worn the traditional uniform, his margin over Benas could have been a little more comfortable. Yet asked if the statement he is trying to make — that it's time for men's gymnastics to modernize its uniforms — is worth the risk to his potential placement during a given meet, he didn't hesitate. While Richard quickly fell in love with gymnastics as a kid growing up in the Boston area, the stirrup pants worn by the guys on pommel horse, still rings, parallel bars, and high bar were another matter. “If I left the gym to go to the gas station, I didn't want anybody to see me in my pommel horse pants,” Richard said. But I didn't want them to search ‘gymnast' and see the uniform. I didn't feel like it was cool.” His solution was to design an alternative. During the opening night of competition on Thursday, the rising Michigan junior wore maize-and-blue colored zebra-patterned leggings with (almost) matching blue shorts. On Saturday, Richard swapped the maize and blue for gray. Both times, there was a “ND -0.3” next to Richard's score on the first event in which the traditional pants were required. Yet Richard wasn't as focused on the ribbon board where his score was posted, but on the young boys in the stands below them. Even if it's a largely American conversation. They're not talking about stirrup pants in China. Places with dominant programs whose stars become champions and national heroes in the process. The number of Division I programs that offer it as a scholarship sport is a fraction of what it was decades ago. And the impact of the recent House settlement could make opportunities at a level that has long served as a feeder system to the U.S. national team even scarcer. Countless young boys dabble in multiple sports growing up, gymnastics included. Richard thinks tweaking the uniform requirements into something he considers more modern could remove what he thinks might be a roadblock to sticking with it for some. “It does add to what makes a 12-year-old boy decide, 'Do I want to keep doing this sport? The rules do allow for a little latitude. Some German female gymnasts opted for full-body unitards at each of the last two Olympics, though the design does not run afoul of FIG regulations. And while he stressed he would never wear his outlawed uniform in a team competition — he wore regulation pants while helping lead Michigan to the NCAA championship this spring — that might not be the case the next time he competes internationally. “We'll see about the world stage,” Richard said. “We'll have to talk and see what they allow, but I want to keep pushing it. He'll have some time to think about it. When the six-man roster for the 2025 World Championships was announced late Saturday night, Richard's name wasn't on it. The decision had nothing to do with Richard's uniform but the uniqueness of this year's world meet, which does not include a team event and is largely designed for event specialists. Yet even he admitted he was at about “80%” at nationals following a whirlwind stretch that included traveling to places like Uganda. Richard is partnering with the African nation to open a facility for boys there interested in acrobatics. So has the criticism he's received back home for his uniform choice, with some telling him if he wants to look like a basketball player, maybe he should go play basketball. While Richard's modified look wouldn't look out of place on the court, pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik — who won a pair of bronze medals in Paris and became a breakout star in the process (all while wearing stirrup pants) last summer — agrees with his Olympic teammate that there “should be a certain level of flexibility” when it comes to uniforms, though he also pointed out that having everyone wear identical outfits is designed to help the judges do their jobs. “But I do like there should be maybe a little bit of wiggle room.” That's all Richard says he is asking for, though it seems highly unlikely the FIG would eliminate the deduction for a uniform violation anytime soon. That is not going to stop Richard from pressing on. “So eventually, if I keep succeeding and winning, and eventually on the international stage do the same thing and keep winning, (the FIG) will see how people like it (and) the younger kids will start wearing it ... and the trend is going to grow.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Taliban are investigating explicit death threats against dozens of Afghan women working for the United Nations, according to a report published Sunday. In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, the U.N. mission to the country said that dozens of female national staff were subjected to explicit death threats in May. The threats come against a backdrop of severe restrictions placed on women since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021. An Interior Ministry investigation is underway, the report added. The Interior Ministry spokesman, Abdul Mateen Qani, said no such threats had been made. “The ministry has an independent department for this, and we have a strategic plan for protection and security so there is no threat to them in any area, nor can anyone threaten them, nor is there any threat to them.” Qani did not answer questions about an investigation. The Taliban barred Afghan women from working at domestic and foreign nongovernmental organizations in December 2022, extending this ban to the U.N. six months later, and then threatening to shut down agencies and groups still employing women. Some women have nonetheless stayed on in key sectors, such as health care and urgent humanitarian assistance, where aid agencies say the needs are great. Humanitarian agencies say the Taliban have hampered or interfered with their operations, allegations denied by authorities. The report also highlighted other areas affecting women's personal freedoms and safety. In Herat, inspectors from the Vice and Virtue Ministry began requiring women to wear a chador, a full-body cloak covering the head. Dozens of women deemed “not in compliance” were barred from entering markets or using public transportation. Several women were detained until relatives brought them a chador, the report said. Women have also been denied access to public areas, in line with laws banning them from such spaces. In Ghor province, police forced several families to leave a recreational area. They warned the families against visiting outdoor picnic sites with women. In Herat, Vice and Virtue inspectors stopped family groups with women and girls from accessing an open recreational area, only allowing all-male groups. In Kandahar, the Public Health Department instructed female health care workers to be accompanied to work by male guardians with an identification card proving that they were related to the woman by blood or marriage. It wasn't immediately clear if the card is specific to Kandahar or will be rolled out across Afghanistan.</p>

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump's Olympic task force, perception of the ‘big, beautiful bill' and more on ‘Special Report.' An educational consultant warned that there will be "no more normal years" as colleges brace for a loss of international students and face financial challenges due to those losses. Prestigious colleges have been offering student prospects on their waitlist a spot among their first-year students a lot later than usual, according to Town & Country. "This is not a typical year," the outlet reported. The magazine explained further that waitlist discussions on college forums "went deep into July." In an effort to attract students who were waitlisted, Rice University has had to compensate students who have already committed to another school and received important materials such as course schedules and freshman dorm assignments. Trump admin has cracked down on foreign student visa holders   (Glenn Stubbe/Star Tribune/Felipe Ramales for Fox News Digital) Rice has been admitting students from its waitlist deep into summer. "The most likely explanation for the waitlist extensions this year is a fear that international students will not be able to start classes in August as a result of a pause that Secretary of State Marco Rubio placed on visa interviews earlier this year, between May 27 and June 18, during their peak season," the outlet reported. "When interviews were resumed, U.S. consulates were told that they must implement new social media vetting protocols within five days. According to NAFSA, a professional organization for people who work in international education, the State Department provided little guidance on how to carry out this new order." International students at consulates in India, China, Nigeria, Japan, and other countries are reportedly backlogged due to a "three-week" pause in interviews. Colleges will lose many of their international student enrollment as India and China make up over half of international students in the U.S. "NAFSA predicts ‘a potential 30–40 percent decline in new international student enrollment,' which could mean 150,000 fewer international students on American campuses," Town & Country reported. Mark Moody, an education consultant who has worked at high schools domestically and internationally for almost three decades, told Town & Country that this "year's issue with international enrollment needs to be understood as compounding, not creating, problems that have been developing for some time." Union College reportedly announced financial cuts and was forced to pull from endowment funds after a decline in international students. The loss of international students has shaken up the college admissions process, causing many universities to extend the waitlist deadline as they struggle to predict which students will enroll. It's become more common for families to make deposits at multiple colleges in the hope of securing better financial aid deals later that summer," the outlet reported. "The international visa problems have made the uncertainty and anxiety among admissions leaders worse, but they were already bad," Town & Country stated. Union College reportedly announced financial cuts and was forced to pull from endowment funds after a decline in international students. Moody told Town & Country that the college admissions landscape will favor students with "higher admit rates and more merit aid, especially if they're from full-pay families." "Outside of the Ivy League and perhaps a dozen other schools with massive endowments, colleges are going to feel great pressure to admit more students who will help them hit their bottom line." Moody worries that more colleges will lean heavily into their early decision process to admit a larger percentage of their freshman class, which "could put students in a tough spot" if they apply regular decision or if they don't approach early decision very carefully and strategically. "There are no more normal years," Mark Moody said to Town & Country. Joshua Q. Nelson is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

New York City Democratic Party mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani gets a big thumbs up from progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts As someone who ran a hard-fought senate race against Elizabeth Warren in 2012, I don't agree with her on many policies, but I have to give her credit for her honesty about political sensation Zohran Mamdani. Other Democrats are offering mealy-mouthed canned responses to questions about Mamdani, including my opponent in the New Hampshire Senate race, U.S. Representative Chris Pappas, D-N.H., who won't take a position on Mamdani's candidacy, and is calling me "pathetic" for raising the issue. The outcome of this fall's mayoral race in New York City has implications poised to resonate far beyond the five boroughs. Less than a year after getting their electoral clocks cleaned by President Donald Trump, the party's national standing has plummeted to a 35-year low. Republican candidates need to do more than sit back and watch the Democrats implode. We must loudly and clearly explain to voters what socialism means. Remind them it's been decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, but a group of extreme and uniformed politicians are trying to bring back some of its core tenets. These should be relics of a failed economic playbook that belongs in the history books, not modern political debates. Capitalism is the greatest force for good this world has ever seen. It has lifted people up from poverty and provided opportunities for those at the bottom. I went from being a kid on welfare to the halls of Congress and then to serving as President Donald Trump's ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa decades later. That upward mobility doesn't exist in Mamdani's socialist worldview. He frames his arguments around free handouts and government-run grocery stores. In his mind, it's better to spread mediocrity widely than strive for excellence through hard work. Believe it or not, it won't be long before presidential candidates are kicking the tires on campaigns for 2028, especially in my home state of New Hampshire, the site of the First in the Nation presidential primary (at least on the Republican side, the Democrats decided to move it back in line to boost former President Joe Biden's electoral prospects). Should he win this November, Mamdani is poised to become one of his party's biggest stars. His fellow socialist, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., is ascendant. Juan Williams, a well-respected Democratic voice even boldly predicted this week: "Say hello in 2028 to President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez." Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaks at the NYCLU's May Day rally for workers' and immigrants' rights at Foley Square, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. The Occupy Wall Street movement that was born in many of America's major cities a decade and a half ago has graduated to an open embrace of socialism. With President Trump atop the ticket, the GOP made steady gains last year among younger and working-class voters. With every Democrat on record opposing tax cuts in the "One Big Beautiful Bill," not to mention provisions like "No Tax On Tips," we have a compelling story to tell about our vision for the future. If we don't, it's more than just politics at stake. Democrats' economic vision is the one outlined by Sen. Warren and Mamdani: more government programs funded by higher taxes. Unlike those two politicians, most aren't willing to admit it, but given the chance, their policies would be ruinous. Republican Scott Brown represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 2010-2013 and served as the United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa from 2017-2020. He is currently running as Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. That's why a few months ago I launched Good News, Vox's weekly newsletter dedicated not to ignoring our often difficult reality, but to placing it in the broader context it deserves. This past Monday, Good News got the Unexplainable treatment, as Vox's excellent science podcast invited me on to discuss why, exactly, we find good news so elusive. It's not just the media's bias — although, as I confessed to Unexplainable's Meradith Hoddinott, that's undeniably a part of it. After nearly 25 years in journalism, I've learned that the press is fundamentally a watchdog, conditioned to bark loudest when things go wrong. But there's also a deeper reason: our own negativity bias. Humans are hardwired to focus on threats, an evolutionary adaptation that once kept us alive on the savannah but now leaves us doomscrolling through headlines. In the Unexplainable episode, Meredith and I explored this psychological quirk, highlighting stories of genuine progress that usually slip under the radar. Like this one: despite fears about rising crime, the murder rate in the US is potentially on track to hit historic lows. And despite the worsening effects of climate change and the proliferation of billion-dollar disasters, fewer people globally died from extreme weather in the first half of 2025 than in any comparable period on record. It fuels the belief that problems, even enormous ones, are solvable, which in turn inspires action. And, as I've discovered writing the Good News newsletter, this optimism can act like armor, helping us face a challenging, sometimes frightening future with greater resilience. It's why Good News felt like a natural outgrowth of our work here at Future Perfect, where above all we want to capture an accurate view of the world as it is — the bad and the good.

To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity: I typically eat vegetarian, and have considered going fully vegan out of concern for animal welfare. But lately my on-again, off-again gastrointestinal problems have been acting up, and I've had to go back on a more restricted diet to manage my symptoms — no spice, no garlic or onions, nothing acidic, and nothing caffeinated. Sticking to a “bland” diet is hard enough, but doing so while vegetarian is very difficult when things like tomatoes and onions and grapefruits are off the table. I know a lot of people with these issues eat fish or meat, and some medical professionals recommend drinking chicken bone broth to soothe flare-ups. Only 5 percent of American adults say they're vegetarian or vegan. What's more, one study found that 84 percent of people who adopt those diets actually go back to eating meat at some point. And most of them aren't even dealing with the gastrointestinal problems you face. So, it speaks to the depth of your moral commitment that you're really wrestling with this. I'll have some concrete suggestions for you in a bit, but first I want to emphasize that how you approach the question of meat-eating will depend on your underlying moral theory. There's a classic split in moral philosophy between deontologists and utilitarians. A deontologist is someone who thinks an action is moral if it's fulfilling a duty — and we have universal duties like, “always treat others as ends in themselves, never as means to an end.” From that perspective, killing an animal for food would be inherently morally wrong, because you're treating the animal as a means to an end. Meanwhile, a utilitarian is someone who thinks that an action is moral if it produces good consequences — and behaving morally means producing the most happiness or well-being possible, or reducing the most suffering possible. Utilitarian philosophers like Peter Singer argue that we should be reducing, and ideally eliminating, the suffering that animals endure at our hands. Deontologists and utilitarians are often pitted against each other, but they actually have one big thing in common: They both believe in a universal moral principle — whether it's “always treat others as ends in themselves” or “always maximize happiness.” A lot of people find that comforting, because it offers certainty about how we should act. But these moral theories assume that all the complexity of human life can be reduced to one tidy formula. Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Human life is so complicated, with many different factors at play in any ethical dilemma, so we should be pluralistic about what makes outcomes valuable instead of acting like the only thing that matters is maximizing a single value (say, happiness). And human society is always evolving, so a moral idea that makes sense in one context may no longer make sense in a different context. To a pragmatist, moral truths are contingent, not universal and unchanging. I think one pragmatist who can really help you out is the University of Michigan's Elizabeth Anderson. In a 2005 essay applying pragmatism to the question of eating meat, the philosopher points out that for most of human history, we couldn't have survived and thrived without killing or exploiting animals for food, transportation, and energy. The social conditions for granting animals moral rights didn't really exist on a mass scale until recently (although certain non-Western societies did ascribe moral worth to some animals). In other words, Anderson doesn't think there's some universal rule like “eating animals is inherently morally wrong.” It's our social and technological circumstances that have made us more able than before to see animals as part of our moral circle. She also doesn't believe there's a single yardstick — like sentience or intelligence — by which we can judge how much of our moral concern an animal deserves. It matters whether we've made them dependent on us by domesticating them, say, or whether they live independently in the wild. It also matters whether they're fundamentally hostile to us. They may be sentient, but, Anderson writes, “We are in a permanent state of war with them, without possibility of negotiating for peace. Anderson's point is not that animals' intelligence and sentience don't matter. It's that lots of other things matter, too, including our own ability to thrive. The key thing to realize is that some types of animal consumption cause a lot less suffering than others. Oh, and chickens have been bred to be so big that they're in constant pain; they live miserable lives from start to finish. A pasture-raised label doesn't mean an animal has been spared all of the harms of modern agriculture — it doesn't guarantee that pain relief is used for painful procedures, and farm animals across different production systems have been bred to maximize production, which can take a toll on their welfare. And of course they'll ultimately meet the same fate as those raised on factory farms — slaughter. But your goal here is to meaningfully reduce, not 100 percent eliminate, the harms. And at least pasture-raised animals have gotten to roam around in a field and engage in natural behaviors up until the end. It's a similar story for fish, by the way. Wild-caught fish is not perfect — slow, suffocating deaths are common — but it's better than farmed. If you see the label “Certified Humane,” that's genuinely higher-welfare — but don't mistake it for “American Humane Certified,” which is really not. And be wary of putting much stock in labels like “cage-free” or “free-range.” They're better than nothing, but because the terms are often ill-defined and unenforced, they're not as meaningful as you might think. Another classic recommendation among animal welfare advocates is to eat bigger animals — in other words, go for beef rather than chicken. So, every year, the average American eats about 23 chickens and just over one-tenth of one cow. That said, cows take a heavier toll on the climate than chickens do, so you don't want to eat tons of beef either. The environment is also one of the key values at stake in our consumption choices, so that has to factor in, too. Of course, another possibility — to the extent that this works with your gastrointestinal issues — is to reach for low-fiber plant-based foods like tofu, seitan, and the smorgasbord of newer products now available (like Beyond and Impossible burgers). But assuming you're going to eat meat, it's a good idea to set some clear parameters and standards around your reducetarian diet. A lot of reducetarians — myself included — have fallen into the trap of saying, “I'll reduce how much meat I eat,” but forgetting to quantify what that means. So it's probably better to commit to something like “weekday vegetarian” or “vegan before six” — you can check out the Reducetarian Foundation for suggestions. That may be the best any of us can really do. Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican lawmakers are zeroing in on two powerful foreign-owned firms they say are quietly shaping how Wall Street votes, and pushing corporate America toward progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals in the process. Their focus is on Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, two foreign-based proxy advisory companies that operate with outsized sway over shareholder decisions. But critics say ISS and Glass Lewis now often set the direction of corporate decision-making. Many investors follow these firms' advice closely, some even automatically, giving them enormous sway over boardroom decisions, especially when it comes to ESG issues. Most people with a 401(k), pension, or retirement plan are invested by asset managers that rely heavily on proxy advisor guidance from groups like ISS or Glass Lewis. If votes prioritize ideology over returns, that could erode retirement savings. “These decisions aren't just symbolic… they can shrink margins, hurt stock prices, and reduce the value of a teacher's pension or construction worker's 401(k),” said one GOP aide. In a letter to both firms in late May, Scott and nine Republican colleagues raised concerns that ISS and Glass Lewis are steering corporate votes based on ideology, not economics. “Two foreign-owned companies hold a near-duopoly over proxy advisor services in the United States — influencing boardroom decisions, shareholder votes, and corporate strategy across the American economy, as well as a wide range of public policy on important issues,” Scott said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “They also routinely issue recommendations based on Left-wing politics over sound economic analysis.” The real-world influence of these firms is well documented. But when ISS opposed it, support dropped to just 68 percent. Similar shifts were seen in votes on stock plans, board seats, and efforts to replace company leadership. 1, which owned just 0.02% of Exxon's shares, launched a campaign to push the oil giant toward more aggressive climate action by replacing three board members. The result: three new directors and a major shift in Exxon's climate strategy. Supporters of ESG and the proxy process argue that these firms play an important role in helping investors manage thousands of shareholder votes each year, offering independent research and recommendations. They also push back on claims of political bias, arguing that ESG investing, focused on long-term risks like climate change, board accountability, and data security, can be aligned with strong financial performance. ISS and Glass Lewis have said their guidance is based on established policies, not ideology, and that investors are free to vote however they choose. Both companies did not respond to requests for comment. But under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC rolled back those reforms in 2022. And a recent court ruling further restricted the agency's oversight, finding that proxy advice doesn't qualify as “solicitation” under federal law, limiting the SEC's authority to regulate it. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rep. Riley Moore (R‑WV), a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said lawmakers must remain aggressive in countering what he calls a “woke” investment agenda being quietly driven by foreign proxy firms. “We need to stay vigilant against ESG, especially as proxy advisors turn more and more decisions over to foreign-owned management,” Moore told the Washington Examiner. He pointed to recent efforts by West Virginia and other states to pull public funds from ESG-focused investment strategies, but warned that “BlackRock and other private equity firms are dead set on keeping ESG, DEI, and other woke investing practices alive.” He called for stronger oversight from both Congress and federal regulators. The case alleges the firms coordinated to suppress coal production by aligning their votes through climate-focused investor alliances, a potential violation of federal competition law. Separately, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is investigating ISS and Glass Lewis for allegedly misleading clients and concealing political motives behind their recommendations. In Congress, the House last year passed the Protecting Americans' Retirement Savings from Politics Act, which would require proxy advice and shareholder proposals to focus on financial outcomes, not ideological agendas. Hill's committee has held multiple hearings on the issue and released a report titled “The Failure of ESG,” calling for major reforms to how proxy firms operate, and aides say more oversight efforts are likely in the months ahead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer superstar Mohamed Salah called out European football's governing body on Saturday for its limited statement after Palestinian footballer Suleiman Al-Obeid was killed in Gaza. Al-Obeid, who during his playing days was part of the Palestinian national team, was killed by an Israeli strike targeting civilians waiting for aid in southern Gaza, according to the Palestine Football Association (PFA). A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times,” wrote UEFA in a post on X. Salah responded to the post on Saturday: “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” His remark quickly gained traction online, with more than 840,000 likes by Saturday night. Later on Saturday, the PFA shared a statement ﻿in Arabic that it said was sent from UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, expressing his condolences for Al-Obeid's death. Al-Obeid showed that “joy, talent, and pride can blossom despite suffering,” said the statement attributed to Ceferin. “His talent and dedication of the game gave the children of Gaza and beyond hope in a brighter tomorrow.” Liverpool and Egypt star Mo Salah calls for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza ‘immediately' He had scored more than 100 goals throughout his long career, it said. According to the PFA, 325 members of its football community have been killed since the war began on October 7, 2023 – including players, managers, referees, coaches and other staff. The United Nations says more than 1,300 people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking food since late May, when a controversial new Israel- and US-backed aid group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, began operating. Of those, more than 800 have been killed near GHF sites, according to the UN. Currently 75% of all United Nations members recognize a sovereign Palestinian state, with more countries - including Britain, France and Canada - recently announcing plans to do the same. As a football team though, Palestine has been recognized by the sport's world governing body FIFA since 1998. They have played in the last three Asian Cup tournaments, but have yet to qualify for the World Cup.</p>
