                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French officials says heatwave in southern Europe complicates efforts to contain biggest wildfire since 1949 Tourist trails have been closed on Mount Vesuvius in southern Italy as firefighters tackle a huge blaze on the volcano's slopes, while officials warned of another “challenging day” for those working to contain France's biggest wildfire since 1949. The wildfire on Mount Vesuvius, close to Naples, broke out a few days ago and by Saturday afternoon had stretched to about 3km (1.9 miles) wide, destroying hundreds of hectares of woodland and killing wild animals. Six Canadair firefighting planes have been dispatched from the state fleet and teams made up of firefighters, soldiers, forestry corps, police and civil protection volunteers from across Italy are working on the ground. Vesuvius national park authorities said the volcano's trail network had been closed for safety reasons and to facilitate firefighting and clean-up operations in the areas affected. The cause of the fire has not been identified although there are strong suspicions that it was arson, with Ranieri suggesting there may be “a criminal hand” behind it. Firefighters in France's southern Aude region, meanwhile, have managed to contain a massive wildfire, which killed one person and injured several others, although authorities warned that work on Sunday would be complicated by intense heat and a hot, dry wind. “It's a challenging day, given that we are likely to be on red alert for heatwave from 6pm, which will not make things any easier,” said Christian Pouget, the prefect of the Aude department. Europe is far from alone in suffering frequent wildfires. Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the US and Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in southern China.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Thompson has accepted Academy Awards, Baftas and even a damehood over a glittering career, but there was one offer she had to turn down. The actor says she once got asked out on a date by Donald Trump on the same day her divorced was confirmed. Thompson said she was in her trailer filming Primary Colors in 1998, a political satire based on Bill Clinton's presidential rise, when the phone rang. “It was Donald Trump,” Thompson told an audience at the Locarno film festival in Switzerland, where she received the Leopard Club award for career achievement. “Then he said: ‘I'd love you to come and stay at one of my beautiful places. At the time, Trump had just split from his second wife, Marla Maples. Thompson, meanwhile, had just finalised her divorce from Kenneth Branagh. “I realised my divorce decree had come through that day,” she said on Saturday. “I bet he's got people looking for a nice divorcee to take out on his arm. “And he found the number in my trailer,” she joked. Thompson, a lifelong Labour supporter who publicly backed Jeremy Corbyn's 2017 and 2019 election campaigns, is a high-profile environmental activist who has campaigned for refugee and women's rights. “I could have changed the course of American history.” The talk at the festival also covered Thompson's film career and one of her most famous roles, in Richard Curtis' Christmas romcom, Love Actually. In the 2003 classic, Thompson plays Karen, whose marriage to Harry, played by Alan Rickman, comes under strain when Harry becomes tempted into an affair with his secretary. Discussing the movie and the moment Karen discovers her partner has been unfaithful, she said she believes its appeal “touched a nerve because [when] we get a heartbreak, especially women, we have to hide it because we don't want people to see it”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time in 19 years, just two of us and our 12-pound Maltese Shih Tzu will be rattling around inside our family home. Empty nesting is a phrase that seems to be laden with heartache and trepidation. With high school graduation approaching last May, we could feel an emotional knife twisting as our social media feeds filled with nostalgic images of the first day of kindergarten alongside the last day of 12th grade. We started becoming hyperaware of the imminent transition, my wife even describing a dagger of pain in the grocery store when she bought a packet of brown paper lunch bags for the last time. It really does feel like only yesterday that our boys arrived together, their births announced to the world on air by my CNN International colleagues. Since then, we have anxiously wondered if the boys will be ready when it's time for them to take off on their own. But then I began wondering if the question should instead be, “Are we ready?” Are we prepared for the transition back from “parents” to “couple”? I often think of an old friend in London who raised five children over about 25 years. When the last one left, she said she turned to her husband and, for the first time in a quarter of a century, asked, “So, how are you?” No longer babies, some teens take to ‘soiling the nest' We're obviously not the first generation to have experienced empty nesting, a concept reportedly coined in 1914 and popularized in the 1970s, but we may be the first generation to have openly talked about it. Former first lady Michelle Obama recently discussed how she was using therapy to transition to a new phase of life after having “launched” her daughters. Ramsay's heartfelt honesty also shatters a myth about empty nesting that it's only moms who are emotional when the children leave. “I thought my husband was just being a heartless bastard,” she recalled of the time her eldest son left home. An understanding of how fathers might be affected in no way minimizes the attachment between mothers and their children, a bond that is (mostly) formed in the womb. “When empty nesters talk about the teenagers,” the comedian Jim Gaffigan quipped, “they always sound like they're describing a hurricane: ‘My wife and I thought we were prepared; we lost everything! Madonna wasn't quite so dramatic when she talked about her daughter Lourdes leaving, but she still compared it to losing an arm. As Dodd wrote in ‘The Empty Nest,' “To me, it was glaringly obvious that parting from a child who has been the centre of your life for twenty-odd years is a really big deal. Yet while new parents are bombarded with advice, empty nest parents are left to muddle through what is arguably the most challenging phase of parenting.” A return to life without children — while still being a parent — requires another massive readjustment of self and your place in the world.” Since my parents' generation, there has been a revolution in family life. Dodd has observed that many modern-day parents are closer to their kids than they once were to their own parents. They're more involved in their lives, and some even want to be friends with them. I'm immensely proud of my sons, and I'm excited for their future, and as hard as it will be to let go, I recognize that it's crucial for all of us to shift the dynamic in our family relationship. On a recent trip home to London, some friends of mine ran through the list of our peers who had recently been separated. It was anecdotal, but the handful of cases seemed alarmingly high. Why can even seemingly rock-solid couples run into problems when it's just the two of them at home? Equally, mine seem to recognize the void their departure will create — our sons have asked more than once if we'll be OK when they're gone. Such a level of emotional maturity signals to me that they'll be just fine on their own. Having thought about this impending transition for many years, I no longer fear it; in fact, I'm learning to embrace it. Intentional date nights are already back on the calendar, and my wife is excited to devote her full time to her art career. My creative space is the yard and garden, so finally the plants will have my full care and attention, and I'm one step closer to keeping the beehives I've been dreaming about. For the coming months, we've bought tickets to ghost tours and shows and even a gig in Canada, which seems very rock ‘n' roll. The oft-quoted translation that the Chinese symbol for crisis means both danger and opportunity may not be totally accurate, but I choose to believe it at this stage of my life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While front-line units stretched thin, politicians dodge responsibility for an increasingly unpopular draft As Ukraine struggles to replenish front-line units after 42 months of all-out war, those in power prefer to avoid publicly commenting on mobilization efforts and the way it is conducted. Political experts say mobilization became a "toxic" and politicized issue, with high-ranking officials — from the president to ministers and lawmakers — trying to avoid being associated with the cause. "In my opinion, most politicians are afraid to raise this topic because it is controversial," political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine is mobilizing about 30,000 people per month, but only a third of them are fit to fight, a senior Ukrainian official told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly said that Ukraine's army is roughly 1 million strong, but Ukrainian military analyst Serhiy Hrabskyi estimated that it needs three times more to be able to rotate battle-torn units out into the rears. Many guys brought into the war often struggle physically and mentally. Ukraine's mobilization efforts come as Russia continues to slowly advance across the front, relying on its vast manpower advantage and what often feels like endless resources, including an upper hand in drone warfare. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi listed mobilization measures as among the key objectives to defend the country against Russia, especially as Moscow accumulates more force. Syrskyi said on Aug. 5 that Russia is mobilizing more troops than it is losing, growing its forces by 9,000 a month despite losing over 33,000 troops in July alone. While Ukraine has not released its casualty rate, military experts say the current mobilization pace is not filling the gaps left behind by battlefield losses — leading to situations where soldiers have to be sometimes deployed a month or two to the "zero" line without the possibility of rotation. Zelensky's last major announcement regarding mobilization was the introduction of the "special contracts" for young draft-exempt Ukrainians, trying to lure them with high financial and social benefits. Mobilization appears to be an uncomfortable topic for Zelensky as well, according to Yuriy Honcharenko, head of the InfoLight.UA research and analytical group. After the program to lure young recruits likely fell short of expectations, it appeared that Zelensky "no longer wants to be directly associated with mobilization," Honcharenko alleges. Zelensky's last publicized meeting with Defense Minister Rustum Umerov that focused on mobilization was in November 2023, during which he instructed Umerov and the then Commander-in-Chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, to present a new mobilization plan. Almost two years since then, the president made only a handful of comments about mobilization. Political analyst Fesenko argued that mobilization is a complicated issue, especially for draft-eligible men and their families, who don't want their relatives to serve in the army. Some politicians, Fesenko said, see them as potential voters, and they try, at least partially, to act in their interests, criticizing forced mobilization methods. Fesenko believes that it won't actually have much of an impact on post-war elections, as new issues will arise by then, and politicians' stance toward mobilization will play a small role. Following amendments to the mobilization law adopted in April 2024, a survey by research agency Info Sapiens showed that 21 percent of Ukrainians perceive mobilization as positive, while 22 percent are neutral, and 44 percent had either an absolutely negative or rather negative view. After the failed summer counteroffensive, it also became clear that it would be a long war, and joining the army wouldn't be a short-term endeavor. What analyst Honcharenko worries about above all is the polarization of society, fueled by the military enlistment officers' attempts to conscript more men. The drafters are often accused of ignoring fundamental civil rights, such as taking away conscripts' cell phones and forcing them into a bus, which led to a recent protest in the central city of Vinnytsia. He stressed that the Defense Ministry should have more autonomy in organizing and coordinating mobilization, and be more open about how it is conducted. Honcharenko also hopes that politicians will take responsibility and improve the draft process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Families of Israeli hostages kept captive in Gaza are calling for a nationwide general strike next Sunday, in protest of the Israeli security cabinet's recent decision to expand the war and take over Gaza City. Organizers said the initiative would start as a grassroots effort primarily through private companies and citizens who will strike on Sunday to halt the economy. Within hours, the October 7 Council said “hundreds” of companies said they would participate in the strike, as well as “thousands of citizens who have declared they will take the day off.” Israel's largest worker union, known as the Histadrut, hasn't yet joined the strike. Anat Angrest, mother of Matan, who is being held hostage in Gaza, appealed to the heads of the economic and labor industries, warning that “your silence is killing our children.” Angrest said, “I know your hearts are with us and in pain – but that is not enough. That is why I am here today to ask for something I have avoided until now – to ask the heads of industry: you have the power.” The Histadrut has already staged a general strike in support of the hostages' families last year. After the killing of six Israeli hostages by Hamas in September 2024, the union disrupted key sectors like transport, banking, healthcare, and joined widespread protests and demonstrations throughout the day. However, the Israeli government blasted their actions as political and moved to halt the strike through a labor court injunction. The Israeli security cabinet decided on Friday to move forward with a controversial plan to expand the war and take over Gaza City. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the escalation in a news conference on Sunday. “Contrary to false claims, this is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily,” he told reporters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed that Kyiv would "have to pay dearly" due to what he  blamed was the West's failure to weaken Russia by using Ukraine, ahead of the scheduled Putin-Trump meeting on Aug. 15. "Everyone already knows that the conflict has serious roots in recent history, that it has no military solution, everyone already knows that Ukraine's membership in NATO is impossible," Fico claimed on social media, as cited by Slovak media Dnes24. Fico used an African proverb of "grass" and "elephants" against Ukraine, saying that: "No matter how the elephants' negotiations on Aug. 15 turn out, the grass will suffer - in this case, Ukraine." Ukraine's Foreign Ministry immediately condemned Fico for being "openly offensive rhetoric against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people," and warned against using "unfriendly folklore allegories." The tensions between Ukraine and Slovakia, a member of the EU, come as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin plan to meet in Alaska for talks on ending the war in Ukraine on Aug. 15. More than three years into the full-scale war, some European countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, have maintained  friendly ties with Moscow despite the criticism from Kyiv and other Western alies.

She was also featured in the Media Development Foundation's “25 under 25: Young and Bold” 2023 list of emerging media makers in Ukraine. The attack marks Kyiv's first confirmed drone strike in Russia's northwestern Komi Republic. Rescue workers are still searching for victims who may be trapped beneath the rubble. The General Staff's statement comes as Russia continues to try advancing deeper into Sumy Oblast more than two months after opening a new front in the northeast. Drones attacked an oil refinery in Saratov on Aug. 10, sparking a large fire and explosions, according to local reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko appear to have renewed their efforts to institute a migrant crisis within the EU with the assistance of Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar, the Telegraph reported on Aug. 9. Ukrainian and European officials rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for Kyiv to cede its eastern territories to Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Aug. 9. President Volodymyr Zelensky in his evening address on Aug. 9 rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for Kyiv to cede Ukrainian territory to end Russia's war, warning that a lack of a "genuine peace" may give Russia the opportunity to reinvade. European leaders reiterated their support for Ukraine's territorial integrity on Aug. 9 after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to the U.S. a ceasefire plan that involves halting hostilities in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern territories to Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Have you noticed fewer rungs on the corporate ladder lately? For the last few years, as companies invest more capital into artificial intelligence, Big Tech has been cutting layers of management in what's become known as the “Great Flattening.” Now, new data from Gusto, which provides payroll and HR solutions, shows small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are following suit and it's reshaping the way teams are structured, developed and led. From 2022 to 2024, the number of individual contributors per people manager at SMBs has doubled. “What seems to be happening is that as folks move on – older folks retire or others shift to new roles – businesses simply aren't backfilling those managerial positions,” he says. “Small businesses don't have a lot of leeway in their budgets, so they're thinking through how best to maximize the productivity of the folks they have on staff. But the consequences of a leaner org chart extend beyond budgets. While some businesses may appreciate the savings and agility that come with fewer layers of hierarchy, Mr. Tremper cautions against seeing it as a purely positive shift. “These middle managers are really important for organizations,” he says. “You have strategic decisions and guidance coming from the highest level of management, but it's individual managers who are turning those directions into actionable steps.” In other words, fewer managers may mean faster decision-making in the short term, but also the risk of teams lacking mentorship, development and day-to-day leadership. “Highly productive sectors tend to maintain more managers with smaller teams,” Mr. Tremper says. Even in lower-productivity industries, measured by total output per hour worked, Gusto found that businesses with a higher share of managers tend to outperform their peers. “Quit rates are often viewed as a sign of labour market confidence,” says Mr. Tremper. Some may even be taking the opportunity to pivot entirely. “For folks who are maybe no longer managers, this could be a chance to ask: What path do I really want? The Great Flattening may seem like a cost-saving trend but it comes with trade-offs. While it can boost short-term agility, businesses that cut too deeply may sacrifice long-term development and stability. Mr. Tremper says business leaders should think carefully about what they're giving up. They created opportunities for me to grow beyond my current skill set,” he says. According to new data from book summary app company Headway, while many workers are enjoying a slow summer season, more than one in 10 say their workload has increased. Experts say rebranding yourself is about more than a job title or what you wear. On a more tactical level, you can also get new headshots, work with a coach and spend time connecting intentionally with your current network and new peers in your industry.

TOKYO, August 10. /TASS/. Over 30,000 residents of the largest Japanese island of Honshu received evacuation alerts due to the threat of landslides that may be caused by heavy rainfalls, Japan's TV broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday.

The country's authorities recommended the evacuation mainly to residents of small settlements in mountainous areas.

Heavy rains also halted high-speed train traffic between the city of Hiroshima on Honshu Island and the city of Fukuoka on the neighboring Island of Kyushu.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ken Paxton has been embroiled in so many scandals that his political enemies say there are too many to choose from. The Texas attorney general, a conservative firebrand, has been hit by allegations of everything from fraud to adultery to corruption in his two-decade-long career. Now he is locked in a bitter fight with Senator John Cornyn to become the state's next Republican senator, in what commentators have called the “nastiest, most aggressive, most personal” primary in living memory. An investigation by federal authorities into securities fraud was quietly dropped without charges being brought last year, and a 2023 impeachment trial in the Texas Senate into alleged corruption ended with him being acquitted. The 73-year-old appears popular among colleagues in Washington, but polling from Texas shows he is badly lagging behind his rival, who has painted him as an establishment, “anti-Maga” politician. Despite taking an early lead in the contest, Washington Republicans are not convinced Mr Paxton can win a general election in Texas, which Democrats are eyeing as a potential gain in next year's mid-terms. Will it be Mr Cornyn, a proven election-winner whose appeal to the Republican base has been thrown into doubt, or Mr Paxton, a Maga hardliner with a list of alleged scandals as long as his arm? He claims Kash Patel, the bureau chief, has agreed to help. The primary contest is still in its early stages, and the Cornyn campaign believes the next few months will be critical in shifting public perception of Mr Paxton from a Republican bruiser to an untrustworthy “conman”, with a secret woke streak. Working on the theory that occasional news reports do not hold much weight for the average voter, Mr Cornyn's campaign strategy is to hammer his opponent over his alleged indiscretions. In a Trump-esque move, the senator's team has labelled Mr Paxton “Crooked Ken”, setting up a website devoted to his chequered personal and political life. “We have not seen an opponent run saturation level state-wide paid media against Paxton that's harsh and negative,” a Cornyn campaign source said. They added: “He's got so many controversies… it's almost too much. We're having to select between lots of different things. You can pursue too many messages – you have to be able to burn a message through so people really hear it and internalise it.” When it comes to mortgage fraud, Crooked Ken Paxton isn't fighting the swamp; he's swimming in it.Learn more at: https://t.co/h46G6B5Na9 pic.twitter.com/8qlR8YvRr7 In 2018, Mr Paxton was alleged to have started an affair with Laura Olson, at that time an aide in the Texas Senate. The story resurfaced in July, in awkward timing for the attorney general, when Mr Paxton's wife of 38 years filed for divorce on “biblical grounds”. Angela Paxton, herself a Texas state senator, said she had decided to end their relationship “in light of recent discoveries”, and state news outlets reported she accused her husband of adultery in a divorce filing. In exchange, Mr Paul allegedly gave Ms Olson a job at his company and paid for renovations to the Paxton home. Mr Paxton was also indicted on fraud charges in 2015 in a long-running legal saga that once looked like it could cut off his rising political star. As a Republican state legislator, he was accused of duping investors to invest in a tech startup without disclosing that he was being compensated to bring them on board. It ended last year without charges being brought, although he agreed to pay $300,000 in restitution. The “Crooked Ken” website claims Mr Paxton, sometimes hailed as the most conservative attorney general in America, is funding “woke with your tax dollars” and hiring lawyers with ties to Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The attorney general has painted his opponent as a member of the Washington establishment, claiming Mr Cornyn is “anti-Maga” and not a true conservative. And he has run adverts claiming Mr Cornyn “turned his back” on Mr Trump, re-airing an old interview in which the senator said he thought Republicans should find an alternative candidate for the 2024 election. For years, John Cornyn has betrayed President Trump and the America First movement. Texas deserves better, and that's why I'm running for U.S. Senate.Join me in the fight: https://t.co/rQl0P2UnWU pic.twitter.com/WP1g8vbXi0 “[Mr Cornyn] just can't beat Ken on ideology, so you've got to try and tear him down. But people just don't care anymore,” a Paxton adviser said. The rivalry between the two men, locked in a bitter and hard-fought fight for political survival, has penetrated deep into their teams. Chris LaCivita, Mr Trump's former co-campaign manager and an experienced Republican strategist, is working for the Cornyn campaign. He appears to have a sincere dislike for Jeff Roe, whose firm, Axiom Strategies, is running the Paxton campaign. It was recently downgraded from a “hold” to “likely Republican” by the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Others believe Mr Trump is planning to stay out of the race altogether. Barring a “Hail Mary” intervention from the president, both camps are in for months' worth of trench warfare before the primary vote in March. If anyone can shake loose Mr Cornyn's grip on a Senate seat he has held for more than 20 years, that candidate is Ken Paxton. And if Mr Paxton's scandals are ever going to catch up with him, it's now.</p>

LONDON, August 10. /TASS/. European leaders have called on US President Donald Trump to hold talks with Russia "only under a ceasefire" and to "protect the vital security interests of Ukraine and Europe", according to a joint declaration by the President of the European Commission and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Finland, and non-EU member United Kingdom. The title of the document specifies that it was adopted ahead of the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests. We agree that these vital interests include the need for robust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity," the statement said, adding, "The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine."

The leaders said "they remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force," and added, "The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations."

The Europeans expressed the view that the current line of contact in Ukraine should serve as the starting point for negotiations on territories. They once again welcomed Trump's diplomatic initiatives but expressed the view that efforts to end the conflict should combine active diplomacy, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia.

They pledged to support the work to end the conflict "diplomatically", as well as by "maintaining significant military and financial support for Ukraine, including within the framework of the ‘Coalition of the Willing,'" and by maintaining and introducing restrictive measures against Russia.</p>

Aug 9 (Reuters) – From firing people to promoting jeans, calling for peace deals or the renaming of a sports team, President Donald Trump keeps a lot on his proverbial to-do list. More than six months into his second term as U.S. commander-in-chief, Trump, a former New York businessman and reality television host, has applied a hands-on management style and producer-like attitude toward governing, relying largely on his own instincts for decisions large and small. Using the tools of social media and a propensity for bullying, Trump personally wades into issues inside and outside the federal government to get his way. Last week he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over unproven allegations she falsified figures that he didn't like. “While he delves into topics that are certainly distractions relative to the big business of leading the world's greatest nation, it can also be said that past presidents have excessively deferred to the bureaucracy and failed to deliver the change their voters expected,” said Carlos Curbelo, a Republican former congressman from Florida. “It's good for decision making and challenging for the constitutional order which made our country the world's greatest economic and military force.” Trump has taken on academia, the legal world, media companies, athletics, the federal bureaucracy and more, all while retooling the world economy with tariffs, cracking down on immigration flows, upending relations with allies and putting his stamp on American culture. Though he has a team of advisers, the president frequently follows his own counsel, making policy decisions and then announcing them himself, ramifications aside. “I think what a lot of people miss about Trump is he's the marketer-in-chief,” said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist with ties to the White House. Critics question why Trump gets bogged down in issues that are secondary to his goals of strengthening the U.S. economy, for example, or achieving a peace deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “He's commenting one moment on … Putin and tariffs and all that's happening in the world and the next moment he's talking about, oh, Sydney Sweeney, and all these other issues that are completely unrelated to being president of the United States,” said Charlie Dent, a Republican former congressman from Pennsylvania. The White House said Trump is using his skills to deliver on policy priorities. “President Trump's leadership style can be summed up plainly as decisive and commanding,” said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. Trump also employs a talent to distract when facing difficulty. “His leadership style is much closer to that of an executive producer, and the executive producer who has a really big picture understanding of the audience,” said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. “I think he trusts his instincts about the audience over anybody else, and that's why you see him oftentimes, you know, managing his own policy portfolio.” The White House said Trump and other donors plan to pay for the $200 million ballroom project, which is slated to be finished before his second term concludes. “I think narcissists do get bogged down in details because they think that everything is a reflection of them,” said Republican strategist Rina Shah.
