French officials says heatwave in southern Europe complicates efforts to contain biggest wildfire since 1949

Tourist trails have been closed on Mount Vesuvius in southern Italy as firefighters tackle a huge blaze on the volcano's slopes, while officials warned of another “challenging day” for those working to contain France's biggest wildfire since 1949.

The wildfire on Mount Vesuvius, close to Naples, broke out a few days ago and by Saturday afternoon had stretched to about 3km (1.9 miles) wide, destroying hundreds of hectares of woodland and killing wild animals. Thick smoke could be seen from Pompeii and Naples.

Six Canadair firefighting planes have been dispatched from the state fleet and teams made up of firefighters, soldiers, forestry corps, police and civil protection volunteers from across Italy are working on the ground.

Drones were being used to monitor the spread of the fire, the national fire service said. The operation has been complicated by the latest heatwave.

Vesuvius national park authorities said the volcano's trail network had been closed for safety reasons and to facilitate firefighting and clean-up operations in the areas affected. Pompeii's archaeological park remains open to the public.

The fire has mainly affected the Terzigno pine forest as well as woodlands close to the small towns of Trecase, Ercolano and Ottaviano at the foot of the volcano.

Francesco Ranieri, the mayor of Terzigno, told Italian media the situation on Saturday night was “very critical” although the efforts of firefighters ensured the flames did not reach any homes.

The cause of the fire has not been identified although there are strong suspicions that it was arson, with Ranieri suggesting there may be “a criminal hand” behind it.

Firefighters in France's southern Aude region, meanwhile, have managed to contain a massive wildfire, which killed one person and injured several others, although authorities warned that work on Sunday would be complicated by intense heat and a hot, dry wind.

“It's a challenging day, given that we are likely to be on red alert for heatwave from 6pm, which will not make things any easier,” said Christian Pouget, the prefect of the Aude department.

Europe is far from alone in suffering frequent wildfires. The weather conditions in which they flourish, marked by heat, drought and strong winds, is increasing in some parts of all continents.

Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the US and Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in southern China.

Climate breakdown has increased the wildfire season by about two weeks on average across the globe.

Actor said Trump phoned her to make the offer on the day her divorce from Kenneth Branagh was confirmed in 1998

Emma Thompson has accepted Academy Awards, Baftas and even a damehood over a glittering career, but there was one offer she had to turn down.

The actor says she once got asked out on a date by Donald Trump on the same day her divorced was confirmed.

Thompson said she was in her trailer filming Primary Colors in 1998, a political satire based on Bill Clinton's presidential rise, when the phone rang.

“It was Donald Trump,” Thompson told an audience at the Locarno film festival in Switzerland, where she received the Leopard Club award for career achievement.

“He said: ‘Hello, this is Donald Trump.' I thought it was a joke and asked: ‘How can I help you?' Maybe he needed directions from someone.

“Then he said: ‘I'd love you to come and stay at one of my beautiful places. Maybe we could have dinner.' I said: ‘Well, that's very sweet. Thank you so much. I'll get back to you.'”

At the time, Trump had just split from his second wife, Marla Maples. Thompson, meanwhile, had just finalised her divorce from Kenneth Branagh.

Only later did she twig the timing. “I realised my divorce decree had come through that day,” she said on Saturday. “I bet he's got people looking for a nice divorcee to take out on his arm.

“And he found the number in my trailer,” she joked. “I mean, that's stalking.”

Thompson, a lifelong Labour supporter who publicly backed Jeremy Corbyn's 2017 and 2019 election campaigns, is a high-profile environmental activist who has campaigned for refugee and women's rights.

She joked she could have altered geopolitics if she'd accepted Trump's offer. “I could have gone on a date with Donald Trump, and then I would have a story to tell,” she said. “I could have changed the course of American history.”

The talk at the festival also covered Thompson's film career and one of her most famous roles, in Richard Curtis' Christmas romcom, Love Actually. In the 2003 classic, Thompson plays Karen, whose marriage to Harry, played by Alan Rickman, comes under strain when Harry becomes tempted into an affair with his secretary.

Reflecting on the film's everlasting popularity, she said: “I mean, it's honestly a constant source of astonishment to me that that film lasted – not that I don't like the film. I like it very much, but it's weird.”

Discussing the movie and the moment Karen discovers her partner has been unfaithful, she said she believes its appeal “touched a nerve because [when] we get a heartbreak, especially women, we have to hide it because we don't want people to see it”.

            This month, our twin boys — our only children — will fly the coop and head off to university. For the first time in 19 years, just two of us and our 12-pound Maltese Shih Tzu will be rattling around inside our family home.
    


            The laughter and music that have echoed off the walls will be gone, and my wife and I will enter a new, uncertain phase of life. We will become empty nesters.
    


            Admittedly, this is a rather stark interpretation of what empty nesting is going to be, but we hope we're well-prepared. We've been discussing our dreams for the future, exploring the restaurants that we never quite had time to frequent, and the pickleball paddles have been ordered. Still, it's been hard to ignore the daunting finality that has been creeping up on us for years. Empty nesting is a phrase that seems to be laden with heartache and trepidation.
    


            With high school graduation approaching last May, we could feel an emotional knife twisting as our social media feeds filled with nostalgic images of the first day of kindergarten alongside the last day of 12th grade. We started becoming hyperaware of the imminent transition, my wife even describing a dagger of pain in the grocery store when she bought a packet of brown paper lunch bags for the last time.
    


            It really does feel like only yesterday that our boys arrived together, their births announced to the world on air by my CNN International colleagues. Since then, we have anxiously wondered if the boys will be ready when it's time for them to take off on their own. But then I began wondering if the question should instead be, “Are we ready?” Are we prepared for the transition back from “parents” to “couple”?
    


            I often think of an old friend in London who raised five children over about 25 years. When the last one left, she said she turned to her husband and, for the first time in a quarter of a century, asked, “So, how are you?”
    


No longer babies, some teens take to ‘soiling the nest'



            We're obviously not the first generation to have experienced empty nesting, a concept reportedly coined in 1914 and popularized in the 1970s, but we may be the first generation to have openly talked about it.
    


            Former first lady Michelle Obama recently discussed how she was using therapy to transition to a new phase of life after having “launched” her daughters. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay admitted that he was so sad when his son went off to university that he went into his son's bedroom and put on a pair of his underwear.
    


            Ramsay's heartfelt honesty also shatters a myth about empty nesting that it's only moms who are emotional when the children leave. The British author Celia Dodd, who recently updated her 2011 book, “The Empty Nest: How to Survive and Stay Close to Your Adult Child,” told me that dads often seem to be coping fine with the transition but might be struggling the most.
    


            “I thought my husband was just being a heartless bastard,” she recalled of the time her eldest son left home. “He was going, ‘It's great, they'll have a great time.' Whereas in fact he was feeling just as sad as I did. I think a lot of men feel there's not space for them to talk about how they feel, because they're supporting their partner and they're supporting the kids.”
    


            An understanding of how fathers might be affected in no way minimizes the attachment between mothers and their children, a bond that is (mostly) formed in the womb.
    


            Other parents have told me to expect a multitude of emotions, but surely the most immediate will be the sense of loss in the weeks after departure. “When empty nesters talk about the teenagers,” the comedian Jim Gaffigan quipped, “they always sound like they're describing a hurricane: ‘My wife and I thought we were prepared; we lost everything!'”
    


            Madonna wasn't quite so dramatic when she talked about her daughter Lourdes leaving, but she still compared it to losing an arm. Once you've come to terms with that, there is often an identity crisis to navigate.
    


Overinvolved in your college kid's life? It's understandable but not helpful, experts say



            As Dodd wrote in ‘The Empty Nest,' “To me, it was glaringly obvious that parting from a child who has been the centre of your life for twenty-odd years is a really big deal. Yet while new parents are bombarded with advice, empty nest parents are left to muddle through what is arguably the most challenging phase of parenting.”
    


            She added, “It is the flipside of the seismic emotional adjustment that new parents go through with the birth of their first baby. A return to life without children — while still being a parent — requires another massive readjustment of self and your place in the world.”
    


            Since my parents' generation, there has been a revolution in family life. Dodd has observed that many modern-day parents are closer to their kids than they once were to their own parents. They're more involved in their lives, and some even want to be friends with them.
    


            I'm immensely proud of my sons, and I'm excited for their future, and as hard as it will be to let go, I recognize that it's crucial for all of us to shift the dynamic in our family relationship. They know that we're always here if they need us, but we don't intend to check in every day to see how they're doing.
    


Is your child headed off to college? Here are 5 tips to manage mental health



            Perhaps the greatest concern is the increasing divorce rate among empty nesters. On a recent trip home to London, some friends of mine ran through the list of our peers who had recently been separated. It was anecdotal, but the handful of cases seemed alarmingly high.
    


            Why can even seemingly rock-solid couples run into problems when it's just the two of them at home? “It's hard to imagine what life will be like when there's just the two of you, and it's natural to wonder what on earth you'll find to talk about,” Dodd wrote.
    


            “One mother sums it up: ‘Suddenly you're on your own and you look at each other and realise you haven't paid much attention to each other for years.”
    


            I want my kids to succeed and find their independence; the ultimate parental dream is to see our children soar. Equally, mine seem to recognize the void their departure will create — our sons have asked more than once if we'll be OK when they're gone. Such a level of emotional maturity signals to me that they'll be just fine on their own.
    


            Having thought about this impending transition for many years, I no longer fear it; in fact, I'm learning to embrace it. Planning and preparation are important, as is the mindset — we shouldn't be “filling a hole” but finding a purpose.
    


Married for 50 years, these psychologists who study love share what they've learned to do — and not to do — to stay happy



            Intentional date nights are already back on the calendar, and my wife is excited to devote her full time to her art career. My creative space is the yard and garden, so finally the plants will have my full care and attention, and I'm one step closer to keeping the beehives I've been dreaming about. For the coming months, we've bought tickets to ghost tours and shows and even a gig in Canada, which seems very rock ‘n' roll.
    


            The oft-quoted translation that the Chinese symbol for crisis means both danger and opportunity may not be totally accurate, but I choose to believe it at this stage of my life.
    


            It's not just our children who are gaining their independence; we're going to rediscover it, too.

While front-line units stretched thin, politicians dodge responsibility for an increasingly unpopular draft

As Ukraine struggles to replenish front-line units after 42 months of all-out war, those in power prefer to avoid publicly commenting on mobilization efforts and the way it is conducted.

Political experts say mobilization became a "toxic" and politicized issue, with high-ranking officials — from the president to ministers and lawmakers — trying to avoid being associated with the cause.

"In my opinion, most politicians are afraid to raise this topic because it is controversial," political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent.

Following the initial spike in the number of volunteers joining the Armed Forces, Kyiv has mostly turned to conscription.

Ukraine is mobilizing about 30,000 people per month, but only a third of them are fit to fight, a senior Ukrainian official told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly said that Ukraine's army is roughly 1 million strong, but Ukrainian military analyst Serhiy Hrabskyi estimated that it needs three times more to be able to rotate battle-torn units out into the rears. Many guys brought into the war often struggle physically and mentally.

"The guys know that their service is until the end of the war, or their life," Dmytro, an infantryman with the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine's mobilization efforts come as Russia continues to slowly advance across the front, relying on its vast manpower advantage and what often feels like endless resources, including an upper hand in drone warfare. The Ukrainian manpower shortage leaves the army prone to leaving weak spots on the front for the Russian troops to exploit.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi listed mobilization measures as among the key objectives to defend the country against Russia, especially as Moscow accumulates more force.

Syrskyi said on Aug. 5 that Russia is mobilizing more troops than it is losing, growing its forces by 9,000 a month despite losing over 33,000 troops in July alone. While Ukraine has not released its casualty rate, military experts say the current mobilization pace is not filling the gaps left behind by battlefield losses — leading to situations where soldiers have to be sometimes deployed a month or two to the "zero" line without the possibility of rotation.

The West has pushed Kyiv to boost mobilization efforts to better hold off Russia's ongoing offensive, with some allies, according to Zelensky, refraining from imposing new sanctions on Russia partly because Kyiv is refusing to lower the mobilization age from 25  to 18.

Ukraine has so far kept the mobilization age from 25 to 60, after lowering it from 27 in 2024.

Of the roughly 30,000 that Kyiv says it is mobilizing, about half of them are the soldiers who are returning from AWOL, or absent without leave, according to a Ukrainian official familiar with the matter.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the topic's sensitivity, said that the remaining 40 percent are from the enlistment offices, while the remaining 10 percent came from foreign volunteer recruitment and the new one-year voluntary military contract for 18-24-year-olds.

Zelensky's last major announcement regarding mobilization was the introduction of the "special contracts" for young draft-exempt Ukrainians, trying to lure them with high financial and social benefits. Zelensky expanded the contract program for 18-24-year-olds in July, adding the option for them to join drone units.

Mobilization appears to be an uncomfortable topic for Zelensky as well, according to Yuriy Honcharenko, head of the InfoLight.UA research and analytical group.

"Unpopular decisions that need to be made in order to fix the situation may lead to a drop in the popularity of those who will make them, perhaps even the loss of some kind of future political prospects," Honcharenko told the Kyiv Independent.

After the program to lure young recruits likely fell short of expectations, it appeared that Zelensky "no longer wants to be directly associated with mobilization," Honcharenko alleges.

Zelensky's last publicized meeting with Defense Minister Rustum Umerov that focused on mobilization was in November 2023, during which he instructed Umerov and the then Commander-in-Chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, to present a new mobilization plan.

Almost two years since then, the president made only a handful of comments about mobilization.

Political analyst Fesenko argued that mobilization is a complicated issue, especially for draft-eligible men and their families, who don't want their relatives to serve in the army. Some politicians, Fesenko said, see them as potential voters, and they try, at least partially, to act in their interests, criticizing forced mobilization methods.

Fesenko believes that it won't actually have much of an impact on post-war elections, as new issues will arise by then, and politicians' stance toward mobilization will play a small role.

Following amendments to the mobilization law adopted in April 2024, a survey by research agency Info Sapiens showed that 21 percent of Ukrainians perceive mobilization as positive, while 22 percent are neutral, and 44 percent had either an absolutely negative or rather negative view.


"Let's first preserve our statehood, and then we will worry who will become the president and who will head the next parliament."
    

Ruslan Gorbenko, a lawmaker from the ruling Servant of the People, admitted that "a certain percentage of politicians" are working in their interests to be elected in the upcoming elections, rather than in the country's interests.

Gorbenko added that others are trying to avoid the topic, worried that drastic measures such as reforming the draft office or lowering the draft age would hurt them in the long run.

Political and military experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that mobilization has been "politicized" since 2023, when the number of volunteers decreased while the need for new soldiers had increased. After the failed summer counteroffensive, it also became clear that it would be a long war, and joining the army wouldn't be a short-term endeavor.

The experts agreed that the topic's sensitivity has slowed down the crucial decision-making process regarding mobilization.

What analyst Honcharenko worries about above all is the polarization of society, fueled by the military enlistment officers' attempts to conscript more men. The drafters are often accused of ignoring fundamental civil rights, such as taking away conscripts' cell phones and forcing them into a bus, which led to a recent protest in the central city of Vinnytsia. The police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and to prevent the protesters from getting into a detention facility.

Honcharenko believes that the tensions would rise as the situation on the front becomes tougher and mobilization remains a "politicized" topic. He stressed that the Defense Ministry should have more autonomy in organizing and coordinating mobilization, and be more open about how it is conducted.

Honcharenko also hopes that politicians will take responsibility and improve the draft process.

"Let's first preserve our statehood, and then we will worry who will become the president and who will head the next parliament," Honcharenko said.

            Families of Israeli hostages kept captive in Gaza are calling for a nationwide general strike next Sunday, in protest of the Israeli security cabinet's recent decision to expand the war and take over Gaza City.
    


            “We are shutting down the country to save the soldiers and the hostages,” said the relatives of the hostages in Tel Aviv. They were joined by the October 7 Council, which represents bereaved families of soldiers who fell at the start of the war.
    


            Organizers said the initiative would start as a grassroots effort primarily through private companies and citizens who will strike on Sunday to halt the economy.
    


            Within hours, the October 7 Council said “hundreds” of companies said they would participate in the strike, as well as “thousands of citizens who have declared they will take the day off.”
    


            Israel's largest worker union, known as the Histadrut, hasn't yet joined the strike.  The families are expected to meet with Histadrut Chairman Arnon Bar-David on Monday in a bid to convince him to join forces.
    


            Anat Angrest, mother of Matan, who is being held hostage in Gaza, appealed to the heads of the economic and labor industries, warning that “your silence is killing our children.”
    


            Angrest said, “I know your hearts are with us and in pain – but that is not enough. Silence kills. That is why I am here today to ask for something I have avoided until now – to ask the heads of industry: you have the power.”
    


            The Histadrut has already staged a general strike in support of the hostages' families last year. After the killing of six Israeli hostages by Hamas in September 2024, the union disrupted key sectors like transport, banking, healthcare, and joined widespread protests and demonstrations throughout the day. However, the Israeli government blasted their actions as political and moved to halt the strike through a labor court injunction.
    


            While the Histadrut has not commented publicly about the strike, Israeli opposition leaders have endorsed and embraced the initiative. Leader of the opposition Yair Lapid said, “The call by the families of the hostages for a general strike is justified and appropriate.”
    


            The chairman of the Democrats party, Yair Golan, announced the party would join the strike and called “on all Israeli citizens – anyone who holds the values of life and mutual responsibility dear – to strike with us, to take to the streets, to resist and disrupt.”
    


            The Israeli security cabinet decided on Friday to move forward with a controversial plan to expand the war and take over Gaza City. The plan has provoked harsh criticism from the families of the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are presumed to be alive, warning that the new military move could endanger the living hostages and sentence them to death.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the escalation in a news conference on Sunday. “Contrary to false claims, this is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily,” he told reporters.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed that Kyiv would "have to pay dearly" due to what he  blamed was the West's failure to weaken Russia by using Ukraine, ahead of the scheduled Putin-Trump meeting on Aug. 15.

"Everyone already knows that the conflict has serious roots in recent history, that it has no military solution, everyone already knows that Ukraine's membership in NATO is impossible," Fico claimed on social media, as cited by Slovak media Dnes24. 

Fico used an African proverb of "grass" and "elephants" against Ukraine, saying that: "No matter how the elephants' negotiations on Aug. 15 turn out, the grass will suffer - in this case, Ukraine." 

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry immediately condemned Fico for being "openly offensive rhetoric against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people," and warned against using "unfriendly folklore allegories."

"This is frivolity that insults the memory of the dead, the suffering of millions of Ukrainian families, and the sacrifice of those fighting for freedom," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement published on its website on Aug. 10. 

The tensions between Ukraine and Slovakia, a member of the EU, come as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin plan to meet in Alaska for talks on ending the war in Ukraine on Aug. 15. 

CNN earlier reported that Ukraine's participation following the Putin-Trump meeting is not ruled out, but it is so far not named as among the participants of the Alaska summit. 

More than three years into the full-scale war, some European countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, have maintained  friendly ties with Moscow despite the criticism from Kyiv and other Western alies. 

Fico visited Moscow in December 2024 and has been fostering closer ties with Moscow.

A woman died and a man was trapped inside a vehicle after strong winds toppled a large tree and crushed car

Strong storms in eastern Nebraska early Saturday killed one person, seriously injured another in a state park and displaced hundreds of inmates after two prison housing units were damaged, officials said – as other midwest US states also braced for bad weather.

Meanwhile, more than 40 million Americans have been put on alert for dangerous heat and fire weather. In terms of fire weather, a blaze which prompted mandatory evacuations in two Colorado counties was of particular note.

With respect to the Nebraska storms, the Waterloo volunteer fire department was called to Two Rivers state park just before 7am Saturday, where first responders found a vehicle crushed by a large cottonwood tree. The tree had toppled as the storm brought gusts higher than 80mph (129 kph) to the area, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). A woman in the vehicle was declared dead at the scene, while a man was trapped inside, the fire department said in a news release.

It took firefighters about 90 minutes to free the man because of the size and weight of the tree, the department said. Once free, the man was taken to an Omaha hospital with life-threatening injuries, Waterloo fire chief Travis Harlow said.

The state park – a popular camping spot – is about 5 miles (8km) west of Omaha's western border.

High winds caused widespread damage across eastern Nebraska, toppling trees, damaging roofs and pulling down electrical lines. Thousands of people were left without power in the immediate aftermath.

In the state capital of Lincoln, the storms damaged two housing units at the Nebraska state penitentiary, displacing 387 prisoners, the state department of correctional services said in a statement.

“There are no reported injuries, and all staff and incarcerated individuals are safe and accounted for,” the agency said.

Strong storms also moved through parts of eastern Wisconsin on Saturday, bringing gusts of 60mph (97 kph) to the state's Door Peninsula, the National Weather Service said. Flood warnings were put in effect in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. And flash flooding forced the closure of parts of interstates 43, 41 and 94, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The outlet added that all runways except one at Milwaukee's Mitchell international airport were reported flooded at one point, along with most taxiways and an underpass tunnel.

The weather service said more strong storms were possible across the nation's midsection Saturday night into Sunday, stretching from western Colorado into Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, northern Missouri and into Illinois and Wisconsin.

Meanwhile, grappling with extreme heat advisories was a region including Albuquerque, New Mexico; El Paso and Dallas, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Wichita, Kansas; Springfield, Missouri; and Kansas City, Missouri, as ABC News reported. And the network noted that places in Oregon, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming were put on alert for fire conditions.

Notably, after the Lee wildfire in Colorado grew by nearly 30,000 acres, officials in Rio Blanco and Garfield counties ordered mandatory evacuations as flames raced south, according to the Denver Post.

The earth's ongoing climate crisis – fueled by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions – has been making extreme weather events more common, including strong storms, floods and wildfires.

Have you noticed fewer rungs on the corporate ladder lately? 

For the last few years, as companies invest more capital into artificial intelligence, Big Tech has been cutting layers of management in what's become known as the “Great Flattening.” Now, new data from Gusto, which provides payroll and HR solutions, shows small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are following suit and it's reshaping the way teams are structured, developed and led.

From 2022 to 2024, the number of individual contributors per people manager at SMBs has doubled. Back in 2019, managers typically oversaw about three direct reports. Now, that number is about six. 

Nich Tremper, senior economist at Gusto, says this isn't simply a result of sweeping layoffs, but rather a quiet evolution. 

“What seems to be happening is that as folks move on – older folks retire or others shift to new roles – businesses simply aren't backfilling those managerial positions,” he says.

The change is largely driven by cost pressures. “We've seen the average labour cost increase nearly 20 per cent over the last couple of years,” Mr. Tremper says. “Small businesses don't have a lot of leeway in their budgets, so they're thinking through how best to maximize the productivity of the folks they have on staff. Part of that has come down to reducing management layers.”

But the consequences of a leaner org chart extend beyond budgets.

What we lose when we flatten

While some businesses may appreciate the savings and agility that come with fewer layers of hierarchy, Mr. Tremper cautions against seeing it as a purely positive shift.

“These middle managers are really important for organizations,” he says. “You have strategic decisions and guidance coming from the highest level of management, but it's individual managers who are turning those directions into actionable steps.”

In other words, fewer managers may mean faster decision-making in the short term, but also the risk of teams lacking mentorship, development and day-to-day leadership.

“Highly productive sectors tend to maintain more managers with smaller teams,” Mr. Tremper says. “It suggests that first-line managers play a critical role in scaling their expertise, developing their teams and ultimately boosting productivity.”

Even in lower-productivity industries, measured by total output per hour worked, Gusto found that businesses with a higher share of managers tend to outperform their peers.

Managers are opting out, too

Not only are businesses hiring fewer managers but existing ones are leaving.

In late 2024, Gusto found that the quit rate among managers was about 10 per cent higher than it was in January 2022, when it was more of an employee-driven labour market. 

“Quit rates are often viewed as a sign of labour market confidence,” says Mr. Tremper. “If managers are leaving, it could mean they believe they can find more meaningful work elsewhere. They might be looking to lead teams at other companies or return to being high-performing individual contributors.”

Some may even be taking the opportunity to pivot entirely. “For folks who are maybe no longer managers, this could be a chance to ask: What path do I really want? Do I want to be an individual expert? Or maybe this is the time to start my own business or consulting practice.”

Flattening with intention 

The Great Flattening may seem like a cost-saving trend but it comes with trade-offs. While it can boost short-term agility, businesses that cut too deeply may sacrifice long-term development and stability.

Mr. Tremper says business leaders should think carefully about what they're giving up. “When I think of the most effective managers I've had, they've cared deeply about my professional development. They created opportunities for me to grow beyond my current skill set,” he says.

Small businesses especially, he adds, rely on strong teams and strong teams often rely on great managers.

11 per cent

According to new data from book summary app company Headway, while many workers are enjoying a slow summer season, more than one in 10 say their workload has increased.

Experts say rebranding yourself is about more than a job title or what you wear. It's important to be authentic about how you're changing personally and professionally and share that story over time. On a more tactical level, you can also get new headshots, work with a coach and spend time connecting intentionally with your current network and new peers in your industry.

“Being punctual is a form of non-verbal communication. By showing up on time, you're non-verbally telling that person you care enough about their time and the task at hand. It's a representation of your work ethic and competency,” says etiquette trainer Mariah Grumet Humbert.

This article looks at how punctuality norms have evolved over time and how being chronically late can impact your personal brand at work and in life.

A first-ever trilateral meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska could still be on the table, CNN reported on Aug. 10, citing its sources familiar with the matter. 

The report comes after Trump said that he would meet Putin on Aug. 15 in Alaska for talks on ending the war in Ukraine. 

CNN reported that while Zelensky was not named among the participants of the Alaska summit, the Trump administration has not ruled out some meetings involving Zelensky, according to its sources. 

One White House official told CNN that anything with Zelensky's involvement would likely be scheduled after Trump's meeting with Putin. 

Zelensky confirmed on Aug. 7 that the discussions were ongoing on a bilateral and trilateral summit, including the three leaders, to end the war. Moscow has confirmed the plans for a meeting between Putin and Trump in the near future, but has not mentioned Zelensky's involvement. 

A source in Ukraine's President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Trump and Putin planned to discuss a peace plan, in which Ukraine would have to withdraw further from two territories partly occupied by Russian troops. 

The source, who was part of the team briefed on the discussion Putin had with Witkoff, said that the plan would see Kyiv withdraw its troops from two of the partly occupied Ukrainian regions — Donetsk and Luhansk. 

The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic, said Ukraine would outright reject the plan. 

The Putin-Trump meeting is planned a week after Trump's ultimatum on Moscow expired, in which he threatened sweeping secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia if no ceasefire is agreed by then.

TOKYO, August 10. /TASS/. Over 30,000 residents of the largest Japanese island of Honshu received evacuation alerts due to the threat of landslides that may be caused by heavy rainfalls, Japan's TV broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday.

The country's authorities recommended the evacuation mainly to residents of small settlements in mountainous areas.

Heavy rains also halted high-speed train traffic between the city of Hiroshima on Honshu Island and the city of Fukuoka on the neighboring Island of Kyushu.

Ken Paxton has been embroiled in so many scandals that his political enemies say there are too many to choose from.

The Texas attorney general, a conservative firebrand, has been hit by allegations of everything from fraud to adultery to corruption in his two-decade-long career.

Now he is locked in a bitter fight with Senator John Cornyn to become the state's next Republican senator, in what commentators have called the “nastiest, most aggressive, most personal” primary in living memory.

“It's just ridiculous, unethical behaviour. There's almost nothing similar to it, certainly in the modern Texas political era,” a state Republican source told The Telegraph.

Incredibly, none of the drama has blunted Mr Paxton's political rise over the years.

An investigation by federal authorities into securities fraud was quietly dropped without charges being brought last year, and a 2023 impeachment trial in the Texas Senate into alleged corruption ended with him being acquitted.

Mr Cornyn, the incumbent Republican senator of more than 20 years, is in the fight of his life with the primary challenge from the attorney general.

The 73-year-old appears popular among colleagues in Washington, but polling from Texas shows he is badly lagging behind his rival, who has painted him as an establishment, “anti-Maga” politician.

Despite taking an early lead in the contest, Washington Republicans are not convinced Mr Paxton can win a general election in Texas, which Democrats are eyeing as a potential gain in next year's mid-terms.

The stand-off between the two Republicans also poses a serious headache for Donald Trump, who will be eyeing his party's narrow Senate majority and considering whether to endorse one of the candidates.

But if so, which one? Will it be Mr Cornyn, a proven election-winner whose appeal to the Republican base has been thrown into doubt, or Mr Paxton, a Maga hardliner with a list of alleged scandals as long as his arm?

Both have been vocal in their support for Mr Trump's push to redraw Texas' congressional districts to keep Republicans in control of the House of Representatives in next year's mid-terms.

After Democrat politicians fled the state to block a vote on the proposal, Mr Paxton took a hard line, vowing they would be “swiftly arrested, punished, and face the full force of the law”.

Not to be outdone, Mr Cornyn asked the FBI to locate and return the Democrats, accusing them of “potential criminal acts in their rush to avoid their constitutional responsibilities”. He claims Kash Patel, the bureau chief, has agreed to help.

The primary contest is still in its early stages, and the Cornyn campaign believes the next few months will be critical in shifting public perception of Mr Paxton from a Republican bruiser to an untrustworthy “conman”, with a secret woke streak.

Texas Southern University gave the attorney general a nine-point lead in the state in May, while the RealClearPolitics polling average from the same month put this at almost 15 per cent.

But Mr Cornyn's campaign believes Mr Paxton's controversies have not cut through with the general public.

Working on the theory that occasional news reports do not hold much weight for the average voter, Mr Cornyn's campaign strategy is to hammer his opponent over his alleged indiscretions.

Insiders think that Mr Paxton will crumble under the pressure of the electorate being confronted with a comprehensive list of decades of alleged wrongdoings.

In a Trump-esque move, the senator's team has labelled Mr Paxton “Crooked Ken”, setting up a website devoted to his chequered personal and political life.

“We have not seen an opponent run saturation level state-wide paid media against Paxton that's harsh and negative,” a Cornyn campaign source said. “There's a presumption that because a lot of stuff's been in the news, a lot of people know a decent amount about him. But that's simply not the case.”

They added: “He's got so many controversies… it's almost too much. We're having to select between lots of different things. You can pursue too many messages – you have to be able to burn a message through so people really hear it and internalise it.”

In 2018, Mr Paxton was alleged to have started an affair with Laura Olson, at that time an aide in the Texas Senate.

The story resurfaced in July, in awkward timing for the attorney general, when Mr Paxton's wife of 38 years filed for divorce on “biblical grounds”.

Angela Paxton, herself a Texas state senator, said she had decided to end their relationship “in light of recent discoveries”, and state news outlets reported she accused her husband of adultery in a divorce filing.

Mr Paxton characterised the split as a mutual decision prompted by “the pressures of countless political attacks and public scrutiny”.

The alleged affair was a central part of the three-term attorney general's impeachment trial in the Texas Senate in 2023. Mrs Paxton was disqualified from voting in her husband's trial but was watching on from the gallery.

Mr Paxton was also accused of exploiting his office to harass rivals of a real estate developer called Nate Paul.

In exchange, Mr Paul allegedly gave Ms Olson a job at his company and paid for renovations to the Paxton home.

The attorney general, who consistently denied wrongdoing, was later acquitted of 16 counts of impeachment.

Mr Paxton was also indicted on fraud charges in 2015 in a long-running legal saga that once looked like it could cut off his rising political star.

As a Republican state legislator, he was accused of duping investors to invest in a tech startup without disclosing that he was being compensated to bring them on board. It ended last year without charges being brought, although he agreed to pay $300,000 in restitution.

The “Crooked Ken” website claims Mr Paxton, sometimes hailed as the most conservative attorney general in America, is funding “woke with your tax dollars” and hiring lawyers with ties to Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.

The Paxton team, sitting on a comfortable lead in the contest, believes their candidate has the same “teflon” quality as the president, who has had his fair share of controversies.

The attorney general has painted his opponent as a member of the Washington establishment, claiming Mr Cornyn is “anti-Maga” and not a true conservative.

And he has run adverts claiming Mr Cornyn “turned his back” on Mr Trump, re-airing an old interview in which the senator said he thought Republicans should find an alternative candidate for the 2024 election.

For years, John Cornyn has betrayed President Trump and the America First movement. Texas deserves better, and that's why I'm running for U.S. Senate.Join me in the fight: https://t.co/rQl0P2UnWU pic.twitter.com/WP1g8vbXi0

The result is what Matt Mackowiak, a veteran Texas political operative, said earlier this year would be the “most expensive, nastiest, most aggressive, most personal US Senate primary” in the state's history.

“[Mr Cornyn] just can't beat Ken on ideology, so you've got to try and tear him down. But people just don't care anymore,” a Paxton adviser said.

The rivalry between the two men, locked in a bitter and hard-fought fight for political survival, has penetrated deep into their teams.

Chris LaCivita, Mr Trump's former co-campaign manager and an experienced Republican strategist, is working for the Cornyn campaign.

He appears to have a sincere dislike for Jeff Roe, whose firm, Axiom Strategies, is running the Paxton campaign.

Their rumoured bad blood could date back to the pair being pitted against each other in the battle for the presidential nomination last year.

As the candidates fling out attacks, they may also be damaging their party's hold on the Lone Star State's Senate seat. It was recently downgraded from a “hold” to “likely Republican” by the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

The Republican establishment has sided with Mr Cornyn, and the party's leader in the Senate, John Thune, has personally appealed to Mr Trump to intervene in the contest.

Some fear the fight could syphon funds from election battlegrounds and cost the party as much as $100m, according to CNN.

Mr Paxton is seen as the more polarising figure who would have a tougher time fending off a Democrat challenger, even though supporters point out he has never lost a state-wide race.

But Mr Cornyn has admitted he needs to start closing the gap in the polls before he has a chance of securing the president's support.

“Trump's endorsement is the most powerful endorsement in the modern history of the Republican party,” the campaign source continued. “We've just never seen anything like it.”

Others believe Mr Trump is planning to stay out of the race altogether.

Barring a “Hail Mary” intervention from the president, both camps are in for months' worth of trench warfare before the primary vote in March.

If anyone can shake loose Mr Cornyn's grip on a Senate seat he has held for more than 20 years, that candidate is Ken Paxton. And if Mr Paxton's scandals are ever going to catch up with him, it's now.

Israeli PM's plan to escalate war has drawn international condemnation

See all our Middle East crisis coverage

Family of victims accuse government of rewarding Hamas with plan to recognise a Palestinian state

Ayelet Svatitzky, whose brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell were murdered, told demonstrators at the march in London that recognising the state of Palestine before the return of all of the hostages is a “prize” to Hamas.

Speaking close to Downing Street, she said: “This week I joined a meeting with the UK government to continue to press our case that the hostages must be freed before the UK government can recognise the state of Palestine.

“As I said to the government, to recognise the state without the return of all of the hostages is a prize to Hamas for the murder of my two brothers.”

The UN security council meeting on Gaza is still going on and there is a video feed at the top of this blog.

Associated Press reports that the US defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.
 The US has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.
 Other council members, and UN officials, expressed alarm. China called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities”.
 “This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,” said Ramesh Rajasingham with the UN humanitarian office told the AP. “Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.”

The UK's Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis has addressed the London march calling for the hostages' release and has attacked an announcement by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, that the country was set to recognise Palestine as a state next month.

Addressing the crowd close to Starmer's London residence in Downing Street, Mirvis said:

To our government we turn and we say ‘how would you ever be able to live with the fact that you would have recognised a Palestinian state, at the head of which is a terrorist organisation, with a stated intention of destroying the state of Israel and harming Jews right around the world and all this at a time when the hostages are still languishing in the tunnels of Gaza?

The Labour party, both in opposition and now in government has had a mantra, they have continuously been saying ‘don't judge us by our words, judge us by our deeds'.

And to our government we say right now this is the time for responsible action, it is not too late.”

He added: “We will continue to do whatever we can for the sake of each and every one of the hostages.”

A man has been arrested at the “national march for the hostages” in central London, the Metropolitan police have said.

The force said the individual, who was not part of the march, was held for common assault and a racially aggravated public order offence after the march briefly paused just past Charing Cross.

The march was ending with an assembly in Whitehall.

In the UK, a man has been carried away by police officers after a scuffle broke out close to the gates of Downing Street, the prime minister's London residence.

The man was seen throwing water over a demonstrator who was part of a protest calling for the release of the hostages (see post at 12.43BST). He then charged at him and a scuffle broke out as the man then put his hand around the demonstrator's neck.

Police officers then intervened and the man was seen being carried away.

Meanwhile, in Greece, pro-Palestinian protestors are braced to take to the streets in more than 100 locations nationwide, triggering a rare warning from the Israeli foreign ministry to tourists visiting the country.

Stop the war campaigners say the ‘day of rage' rallies have been organised in major urban centres, towns, villages and islands with the sole purpose of calling for an end “to the genocide in Gaza” and Benjamin Netanyahu's latest takeover plans.

Graffiti deploring Israel and its actions have proliferated in areas popular with tourists, starting with Plaka, the ancient Athenian neighbourhood of narrow alleys beneath the Acropolis.

“Wherever we are, in every village, every square, every island, every alley, on every street in every town and on every mountain we will call for justice for Palestine,” said a statement released by protest organisers ahead of this evening's demonstrations.

“We will not put up with those in our country and on our islands who support genocide, we will not tolerate genocide in our name. The whole world will learn that the Greek government is alone,” it added, castigating the centre- right administration of Kyriakos Mitsotakis for standing by the “murderous” Netanyahu.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry warned Israelis to “stay away from areas of demonstrations, avoid public debates and expressing political positions in public spaces, and minimize visible signs of identification (such as [Israeli] flags, shirts with Hebrew writing, IDF symbols.”

Fury over the war in Gaza has mounted in Greece putting diplomatic ties between the two countries under unexpected strain.

Last week, the Israeli ambassador to Greece Noam Katz lashed out at the mayor of Athens, Haris Doukas, for failing to clean up anti-Israel graffiti that was, he said “(making) Israeli tourists feel uncomfortable.”

Infuriated by his remarks, Doukas hit back saying:

We Greeks do not take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians and children standing in line for food, from those responsible for the daily deaths of dozens of Gazans from bombs, hunger and thirst.

James Kariuki, the UK's deputy permanent representative to the UN, called Israel's decision to take Gaza City over “wrong” and said it would displace nearly one million (more) Palestinians.

“Expanding military operations will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict. It will not secure the release of the hostages. It will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” Kariuki was quoted by Al Jazeera as having said.

“This inhumanity cannot be justified”, he said, referring to the continuing restrictions on aid imposed by Israel (and its recent total aid blockade which caused widespread starvation). “The partial aid access Israel granted in late July has proven woefully inadequate. We have a clear message for Israel. Urgently and permanently lift all restrictions on aid delivery.”

Let's give you some lines from today's UN security council meeting convened after Israel said its military would “take control” of Gaza City.

“If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction,” UN assistant secretary Miroslav Jenca told the UN security council.

Slovenia's ambassador to the UN Samuel Zbogar, speaking on behalf of the five European members of the security council (France, the UK, Slovenia, Greece and Denmark) ahead of the meeting, said “this decision by the Israeli government will do nothing to secure the return of the hostages and risk further endangering their lives”.

“It will also worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and risk further death and mass displacement of Palestinian civilians.”

Netanyahu says he wants to get all remaining hostages out alive and recover the remains of those who have died in Hamas captivity.

“If we don't do anything, we are not going to get them out,” Netanyahu said.

“The move I'm talking about has the possibility of getting them out,” he added, without elaborating on tactics but said there are “creative” approaches under consideration.

Protesters, including relatives of 50 hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are reported to be alive, fear Netanyahu's Gaza City takeover plan puts the lives of hostages at risk.

Netanyahu says he has “directed” the Israeli military to bring in foreign journalists to Gaza, but stressed the importance of assuring the safety of reporters.

“The directive has been since two days ago,” he said, adding “I think you should see it (the Gaza Strip)”.

Netanyahu said:

One of the things you are going to see is precisely our efforts to bring in food to Gaza, you will see the trucks that have entered Gaza and are still waiting to be distributed.

You'll see Gazans who are fighting Hamas. We haven't seen it since the beginning of the war. And that is a reflection of the fact that they know we are approaching the end stage.

With international reporters barred by Israel from entering the strip, Palestinian journalists have been the only ones able to report from the ground in the war zone. More than 170 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 2023, with some estimates putting the toll as high as 206. It is the deadliest conflict for media workers in recent history.

Netanyahu is now taking questions from the media. He has been asked by a journalist for a timeline on when he expects to conclude the expansion of his new assault on the territory. Netanyahu does not put a date on it, but said it should be done “fairly quickly”.

“The timeline that we set for the action is fairly quickly. I mean we want to first of all enable safe zones to be established, facilities to be brought so that the civilian population in Gaza City can move out, as they moved out in Rafah.”

Netanyahu claims he wants to bring the war to an end as soon as possible.

Netanyahu says he is talking to the US about “additional measures” to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza (which is experiencing famine because of the Israeli aid blockade and ongoing restrictions).

The Israeli leader said that in the meantime:

What we are doing, as I said, is designate safe quarters, expand the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution points and they are trying to bring in more resources, hope to recruit some international organisations, maybe – god willing – the UN if they ever decide to actually do something for the Palestinian people that does not go through Hamas.

Netanyahu adds that he wants to increase airdrops into Gaza, though he says these are not the most important form of aid delivery (compared to “ground routes”).

Netanyahu says the only people who are being deliberately starved in Gaza are hostages, not Palestinian civilians.

He claims the media has distorted the facts on the ground around starvation by relying on Hamas' statistics and claims. Netanyahu points to images of “fake starving children”, including a cover photo from the New York Times.

Netanyahu turns to antisemitism, saying that “every massacre of the Jewish people was proceeded by massive vilification”.

Netanyahu says Hamas is refusing to lay down its weapons. “Given Hamas' refusal to lay down its arms, Israel has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas,” the Israeli prime minister tells journalists at the conference. He says about 70-75% of Gaza is under Israeli military control – but says there are two “remaining strongholds” where Hamas militants apparently are: Gaza City and the “central camps in Al Mawasi”.

Netanyahu further defends his government's plan to take over Gaza City, which has been widely condemned on the international stage, including by western allies, with the below comments:

Contrary to false claims this is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily. We will do so by first enabling the civilian population to safely the leave combat areas to designated safe zones and these safe zones they will be given ample food, water and medical care, as we have done before.

And again contrary to false claims, our policy throughout the war has been to prevent a humanitarian crisis while Hamas' policy has been to create it.

Since the beginning of the war, Israel has let in close to two million tonnes of aid. I know of no other army that has enabled such aid to go to the civilian population in enemy territory. Now, if we had a starvation policy no one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war. But our policy has been the exact opposite.

Netanyahu says Israel's goal is not to occupy Gaza but to free it from “Hamas terrorists”. The Israel leader, who describes Hamas as a “genocidal organisation”, continued:

The war can end continue if Gaza, or rather, Hamas lays down its arms and releases all the remaining hostages.

Gaza will be demilitarised, Israel will have overriding security responsibility, a security zone will be established on Gaza's border with Israel to prevent future terrorist incursions, a civilian administration will be established in Gaza that will seek to live in peace with Israel.

That is our plan for the day after Hamas.

Netanyahu says Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists in Gaza and said the Palestinian militant group has vowed to repeat the “savagery of the attack” on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.

Netanyahu has started speaking. He said this press conference is an opportunity to “puncture the lies”.

Humanitarian office says 37 children have died from acute malnutrition since July, as overall toll nears 100

See all our Middle East crisis coverage

UN warns Gaza faces ‘starvation, pure and simple' as child deaths mount. The body's humanitarian office OCHA said 98 children had died from acute malnutrition since the start of the conflict in October 2023, with 37 of those deaths since July, according to Gaza's authorities. (see post 18.46)

Chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis criticises UK decision to recognise Palestine at a march in central London calling for release of Israeli hostages.

Meanwhile, at least 61,430 Palestinian people have been killed and 153,213 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. At least 61 Palestinian people were killed and 363 others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said.

“The invasion of Gaza risks turning into a Vietnam for Israeli soldiers,” Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said in an interview with daily Il Messaggero. Senior Israeli military officers and former senior commanders have warned that Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City risks further international isolation of Israel.

Gaza's Government Media Office say only 14% of the aid Gaza's population needs entered the Strip over the last fortnight.

Benjamin Netanyahu says he wants a ‘civilian administration' to be established in Gaza after Hamas is defeated.

The Israeli prime minister defended his Gaza city plan and said on Sunday he was talking to the US about ‘additional aid measures' and claims he has ‘directed' the military to bring in foreign reporters to Gaza.

The UN security council debated the seizure of Gaza in a rare emergency meeting, you can watch the video below:

Back to those protests in Greece where demonstrators far and wide have kicked off a “day of rage” with more than 100 “stop the war” rallies planned nationwide this evening.

In remote Astypalaia in the south-eastern Aegean Sea, a motley group of protesters, including tourists and locals unfurled banners and placards proclaiming “free Palestine, stop the genocide, not in our name” and “victory to Palestine” at the foot of the island's fortress-topped town.

The mass rallies – the biggest coordinated wave of protest seen in Greece since the onset of the Gaza war – come on the back of rising anger over the increasingly close ties Athens enjoys with Tel Aviv. Tessa Charta joined the mass rally outside the Greek parliament this evening in Athens' Syntagma square.

We are disgusted with our government's blind support for a country so obviously violating every human right. Other countries with close ties have criticised Israel and have promised to recognise Palestine but not Greece. That is why the slogan tonight is not in our name. We don't want to be complicit

AFP reports that the UN's humanitarian office OCHA said 98 children had died from acute malnutrition since the start of the conflict in October 2023, with 37 of those deaths since July, according to Gaza's authorities.

OCHA's coordination director Ramesh Rajasingham said the situation in Gaza had developed into full blown starvation.

This is no longer a looming hunger crisis – this is starvation, pure and simple

 Other council members, and UN officials, expressed alarm. China called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities”.
 “This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,” said Ramesh Rajasingham with the UN humanitarian office told the AP. “Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.”

The UK's chief rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis has addressed the London march calling for the hostages' release and has attacked an announcement by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, that the country was set to recognise Palestine as a state next month.

Addressing the crowd close to Starmer's London residence in Downing Street, Mirvis said:

To our government we turn and we say ‘how would you ever be able to live with the fact that you would have recognised a Palestinian state, at the head of which is a terrorist organisation, with a stated intention of destroying the state of Israel and harming Jews right around the world and all this at a time when the hostages are still languishing in the tunnels of Gaza?

The Labour party, both in opposition and now in government has had a mantra, they have continuously been saying ‘don't judge us by our words, judge us by our deeds'.

And to our government we say right now this is the time for responsible action, it is not too late.”

He added: “We will continue to do whatever we can for the sake of each and every one of the hostages.”

A man has been arrested at the “national march for the hostages” in central London, the Metropolitan police have said.

The force said the individual, who was not part of the march, was held for common assault and a racially aggravated public order offence after the march briefly paused just past Charing Cross.

The march was ending with an assembly in Whitehall.

In the UK, a man has been carried away by police officers after a scuffle broke out close to the gates of Downing Street, the prime minister's London residence.

The man was seen throwing water over a demonstrator who was part of a protest calling for the release of the hostages (see post at 12.43BST). He then charged at him and a scuffle broke out as the man then put his hand around the demonstrator's neck.

Police officers then intervened and the man was seen being carried away.

Meanwhile, in Greece, pro-Palestinian protestors are braced to take to the streets in more than 100 locations nationwide, triggering a rare warning from the Israeli foreign ministry to tourists visiting the country.

Stop the war campaigners say the ‘day of rage' rallies have been organised in major urban centres, towns, villages and islands with the sole purpose of calling for an end “to the genocide in Gaza” and Benjamin Netanyahu's latest takeover plans.

Graffiti deploring Israel and its actions have proliferated in areas popular with tourists, starting with Plaka, the ancient Athenian neighbourhood of narrow alleys beneath the Acropolis.

“Wherever we are, in every village, every square, every island, every alley, on every street in every town and on every mountain we will call for justice for Palestine,” said a statement released by protest organisers ahead of this evening's demonstrations.

“We will not put up with those in our country and on our islands who support genocide, we will not tolerate genocide in our name. The whole world will learn that the Greek government is alone,” it added, castigating the centre- right administration of Kyriakos Mitsotakis for standing by the “murderous” Netanyahu.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry warned Israelis to “stay away from areas of demonstrations, avoid public debates and expressing political positions in public spaces, and minimize visible signs of identification (such as [Israeli] flags, shirts with Hebrew writing, IDF symbols.”

Fury over the war in Gaza has mounted in Greece putting diplomatic ties between the two countries under unexpected strain.

Last week, the Israeli ambassador to Greece Noam Katz lashed out at the mayor of Athens, Haris Doukas, for failing to clean up anti-Israel graffiti that was, he said “(making) Israeli tourists feel uncomfortable.”

Infuriated by his remarks, Doukas hit back saying:

We Greeks do not take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians and children standing in line for food, from those responsible for the daily deaths of dozens of Gazans from bombs, hunger and thirst.

James Kariuki, the UK's deputy permanent representative to the UN, called Israel's decision to take Gaza City over “wrong” and said it would displace nearly one million (more) Palestinians.

“Expanding military operations will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict. It will not secure the release of the hostages. It will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” Kariuki was quoted by Al Jazeera as having said.

“This inhumanity cannot be justified”, he said, referring to the continuing restrictions on aid imposed by Israel (and its recent total aid blockade which caused widespread starvation). “The partial aid access Israel granted in late July has proven woefully inadequate. We have a clear message for Israel. Urgently and permanently lift all restrictions on aid delivery.”

LONDON, August 10. /TASS/. European leaders have called on US President Donald Trump to hold talks with Russia "only under a ceasefire" and to "protect the vital security interests of Ukraine and Europe", according to a joint declaration by the President of the European Commission and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Finland, and non-EU member United Kingdom. The title of the document specifies that it was adopted ahead of the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests. We agree that these vital interests include the need for robust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity," the statement said, adding, "The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine."

The leaders said "they remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force," and added, "The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations."

The Europeans expressed the view that the current line of contact in Ukraine should serve as the starting point for negotiations on territories. They once again welcomed Trump's diplomatic initiatives but expressed the view that efforts to end the conflict should combine active diplomacy, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia.

They pledged to support the work to end the conflict "diplomatically", as well as by "maintaining significant military and financial support for Ukraine, including within the framework of the ‘Coalition of the Willing,'" and by maintaining and introducing restrictive measures against Russia.

Reuters

11:40 JST, August 10, 2025

Aug 9 (Reuters) – From firing people to promoting jeans, calling for peace deals or the renaming of a sports team, President Donald Trump keeps a lot on his proverbial to-do list. Much of it is unrelated to running the country.

More than six months into his second term as U.S. commander-in-chief, Trump, a former New York businessman and reality television host, has applied a hands-on management style and producer-like attitude toward governing, relying largely on his own instincts for decisions large and small.

Using the tools of social media and a propensity for bullying, Trump personally wades into issues inside and outside the federal government to get his way. He harangues company executives to invest in America and uses trade deals as leverage over foreign leaders to end conflicts.

Last week he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over unproven allegations she falsified figures that he didn't like. This week he called for the head of Intel to step down over ties with China, and the company's stock fell.

In recent months he has pressed the Washington Commanders football team to change its name back to the Redskins, forced universities to pay huge amounts to the federal government, boosted retailer American Eagle Outfitters' shares with a compliment about a controversial jeans commercial featuring actor Sydney Sweeney and attempted to shore up Republican power by pushing for political redistricting in Texas.

Trump's style, which can confound both his friends and his foes, is dramatically different from his more traditional predecessors. It has earned him condemnation for being caustic and praise for being effective at getting what he wants.

“While he delves into topics that are certainly distractions relative to the big business of leading the world's greatest nation, it can also be said that past presidents have excessively deferred to the bureaucracy and failed to deliver the change their voters expected,” said Carlos Curbelo, a Republican former congressman from Florida.

“Trump views himself more as the CEO of the U.S.A. than as president,” Curbelo added. “It's good for decision making and challenging for the constitutional order which made our country the world's greatest economic and military force.”

Trump has taken on academia, the legal world, media companies, athletics, the federal bureaucracy and more, all while retooling the world economy with tariffs, cracking down on immigration flows, upending relations with allies and putting his stamp on American culture.

Though he has a team of advisers, the president frequently follows his own counsel, making policy decisions and then announcing them himself, ramifications aside.

“I think what a lot of people miss about Trump is he's the marketer-in-chief,” said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist with ties to the White House. “Not only is he his own best press secretary, he's also his own best chief-of-staff.”

Critics question why Trump gets bogged down in issues that are secondary to his goals of strengthening the U.S. economy, for example, or achieving a peace deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

“He's commenting one moment on … Putin and tariffs and all that's happening in the world and the next moment he's talking about, oh, Sydney Sweeney, and all these other issues that are completely unrelated to being president of the United States,” said Charlie Dent, a Republican former congressman from Pennsylvania. “He simply can't focus.”

The White House said Trump is using his skills to deliver on policy priorities. “President Trump's leadership style can be summed up plainly as decisive and commanding,” said White House spokesman Harrison Fields.

Trump also employs a talent to distract when facing difficulty. Though that super power has largely eluded him with the controversy over sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Department of Justice's refusal to release files related to the disgraced financier's case, Trump's broad ability to change the subject and dominate the news cycle has stupefied his opponents for years.

“His leadership style is much closer to that of an executive producer, and the executive producer who has a really big picture understanding of the audience,” said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.

“I think he trusts his instincts about the audience over anybody else, and that's why you see him oftentimes, you know, managing his own policy portfolio.”

Trump, though not a stickler for detail on all things policy-related, does get into the weeds on things he cares about, both cultural and political, including redecorating the Oval Office with gold, paving over the Rose Garden and building a new ballroom on the White House grounds.

On Tuesday, reporters bantered with the president while he walked on the roof of the White House press room, surveying the grounds for what he said were more ways to spend his money. The White House said Trump and other donors plan to pay for the $200 million ballroom project, which is slated to be finished before his second term concludes.

“I think narcissists do get bogged down in details because they think that everything is a reflection of them,” said Republican strategist Rina Shah. “When he decides to focus on the minutia, he's forgetting about the bigger picture. And that's kind of a disservice to the office.”

Where critics see such disservice, the White House sees results.

On the eve of presiding over a U.S.-brokered peace framework between Azerbaijan and Armenia this week, Trump took to social media to tout his involvement: “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP.'”

MOSCOW, August 10. /TASS/. The White House is reportedly considering the possibility of inviting Vladimir Zelensky to the negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, NBC News reported, citing a US official and three other sources.

"Discussions are underway," one source told the channel. A White House representative added that it is "absolutely possible."

On Friday, Trump announced his intention to hold a meeting with Putin in Alaska on August 15. The plans for these talks were subsequently confirmed by Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov. According to Ushakov, Putin and Trump will focus on discussing options to achieve a long-term peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. The Kremlin expects that the next meeting between Putin and Trump will take place on Russian territory, Ushakov emphasized.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war in Gaza can “end tomorrow” if ”Hamas lays down its arms and releases all the remaining hostages.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israel's new military offensive in one of Gaza's most populated areas amid growing condemnation at home and abroad, declaring that this is “the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily.”

Relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza on Sunday called on Israeli companies to strike next week to pressure the government to reverse its decision to take over Gaza City.

Foreign nations continued airdropping aid in Gaza on Sunday following Israel's announcement of its plan to retake Gaza City in another escalation of the war.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.”

Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the camps of Muwasi and Deir al-Balah. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas.

The crowded camps — sheltering well over a half-million displaced people, according to the U.N. — had not been part of Israel's announcement Friday. It was not clear why, though Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be “safe zones,” but such designated areas have been bombed in the past.




Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.”

Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.

“Our goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza,” Netanyahu asserted.

Netanyahu said there is a “fairly short timetable” for next steps there, but didn't give specifics. The goals, he said, include demilitarizing the territory, the Israeli military having “overriding security control” and a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge.

Israel wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites in Gaza, he said, but in a later briefing to local media, he asserted: “There is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.”

Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war.

He again blamed many of Gaza's problems on the Hamas militant group, including civilian deaths, destruction and aid shortages. “Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists,” he asserted, adding that Palestinians are “begging” to be freed from them.

Hamas responded with a lengthy statement that summed up Netanyahu's remarks as “blatant lies.”

The United States defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.

The U.S. has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.

Other council members, and U.N. officials, expressed alarm. China called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities.”

“This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,” said Ramesh Rajasingham with the U.N. humanitarian office. “Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.”

Israel faces growing action even by its closest allies. Netanyahu said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany had “buckled under” the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. Merz, for his part, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany and Israel were talking “very critically” but Berlin's overall policies of friendship haven't changed.

At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. The Associated Press spoke to witnesses of gunfire in the Israeli-controlled Morag and Netzarim corridors and the Teina area in the south. All accused Israeli forces of firing at crowds trying to reach food distributions or waiting for convoys.

Fifteen people were killed while waiting for trucks near the Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital.

The situation is a “death trap,” said Jamal al-Laweh, who said Israeli forces opened fire there. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.”

Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital.

In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The AP could not independently confirm who fired. Awda hospital said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire.

Six other aid-seekers were killed while trying to reach GHF sites in Khan Younis and Rafah, Nasser hospital said.

The GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but operations have been marred by deaths and chaos.

Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Israel's air and ground offensive has displaced most Palestinians and pushed the territory toward famine. Two Palestinian children died of malnutrition-related causes on Saturday, bringing the toll among children to 100 since the war began.

At least 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since June, when the ministry started to count them.

The hunger toll is in addition to the ministry's war toll of 61,400 Palestinians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, doesn't distinguish between fighters or civilians, but says around half of the dead have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties.

Hostages' relatives have urged a labor strike in Israel next week over the plans to expand military operations, fearing it will endanger their loved ones. Fifty hostages remain after being taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Twenty are believed to be alive.

Dozens of people sat outside the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem to protest Israel's offensive. “I think it's a horrible decision. It's like deciding that we don't want (hostages) alive anymore,” said one, Milly Rothschild.

Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab joins 'Fox & Friends' to examine a new study on the effects of pathogenic gut bacteria and tips for limiting exposure to harmful bacteria.

James van der Beek has revealed the first warning sign of his colon cancer — and it's one that did not seem alarming at the time.

The "Dawson's Creek" actor, 48, who announced his colorectal cancer diagnosis in November 2024, recently told Healthline that "there wasn't any red flag or something glaring."

"I was healthy. I was doing the cold plunge," he said. "I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea."

COLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSES SOAR AMONG YOUNGER ADULTS FOR ONE KEY REASON

The one symptom that he did experience was a change in bowel movements, which the actor chalked up to an effect of his coffee consumption.

"Before my diagnosis, I didn't know much about colorectal cancer," van der Beek said. "I didn't even realize the screening age [had] dropped to 45; I thought it was still 50."

He ultimately underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed that the actor had stage 3 colon cancer.

Professor Eitan Friedman, M.D., Ph.D., an oncologist and founder of The Suzanne Levy-Gertner Oncogenetics Unit at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, confirmed that changes in bowel habits is the primary red flag that should raise the suspicion of colorectal cancer.

Others include fatigue as a result of anemia, blood in stool, weight loss, loss of appetite and abdominal discomfort, Friedman, who has not treated van der Beek, told Fox News Digital.

"I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea."

Dr. Erica Barnell, M.D., Ph.D., a physician-scientist at Washington University School of Medicine — and co-founder and chief medical officer at Geneoscopy — noted that van der Beek's experience of having no "glaring" signs is common.

"Many colorectal cancers develop silently, without obvious symptoms," Barnell, who also did not treat the actor, told Fox News Digital. "By the time symptoms appear, the disease may already be advanced."

Symptoms are "especially worrisome" for those 45 and older who have at least one first-degree relative with colon cancer or other GI malignancies, and those with active inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, added Friedman, who is also an advisory board member at SpotitEarly, a startup that offers an at-home breath test to detect early-stage cancer signals.

The overall chance of an average-risk person getting colorectal cancer over a lifetime is 4% to 5%, according to Friedman.

"Colonoscopy at age 45 onwards, at five- to 10-year intervals, has been shown to lead to early detection of polyps that have the potential to become malignant, and to allow for their removal as an effective means of minimizing the risk of malignant transformation," he said.

Unfortunately, Barnell noted, "screening compliance in the U.S. remains below national targets, and gaps are widest in rural, low-income and minority communities."

To help close those gaps, she called for greater access to "accurate, noninvasive screening technologies," along with efforts to increase public awareness.

"Colonoscopy at age 45 onwards, at five- to 10-year intervals, has been shown to lead to early detection of polyps that have the potential to become malignant, and to allow for their removal as an effective means of minimizing the risk of malignant transformation," an expert said.  (iStock)

"Most people don't like talking about bowel habits, but paying attention to changes can save your life," Barnell said. "Screening gives us the chance to find problems early — often before you feel sick — and that can make all the difference."

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A U.S. tourist who was visiting Puerto Rico for Bad Bunny's residency was fatally shot early Sunday at La Perla, a popular seaside shantytown, police said.

The victim was identified as Kevin Mares, a 25-year-old who lived in New York, according to a police statement.

The shooting happened in the predawn hours at a nightspot called “Shelter for Mistreated Men” in La Perla, a coastal community that has struggled to shed its dark reputation.

Homicide detective Sgt. Arnaldo Ruiz said in a phone interview that the shooting took place when several people near Mares began arguing and one pulled out a gun and shot at least three people, including Mares. Two other men who live in La Perla were injured and remain hospitalized.

Ruiz said Mares was an innocent bystander. He was with three other friends who told police they were in Puerto Rico for one of Bad Bunny's 30 concerts, which have attracted tens of thousands of visitors to the U.S. territory.

Mares was shot on the left side of his abdomen and was taken to Puerto Rico's largest public hospital, where he died, authorities said.

Ruiz said police don't yet know what the people were arguing about and don't have a description of the shooter. “We have very little information,” he said.

Ruiz added that Mares' three friends also were from New York. He didn't have their hometowns.

La Perla is located on the outskirts of a historic district popular with tourists known as Old San Juan. A couple hundred people live in the shantytown, which once served as Puerto Rico's biggest distribution point for heroin and was known for its violence.




Police used to avoid the community, which used to have a sign proclaiming, “Not open to visitors. Do not enter.”

But violence eased when hundreds of federal agents raided the slum in 2011 and arrested dozens of people, including a well-known community leader who was later convicted.

The neighborhood became even safer and more welcoming after Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featured it in their hit, “Despacito.”

But isolated, violent incidents persist.

In February 2023, three tourists were stabbed after police said a person told them to stop filming inside the community.

Then in April 2024, a 24-year-old tourist from Delaware was killed and his body set on fire after police said he and a friend were attacked following a drug purchase. Police said the victims were trying to take pictures of La Perla after being warned not to do so.

The island of 3.2 million people has reported 277 killings so far this year, compared with 325 killings in the same period last year.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Frederick Richard is taking the fight to make men's gymnastics matter to a new front: his wardrobe.

The charismatic 21-year-old Olympic bronze medalist switched out the stirrup pants that have long been a staple of the men's uniform for shorts with compression leggings at the U.S. Championships this weekend, firm in his belief that the three-tenths (0.3) deduction he receives every day of competition that he breaks the rules is worth it if it makes his sport more accessible.

Even when those tenths add up. Richard edged Fuzzy Benas by less than a quarter of a point for second place behind two-time national champion Asher Hong. If Richard had worn the traditional uniform, his margin over Benas could have been a little more comfortable. 

Yet asked if the statement he is trying to make — that it's time for men's gymnastics to modernize its uniforms — is worth the risk to his potential placement during a given meet, he didn't hesitate.

“It's 1,000% worth it,” Richard said. “If you look at these kids in the crowd, I'm thinking about them and I'm thinking about when I was younger.”




While Richard quickly fell in love with gymnastics as a kid growing up in the Boston area, the stirrup pants worn by the guys on pommel horse, still rings, parallel bars, and high bar were another matter.

“If I left the gym to go to the gas station, I didn't want anybody to see me in my pommel horse pants,” Richard said. “Kids would say, ‘Do you do gymnastics?' I'd say ‘Yeah.' But I didn't want them to search ‘gymnast' and see the uniform. I didn't feel like it was cool.”

His solution was to design an alternative. With the help of the apparel company Turn, Richard debuted the look earlier this year and “refined” it ahead of nationals. 

During the opening night of competition on Thursday, the rising Michigan junior wore maize-and-blue colored zebra-patterned leggings with (almost) matching blue shorts. On Saturday, Richard swapped the maize and blue for gray.

Both times, there was a “ND -0.3” next to Richard's score on the first event in which the traditional pants were required. Yet Richard wasn't as focused on the ribbon board where his score was posted, but on the young boys in the stands below them.

“(I want them to) see this, and they're like, ‘This is cool. I want to wear this. This kid is trying to make the sport cool, he looks cool,'” Richard said. “And that's the stuff that gets kids into the sport, that's stuff that keeps kids in the sport.”

Even if it's a largely American conversation. 

While the popularity of men's gymnastics in the U.S. has declined for decades (though there is optimism that the bronze medal Richard and his teammates captured at the 2024 Olympics could help stem the tide), there are no such issues overseas.

They're not talking about stirrup pants in China. Or Japan. Or Russia. Places with dominant programs whose stars become champions and national heroes in the process.

The challenges men's gymnastics faces in the U.S. are many. The number of Division I programs that offer it as a scholarship sport is a fraction of what it was decades ago. And the impact of the recent House settlement could make opportunities at a level that has long served as a feeder system to the U.S. national team even scarcer.

At the Olympic level, the men have long competed in the shadow of the star-studded (and highly successful) women's program.

Richard has long understood this. He's seen the attrition firsthand. While the uniform didn't stop him from pressing on, he believes he might be the exception, not the rule.

Countless young boys dabble in multiple sports growing up, gymnastics included. Richard thinks tweaking the uniform requirements into something he considers more modern could remove what he thinks might be a roadblock to sticking with it for some.

“It does add to what makes a 12-year-old boy decide, 'Do I want to keep doing this sport? Or should I play football or soccer, because my friends think I'm cool when I play with them?” he said.

The rules do allow for a little latitude. Some German female gymnasts opted for full-body unitards at each of the last two Olympics, though the design does not run afoul of FIG regulations. 

What Richard is doing does. 

And while he stressed he would never wear his outlawed uniform in a team competition — he wore regulation pants while helping lead Michigan to the NCAA championship this spring — that might not be the case the next time he competes internationally.

“We'll see about the world stage,” Richard said. “We'll have to talk and see what they allow, but I want to keep pushing it. I'm having fun. I feel more free.”

He'll have some time to think about it. When the six-man roster for the 2025 World Championships was announced late Saturday night, Richard's name wasn't on it. The decision had nothing to do with Richard's uniform but the uniqueness of this year's world meet, which does not include a team event and is largely designed for event specialists.

At his best, Richard is one of the top all-arounders on the planet. Yet even he admitted he was at about “80%” at nationals following a whirlwind stretch that included traveling to places like Uganda. Richard is partnering with the African nation to open a facility for boys there interested in acrobatics.

The joy he felt during the trip was palpable. So has the criticism he's received back home for his uniform choice, with some telling him if he wants to look like a basketball player, maybe he should go play basketball.

While Richard's modified look wouldn't look out of place on the court, pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik — who won a pair of bronze medals in Paris and became a breakout star in the process (all while wearing stirrup pants) last summer — agrees with his Olympic teammate that there “should be a certain level of flexibility” when it comes to uniforms, though he also pointed out that having everyone wear identical outfits is designed to help the judges do their jobs.

“So like, you can't wear like super baggy clothes, obviously,” Nedoroscik said. “But I do like there should be maybe a little bit of wiggle room.”

That's all Richard says he is asking for, though it seems highly unlikely the FIG would eliminate the deduction for a uniform violation anytime soon. That is not going to stop Richard from pressing on.

“I'll wear it for the next 10 years if I have to,” he said. “So eventually, if I keep succeeding and winning, and eventually on the international stage do the same thing and keep winning, (the FIG) will see how people like it (and) the younger kids will start wearing it ... and the trend is going to grow.”

ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Taliban are investigating explicit death threats against dozens of Afghan women working for the United Nations, according to a report published Sunday.

In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, the U.N. mission to the country said that dozens of female national staff were subjected to explicit death threats in May. 

The threats come against a backdrop of severe restrictions placed on women since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021. 

The U.N. report said the threats came from unidentified individuals related to their work with the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, other agencies, funds, and programs, “requiring the U.N. to implement interim measures to protect their safety.”

It said that the Taliban told the U.N. mission that their personnel were not responsible for the threats. An Interior Ministry investigation is underway, the report added.

The Interior Ministry spokesman, Abdul Mateen Qani, said no such threats had been made.

“This is completely incorrect,” Qani said. “The ministry has an independent department for this, and we have a strategic plan for protection and security so there is no threat to them in any area, nor can anyone threaten them, nor is there any threat to them.”

Qani did not answer questions about an investigation.

The Taliban barred Afghan women from working at domestic and foreign nongovernmental organizations in December 2022, extending this ban to the U.N. six months later, and then threatening to shut down agencies and groups still employing women. Some women have nonetheless stayed on in key sectors, such as health care and urgent humanitarian assistance, where aid agencies say the needs are great.




Humanitarian agencies say the Taliban have hampered or interfered with their operations, allegations denied by authorities.

The U.N. report is the first official confirmation of death threats against Afghan women working in the sector. The report also highlighted other areas affecting women's personal freedoms and safety.

In Herat, inspectors from the Vice and Virtue Ministry began requiring women to wear a chador, a full-body cloak covering the head. Dozens of women deemed “not in compliance” were barred from entering markets or using public transportation. Several women were detained until relatives brought them a chador, the report said. 

In Uruzgan, women were arrested for wearing a hijab — a headscarf — rather than a burqa covering the entire body and face.

Women have also been denied access to public areas, in line with laws banning them from such spaces. In Ghor province, police forced several families to leave a recreational area. They warned the families against visiting outdoor picnic sites with women. 

In Herat, Vice and Virtue inspectors stopped family groups with women and girls from accessing an open recreational area, only allowing all-male groups.

Nobody from the Vice and Virtue Ministry was immediately available to comment on the Ghor, Herat and Uruzgan incidents, which the U.N. said happened in May.

In Kandahar, the Public Health Department instructed female health care workers to be accompanied to work by male guardians with an identification card proving that they were related to the woman by blood or marriage. 

It wasn't immediately clear if the card is specific to Kandahar or will be rolled out across Afghanistan.

“The process to apply for a mahram (male guardian) identification card is reportedly cumbersome and can take up to several weeks as it requires the de facto Department for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice and a member of the local community (e.g. malik, imam or village elder) to verify the relationship,” the U.N. report said.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump's Olympic task force, perception of the ‘big, beautiful bill' and more on ‘Special Report.'

An educational consultant warned that there will be "no more normal years" as colleges brace for a loss of international students and face financial challenges due to those losses.

Prestigious colleges have been offering student prospects on their waitlist a spot among their first-year students a lot later than usual, according to Town & Country.

"This is not a typical year," the outlet reported. 

The magazine explained further that waitlist discussions on college forums "went deep into July." Top schools like Columbia University, Rice University, Stanford University, and Duke have been notifying students a lot later than usual. 

In an effort to attract students who were waitlisted, Rice University has had to compensate students who have already committed to another school and received important materials such as course schedules and freshman dorm assignments.

Rice has been admitting students from its waitlist deep into summer.

The admissions process at America's most selective universities has been disrupted, possibly due to the Trump administration's pressure on colleges' handling of antisemitism on campus and civil rights violations as well as freezing the funding they relied on from the federal government, the outlet suggested.

"The most likely explanation for the waitlist extensions this year is a fear that international students will not be able to start classes in August as a result of a pause that Secretary of State Marco Rubio placed on visa interviews earlier this year, between May 27 and June 18, during their peak season," the outlet reported.

"When interviews were resumed, U.S. consulates were told that they must implement new social media vetting protocols within five days. According to NAFSA, a professional organization for people who work in international education, the State Department provided little guidance on how to carry out this new order."

International students at consulates in India, China, Nigeria, Japan, and other countries are reportedly backlogged due to a "three-week" pause in interviews. 

Colleges will lose many of their international student enrollment as India and China make up over half of international students in the U.S. "NAFSA predicts ‘a potential 30–40 percent decline in new international student enrollment,' which could mean 150,000 fewer international students on American campuses," Town & Country reported.

Mark Moody, an education consultant who has worked at high schools domestically and internationally for almost three decades, told Town & Country that this "year's issue with international enrollment needs to be understood as compounding, not creating, problems that have been developing for some time."

The financial implications are a significant factor. Union College reportedly announced financial cuts and was forced to pull from endowment funds after a decline in international students.

The loss of international students has shaken up the college admissions process, causing many universities to extend the waitlist deadline as they struggle to predict which students will enroll.

"Students are applying to more colleges, making it harder to predict who will enroll. Colleges are seeing more students secure a spot in a college with a deposit in the spring and then never actually enroll, a phenomenon known as melt. It's become more common for families to make deposits at multiple colleges in the hope of securing better financial aid deals later that summer," the outlet reported.

"The international visa problems have made the uncertainty and anxiety among admissions leaders worse, but they were already bad," Town & Country stated.

Moody told Town & Country that the college admissions landscape will favor students with "higher admit rates and more merit aid, especially if they're from full-pay families."

"Outside of the Ivy League and perhaps a dozen other schools with massive endowments, colleges are going to feel great pressure to admit more students who will help them hit their bottom line." 

Moody worries that more colleges will lean heavily into their early decision process to admit a larger percentage of their freshman class, which "could put students in a tough spot" if they apply regular decision or if they don't approach early decision very carefully and strategically.

"There are no more normal years," Mark Moody said to Town & Country.

New York City Democratic Party mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani gets a big thumbs up from progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts

As someone who ran a hard-fought senate race against Elizabeth Warren in 2012, I don't agree with her on many policies, but I have to give her credit for her honesty about political sensation Zohran Mamdani.

Asked about the New York City Democratic mayoral candidate this week, the Massachusetts senator urged her fellow Democrats to embrace Mamdani's socialist plans as the "Democratic message."

Imagine that: a clear (albeit extreme) answer to a direct question rather than contrived talking points. Other Democrats are offering mealy-mouthed canned responses to questions about Mamdani, including my opponent in the New Hampshire Senate race, U.S. Representative Chris Pappas, D-N.H., who won't take a position on Mamdani's candidacy, and is calling me "pathetic" for raising the issue. 

TOP DEM SENATOR REVEALS SOCIALIST MAMDANI IS WHAT HER PARTY SHOULD LOOK LIKE: 'YOU BET'

The outcome of this fall's mayoral race in New York City has implications poised to resonate far beyond the five boroughs. Not only would the epicenter of capitalism falling into the hands of an avowed socialist send a dangerous message to our innovators and the world, but it will shape the future of the Democratic Party struggling to find its footing. Less than a year after getting their electoral clocks cleaned by President Donald Trump, the party's national standing has plummeted to a 35-year low.

Republican candidates need to do more than sit back and watch the Democrats implode. We must loudly and clearly explain to voters what socialism means. Remind them it's been decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, but a group of extreme and uniformed politicians are trying to bring back some of its core tenets. Mamdani has called for the abolition of private property and discussed "the end goal of seizing the means of production." These should be relics of a failed economic playbook that belongs in the history books, not modern political debates.

Capitalism is the greatest force for good this world has ever seen. It has lifted people up from poverty and provided opportunities for those at the bottom.  And I am one of them. I went from being a kid on welfare to the halls of Congress and then to serving as President Donald Trump's ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa decades later.

That upward mobility doesn't exist in Mamdani's socialist worldview. He frames his arguments around free handouts and government-run grocery stores. In his mind, it's better to spread mediocrity widely than strive for excellence through hard work. It's free for everyone until it doesn't exist for anyone.

Believe it or not, it won't be long before presidential candidates are kicking the tires on campaigns for 2028, especially in my home state of New Hampshire, the site of the First in the Nation presidential primary (at least on the Republican side, the Democrats decided to move it back in line to boost former President Joe Biden's electoral prospects).

Should he win this November, Mamdani is poised to become one of his party's biggest stars. His fellow socialist, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., is ascendant. Juan Williams, a well-respected Democratic voice even boldly predicted this week: "Say hello in 2028 to President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez."

The copycat phenomenon is well underway. In Minnesota, a socialist challenger to the incumbent Democrat mayor has been dubbed the "Mamdani of Minneapolis."

The recent trend lines are concerning. A 2021 Gallup poll found that just half of young Americans had a positive view of capitalism, while a separate survey showed that 62% of younger voters held a "favorable view" of "socialism." The Occupy Wall Street movement that was born in many of America's major cities a decade and a half ago has graduated to an open embrace of socialism.

With President Trump atop the ticket, the GOP made steady gains last year among younger and working-class voters. With every Democrat on record opposing tax cuts in the "One Big Beautiful Bill," not to mention provisions like "No Tax On Tips," we have a compelling story to tell about our vision for the future.

If we don't, it's more than just politics at stake. It's the future of our country. Democrats' economic vision is the one outlined by Sen. Warren and Mamdani: more government programs funded by higher taxes. Unlike those two politicians, most aren't willing to admit it, but given the chance, their policies would be ruinous.

Why focusing only on what's broken blinds us to what's fixable.

Over the past week or so, the US economy took a major hit, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was no longer in the business of caring about the environment, and the only thing the internet can talk about is Sydney Sweeney. But here's the thing: Even amid the constant deluge of news that alternates between the negative and the just silly, there's another story unfolding. It's quieter, slower, less flashy, but it's real, and it matters. And that's the story of progress.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

That's why a few months ago I launched Good News, Vox's weekly newsletter dedicated not to ignoring our often difficult reality, but to placing it in the broader context it deserves. This past Monday, Good News got the Unexplainable treatment, as Vox's excellent science podcast invited me on to discuss why, exactly, we find good news so elusive.

It's not just the media's bias — although, as I confessed to Unexplainable's Meradith Hoddinott, that's undeniably a part of it. After nearly 25 years in journalism, I've learned that the press is fundamentally a watchdog, conditioned to bark loudest when things go wrong. But there's also a deeper reason: our own negativity bias. Humans are hardwired to focus on threats, an evolutionary adaptation that once kept us alive on the savannah but now leaves us doomscrolling through headlines.

In the Unexplainable episode, Meredith and I explored this psychological quirk, highlighting stories of genuine progress that usually slip under the radar. Like this one: despite fears about rising crime, the murder rate in the US is potentially on track to hit historic lows. And despite the worsening effects of climate change and the proliferation of billion-dollar disasters, fewer people globally died from extreme weather in the first half of 2025 than in any comparable period on record.

Why spotlight developments like these, which can feel like the opposite of news? Because focusing only on what's broken can blind us to what's fixable. Realistic optimism isn't naïve; it's necessary. It fuels the belief that problems, even enormous ones, are solvable, which in turn inspires action. And, as I've discovered writing the Good News newsletter, this optimism can act like armor, helping us face a challenging, sometimes frightening future with greater resilience.

It's why Good News felt like a natural outgrowth of our work here at Future Perfect, where above all we want to capture an accurate view of the world as it is — the bad and the good. So, give the episode a listen — you'll hear us break down the science of negativity and the underappreciated power of hope. And, of course, subscribe to Good News.

This doesn't have to be all-or-nothing.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I typically eat vegetarian, and have considered going fully vegan out of concern for animal welfare. But lately my on-again, off-again gastrointestinal problems have been acting up, and I've had to go back on a more restricted diet to manage my symptoms — no spice, no garlic or onions, nothing acidic, and nothing caffeinated. Sticking to a “bland” diet is hard enough, but doing so while vegetarian is very difficult when things like tomatoes and onions and grapefruits are off the table.

I know a lot of people with these issues eat fish or meat, and some medical professionals recommend drinking chicken bone broth to soothe flare-ups. I don't want to abandon my commitment to animal welfare while my gut sorts itself out, but my food options are limited right now. How should I approach this?

Dear Would-Be Vegetarian,

You're not alone in finding it hard to stick to a purely vegetarian diet. Only 5 percent of American adults say they're vegetarian or vegan. What's more, one study found that 84 percent of people who adopt those diets actually go back to eating meat at some point. And most of them aren't even dealing with the gastrointestinal problems you face.

So, it speaks to the depth of your moral commitment that you're really wrestling with this. I'll have some concrete suggestions for you in a bit, but first I want to emphasize that how you approach the question of meat-eating will depend on your underlying moral theory.

There's a classic split in moral philosophy between deontologists and utilitarians. A deontologist is someone who thinks an action is moral if it's fulfilling a duty — and we have universal duties like, “always treat others as ends in themselves, never as means to an end.” From that perspective, killing an animal for food would be inherently morally wrong, because you're treating the animal as a means to an end.

Meanwhile, a utilitarian is someone who thinks that an action is moral if it produces good consequences — and behaving morally means producing the most happiness or well-being possible, or reducing the most suffering possible. Utilitarian philosophers like Peter Singer argue that we should be reducing, and ideally eliminating, the suffering that animals endure at our hands.

Deontologists and utilitarians are often pitted against each other, but they actually have one big thing in common: They both believe in a universal moral principle — whether it's “always treat others as ends in themselves” or “always maximize happiness.”

A lot of people find that comforting, because it offers certainty about how we should act. Even if acting morally requires hard sacrifices, it's incredibly soothing to think “If I just do X, then I'll know for sure that I'm being a good person!”

But these moral theories assume that all the complexity of human life can be reduced to one tidy formula. Can it, really?

Another school of philosophy — pragmatism — says we should be skeptical of fixed moral principles. Human life is so complicated, with many different factors at play in any ethical dilemma, so we should be pluralistic about what makes outcomes valuable instead of acting like the only thing that matters is maximizing a single value (say, happiness). And human society is always evolving, so a moral idea that makes sense in one context may no longer make sense in a different context. To a pragmatist, moral truths are contingent, not universal and unchanging.

I think one pragmatist who can really help you out is the University of Michigan's Elizabeth Anderson. In a 2005 essay applying pragmatism to the question of eating meat, the philosopher points out that for most of human history, we couldn't have survived and thrived without killing or exploiting animals for food, transportation, and energy. The social conditions for granting animals moral rights didn't really exist on a mass scale until recently (although certain non-Western societies did ascribe moral worth to some animals).

“The possibility of moralizing our relations to animals (other than our pets),” Anderson writes, “has come to us only lately, and even then not to us all, and not with respect to all animal species.”

In other words, Anderson doesn't think there's some universal rule like “eating animals is inherently morally wrong.” It's our social and technological circumstances that have made us more able than before to see animals as part of our moral circle. She also doesn't believe there's a single yardstick — like sentience or intelligence — by which we can judge how much of our moral concern an animal deserves. That's because moral evaluation isn't just about animals' intrinsic capacities, but also about their relationships to us. It matters whether we've made them dependent on us by domesticating them, say, or whether they live independently in the wild.

It also matters whether they're fundamentally hostile to us. Killing bedbugs? Totally fine! They may be sentient, but, Anderson writes, “We are in a permanent state of war with them, without possibility of negotiating for peace. To one-sidedly accommodate their interests…would amount to surrender.”

Anderson's point is not that animals' intelligence and sentience don't matter. It's that lots of other things matter, too, including our own ability to thrive.

With this pragmatic approach in mind, you can consider how to balance your concern for animal welfare with your concern for your own welfare. Instead of thinking in terms of a moral absolute that would force you into a “purist” diet no matter the cost to you, you can consider a “reducetarian” diet, which allows you to ease your own struggle while also taking care for animals seriously.

The key thing to realize is that some types of animal consumption cause a lot less suffering than others.

For one thing, if you're eating meat, try to buy the pasture-raised kind and not the kind that comes from factory farms — the huge industrialized facilities that supply 99 percent of America's meat. In these facilities, animals are tightly packed together and live under unbelievably harsh and unsanitary conditions. They're also often mutilated without pain relief: Think pigs being castrated, cows being dehorned, and hens being debeaked. Oh, and chickens have been bred to be so big that they're in constant pain; they live miserable lives from start to finish.

A pasture-raised label doesn't mean an animal has been spared all of the harms of modern agriculture — it doesn't guarantee that pain relief is used for painful procedures, and farm animals across different production systems have been bred to maximize production, which can take a toll on their welfare. And of course they'll ultimately meet the same fate as those raised on factory farms — slaughter. But your goal here is to meaningfully reduce, not 100 percent eliminate, the harms. And at least pasture-raised animals have gotten to roam around in a field and engage in natural behaviors up until the end.

It's a similar story for fish, by the way. More than half of the fish we eat comes from fish farms, which are basically just underwater factory farms. Wild-caught fish is not perfect — slow, suffocating deaths are common — but it's better than farmed.

The caveat here is that a lot of the welfare labels you'll see on animal products are basically a con. And some certification schemes have similar names, so you have to pay close attention. If you see the label “Certified Humane,” that's genuinely higher-welfare — but don't mistake it for “American Humane Certified,” which is really not. And be wary of putting much stock in labels like “cage-free” or “free-range.” They're better than nothing, but because the terms are often ill-defined and unenforced, they're not as meaningful as you might think. Here's a good guide to separating the real deal from the advertising spin.

Another classic recommendation among animal welfare advocates is to eat bigger animals — in other words, go for beef rather than chicken. That's both because of how miserable chickens' lives are on factory farms and because, as Vox's Kelsey Piper has written, it just takes way more chicken lives than cow lives to feed people. Cows are huge, producing about 500 pounds of beef apiece, while a chicken yields only a few pounds of meat. So, every year, the average American eats about 23 chickens and just over one-tenth of one cow.

That said, cows take a heavier toll on the climate than chickens do, so you don't want to eat tons of beef either. The environment is also one of the key values at stake in our consumption choices, so that has to factor in, too.

Of course, another possibility — to the extent that this works with your gastrointestinal issues — is to reach for low-fiber plant-based foods like tofu, seitan, and the smorgasbord of newer products now available (like Beyond and Impossible burgers).

But assuming you're going to eat meat, it's a good idea to set some clear parameters and standards around your reducetarian diet. A lot of reducetarians — myself included — have fallen into the trap of saying, “I'll reduce how much meat I eat,” but forgetting to quantify what that means. That can lead you to eat more meat than you'd intended. So it's probably better to commit to something like “weekday vegetarian” or “vegan before six” — you can check out the Reducetarian Foundation for suggestions.

At the end of the day, remember that there's a plurality of values at stake here, and no one of them necessarily trumps all the others. If you feel that eating some meat is important for your well-being right now, and you try to do that in ways that keep suffering for animals to a minimum, I don't think you need to feel bad about that. That's because you won't be shirking your values: You'll be recognizing that your values are plural, and you're doing your best to balance between them. That may be the best any of us can really do.

Republican lawmakers are zeroing in on two powerful foreign-owned firms they say are quietly shaping how Wall Street votes, and pushing corporate America toward progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals in the process.

Their focus is on Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, two foreign-based proxy advisory companies that operate with outsized sway over shareholder decisions. ISS is owned by Germany's Deutsche Börse, and Glass Lewis is owned by a Canadian private equity firm. 

Both firms are tasked with advising how large institutional investors, like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, cast votes at shareholder meetings, including on executive pay, board appointments, and company policies related to ESG and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).

The firms were originally created to help investors manage tens of thousands of votes, offering a kind of “cheat sheet” for quick decision-making. But critics say ISS and Glass Lewis now often set the direction of corporate decision-making.

“There must be greater transparency, due process, and oversight to ensure that proxy voting remains accountable to shareholders — not outsourced to unregulated intermediaries,” said Rep. French Hill (R‑AR), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, to the Washington Examiner. 

Many investors follow these firms' advice closely, some even automatically, giving them enormous sway over boardroom decisions, especially when it comes to ESG issues.

That has real-world implications for millions of Americans. Most people with a 401(k), pension, or retirement plan are invested by asset managers that rely heavily on proxy advisor guidance from groups like ISS or Glass Lewis. If votes prioritize ideology over returns, that could erode retirement savings.

“These decisions aren't just symbolic… they can shrink margins, hurt stock prices, and reduce the value of a teacher's pension or construction worker's 401(k),” said one GOP aide. 

Sen. Tim Scott (R‑SC), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, is spearheading oversight efforts in the Senate. In a letter to both firms in late May, Scott and nine Republican colleagues raised concerns that ISS and Glass Lewis are steering corporate votes based on ideology, not economics.

“Two foreign-owned companies hold a near-duopoly over proxy advisor services in the United States — influencing boardroom decisions, shareholder votes, and corporate strategy across the American economy, as well as a wide range of public policy on important issues,” Scott said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “They also routinely issue recommendations based on Left-wing politics over sound economic analysis.”

The real-world influence of these firms is well documented. A 2018 study of 713 major investors found that when ISS recommended voting for an executive pay package, 95 percent of them did. But when ISS opposed it, support dropped to just 68 percent. Similar shifts were seen in votes on stock plans, board seats, and efforts to replace company leadership. Glass Lewis also had a strong impact, when it backed a proposal during a leadership fight, support for that measure jumped by 64 percent.

One of the most striking examples of proxy advisor influence came in 2021 during a boardroom shake-up at ExxonMobil. A tiny activist firm called Engine No. 1, which owned just 0.02% of Exxon's shares, launched a campaign to push the oil giant toward more aggressive climate action by replacing three board members.

But, they didn't do it alone. Both ISS and Glass Lewis backed Engine No. 1's candidates, and some of the country's biggest investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard, and large pension funds, followed their lead. The result: three new directors and a major shift in Exxon's climate strategy.

A House Judiciary report later detailed how the proxy firms had aligned their recommendations with a climate activist network called Climate Action 100+, raising concerns that they were promoting a political agenda rather than offering neutral guidance.

Supporters of ESG and the proxy process argue that these firms play an important role in helping investors manage thousands of shareholder votes each year, offering independent research and recommendations. They also push back on claims of political bias, arguing that ESG investing, focused on long-term risks like climate change, board accountability, and data security, can be aligned with strong financial performance. ISS and Glass Lewis have said their guidance is based on established policies, not ideology, and that investors are free to vote however they choose. Both companies did not respond to requests for comment.

So far, federal regulators have taken a mixed approach. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced new rules in 2020 to boost transparency and allow companies to respond to proxy firm recommendations. But under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC rolled back those reforms in 2022. And a recent court ruling further restricted the agency's oversight, finding that proxy advice doesn't qualify as “solicitation” under federal law, limiting the SEC's authority to regulate it. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rep. Riley Moore (R‑WV), a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said lawmakers must remain aggressive in countering what he calls a “woke” investment agenda being quietly driven by foreign proxy firms.

“We need to stay vigilant against ESG, especially as proxy advisors turn more and more decisions over to foreign-owned management,” Moore told the Washington Examiner. He pointed to recent efforts by West Virginia and other states to pull public funds from ESG-focused investment strategies, but warned that “BlackRock and other private equity firms are dead set on keeping ESG, DEI, and other woke investing practices alive.” He called for stronger oversight from both Congress and federal regulators.

DOJ BACKS ANTITRUST LAWSUIT ACCUSING BLACKROCK AND OTHERS OF COLLUDING TO BOOST ESG

Legal and regulatory challenges are now mounting. Just last week, a federal judge in Texas allowed a major antitrust lawsuit to move forward against BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. The case alleges the firms coordinated to suppress coal production by aligning their votes through climate-focused investor alliances, a potential violation of federal competition law.

Separately, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is investigating ISS and Glass Lewis for allegedly misleading clients and concealing political motives behind their recommendations. 

In Congress, the House last year passed the Protecting Americans' Retirement Savings from Politics Act, which would require proxy advice and shareholder proposals to focus on financial outcomes, not ideological agendas. But the bill was never brought up in the Senate. Hill's committee has held multiple hearings on the issue and released a report titled “The Failure of ESG,” calling for major reforms to how proxy firms operate, and aides say more oversight efforts are likely in the months ahead.

“Our Committee looks forward to working with Chairman Paul Atkins and the Securities and Exchange Commission on proper oversight,” Hill added.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — CeeDee Lamb took a big hit and committed a penalty in the Dallas Cowboys' preseason opener — even though the star receiver wasn't playing.

A sprinting official ran straight into Lamb's back when the four-time Pro Bowl wideout wandered too close to the field during the second quarter of the Cowboys' 31-21 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday night, resulting in a 15-yard penalty to Dallas for making contact with an official.

Dressed in street clothes, Lamb was watching Joe Milton's deep pass to Jonathan Mingo and signaling to his teammates while standing in the white paint on the edge of the sideline. The official was tracking the play while he ran, and he didn't see Lamb before inadvertently delivering a big hit to Lamb's back, sending both men tumbling to the SoFi Stadium turf.

“It's a sideline interference,” referee Alex Moore told a pool reporter. “CeeDee Lamb was standing in the restricted white border area, which is our area to officiate the game. The official on the play was focused solely on doing his job and he ran into CeeDee Lamb, who was standing in that restricted area. That's what happened. And with that contact, it's an automatic foul.”

Lamb got up with no apparent ill effects, laughing about the collision with his teammates. Dallas was still whistled for the penalty, which took 15 yards off the Cowboys' 51-yard gain on Los Angeles defensive back Shaun Jolly's simultaneous pass interference on Mingo.

“Normally we don't have anybody standing that deep into the restricted area, or that type of forceful contact,” Moore said. “So it is a rare occurrence, but it does happen from time to time.”




Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer wasn't thrilled about Lamb's mistake, even though he knew it was an accident.

“Just like the pre-snap penalties, that penalty, we've got to be better with discipline,” Schottenheimer said. “I hope the guy's OK. I think he's OK, the official that he ran into, but we have to be better than that. CeeDee knows better. We know better.”

Lamb, Dak Prescott, George Pickens and most of the Cowboys' key players didn't participate in the preseason opener, nor did nearly all of the Rams' presumptive starters.

            Soccer superstar Mohamed Salah called out European football's governing body on Saturday for its limited statement after Palestinian footballer Suleiman Al-Obeid was killed in Gaza.
    


            The Egyptian Liverpool forward, the highest-profile Arab player in the game, pointedly noted that the post by UEFA made no reference to the circumstances of Al-Obeid's death.
    


            Al-Obeid, who during his playing days was part of the Palestinian national team, was killed by an Israeli strike targeting civilians waiting for aid in southern Gaza, according to the Palestine Football Association (PFA).
    


            “Farewell to Suleiman al-Obeid, the ‘Palestinian Pelé'. A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times,” wrote UEFA in a post on X.
    


            Salah responded to the post on Saturday: “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” His remark quickly gained traction online, with more than 840,000 likes by Saturday night.
    


            UEFA has not publicly commented further. CNN has contacted the Switzerland-based body for comment.
    


            Later on Saturday, the PFA shared a statement ﻿in Arabic that it said was sent from UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, expressing his condolences for Al-Obeid's death.
    


            Al-Obeid showed that “joy, talent, and pride can blossom despite suffering,” said the statement attributed to Ceferin. “His talent and dedication of the game gave the children of Gaza and beyond hope in a brighter tomorrow.”
    


Liverpool and Egypt star Mo Salah calls for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza ‘immediately'



            Al-Obeid was born in Gaza City and was 41 years old when he was killed, according to the PFA. He had scored more than 100 goals throughout his long career, it said.
    


            Salah, a four-time Premier League top-goalscorer, is one of the highest-profile footballers to speak out against the war in Gaza. He has previously called for humanitarian aid to be allowed into the enclave “immediately,” for world leaders to help end the fighting, and for the “massacres” to stop.
    


            According to the PFA, 325 members of its football community have been killed since the war began on October 7, 2023 – including players, managers, referees, coaches and other staff.
    


            The United Nations says more than 1,300 people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking food since late May, when a controversial new Israel- and US-backed aid group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, began operating. Of those, more than 800 have been killed near GHF sites, according to the UN.
    


            Currently 75% of all United Nations members recognize a sovereign Palestinian state, with more countries - including Britain, France and Canada - recently announcing plans to do the same. At the UN, Palestine is currently a non-member observer state of the UN General Assembly as the United States has consistently blocked full UN membership.
    


            As a football team though, Palestine has been recognized by the sport's world governing body FIFA since 1998. They have played in the last three Asian Cup tournaments, but have yet to qualify for the World Cup.

ATLANTA (AP) — Jen Pawol felt love and support from fans, family, peers and players as she made history as the first female umpire to work a regular-season game in the major leagues.

“It was amazing when we took the field,” Pawol said. “It seemed like quite a few people were clapping and calling my name. That was pretty intense and emotional.”

Pawol's much-anticipated debut came as the first base umpire for Saturday's first game of a split doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. It was a smooth debut.

“She did a good job,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “You can tell she knows what she does.”

Pawol said she had a group of about 30 friends and family members, including her father, at the game and she immediately identified a major difference of working in a major league stadium. Those familiar faces were not so easy to find at Truist Park.

“When I looked up they weren't in the lower tier like in the minor leagues,” Pawol said. “When I looked up it took me a while. Whoa, they're up there! I'll never forget that. That was just awesome.

“The dream actually came true today. I'm still living in it. I'm so grateful to my family and Major League Baseball for creating such an incredible work environment. … I'm just so thankful.”

Pawol's first real test came in the third inning of Atlanta's 7-1 win when she called Braves catcher Sean Murphy safe on a close play. Marlins manager Clayton McCullough did not challenge the call.




Pawol also showed she will make animated calls. When Miami's Xavier Edwards grounded into a double play in the third inning, Pawol pumped her fist and lifted her leg when she called Edwards out.

Pawol couldn't help but notice her debut was being watched closely. Fans responded with a warm ovation when the video board focused on the umpire between innings, forcing her to take a quick glance at her image.

Pawol worked third base in the second game of the doubleheader. She will be in the spotlight when she calls pitches behind the plate in Sunday's final game of the series. As a rover, she'll then be waiting for her next assignment.

While she waits, the umpire cap she wore in her first game will be on the way to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

“This is one of the proudest moments in all my career,” crew chief Chris Guccione said. “I've been blessed with working playoffs, I've worked two World Series, All-Star games, and this is right up there. It gives me chills even thinking about it. And the magnitude, it just hit me just now the magnitude of this thing and how hard she's worked.

“This is just a great role model for girls and women out there and I'm just so proud of her. This is a special moment. I'm so proud of her.”

There was much anticipation for her historic debut on Saturday. A crowd of photographers gathered while waiting for the umpires to walk onto the field from their entry ramp near the Marlins dugout.

McCullough and Braves bench coach Walt Weiss greeted Pawol when lineups were exchanged at home plate before the game. Pawol then jogged down the first base line. She shook hands with Marlins first base coach Tyler Smarslok before taking her position on the right field line for the first pitch.

Pawol said Thursday she was “overcome with emotion” when notified she would make her Major League Baseball debut this weekend.

Pawol, 48, has been working in the minor leagues since she was assigned to the Gulf Coast League in 2016. She was assigned the Triple-A championship game in 2023 and worked spring training games in 2024 and again this year.

“Anytime anybody grinds their way through the minor leagues, I don't care who it is, that's a tough thing,” Snitker said. “I'm happy for anybody who grinds it out.”

Asked if she is prepared for a confrontation with a manager upset about a call, including some known to kick dirt onto umpires, Pawol said it wouldn't be the first time.

“More than dozens of times,” she said. “It doesn't go very well for him. The night is usually over for him. It's just part of the game.”

Pawol, who is from New Jersey, had only a few days to prepare for Saturday's doubleheader. She said she was told of her long-awaited promotion during a Wednesday conference call with director of umpire development Rich Rieker and vice president of umpire operations Matt McKendry.

Pawol was a three-time all-conference softball selection pick at Hofstra. She worked as an NCAA softball umpire from 2010-16.




Pawol's rise to make MLB history came 28 years after the NBA gender barrier for game officials was broken and 10 years after the NFL hired its first full-time female official. The men's soccer World Cup first hired a female referee three years ago. The NHL has not had any women as on-ice officials.

Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley discusses his journey to becoming a Super Bowl champion and what's next.

The highly anticipated release of Madden NFL 26 appears to include a notable touchdown celebration that became a trend among some players last season.

San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers and others broke out in celebratory dances that emulated President Donald Trump after touchdowns and sacks in 2024. 

The upcoming version of the popular NFL-centric video game appears to show the virtual representation of Eagles running back Saquon Barkley doing his version of the dance.

During a Madden game between the Eagles and Washington Commanders, Jalen Hurts throws a pass to Barkley. An animated version of the All-Pro running back then sprints into the end zone for a touchdown before breaking out into the signature Trump dance.

Barkley and Trump have a connection. Earlier this year, Barkley visited the White House to commemorate the Eagles' Super Bowl championship. 

The day before the president hosted Barkley and his teammates on the South Lawn of the White House for a celebration ceremony, the star running back was spotted disembarking Marine One at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey.

Trump told reporters Barkley is a "nice guy" and joked he "wanted to race him." The president ultimately decided to skip the race.

Barkley later responded to some of the backlash to news of his outing with Trump making its rounds on social media.

"Some people are really upset cause I played golfed [sic] and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT," Barkley wrote on X. "Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand," Barkley wrote on X. "Just golfed with Obama not too long ago…and look forward to finishing my round with Trump ! Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day."

The White House's official X account shared a photo of Trump and Barkley inside the Oval Office. The picture features a screenshot of the running back's message to critics.

More recently, Barkley declined an invitation to be part of Trump's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition.

"A couple months ago, it was brought to my team about the council, so I'm not really too familiar with it," he said, according to NBC Philadelphia. "I felt like I'm gonna be super busy, so me and my family thought it was probably in the best interest to not accept that. 

"So, [I] was definitely a little shocked when my name was mentioned, but I'm assuming it's something great. I appreciate it but was a little shocked when my name was mentioned." 

Trump also named Bosa, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker to the council.

Goldie Chan knows how to put herself out there.

Chan, the founder and head of content for branding agency Warm Robots, is also an author, a frequent keynote speaker and a LinkedIn Top Voice.

Still, she describes herself as an introvert at heart — which presented a challenge in growing her career.

"I think a lot of people underestimate introverts in the workplace," she says.

According to Chan, building a personal brand was key to her success. Earlier in her career, Chan worked "completely behind the scenes" in various marketing and social media roles, she says.

In 2017, she began posting short videos about pop culture branding and marketing on LinkedIn, which was beta-testing its video feature at the time.

Becoming a content creator wasn't initially her plan: "I really thought, I'm just going to do this until I get my next full-time job," Chan recalls.

While in between roles, she posted over 800 consecutive daily videos — a pace she doesn't necessarily recommend "unless you never want to sleep again" — and quickly attracted a large audience.

Today, she has over 100,000 followers on LinkedIn, and that platform has helped her land new roles, obtain a book deal and share her expert advice as a Forbes contributor.

"I grew my own personal brand through a lot of consistency and hard work," she says.

Chan writes about how introverts can level up their careers in her upcoming book "Personal Branding for Introverts," which debuts in October.

Whether you know it or not, "everyone has a personal brand," Chan says.

If the idea of a personal brand sounds intimidating, just think of it as "something in your career that people know you for," whether that's your penchant for public speaking, affinity for colorful blazers or your humorous LinkedIn posts.

Developing a strong personal brand can help introverts bring their talents to the forefront and boost their careers, she says: "It allows you to shape the story that other people are telling about you."

Still sound scary? Chan hears that a lot.

"I've had so many introverts who have come up to me and said, 'I'm so terrified of growing my personal brand because I don't want to put myself out there,'" she says.

Chan herself used to feel the same way. To combat her social anxiety, she challenged herself to speak with a new person at her local coffee shop each day for a month.

Just one small, consistent action can help you break out of your comfort zone, she says.

If you're nervous about reaching out to professional connections, commit to sending one networking email a month, Chan says. Trying to grow an online presence? Post one update a week.

"The more you do it regularly, the easier it is to keep going," she says.

Keep in mind that your personal brand doesn't just exist online. According to Chan, participating in social events like hobby groups or networking meetups can also contribute to building your brand.

Your unique interests help set you apart, she says, and you might be surprised at the opportunities that arise.

"A personal brand is never created in isolation," Chan says. "Being involved in groups that interest you, even if they're not directly related to your career, can actually help with your career."

She describes personal brands as the "hub in the center of spokes."

"All these different spokes are all the different things that you do, and they all connect back to a central hub — so whatever small things you do are always going to help your overall personal brand," she says.

The rise of generative AI and large language models has drastically shifted the cybersecurity landscape, empowering attackers with easy-to-use tools that can create realistic video and voice deepfakes, personalized phishing campaigns, and malware and malicious code. 

That has opened the door for AI on the defense as well. As agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in the enterprise in areas like finance and legal, cybersecurity AI agents are on the rise, too, becoming a key asset for detection, analysis, and alerts. 

"It's a massive challenge to detect, contain, investigate and respond across larger companies," said Brian Murphy, CEO of cybersecurity technology company ReliaQuest. "AI is allowing us to remove a lot of that noise, that tier one or tier two work, that work that's often not at all relevant to something that could be threatening to an organization," Murphy said. 

Putting a tool in the hands of human workers that can automate otherwise menial tasks or time-consuming ones, freeing them to do more important work, has often been the pitch for agentic AI. 

In a message shared with Amazon employees in June, CEO Andy Jassy said "We have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live," adding that he sees a future with "billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field," helping workers "focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically" while also making "our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today." 

Murphy shares a similar view across cybersecurity, where he sees an industry of workers who are inundated with work they likely shouldn't be spending time on, causing more burnout and exacerbating the existing issue of a lack of available talent. 

He's also seen the way AI is being wielded to attack companies. "Those phishing emails, they used to look almost laughable with the misspellings and the fonts wrong," he said. "AI can take the average bad actor and make them better, and so the trick is if you're on the defensive side, they have to use AI because of the reality of what AI can do." 

ReliaQuest recently released what it calls GreyMatter Agentic Teammates, autonomous, role-based AI agents that can be used to take on tasks that detection engineers or threat intelligence researchers would otherwise accomplish on a security operations team. 

"Think of it as this persona that teams up with a human, and the human is prompting that agentic AI, so the human knows what to do," Murphy said, adding that it's like having a "teammate that takes that incident response analyst and multiplies their capability." 

Murphy gave an example that is a frequent occurrence for any security team at a global company: international executive travel. Every time a laptop or cell phone is connected to a network in, say, China, the security operations team would be alerted, and the security team would have to verify that the executive is abroad and is securely using their device each day of that trip. With an agentic AI teammate, that security person could automate that task, or even set up a series of similar processes for board meetings, off-sites, or other large team gatherings. 

"There's hundreds of things like that," he said. 

Justin Dellaportas, chief information and security officer at communications technology company Syniverse, said that while AI agents have been able to automate some of those basic cybersecurity tasks like combing through logs, it's also starting to be able to automate actions, like quarantining flagged emails and removing them from inboxes, or restricting access by a comprised account across a variety of logins.

"[AI] is being used by criminals to efficiently find vulnerabilities and exploits into organizations at scale, and all of that is resulting in them having a higher success rate, getting initial access sooner and moving laterally into an organization quicker than we've seen," he said. "Cyber defenders really need to lean into this technology now more than ever to stay ahead of this evolving threat landscape and the pace of cyber criminals."

Dellaportas said that while every company has a unique risk profile and tolerance when it comes to deploying different types of cybersecurity tools, he views the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity as stages of a "crawl, walk, run methodology."

"You roll this out, and it's going to reason and then take action, but then it's got to iterate through the actions that it's previously taken," he said. "I come back to a kind of trust but verify, and then as we get confidence in its effectiveness, we'll move on to different problems." 

While Dellaportas said AI agents can take over some tasks from human cybersecurity professionals in the future, he still sees the technology as an augmentation to make workers more effective, not as a replacement.

Murphy agrees, and said he does not see agentic AI taking the place of actual cybersecurity workers, but helping with tasks where automation is the better option while also addressing the skills gap that many organizations struggle with when filling cybersecurity roles. 

"There may be a shortage of trained and skilled cybersecurity professionals, but there's no shortage of people who would like to be trained and skilled at cybersecurity," he said. "The reason that knowledge transfer takes so long in cyber is that when you get your entry-level job, it's equivalent to working on a help desk." 

Murphy said he understands that there is still plenty of education needed when it comes to deploying agentic AI in any part of a business, as well as concerns about how decisions are made by AI. 

Dellaportas said what has helped is the fact that agentic AI is being used by all types of business lines, so discussions of how these AI tools can help accomplish objectives are not new ones.

AI agents are catching on inside companies. A May 2025 poll of 147 CIOs and IT function leaders by Gartner found that 24% had already deployed a few AI agents, with more than 50% of those AI agents working across functions like IT, HR and accounting, compared to just 23% of external customer facing functions.

Avivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst on Gartner's AI strategy team, said that in the cybersecurity space, companies experimenting with agentic AI are finding it "moderately beneficial," but there remain some questions as to the ability of these tools to scale beyond simpler tasks.

"Security has always been the low-hanging fruit use case for AI," Litan said. "You first saw AI show up with fraud detection, so it's 100% that we're going to have digital security assistance in the future doing work and freeing up staff to take on the new attacks; the key will be making sure they stay up with all this innovation so they can see the whole attack surface."

Murphy believes that corporate adoption and evolution of agentic AI in cybersecurity may occur even more quickly than in finance or legal. 

"They absolutely understand AI is being used against them, and the only way to defend that is to use it in their own defense," he said.

In the world of online payments, the buzzword these days is frictionless, as companies entice customers with increasingly convenient online payment options. Think the online equivalent of a biometric handwave: the fewer steps involved, the more customers will buy, experts say. With that aim in mind, the growing presence of generative AI such as ChatGPT in the shopping ecosystem may next take a shape that has a seismic impact on the economic model of internet retail.

Currently, a search for a large London Fog men's coat on ChatGPT will bring up a purchase option, but you still have to click over to London Fog's site to complete the transaction. But that may soon change.

Gen AI search engine Perplexity already has a deal with PayPal for this kind of function, allowing online shoppers to make purchases such as concert tickets and travel directly in chat, with payments completed with PayPal or Venmo, and PayPal handling the processing, shipping, tracking, and invoicing.

The Financial Times reported last month that an integrated checkout system is coming to ChatGPT, with partners such as Shopify, so that users can complete the transaction within the platform. Merchants will pay a commission to OpenAI. OpenAI and Shopify have not confirmed the plans. The AI company has already worked with Shopify on an AI assistant for internet sales.

OpenAI has already rolled out several features designed to enhance shopping and other consumer experiences, and experts say that in one form or another, this further use of gen AI in retail's future should be expected, and companies need to be planning for the consequences today.

"Enabling customers to purchase without leaving the chat will have a significant impact on the sales cycle," said Elizabeth Perkins, professor of practice of business administration and economics at Roanoke College. But she added that from a marketing perspective, any time you consolidate or eliminate a part of the purchase cycle, you get your customer that much closer to spending money. "No more time-consuming steps. Customers get what they want faster, with less hassle, and honestly, with less chance of changing their mind," Perkins said. 

Perikins says that payment interfaces like Venmo or Apple Pay could be disrupted. But Paul McAdam, J.D. Power's senior director of banking intelligence, says he thinks that while AI checkout capabilities will disrupt the checkout ecosystem, big players will find a way to stay in the game.

"This is one more competitor looking for a slice of the pie. It will be fascinating to see how banks react to this. There will be a shakeout," but he added, "PayPal, Apple, and Google are pretty entrenched, so I don't think they are going anywhere. This will affect the upstarts the most, some of which will probably get gobbled up by larger competitors."

At eBay, AI checkout is not being viewed as a threat, but as a sign of further innovation in the industry.

"AI is proving great at speeding up workflows and generating ideas. We believe the true magic lies in blending that speed and scale with trusted, expert, enthusiast communities," said Blair Ethington, vice president of the company's focus categories and buyer experience division.

Ethington says that eBay will be investing heavily in an increased AI experience at checkout that delivers real-time, hyper-personalized product picks and guidance tuned to each buyer's shopping preferences. "Ultimately, we believe our scale, unique inventory, and trusted community position us extremely well to thrive in an agentic commerce future," Ethington said.

PayPal pointed to its deal with Perplexity as a sign of its embrace of the gen AI feature rather than viewing it as a threat. "We're partnering with some of the biggest players in this space, like Perplexity, to deliver personalized, secure, and seamless payments and commerce experiences to our network of more than 400 million consumers and merchants worldwide," said a PayPal spokesperson.

In one form or another, the checkout experience online is ripe for change, according to Dee Waddell, global managing director of travel & transportation industries at IBM. "Consumers are no longer satisfied with the status quo," said Waddell, citing a recent IBM study that shows only 14% of consumers say they're satisfied with their e-commerce experience. "They're demanding seamless, hyper-personalized experiences across every touchpoint, and retailers must lean into AI to meet those expectations,"  Waddell said.

IBM's retail clients are prioritizing AI to deliver a seamless experience throughout the entire customer journey. "I believe we're on the cusp of a revolution, where generative AI platforms like ChatGPT will act as 'personal assistants' to streamline the digital shopping experience from product discovery to fulfillment,"  Waddell said.

The online shopping experience of the future could feature a consumer going into ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude to ask for gift ideas. Then, Waddell says, without ever leaving the chat, they'll receive personalized recommendations, confirm their payment method easily, verify their shipping address, and complete the purchase.  

"In this new model, the AI personal assistant becomes the marketplace. This means retailers will need to solidify their ecosystem and channel strategies,"  Waddell said, adding that companies will either need to partner with channel providers that want to work with generative AI companies or go directly to AI providers themselves. "This will be a key part of staying relevant and delivering the integrated shopping experiences that consumers are demanding," Waddell said.

Alex Graf, co-founder and CEO of digital commerce platform Spryker and author of "The E-Commerce Book," says this is the beginning of a seismic shift in how people will shop online. But he says the focus on the threat to payment processors misses the biggest disruptive outcome from the shift.

"We're witnessing a structural shift in the e-commerce value chain, and ChatGPT is right at the center of it. The old game was about who could close the sale. The new game is about who controls the pre-sale and gets the user's attention first," Graf said, adding that this is where the LLMs will disrupt the incumbents. Increasingly, Graf says, it will be ChatGPT and Claude that will guide discovery, curate choices, and compress decision-making for customers.

"For ecommerce players who've relied on 'watch time' to keep users browsing, like Amazon, Etsy, or even Shopify storefronts, this is an existential threat," Graf said.

"Users who previously started their search on e-commerce platforms are now starting with AI. And here's the kicker: selling the product isn't where the margin is anymore. It's selling the eyeballs,"  Graf said, noting that ads that appear inside ecommerce ecosystems have become a $50 billion market globally.

"Amazon's most profitable business isn't Prime or AWS, it's retail media," Graf said.

Amazon is investing heavily in its own generative AI features for shopping and has made significant investments in gen AI companies including Anthropic.

Graf says that when a gen AI like ChatGPT becomes the "new homepage" of commerce, it doesn't need to sell products directly.

"It just needs to own the watch time, then monetize via paid placements, affiliate links, and product recommendations, just like Amazon does internally. This re-routes billions in potential retail media revenue toward whoever owns that conversational layer,"  Graf said.

Amazon's ads business has been a bright spot within earnings in recent quarters.

Graf says fintech players like PayPal or Zelle, the online payment app run by a consortium of major banks, will be impacted, but indirectly. Once ChatGPT, or similar AI agents, corner end-to-end shopping, there's less space for third-party payment tools.

"Integrated systems or AI-native wallets may eat that slice of the pie over time," Graf said.

The ultimate winners, he says, will be those who can monetize attention and intention, not just transactions.

Like many Americans, I had always dreamed up moving to Europe. And in 2015, at 35, I decided to leave Texas for Spain.

Two years later, I founded She Hit Refresh, a community that helps women over 30 take the leap abroad. Since then, I've helped hundreds of women build new lives in countries like Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands.

The most popular destinations among the women I work with tend to have warm weather and flexible visa options. Spain and Portugal top the list because they're relatively affordable for Western Europe, enjoy a relaxed pace of life, and have residency pathways that don't require you to be independently wealthy or retired. 

One country that few Americans could probably find on a map, let alone consider moving to, is Albania. But that's changing. 

In recent years, I kept hearing about Albania from members of my community. A handful had moved there and couldn't stop raving about it. Intrigued, I spent a month in Albania in 2024, mainly in the capital, Tirana, and along the coast. I wanted to see what the buzz was about, and what I found truly surprised me.

Albania may not be for everyone — no place is — but for many Americans dreaming of a soft landing, it checks a lot of boxes. Here's why I consider it the No. 1 overlooked destination in Europe for those hoping to relocate from the U.S.:

Albania is one of the few places in Europe where you can still rent a comfortable apartment for under $500 a month, according to the women in my network. This low cost of living is one of the biggest reasons Americans are flocking there.

Take Cheryl Orlov, who moved from Redondo Beach, California, to Tirana. "Even though the cost of living is rising in Tirana, it's still a fraction of what I paid in California," she told me. Her rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Tirana, for example, is less than one sixth of what she'd been paying for a two-bedroom cottage in Redondo Beach before she left California in 2023.

Groceries, dining out, and healthcare are also much more affordable. For digital nomads and retirees alike, Albania offers a quality of life that's increasingly out of reach in many U.S. cities.

One of Albania's biggest advantages is that Americans can live there visa-free for up to 12 months, a rare benefit in Europe.

You can hop on a plane tonight and start your new life in Albania tomorrow, no paperwork required. This makes it ideal for those who want to "test drive" life abroad without navigating complex visa systems.

While in Tirana, I met with Denisa Kaca Bradley, founder of Expats in Albania, to learn more about immigration options. She explained that while staying beyond a year does require paperwork, it's possible and her organization helps newcomers with the process. 

At her weekly meetups, I met dozens of Americans: solo women, couples, and families. Many use Albania as a stepping stone. They stay for a year or two before moving on to another part of Europe once they've figured out the visa situation elsewhere. Others choose to stay long-term.

From the rugged Albanian Alps in the north to the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea in the west and the Ionian in the south, the country's landscape is breathtaking.

During my trip, I drove down the Albanian Riviera and visited Saranda, a lively seaside town with a beautiful promenade. It was September and the weather was still warm enough to swim and sunbathe, but the beaches were practically empty — a rare treat compared to places like Spain or Italy. On a clear day you can see Greece in the distance! The island of Corfu is just a 30-minute ferry ride away. 

I didn't make it to the northern mountains, but they're high on my list for next time. Remote villages, hiking trails, and gorgeous landscapes make it a dream for outdoor lovers.

Until the early 1990s, Albania was largely closed off to the world under a communist regime. Tourism has only really picked up in the last decade or so. As a result, Albania still feels authentically Albanian.

At the same time, Albanians are notably welcoming of Americans, something that surprised many expats I spoke with. The pro-America sentiment and friendliness to expats makes it easier for newcomers to feel at home and connect with the local community.

In cities like Tirana and coastal towns like Vlorë, there's also a growing number of foreigners putting down roots. Like Monica Miranda, an American who moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Vlorë at 43 with her dog. "I didn't know much about Albania," she told me. "But the moment I arrived, something clicked. One month turned into two." Monica has now lived in Albania for nearly two years and recently received her five-year residency card.

"I've built a supportive community of expats from the U.S., the U.K., Australia, and Latin America," she said. "We catch up a few times a week. It's been an incredibly grounding experience."

It may not be the first country that comes to mind, but for many Americans I've met, Albania has become the right place at the right time. 

Cepee Tabibian is the founder of She Hit Refresh, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad, and the author of "I'm Outta Here! An American's Ultimate Visa Guide to Living in Europe." As the daughter of Colombian and Iranian immigrants, Cepee grew up in Houston, Texas, before becoming an immigrant herself in Spain.

Maddy Lopez, a bartender in Los Angeles, has spent 25 years working in the restaurant industry, where tips can make up a significant portion of a worker's income. 

When she heard about President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill," which includes a section called "no tax on tips," she said her first reaction was: "It's a little too good to be true."

Lopez said that in her experience, tax breaks often seem to include "a catch," and she isn't sure the benefit will be as generous as some workers expect.

It's a reasonable question, experts say: Some key details of the provision — including which occupations and kinds of gratuities may qualify — are still unclear. There's also some confusion among workers about how the tax break works.

T. Cooper, a hair and makeup stylist in New York City, said that the measure is "being perceived incorrectly" among tipped workers she knows. 

"A lot of people don't understand that you will still have to pay the tax on tips," she said.

Both Republicans and Democrats floated the "no tax on tips" idea during the 2024 presidential campaign.

The "no tax on tips" provision in Trump's "big beautiful bill" provides a deduction worth up to $25,000. This tax break, which is available even if you don't itemize deductions, reduces taxable income.

The deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000. The law is also temporary; the tax break is available from 2025 through 2028.

However, "you're still likely paying state taxes" on tip income, and you'll owe payroll levies for Medicare and Social Security, said Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner with advisor platform Kitces.com, who analyzed the legislation.

Deductible tips must appear on information returns from your employer, such as Form W-2 or 1099. But the agency's reporting rules for tip income remain unclear, experts say. For example, questions remain about how employers need to report tips on Forms W-2 or 1099 to qualify for the deduction.

Currently, workers who make $20 or more per month in tips must report those earnings to employers, according to the IRS. Tips can include cash directly paid by customers, payouts from tip-sharing structures among employees and credit card payments.

The IRS is expected to clarify which occupations qualify for the tax break in early October, per the agency.

According to the provision, "qualified tips" include cash or gratuity paid by credit card, as well as earnings from a sharing arrangement.

But it also says tips must be paid voluntarily by the customer. That puts automatic service charges — like mandatory gratuity charges restaurants impose on larger parties — in question, experts say.

Adding to the reporting confusion, it's not unusual for those kinds of mandatory gratuities to mix with other tip income and simply appear as tips on tax forms, Lopez, the bartender, said of her experience. 

In some industries, tipping has decreased as consumer sentiment declines. During the second quarter of 2025, the average tip across restaurants, cafes and bars was at 14.99%, down from 15.17% the prior quarter, according to a new report by Square, a technology services company.

"As consumer confidence in the economy shifts and tips fall, workers are taking home less," Ming-Tai Huh, head of food and beverage at Square, wrote in the report.

Some consumers are also experiencing "tipping fatigue." About 41% of Americans said that "tipping is out of control" in 2025, up from 25% last year, according to a Bankrate report.

Some workers say higher service costs and reduced consumer spending have contributed to these tipping trends.

In the hair industry, prices typically rise every year as the cost of materials, rent and services go up, said Cooper. 

"So it's not that people have an issue with tipping," she said. "The service overall has just become way more expensive."

In restaurants and bars, it's not unusual to see smaller checks these days, Lopez said, which makes your tip average decline.

For example, previously, a $200 tab could earn $40 in tips. But nowadays, a typical tab could be $100, she said, and "you're only making $20 on the same guest."

Liu Jianchao, a senior Chinese diplomat widely seen as a potential future foreign minister, has been taken away by authorities for questioning, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Liu was taken away after returning to Beijing in late July from an overseas work trip, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party International Liaison Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Liu, 61, has led the Communist Party's body in charge of managing ties with foreign political parties. Since taking the role in 2022, he has travelled to more than 20 nations and met officials from more than 160 countries.

Liu's busy schedule, especially his meetings with the former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, stoked expectations that the former ambassador and ministry spokesman was being groomed to be the next foreign minister.

His detention marks the highest-level probe involving a diplomat since China ousted its former foreign minister and President Xi Jinping's protégé, Qin Gang, in 2023 following rumors of an extramarital affair.

Born in the northeastern province of Jilin, Liu majored in English at Beijing Foreign Studies University and studied international relations at Oxford before taking up his first post as a translator with the foreign ministry.

He has served in China's mission to Britain and later as ambassador to Indonesia and the Philippines.

During his time as ministry spokesman, he was known for humorous off-the-cuff comments while making a no-nonsense defense of China's interests.

China wants the United States to ease export controls on chips critical for artificial intelligence as part of a trade deal before a possible summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

Chinese officials have told experts in Washington that Beijing wants the Trump administration to relax export restrictions on high-bandwidth memory chips, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.

The White House, State Department and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.

HBM chips, which help perform data-intensive AI tasks quickly, are closely watched by investors due to their use alongside AI graphic processors, particularly Nvidia's.

The FT said China is concerned because the U.S. HBM controls hamper the ability of Chinese companies such as Huawei to develop their own AI chips.

Successive U.S. administrations have curbed exports of advanced chips to China, looking to stymie Beijing's AI and defense development.

While this has impacted U.S. firms' ability to fully address booming demand from China, one of the world's largest semiconductor markets, it still remains an important revenue driver for American chipmakers.

- Peter Schiff, Euro Pacific Capital's chief economist, urges investors to exit Ethereum for Bitcoin, citing Bitcoin's 59.1% dominance and stability as digital gold.

- He dismisses Ethereum's recent $4,200 rally and ETF inflows as temporary "bear market" rebounds, noting its weakening price ratio against Bitcoin.

- Schiff argues Ethereum is losing its foundational role for decentralized apps despite DeFi growth, while Bitcoin attracts institutional inflows despite structural limitations.

- His Bitcoin preference stems from perceived long-term resilience, not technology, sparking renewed debate between Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum innovators.

Peter Schiff, the economist and chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, has reiterated his call for investors to divest Ethereum in favor of Bitcoin, despite Ethereum's recent price rally [1]. In his latest comments, Schiff argued that while Ethereum has shown signs of strength, its long-term prospects remain uncertain, and Bitcoin continues to serve as the preferred digital asset for its role as a store of value [1].

Schiff highlighted that Ethereum's recent gains, including a price rise above $4,200 and inflows into Ethereum ETFs exceeding $404 million, do not necessarily indicate a sustainable bullish trend [1]. He described Ethereum's rally as a typical “bear market rally,” suggesting that the upward movement could be short-lived amid broader market weakness [1]. According to Schiff, the Ethereum to Bitcoin price ratio has moved lower, reinforcing his view that Ethereum is weakening against Bitcoin in the short term [1].

While Ethereum has gained traction in the smart contract and DeFi spaces, Schiff contends that it is losing its original use case, which was to serve as a foundational platform for decentralized applications [1]. By contrast, Bitcoin, despite its structural limitations, remains the dominant asset in the digital gold narrative and continues to attract institutional inflows [1]. The Bitcoin dominance index currently stands at approximately 59.1%, a decline from its peak but still significantly higher than Ethereum's 13% market share [1].

Schiff emphasized that his preference for Bitcoin does not stem from a belief in the technology itself, but rather from its perceived stability and long-term resilience [1]. He acknowledged that both assets have flaws, but argued that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage and growing acceptance by institutional investors make it a safer bet in the current environment [1].

Despite the growing enthusiasm for Ethereum's technological advancements, including its transition to a proof-of-stake model, Schiff remains skeptical about its ability to maintain dominance. He urged investors to avoid the speculative nature of Ethereum and instead focus on Bitcoin, which he views as the more reliable asset in the crypto market [1].

His comments have reignited the ongoing debate between Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum supporters, with some emphasizing innovation and utility while others prioritize stability and long-term value [1]. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Schiff's contrarian stance reflects the broader uncertainty surrounding the future of digital assets in a volatile and rapidly changing financial landscape [1].

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Altcoin Sherpa identifies nine altcoins (PENGU, ENA, LINK, etc.) poised to outperform the crypto market this month.

- PENGU nears $0.0433 resistance, while ENA surges 40% and targets $1.3-$1.5 if bullish momentum continues.

- Chainlink (LINK) remains a DeFi cornerstone, with $23-$30 price targets signaling potential cyclical peaks.

- Market diversification reflects growing institutional interest in altcoins with strong fundamentals and innovative use cases.

The cryptocurrency market continues to diversify as investors increasingly look beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins with strong technical performance and compelling narratives. A pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa has identified nine altcoins expected to outperform the broader market this month. These include ENA, PENGU, HOME, AERO, DOLO, LINK, IP, PUMP, and PENDLE. The selection is based on recent price action, market volume, and projected momentum, suggesting a pattern similar to the 2023 “Mag 7” stocks' impact on traditional markets [1].

Among the highlighted altcoins, PENGU is showing signs of upward movement, rebounding from a $0.0330 floor and approaching a key resistance level at $0.0433. A breakout above this level could lead to a test of $0.04687 and potentially new all-time highs beyond $0.0689, assuming bullish momentum continues [1].

ENA has also seen a notable surge, rising over 40% in three days and encountering resistance at $0.804. A successful push above this level could accelerate its rally toward $1.3 and $1.5, signaling broader altcoin market strength [1].

Chainlink (LINK) remains a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, particularly for its oracle solutions. With price levels above $19.3 maintaining stability, the $23 to $24.7 range represents key targets for near-term gains. A move into the $27–$30 zone could indicate a cyclical peak [1].

PUMP, a Solana-based meme coin, is navigating a post-downturn scenario. After a challenging year marked by significant losses, the token is now testing support at $0.03, with a potential recovery path to its pre-sale price of $0.04. A sustained close above $0.035 could signal the start of a genuine rally [1].

The current market environment is shaped by a mix of speculative momentum and growing institutional interest. As investors seek high-growth opportunities, altcoins with robust fundamentals and clear use cases are attracting attention. While the performance of these coins remains speculative, they reflect broader trends of innovation and adoption in the crypto space [1].

						Competing visions for digital currency regulation reveal broader financial ambitions.
					

Stablecoins have opened a new field in the rivalry between China and the United States. This is a type of cryptocurrency that can maintain a fixed value by being pegged to other assets such as Bitcoin, or the US dollar, or the Chinese renminbi.

In Hong Kong and Washington, bills to regulate stablecoins have recently become law. Hong Kong is attempting to reestablish a position in the global financial world by setting up an economic hub for stablecoins and other ventures in what is known as “Web3”, the next generation of the internet based on decentralisation and blockchain technology. Meanwhile the Trump administration is heavily involved with cryptocurrencies, bolstered by the support of “crypto bros” who funded President Donald Trump's campaign.

Stablecoins could have far reaching consequences for the two economies, while also reshaping global finance.

The Stablecoins Bill, passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council in May, is a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to regulate stablecoins that are pegged to traditional currencies. The Hong Kong stablecoin bill adds to Beijing's efforts to create an alternative to the US-dominated economic order. Alongside the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), plans for BRICS Pay, the digital renminbi and the growing use of the renminbi for international transactions, Hong Kong stablecoins present another avenue for China to conduct international trade outside of the dominance of the US dollar.

Promoters of cryptocurrency have long been convinced of its capacity to change the world.

China appears keen to keep government-backed stablecoins in Hong Kong, while ensuring that stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies are kept outside of the mainland. Although not officially banned by the central government, Stablecoins and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are heavily restricted in mainland China. Beijing plans to ensure central financial control for digital currency, urging its citizens to use the digital renminbi instead of decentralised digital assets.

But Hong Kong has been allowed to enter the stablecoin market. After the 2019 protests and the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has been intent on restoring Hong Kong's place as a global financial hub. The stablecoins bill is a part of that effort to entice foreign banking organisations to return to Hong Kong. The city will once again become another gateway for China, this time for Web3 and cryptocurrencies. While within the mainland crypto will remain suppressed, it will likely bloom in Hong Kong, allowing China to trade with them internationally. Domestic markets will be free from its volatility and anarchic nature.

Last month, Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) into law. This bill similarly aims to create a “comprehensive regulatory framework” for stablecoins. It requires stablecoins to be pegged to the US dollar or other low risk assets, to be registered with regulators, and ensure that they meet audit requirements. The GENIUS act seeks to maintain the supremacy of the US dollar in the ever-growing world of digital payments. Stablecoins are seen as more than just an investment but as a form of payment, with those pegged to the US dollar already rising in use, even in China's fintech sector.

The question, however, is how much the US tilt to stablecoins can truly be seen as the American government advancing the interests of the country versus how much of it is about advancing the interests of Trump and his close allies? A pillar of Trump's support in his 2024 campaign was the “crypto-bros,” tech investors and executives with portfolios heavily based on cryptocurrencies and their connecting technologies. These figures, including Elon Musk, supported Donald Trump on the hope that he would in turn pass favourable legislation. The GENIUS act sees those hopes coming to fruition.

Trump's actions have fostered doubts. His “$Trump” meme coin, launched three days before his inauguration, rose some 300% over the initial price, before dropping by half. The people behind the $trump coin (including Trump) reportedly made an estimated US$100 million in trading fees. It appeared to be a rug pull, where developers of a coin abandon the coin after making initial profits, leaving buyers with a useless asset. The GENIUS Act could see such schemes proliferate.

Promoters of cryptocurrency have long been convinced of its capacity to change the world. As the new forms of digital currency become more like real world currency, with underlying regulations and stability, its integration into the global financial order will increase. Stablecoins are another step. But the dangers of crypto remain.

Ethereum price today surged past $4,300 for the first time since December 2021, fueled by record institutional inflows, strong technical momentum, and renewed optimism around staking-inclusive ETFs.

The rally has analysts debating whether this could be the launchpad for a historic push toward $12,000.

Ethereum (ETH) has climbed over 19% in the past week, liquidating more than $200 million in leveraged short positions. In the last 24 hours alone, ETH gained 7.5%, briefly trading above $4,300 before consolidating near $4,250.

This surge has outpaced Bitcoin's 3% weekly increase, widening ETH's market dominance and pushing the total crypto market capitalization closer to $4 trillion. Popular on-chain analyst Tracer told followers on X that Ethereum is “about to break 4-year resistance” and that “$12,000 is not just a dream anymore.

The latest rally is being driven by large-scale buying from both institutional investors and whales. Data from The Boss shows that SharpLink Gaming increased its ETH holdings to $2.12 billion after a major purchase on August 8.

Whale activity has intensified, with a notable $40.5 million over-the-counter acquisition of 10,400 ETH in recent days. Standard Chartered's Geoffrey Kendrick predicts that corporate treasuries could eventually hold 10% of Ethereum's total supply — a shift that could rival the impact of spot ETFs.

Spot ETH ETFs themselves are enjoying unprecedented demand, posting twelve consecutive weeks of inflows totaling over $5 billion in July. On August 9 alone, ETH ETF inflows hit $461 million, according to analyst Ted.

From a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum has cleared multiple resistance levels. After rebounding from strong support at $3,470, ETH broke above the $4,193 Fibonacci 1.618 extension — a level often associated with accelerated price moves.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.8, just below overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. The “three white soldiers” candlestick pattern since August 5 signals persistent buying pressure, while the MACD remains strongly positive.

Key short-term price levels to watch:

Improving regulatory sentiment has also boosted Ethereum's outlook. The SEC recently clarified that liquid staking does not violate securities laws, paving the way for potential staking-inclusive ETH ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise.

At the ecosystem level, Ethereum Layer 2 growth continues to accelerate, with rising transaction volumes on Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. These scalability solutions are attracting new DeFi projects and NFT marketplaces, adding fresh demand for ETH.

While some analysts warn of potential retracement after such a rapid climb, the overall sentiment remains bullish. On-chain trends, ETF momentum, and macro breakout patterns all point toward continued gains.

Analyst Rekt Capital estimates Ethereum is only “50–60% through its macro uptrend,” leaving plenty of room for upside. If current momentum holds, ETH could challenge its all-time high of $4,868 in the coming weeks and potentially target $5,000 — with the more ambitious $12,000 forecast no longer seeming out of reach.

JPMorgan remains bullish on U.S. stocks even as some observers warn that the economy is beginning to pay the price for President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The investment banking giant forecasts that the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, will yield a "high single-digit return over the next 12 months," driven by three key factors.

One of the main reasons for optimism is that markets don't care about signs of an economic slowdown. Instead, traders are focused on resilient corporate earnings and the subsequent economic recovery.

Since President Trump fired the first tariff salvo on April 2, economists have downgraded full-year U.S. growth forecasts from 2.3% to 1.5%. Still, the S&P 500 has gained over 28% in the four months. The index has held steady despite recent economic data revealing softness in the labour market and consumption, as well as stickiness in manufacturing and service sector inflation.

While the macro analysts' warning is concerning and likely playing out in the background, corporate earnings in the U.S. are ignoring the slowdown risks, at least in the short term, making it the second catalyst for JPMorgan's bullish thesis.

Over 80% of S&P 500 companies have recently reported their Q2 earnings, with 82% surpassing earnings expectations and 79% beating revenue forecasts—the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2021.

According to JPMorgan, while Wall Street analysts initially projected earnings growth below 5%, the index is now on pace for an impressive 11% growth rate. This robust showing supports the ongoing bullish trend in the stock market.

"The full-year earnings expectations for both this year and next have already started to turn higher," analysts at JPMorgan's wealth management said in a market note on Friday, adding that the market is increasingly differentiating between the winners and losers of the Trump trade war.

Additionally, the market is now figuring out and pricing in which companies are getting hit most by U.S. tariffs. So far, it looks like mega corporations will be just fine. This could bolster the case for further positive sentiment in the markets.

JPMorgan analysts explained that consumer-facing and smaller companies with restrained bargaining power against their trading partners and rigid supply chains are facing a stagnant earnings outlook.

This ties to JPMorgan's last catalyst: Trump's tariff bark is proving worse than its bite for large firms, which are managing to secure exemptions and even turn the tariff policies, aimed at sparking a manufacturing boom, into a tailwind.

"The latest example is President Donald Trump's suggestion that imported semiconductors would be taxed at a 100% rate unless the companies commit to relocating production to the United States. Another sign? Apple products are exempted from the latest tariff rates on Indian goods. Indeed, the company also announced an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing facilities. The stock gained almost 9% this week. Tariffs are not happening in a vacuum," analysts explained.

Big firms gain an additional advantage from the One Big Beautiful Act (OBBA), under which firms can claim 100% bonus depreciation for purchases of qualified business property and immediate expense of domestic research and development costs. According to some analysts, the depreciation policy could increase free cash flow for some by over 30%, which could incentivize more investment.

The bank added that its investment strategy remains focused on large-cap equities, particularly in the technology, financials, and utilities sectors, which it believes are best positioned to navigate this new economic environment.

JPMorgan's positive outlook for stocks could bode well for cryptocurrencies, as both tend to move in tandem. The digital assets market has plenty going on for itself, with the Trump administration appointing pro-crypto officials to key regulatory positions.

Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that liquid staking, under certain conditions, falls outside the purview of Securities Law. The ruling has raised hopes for staking spot ether ETFs winning regulatory approval.

Ether has rallied over 13% to over $4,200, reaching levels last seen in 2021. Prices surged nearly 50% last month, CoinDesk data show.

 Ethereum bulls make a strong case for an ETH price rally toward $10,000 or above in the next six to eight months. 

Key takeaways:

Ethereum is breaking out across multiple bullish setups on the price chart.

Analysts see ETH rising to $6,000 soon, with $20,000 possible within a year.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has surged roughly 24% this week to above $4,330, its highest price since December 2021. Many analysts now eye a break above the record $4,950 level next.

Ethereum is showing signals of breaking out of its prevailing Wyckoff Accumulation pattern, according to analyst Lord Hawkins.

The ETH/USD pair has been trading inside a large accumulation range for months, steadily absorbing selling pressure. This phase often ends with a decisive breakout once buyers gain control, according to Wyckoff theory.

That breakout appears to be underway, with ETH pushing above the $4,200 resistance zone, a stage known as the “Sign of Strength” (SOS). 

In Wyckoff's model, this is typically followed by a brief pullback, or “Last Point of Support” (LPS), to confirm the new uptrend.

If the LPS holds, price enters the markup phase, where gains accelerate as demand overwhelms supply. Measuring the height of the accumulation range gives a technical target near $6,000.

As of Sunday, ETH was breaking above the upper trendline of its multi-year symmetrical triangle, located in the $4,000–$4,200 zone, according to analysts Crypto Rover and Titan of Crypto.

The breakout suggests a potential measured move equal to the triangle's maximum height, pointing toward the $8,000 region in the coming months. That is up by over 90% from the current price levels.

Historically, such long-term breakouts on ETH's higher timeframes have preceded strong multimonth rallies, especially when confirmed by increasing volume and favorable macro sentiment.

In April 2020, ETH broke out of a symmetrical triangle, surging more than 950% to hit its projected target, and climbing even higher as bullish sentiment intensified.

Ethereum may be on track for a run toward $20,000 within 6-8 months from now, if historical price fractals play out. 

Analyst Nilesh Verma highlights the repeating pattern, where ETH rallies sharply after retesting a major bottom support.

In January 2017 and April 2020, such retests preceded parabolic uptrends, delivering gains of over 8,000% and 950%, respectively. Both moves lasted roughly 12 months before topping out.

ETH repeated the same “bottom retest” setup in April 2025, bouncing strongly from the $1,750–$1,850 zone. A sustained rally could unfold through April 2026, with the fractal's measured move targeting “$10,000 minimum” and $20,000 in the best-case scenario.

BlackRock has made bold moves into bitcoin and ether ETFs, but on Friday, the asset manager said it had no immediate plans to file for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), dashing the community's hopes that its entry could help extend XRP's 2025 rally.

This statement — made the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs jointly asked an appeals court to dismiss their respective appeals, signaling an end to their nearly five-year legal battle — has left investors questioning why BlackRock remains on the sidelines. 

While several asset managers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for XRP ETFs since late 2024, BlackRock's absence is notable, especially given its dominance in the bitcoin and ether ETF markets. 

Here are five reasons why BlackRock appears in no hurry to launch a spot XRP ETF, despite the XRP community's anticipation of a demand-driven price surge.

First, BlackRock has cited limited client interest in cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH. Back in March 2024, Robert Mitchnick, the asset manager's head of digital assets, said that there's a misconception that BlackRock will have a "long tail" of other crypto services.

"I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit ethereum," he said during a fireside chat at the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22.

Second, BlackRock's strategic caution around regulatory uncertainty plays a role. 

Although XRP sales on public exchanges are deemed non-securities, the broader regulatory framework for altcoins remains murky. BlackRock may be waiting for clearer SEC guidelines before entering the altcoin ETF space. 

The firm's conservative approach contrasts with competitors like ProShares, which filed for a spot XRP ETF in January 2025 alongside leveraged and futures-based XRP ETFs, the latter tracking XRP futures contracts rather than the token's spot price.

Third, BlackRock may see diminishing returns in pursuing a spot XRP ETF given the crowded field. As of August 2025, at least seven firms, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares, have a pending spot XRP ETF application.

Fourth, the XRP community's expectations of a price surge may not align with BlackRock's data-driven strategy. Polymarket odds for the SEC approving a spot XTP ETF in 2025 stand at 77%. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and Solana shows blockchain interest, but XRP's smaller market footprint may not justify the operational costs of a new ETF.

Finally, BlackRock's global perspective prioritizes markets where XRP demand is less pronounced. While the XRP community, active on platforms like X, anticipates a spot ETF driving demand, much of XRP's trading volume comes from Asia, where BlackRock's ETF presence is less dominant.

At press time, XRP was trading around $3.1852, down 3.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Altcoins outperform Bitcoin as crypto market shifts toward utility-driven projects, with 80% showing sustained growth over a month.

- Coinbase's BASE Layer 2 solution surges 9000% in TVL to $4.5B, driven by low fees ($0.005) and 10M+ transactions processed.

- Ethereum's ability to maintain $4,100+ price level is critical for altcoin momentum, with risks of market correction if benchmarks fail.

- Market maturation prioritizes fundamentals over hype, as investors focus on liquidity, network usage, and real-world infrastructure adoption.

The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a notable shift as altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin, signaling a potential turning point in the broader digital asset landscape. This trend has sparked renewed investor interest, particularly in projects demonstrating strong fundamentals and use-case driven growth. With Bitcoin stabilizing above $118,500, altcoins, especially those with real-world utility, are capturing market attention.

Historically, altcoin surges have typically been short-lived, with most not sustaining momentum for more than a few weeks. However, recent data suggests a more prolonged rally. Over the last month, approximately 80% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, a rare occurrence in the current cycle. Analysts at DaanCrypto observe that this rally is distinct from previous ones dominated by meme coins. Instead, it appears driven by stronger capital inflows into major cryptocurrencies, particularly through treasury tools, which could indicate a more sustainable trend [1].

One of the standout performers in this environment is BASE, the Layer 2 solution developed by Coinbase. BASE has gained traction due to its speed and low transaction fees, making it an attractive option for developers and users. Since its launch two years ago, the network has served over a million active users and processed nearly ten million transactions. Its total value locked (TVL) has grown to $4.5 billion, marking a staggering 9000% increase in one year. The average transaction fee of $0.005 further enhances its appeal, especially for high-volume applications [1].

Despite these positive developments, the sustainability of the rally remains conditional. For Ethereum to maintain its position in the bullish trend, it must hold above $4,100 and potentially break its all-time high. Failure to do so could undermine the broader altcoin momentum and result in a market correction. This dynamic highlights the delicate balance between altcoin growth and the performance of leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The current shift in the crypto market underscores a broader transition from hype-driven investments to projects with real-world utility and infrastructure. While Bitcoin remains the dominant asset, the rise of altcoins indicates a maturing market where innovation and performance are increasingly valued. As the market continues to evolve, investors are likely to pay closer attention to altcoin fundamentals, liquidity, and network usage rather than speculative narratives.

 Bitcoin traders are getting excited over a huge short squeeze as BTC price predictions include a return to all-time highs. 

Key points:

Bitcoin tags new August highs as traders see BTC shorts getting punished.

An early retracement could well turn into a trip to $120,000, predictions say.

A CME gap at $116,500 is of interest as a possible next local low.

Bitcoin (BTC) neared $119,000 into Sunday's “decisive” weekly close as traders expected a strong week.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $118,760 on Bitstamp, marking new August highs.

“Out-of-hours” weekend trading saw heightened liquidations, with the 24-hour crypto total at $350 million, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.

Commenting on market structure, crypto forecasts favored further progress into the new week.

“BTC is on the cusp of a reclaiming ~$117200 back into support,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital wrote in his latest X post about the weekly chart.

Popular trader BitBull said that while weekend price moves can typically reverse as TradFi markets reopen, there was hope for new all-time highs next.

“Just a 10% upward move will cause $18B+ in short liquidations and big money is probably watching it,” he suggested about liquidity conditions. 

An accompanying chart compared BTC/USD now to previous bull markets to support the breakout thesis.

Fellow trader Merlijn agreed on the $120,000 target based on a potential short squeeze.

Considering where the next BTC price dip might reverse, meanwhile, crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows suggested that price action would continue to coincide with “gaps” in CME Group's Bitcoin futures market.

“There's a CME gap around $116.5K, which will most likely be filled,” he summarized in part of an X post. 

Trader Daan Crypto Trades nonetheless described the weekend's moves as “choppy” rather than trending.

“Most focus is on $ETH breaking its cycle highs and alts making all kind of moves,” he argued, referring to the largest altcoin Ether (ETH), which hit multiyear highs.

 Despite Trump's pro-crypto stance, Unicoin CEO says US banks continue closing accounts for crypto firms under “Operation Chokepoint.” 

Crypto firms have been facing account closures and denials of banking services for years under the label of de-risking. Many in the crypto industry believe that the debanking represents a policy-driven effort to suppress digital assets, referred to as “Operation ChokePoint 2.0.”

After President Donald Trump's pro-crypto team won the election, many believed the era of debanking was over. His campaign rhetoric and early policy moves signaled a friendlier environment for digital assets, leading some to expect banks would ease restrictions on crypto clients.

However, recent incidents suggest the practice remains entrenched. Last week, Andreessen Horowitz partner Alex Rampell warned that big banks are squeezing fintech and crypto apps in “Operation Chokepoint 3.0,” by hiking fees to access account data or transfer funds to platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood.

Echoing these concerns, Alex Konanykhin, CEO of Unicoin, told Cointelegraph that US banks are continuing to close accounts for crypto firms without explanation, despite growing political pressure to end the practice.

“We know about it first-hand, as Unicoin and its subsidiaries have been de-banked, without explanations, by several banks,” Konanykhin said. He listed five banks that have cut ties with Unicoin or its subsidiaries over the past years, including Citibank, Chase, Wells Fargo, City National Bank of Florida and TD Bank.

A spokesperson for Chase declined to comment on a specific comment. “We welcome the direction of the Trump Administration to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and modernize anti-money laundering regulations,” they added. 

Cointelegraph reached out to all these banks for comment.

Konanykhin claimed that Unicoin was debanked by four banks this year alone, which “suggests that Chokepoint is a large-scale nationwide operation.” Unicoin is a publicly reporting corporation with six years of audited financials and over 4,000 shareholders.

Konanykhin added the debanking campaign has created “highly disruptive and damaging” conditions for crypto companies in the US, depriving them of access to basic financial services and “suppressing the American crypto industry.”

On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that President Trump will sign an executive order directing federal bank regulators to identify and penalize financial institutions that have engaged in debanking.

The order will reportedly require regulators to review complaint data, while banks overseen by the Small Business Administration must work to reinstate clients who were unlawfully denied services.

Konanykhin expressed hope that President Donald Trump's proposed executive order to curb debanking could bring relief. “The President knows the pain of de-banking first-hand and seems determined to stop this form of economic warfare against American businesses,” he said.

He said ending debanking could help US crypto reclaim global leadership. “Ending the War on Crypto will boost the American crypto industry. It may become as impactful internationally as Hollywood is in entertainment or Silicon Valley in IT,” he noted.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth Blickley, a partner at Fox Rothschild's Tax Controversy & Litigation Practice, said that while Trump has directed agencies and Congress to review how crypto can be integrated into mainstream finance, meaningful change will depend on the final wording of regulations and laws.

She pointed to the recently signed Genius Act, which gives the Federal Reserve's Stablecoin Certification Review Committee 180 days to design a regulatory framework.

Blickley warned that most bills in Congress never make it out of committee and that any eventual legislation will likely face litigation from both sides of the regulatory debate. “A regulation may facially comply with the President's request or a law passed, yet have little application or disproportionate impacts based solely on word-choice,” she said.

For now, Blickley said, banks are likely to continue their risk-averse stance toward crypto until new rules clearly reduce perceived risks. “It's all about making risk-averse entities and people feel like crypto is less of a risk,” she concluded.

                            Chamath Palihapitiya believes putting America's jobs data on the blockchain would have prevented the drama from the recent employment report. | Credit: Getty Images.                        

When the U.S. government revealed that June's strong jobs report had been revised into the red, wiping out hundreds of thousands of positions from the official tally, financial markets reeled.

The fallout led to President Trump dramatically firing  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner last week, accusing Erika McEntarfer of “rigging” the data.

Meanwhile, billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya entered the conversation with an idea that he felt could have prevented all of the drama: putting America's jobs data on the blockchain.

The BLS initially reported that the U.S. added approximately 147,000 non-farm jobs in June, massively surpassing expectations.

However, just two months later, that figure was slashed  to a mere 14,000 after unprecedented downward revisions totaling approximately 258,000 jobs across May and June, the steepest two-month drop since the non-pandemic era began in 1979.

The revised data revealed only 73,000 new jobs in July, signaling that the labor market's resilience was perhaps an illusion.

These seismic corrections caught economists and experts off guard and triggered a new feud  between Trump and yet another government agency.

“We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

“I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.”

“Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate; they can't be manipulated for political purposes.”

As the jobs-data controversy swirled, billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya argued that the U.S. needed a wholesale rebuild of how employment numbers are collected and reported.

Palihapitiya took to X, claiming  that the BLS system was “brittle” and “sloppy,” and called for a new “oracle-like data provider” for this critical information.

“Bottom line is that BLS isn't so much conspiratorial as it is inadequate in its approach,” he wrote on X. “They are all over the place and add little directional signal. They constantly revise and in both directions.”

“The sampling techniques they use are brittle and don't work for a large and dynamic economy like the U.S.,” he added.

Palihapitiya said Trump was right to fire the head of the BLS because “she ran a critical aspect of the U.S. economic machinery in an unpredictable, haphazard, and sloppy way.”

“There needs to be a new, oracle-like data provider for this critical information,” he added.

Did you even read what you wrote ? “Oracle like data provider “.   Are you suggesting a crypto like oracle that outputs employment data, every month, on the same day , be REQUIRED FOR EVERY BUSINESS ? 

Who is gonna pay for the implementations?

And of course there are gov… https://t.co/FP1JQVsP1D 

— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 2, 2025 



However, not everyone was convinced this was the answer. Famed investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban fired back at the idea:

“Did you even read what you wrote? Are you suggesting a crypto-like oracle that outputs employment data, every month, on the same day, be required for every business?

“Who is gonna pay for the implementations? And of course there are gov agencies that have to respond as well. What do you have in mind for them?

“Do you really think the implementation, maintenance, and response timing and rates will be better than the current survey?”

Chamath countered Cuban with a three-tier proposal on how he believed taking the jobs market to the blockchain could succeed:

The idea was met with a fairly negative response, with many commenters siding with Cuban and claiming Chamath was “cozying up to Trump.”

Economists also agree on at least part of Cuban's critique, the biggest problem in the recent debacle wasn't tampering, it was the shrinking survey response rates and outdated collection methods.

Under Chamath Palihapitiya's proposal, payroll providers would automatically upload anonymized employment data in real time, allowing for instant verification and reducing reliance on delayed, sample-based surveys that are prone to large revisions.

Because blockchain records are immutable, any changes to the data would be traceable and would eliminate any suspicion of political manipulation.

A real-time feed could also provide policymakers and the public with up-to-date labor market information, reducing the shock of dramatic revisions seen recently.

Critics, however, warn that implementing this at scale would be expensive and too complex from a system which already works.

One X user wrote: “The entire methodology is publicly available on the BLS website.

“Estimation, Revisions, everything. All you have to do is read. Suddenly it's garbage because you wanna be cozied up with the President. Vacuous shill behavior.”

The jobs report sent Trump on a tirade of accusations, claiming the commissioner faked jobs numbers “before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory.”

All of Trump's accusations were presented without any evidence.

Members of the federal government rushed to defend McEntarfer, who has worked in the White House for the past two decades.

Speaking to NBC, Labor Secretary during the Biden administration Julie Su said :

“The work is done largely by expert career staff who do their jobs with care and pride.”

Downward revisions aren't scandal — they're science.

The goal is accuracy, especially with trillions on the line.  

We worked closely with a Trump-appointed commissioner.  

We never doubted the data, even with bad news.

Respecting the truth isn't optional. It's the job. pic.twitter.com/SZy8zFmVAx 

— Dan Koh (@dank) August 4, 2025 



Meanwhile, Labor Department Chief of Staff Daniel Koh took to X to claim:

“Nobody is faking numbers.”

“Downward revisions aren't scandal — they're science,” he added.

Koh said the agency worked closely with a Trump-appointed commissioner and “never doubted the data, even with bad news.”

“Respecting the truth isn't optional. It's the job,” he said.

Altcoins have been on a tear recently, and it has left many of us wondering if this is just a temporary blip or if we're witnessing the dawn of a new era in cryptocurrency. The surge in altcoins is not without its implications, especially in the realm of crypto banking and payroll. Let's dig into the context behind this trend and the potential risks that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) could face by diversifying their portfolios.

Altcoins have now been on top of Bitcoin for a whopping 31 consecutive days, the longest stretch we've seen in over a year. This has been driven by a resurgence in global trading flows and Ethereum's own rise to price levels we haven't seen since 2021. The market's rising tides are shifting the balance, causing Bitcoin's market share to dwindle as total crypto capitalization increases. It's looking like we might have an altcoin season on our hands, and it's prompting investors to consider branching out from Bitcoin.

The altcoin rally has significant implications for regulatory compliance in crypto banking across Asia and Europe. With altcoin trading on the upswing, there's a pressing need for clearer and more adaptable regulatory frameworks. Europe is gearing up for new regulations expected to come into force by 2026, aiming to offer comprehensive guidelines for crypto assets. 

This reflects a broader trend toward establishing detailed rules for stablecoins and other digital assets in order to maintain market integrity and protect consumers. Crypto banks have to step up their anti-money laundering (AML) controls, know-your-customer (KYC) processes, and transaction monitoring to deal with the increased complexity and risks that come with altcoin trading. Blockchain intelligence tools are becoming essential for compliance teams to detect illicit activities and manage risks effectively.

While altcoins offer exciting opportunities, SMEs venturing into this volatile market could face significant risks. Let's break down some of the key risks here:

Increased Volatility: Altcoins are notoriously volatile, which can put a strain on SME liquidity and financial stability. Unlike Bitcoin, altcoins can swing wildly, sometimes exceeding 100% changes in a single day.

Fraud and Security Vulnerabilities: Altcoins are more susceptible to scams and hacks due to weaker security measures and less established networks, increasing the risk of asset theft or loss.

Regulatory Compliance Hurdles: Navigating the complex and fragmented regulations can be tough, especially without specialized legal expertise. The regulatory ambiguity surrounding many altcoins only amplifies this risk.

Operational Complexities: Implementing altcoin payment systems requires robust compliance frameworks and a deep understanding of the tax implications, stretching SME resources.

Limited Investor Protections: Many altcoins lack registration and oversight, which reduces transparency and increases exposure to unregulated entities.

How should SMEs navigate these risks? Here are some strategies to consider:

Broaden Cryptocurrency Holdings: Introduce both Bitcoin and select altcoins into financial strategies. This can help mitigate volatility risks and attract a larger customer base.

Keep an Eye on Market Cycles: Stay informed about crypto market cycles (Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season) to time financial decisions and marketing efforts effectively.

Utilize Stablecoins: Leverage stablecoins for payroll and transactions to shield against volatility and ensure consistent value for employees.

Partner with Crypto Payment Processors: Collaborate with payment processors that support multiple cryptocurrencies, facilitating smoother transactions and enhancing operational efficiency.

Stay Updated on Regulatory Changes: Keep abreast of evolving regulations to ensure compliance and adapt strategies accordingly.

The rise of altcoins brings both risks and opportunities for SMEs in the crypto landscape. Understanding the implications of altcoin dominance, regulatory requirements, and associated risks is crucial for developing a solid strategy. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, staying informed and adaptable will be key to navigating the future of finance successfully.

Ethereum has soared to a multi-year high, touching the $4,330 level — its highest price since November 2021. This milestone not only reinforces ETH's dominant position in the crypto market but also marks the return of co-founder Vitalik Buterin to billionaire status, with his publicly known wallets now valued above the billion-dollar mark.

Since April, Ethereum has delivered a staggering gain of over 200%, outpacing most major cryptocurrencies and reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. Analysts attribute the rally to strong fundamentals, including increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), the rapid growth of layer-2 scaling solutions, and rising institutional interest.

The rally comes amid tightening supply dynamics, with exchange balances dropping to multi-year lows, suggesting that long-term holders and institutional players are accumulating aggressively. On-chain data points to sustained network activity and expanding use cases, adding fuel to the bullish outlook.

Many market watchers believe Ethereum is setting up for further gains, potentially challenging its all-time highs in the months ahead. As the ecosystem continues to expand and regulatory clarity improves, ETH appears poised to remain at the center of the next major wave in crypto growth.

According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, Buterin holds approximately 240,000 ETH, alongside other digital assets such as MOODENG and DINU. At current market prices, his ETH holdings alone are worth around $1 billion, cementing his status as one of the wealthiest figures in crypto — at least on-chain.

The surge in ETH's price comes after a series of volatile moves earlier this year that left some questioning the sustainability of the rally. However, the latest breakout above $4,300 suggests strong underlying momentum. Institutional adoption is playing a crucial role, with public companies like Sharplink Gaming adding Ethereum to their balance sheets as part of their treasury strategy. This marks a notable shift in corporate crypto allocation trends, where ETH is increasingly seen not just as a speculative asset but as a core long-term holding.

With on-chain data pointing to robust network activity, the supply-demand dynamics appear favorable for continued gains. As institutions, public companies, and long-term holders continue to accumulate, Ethereum's bullish narrative remains intact — and Buterin's billion-dollar stake is now riding the wave.

Ethereum (ETH) has surged to $4,242, marking its highest level since November 2021 and confirming a major breakout on the weekly chart. The rally, driven by strong bullish momentum, saw ETH climb over 21% in the past week, decisively breaking through the $3,860 resistance level that had capped price advances earlier in the year.

The breakout is supported by rising volume, signaling robust buying interest. ETH is now trading well above its 50-, 100-, and 200-week moving averages, which are all sloping upward — a classic sign of a strong uptrend. This alignment suggests that the medium- to long-term trend remains firmly bullish.

If momentum continues, the next significant target lies near the $4,800–$4,900 range, aligning with the previous all-time highs. However, after such a steep move, short-term consolidation is possible, with $3,860 now acting as a key support level. A deeper pullback could retest $2,852, but this scenario would likely require a broader market correction.

The token's availability on Binance Alpha could boost its visibility and liquidity, potentially drawing in both retail and institutional investors who are increasingly interested in the intersection of gaming and decentralized finance [1].

The launch aligns with a broader industry trend of blockchain gaming tokens securing listings on major exchanges. Binance Alpha's decision to feature GameBuild alongside other innovative projects reflects a deliberate strategy to diversify its offerings and cater to a wider investor base. While no formal price or market data for GAME was disclosed, the token's presence on a prominent exchange is likely to spark initial trading activity and speculative interest [1].

This move follows the recent introduction of other gaming and metaverse-related tokens on the platform, reinforcing Binance Alpha's position as a hub for digital innovation. By supporting projects like GameBuild, Binance is contributing to the development of new ways for users to engage with virtual worlds and digital ownership [1].

However, the launch should be viewed within the context of the broader crypto market, which continues to navigate a period of consolidation. Platforms like Binance are using their infrastructure to back niche but high-potential projects, with GAME serving as a potential indicator of market sentiment toward blockchain-based gaming assets. That said, the token's performance may remain highly volatile and heavily influenced by project fundamentals and community adoption [1].

 Vitalik Buterin's net worth could be bolstered even more as crypto traders are eyeing new all-time highs for Ether in just days. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has regained his status as a ten-figure crypto holder just days after Ether crossed the $4,000 price level for the first time in eight months, according to a blockchain intelligence firm.

“Vitalik Buterin is now an onchain billionaire again,” Arkham said in a post on Saturday. At the time of publication, Buterin's portfolio is valued at approximately $1.04 billion, holding 240,042 ETH alongside smaller stakes in cryptocurrencies such as Aave Ethereum (AETHWETH), WhiteRock (WHITE), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).

On Saturday, Ether (ETH) climbed another 6.38%, reaching as high as $4,332 following its return to $4,000 on Friday — a level not seen since December 2024 — while Bitcoin's (BTC) share of the crypto market cap declined.

At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $4,244, according to Nansen.

Some crypto traders anticipate that Ether is on its way to reclaiming its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878. Crypto trader Ted said in an X post that it “is just a matter of days now.”

CoinGlass data shows a move to $4,500 would put approximately $1.35 billion in short positions at risk amid other traders speculating a short squeeze in the near future.

Arkham also highlighted growing momentum for Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “ETFs yesterday had total flows of $461M for ETH but only $404M for BTC,” the firm said. 

Over the past five trading days, US-based spot Ether ETFs saw $326.6 million in net inflows, while Bitcoin ETFs posted $253.2 million, according to Farside data.

Buterin first became a crypto billionaire at age 27 in May 2021, when Ether crossed $3,000 for the first time. 

At the time, he held around 333,500 ETH, valued at approximately $1.029 billion, according to onchain data from Etherscan. This came after ETH's value had more than quadrupled from roughly $700 at the start of 2021.

Nearly three years earlier, in October 2018, Buterin revealed he never held more than 0.9% of all the ETH supply and his net worth had “never came close” to $1 billion.

While many in the industry attribute a large part of Ether's price surge to the rise of Ether treasury companies, Buterin recently made a strong warning against the trend.

“If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH, then, of course, my guess for why would basically be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game,” Buterin said in an interview on Thursday.

In February this year hackers targeted Dubai-based exchange Bybit, stealing digital assets worth an estimated $1.5 billion. Verichains quickly dispatched engineers to Dubai to assist in the investigation. Thanh says: "I felt we had to act. Otherwise, many people would be affected."

Within a day the cause was identified. Thanh's team produced a 28-page technical report, the first detailed explanation of the breach. It became a key reference for affected parties and users, helping reduce the spread of misinformation that could destabilize the crypto market.

"They are probably the most knowledgeable people in the world when it comes to cyberattacks," Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, told VnExpress then. "I was surprised and impressed to learn they were from Vietnam."

The Bybit case is one of many major blockchain-related attacks Verichains has helped investigate. These incidents often resemble digital crime scenes, with engineers working backward to uncover what happened, much like detectives. Verichains has been involved in investigating many of the world's most high-profile crypto breaches.

These include the 2022 theft of $600 million from BNB Chain Bridge, a platform used to transfer digital assets between blockchains, and the hack targeting Ronin Bridge, a cross-chain platform, which crippled Sky Mavis, the Vietnamese tech unicorn behind the blockchain game "Axie Infinity."

The firm is among the few globally to provide deep-level blockchain forensics. "Our job is to investigate the root cause, identify vulnerabilities exploited by attackers, resolve the incident, collaborate with authorities across multiple countries, and support the affected organization in securing their systems," Thanh says.

Despite its reputation for security, blockchain remains a prime target for hackers. In 2024 alone cybercriminals stole $2.2 billion in crypto assets. In the first half of 2025 alone that figure reached $2 billion, driven largely by the Bybit breach.

Thanh says blockchain technology is often wrongly blamed. In most hacking cases, the cause does not stem from core blockchain technology, but from supporting systems, non-decentralized elements such as human error, servers, wallets, and applications on phones or computers. Many crypto startups manage billions of U.S. dollars in assets but are often young companies that have scaled rapidly without the cybersecurity maturity or experience to defend against attacks.

This is where blockchain security engineers come in. They are typically brought in after a breach to audit code, trace stolen assets, identify attack methods, and recommend solutions to prevent future incidents. "When we find a vulnerability, we also check whether any other projects using the same mathematical libraries might be at risk," Thanh says.

Thanks to a proven track record, Verichains now works primarily with major crypto exchanges and digital asset investment funds.

Rare talent in a global market

Blockchain security professionals typically fall into two categories. The first handles smart contract audits, a process that follows defined procedures. The second, more specialized group, deals with complex systems such as crypto exchanges and asset custody platforms.

Thanh says the blockchain security industry faces a global talent shortage due to its technical demands. Experts must be proficient not only in traditional cybersecurity but also in blockchain systems, cryptography, risk management, and financial operations.

While no official statistics are available, he estimates that blockchain security engineers make up only a small fraction of the global cybersecurity workforce. Market demand is also cyclical, fluctuating with crypto investment trends. When crypto prices rise, more projects are launched and security needs increase. When the market slows, demand typically declines.

However, long-term prospects remain strong. Professionals in this field often earn high incomes, especially when working directly with global financial institutions or major exchanges. "Vietnamese engineers can serve global clients," Thanh says. "If you can prove your capabilities, clients will come."

At the GM Vietnam blockchain event held on Aug. 1 and 2 in Hanoi, Vu Ngoc Son, head of technology at the National Cybersecurity Association, said crypto exchanges now resemble banks due to the scale of assets they manage, but often operate without the regulatory safeguards of traditional financial institutions.

This creates both cybersecurity challenges and opportunities for Vietnamese engineers.Vietnamese professionals are typically patient and detail-oriented, traits essential for analyzing thousands of lines of source code to detect hidden vulnerabilities, Son said.

He added that most blockchain flaws are rooted in logic or mathematics, areas where Vietnamese talent tends to excel. "Vietnam has a real opportunity to become a global leader in blockchain security, provided we invest in the right policies and support systems."

Vietnam's growing role in blockchain security may soon be reinforced by new national policies.

The Digital Technology Industry Law, passed by the National Assembly in June and set to take effect in 2026, includes provisions aimed at developing digital workforce capacity.

Under the law, the government will promote education, reskilling and upskilling in digital technologies through scholarships, subsidized student loans and stipends. It also sets out a framework for investing in educational infrastructure, developing online learning platforms and promoting suitable training models to support digital transformation.

Home - Crypto Presales - Bitcoin Energy Value Points to $183K — Analysts Highlight Altcoins With 81x Growth Potential

Bitcoin is trading at a steep discount, according to the Capriole Investments Energy Value model, which now estimates the flagship cryptocurrency's fair price at $183,000. With BTC hovering around $116,000, the data suggests a possible 57% undervaluation. The model uses inputs like mining difficulty, energy consumption, and supply inflation to calculate a more intrinsic price for Bitcoin.

This gap between energy value and market price is the widest seen since 2020, when BTC sat near $10,000 ahead of its explosive rally. With Bitcoin's hashrate at a record 1.031 ZH/s, analysts say miner confidence remains strong despite recent volatility. In fact, the Hash Ribbons indicator just issued a bullish signal, often used by traders to time long-term entries.

For institutions and long-term holders, this reinforces the thesis that Bitcoin remains structurally sound. But it also hints at something else: rising appetite for undervalued plays—especially high-upside altcoins ready to benefit from capital rotation.

The broader crypto market continues to advance. Ethereum recently broke above $4,000, pushing DeFi and NFT volume higher. Bitcoin's dominance has slipped to 57.8%, signaling that capital is moving into altcoins. 

Meanwhile, institutional investment in Ethereum ETFs is climbing, and U.S. regulations like the Genius Act are adding clarity around stablecoins and digital asset retirement plans.At the same time, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefiting from this shift. 

Retail traders are showing renewed interest in narratives that combine meme appeal with structured launches. With token unlock calendars tightening and presale bonuses dwindling, demand for early entries is surging.












With Bitcoin appearing discounted, top Solana and XRP holders are now joining MAGACOIN FINANCE for early positioning, seeking the next breakout asset ahead of broader market moves.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, a low-cap token launched with political and cultural momentum, is drawing strong traction in presale channels. The token's growing visibility among crypto veterans is notable. Wallet activity tied to known Solana and XRP whales shows early MAGACOIN allocations, suggesting strategic positioning for possible outsized returns.

What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its unique blend of community engagement, narrative appeal, and market timing. As traditional memecoins cool and mid-cap alts reach exhaustion, many traders are chasing fresh momentum. 

Some analysts have already placed MAGACOIN among 2025's best crypto presale plays, citing potential upside with massive ROI under current projections. Its early-stage pricing and strong network excitement make it a rare candidate in an increasingly mature altcoin cycle.

Bitcoin may be trading far below its fair value, but that hasn't stopped investors from looking further down the chain for the best crypto presale opportunities. With whales repositioning and altcoin season heating up, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the standout contenders for 2025. As sentiment turns more bullish, early positioning could make all the difference.

Fundamental Global, a Nasdaq-listed financial services provider, filed a $5 billion shelf registration statement with the US SEC this week as part of its ongoing effort to scale its Ethereum accumulation strategy.

The company, soon to be renamed FG Nexus, aims to become the world's largest corporate holder of ETH, targeting a 10% stake in the network.

Achieving this goal would make Fundamental Global one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum, in the company of BitMine, which holds $3.5 billion, and SharpLink, which owns $2.2 billion.

The shelf registration, one of the largest in the digital asset treasury space, includes an “at-the-market” prospectus covering up to $4 billion in common stock sales. This structure gives Fundamental Global the flexibility to raise funds over time, allowing the company to move quickly when market conditions are favorable.

The remaining capacity could be issued as preferred stock, debt, or other securities.

“This $5 billion shelf filing represents a significant step in our capital raising capabilities and positions us to move with speed and scale when capital deployment opportunities arise,” said Kyle Cerminara, CEO and Chairman of Fundamental Global, in a statement. “We believe this framework will enable us to capitalize on ETH accumulation opportunities and support our target of a 10% stake in the Ethereum Network.”

According to Maja Vujinovic, head of the company's Digital Assets Division, institutional adoption of digital assets is accelerating, creating a favorable backdrop for Fundamental's capital deployment plans.

The strategy is to capture multiple value drivers, including ETH price appreciation, staking rewards, and exposure to tokenized real-world assets built on Ethereum, she noted.

Fundamental Global pivoted to Ethereum in late July with a $200 million private placement aimed primarily at purchasing Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset.

Fundamental Global (FGF) shares plunged 48% at market close on Friday, per Yahoo Finance.

Otherdeeds are NFTs representing land deeds in Otherside, a 3D blockchain-based virtual world created by Yuga Labs. These Otherdeeds have a 100,000 supply, with Weitsman's recent purchase representing 5% of the total.

Like many other metaverse projects, Otherside was announced during the height of the NFT craze in 2021. The project had garnered significant hype due to the success of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and raised over $300 million from the sale of 55,000 Otherdeed NFTs in April 2022. But as with most other metaverse and NFT projects, interest in Otherdeed has plummeted following the 2022 cryptocurrency bear market.

Amid the downturn, Yuga Labs has been forced to sell IPs like Moonbirds and CryptoPunks while shifting focus to Otherside. Weitsman cited this Otherside focus among his motivations for the recent NFT sweep.

“I have recently seen Yuga refocus and prioritize Otherside,” he said Monday. “There is a lot riding on this project for the whole space and I will do my best to help make it a success for everyone.”

An avid art collector, Weitsman has built a reputation as a long-term investor and advocate of NFTs over the years. This reputation shines through in the recent Yuga Labs deal.

He told Now Media on Monday that his motivations were not financial, noting that as part of the contract, he can't sell the Otherdeed NFTs despite a “multimillion dollar commitment” on his part.

“This space needs a beacon of hope,” he said. “I don't have a financial interest in Yuga, so I can be very objective. I'm not biased toward the thing. I just want what's best for the space.”

Weitsman told Now Media that he chose Otherside because he loved the aesthetics and believed in the Yuga Labs team.

“I love the look, the plants, resources, and artifacts. I'm really drawn to that,” he said. “I love mythology. I just feel that this could be the greatest story.”

In the future, Weitsman envisions Otherside as a place where children can find solace, get inspiration and learn.

“I've got some ideas about kids playing this all over the world,” he told Now Media. “A place that kids can dream in. They can dream that this is their house and this is their land.”

He added that he would love to have an adviser for every 30 Otherdeeds that would teach the children to build and trade.

It sounds like science fiction: a spacecraft, no heavier than a paperclip, propelled by a laser beam and hurtling through space at the speed of light toward a black hole, on a mission to probe the very fabric of space and time and test the laws of physics. But to astrophysicist and black hole expert Cosimo Bambi, the idea is not so far-fetched.

Reporting in the Cell Press journal iScience, Bambi outlines the blueprint for turning this interstellar voyage to a black hole into a reality. If successful, this century-long mission could return data from nearby black holes that completely alter our understanding of general relativity and the rules of physics.

"We don't have the technology now," says author Cosimo Bambi of Fudan University in China. "But in 20 or 30 years, we might."

The mission hinges on two key challenges -- finding a black hole close enough to target and developing probes capable of withstanding the journey.

Previous knowledge on how stars evolve suggests that there could be a black hole lurking just 20 to 25 light-years from Earth, but finding it won't be easy, says Bambi. Because black holes don't emit or reflect light, they are virtually invisible to telescopes. Instead, scientists detect and study them based on how they influence nearby stars or distort light.

"There have been new techniques to discover black holes," says Bambi. "I think it's reasonable to expect we could find a nearby one within the next decade."

Once the target is identified, the next hurdle is getting there. Traditional spacecrafts, powered by chemical fuel, are too clunky and slow to make the journey. Bambi points to nanocrafts -- gram-scale probes consisting of a microchip and light sail -- as a possible solution. Earth-based lasers would blast the sail with photons, accelerating the craft to a third of the speed of light.

At that pace, the craft could reach a black hole 20 to 25 light-years away in about 70 years. The data it gathers would take another two decades to get back to Earth, making the total mission duration around 80 to 100 years.

Once the craft is near the black hole, researchers could run experiments to answer some of the most pressing questions in physics. Does a black hole truly have an event horizon, the boundary beyond which not even light can escape its gravitational pull? Do the rules of physics change near a black hole? Does Einstein's theory of general relativity hold under the universe's most extreme conditions?

Bambi notes that the lasers alone would cost around one trillion euros today, and the technology to create a nanocraft does not yet exist. But in 30 years, he says that costs may fall and technology may catch up to these bold ideas.

"It may sound really crazy, and in a sense closer to science fiction," says Bambi. "But people said we'd never detect gravitational waves because they're too weak. We did -- 100 years later. People thought we'd never observe the shadows of black holes. Now, 50 years later, we have images of two."

Astronomers have discovered potentially the most massive black hole ever detected.

The cosmic behemoth is close to the theoretical upper limit of what is possible in the universe and is 10,000 times heavier than the black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy.

It exists in one of the most massive galaxies ever observed - the Cosmic Horseshoe - which is so big it distorts spacetime and warps the passing light of a background galaxy into a giant horseshoe-shaped Einstein ring.

Such is the enormousness of the ultramassive black hole's size, it equates to 36 billion solar masses, according to a new paper published on August 7 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

It is thought that every galaxy in the universe has a supermassive black hole at its center and that bigger galaxies host bigger ones, known as ultramassive black holes.

"This is amongst the top 10 most massive black holes ever discovered, and quite possibly the most massive," said researcher Professor Thomas Collett, of the University of Portsmouth.

"Most of the other black hole mass measurements are indirect and have quite large uncertainties, so we really don't know for sure which is biggest. However, we've got much more certainty about the mass of this black hole thanks to our new method."

Researchers detected the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole using a combination of gravitational lensing and stellar kinematics (the study of the motion of stars within galaxies and the speed and way they move around black holes).

The latter is seen as the gold standard for measuring black hole masses, but doesn't really work outside of the very nearby universe because galaxies appear too small on the sky to resolve the region where a supermassive or ultramassive black hole lies.

Adding in gravitational lensing helped the team "push much further out into the universe," Professor Collett said.

"We detected the effect of the black hole in two ways - it is altering the path that light takes as it travels past the black hole and it is causing the stars in the inner regions of its host galaxy to move extremely quickly (almost 400 km/s).

"By combining these two measurements we can be completely confident that the black hole is real."

Lead researcher, PhD candidate Carlos Melo, of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in Brazil, added: "This discovery was made for a 'dormant' black hole - one that isn't actively accreting material at the time of observation.

"Its detection relied purely on its immense gravitational pull and the effect it has on its surroundings.

"What is particularly exciting is that this method allows us to detect and measure the mass of these hidden ultramassive black holes across the universe, even when they are completely silent."

The Cosmic Horseshoe black hole is located a long way away from Earth, at a distance of some 5 billion light-years.

"Typically, for such remote systems, black hole mass measurements are only possible when the black hole is active," Melo said. "But those accretion-based estimates often come with significant uncertainties.

"Our approach, combining strong lensing with stellar dynamics, offers a more direct and robust measurement, even for these distant systems."

The discovery is significant because it will help astronomers understand the connection between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies.

"We think the size of both is intimately linked," Professor Collett added, "because when galaxies grow they can funnel matter down onto the central black hole.

"Some of this matter grows the black hole but lots of it shines away in an incredibly bright source called a quasar. These quasars dump huge amounts of energy into their host galaxies, which stops gas clouds condensing into new stars."

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, hosts a 4 million solar mass black hole. Currently it's not growing fast enough to blast out energy as a quasar but we know it has done in the past, and it may will do again in the future.

The Andromeda Galaxy and our Milky Way are moving together and are expected to merge in about 4.5 billion years, which is the most likely time for our supermassive black hole to become a quasar once again, the researchers say.

An interesting feature of the Cosmic Horseshoe system is that the host galaxy is a so-called fossil group.

Fossil groups are the end state of the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe, arising when they have collapsed down to a single extremely massive galaxy, with no bright companions.

"It is likely that all of the supermassive black holes that were originally in the companion galaxies have also now merged to form the ultramassive black hole that we have detected," said Professor Collett.

"So we're seeing the end state of galaxy formation and the end state of black hole formation."

The discovery of the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole was somewhat of a serendipitous discovery. It came about as the researchers were studying the galaxy's dark matter distribution in an attempt to learn more about the mysterious hypothetical substance.

Now that they've realized their new method works for black holes, they hope to use data from the European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope to detect more supermassive black holes and their hosts to help understand how black holes stop galaxies forming stars.

Weight loss and diabetes drugs on the market often do not achieve long-term weight loss for patients. GLP-1 drugs target brain neurons that control appetite but frequently cause side effects. Nausea and vomiting force 70% of patients to stop treatment within a year. Syracuse University chemistry professor Robert Doyle is leading a multidisciplinary team that has identified a different brain target for treating obesity and diabetes, potentially offering weight loss without gastrointestinal distress.

Neurons are the most well-known and obvious target in research and drug development for brain conditions. GLP-1 drugs, for example, target brain neurons in the hindbrain involved in appetite control. But researchers are looking beyond neurons to study "support" cells such as glia and astrocytes that could aid appetite reduction.

A collaborative research effort has revealed that support cells play a role in reducing feelings of hunger, although this process has not been studied in-depth.

"We wanted to know whether support cells might produce new peptides or new signaling molecules that might be critical in body weight reduction," says Doyle, a medicinal chemist and the Jack and Laura H. Milton Professor of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at Syracuse University. Doyle is also a professor of pharmacology and medicine at SUNY Upstate Medical University.

How it works

Think of each brain neuron as a light bulb and support cells as the components that allow the light bulb to brighten, including the wiring, switch and filament.

"All of those supporting parts beyond the light bulb play a role in making the light shine," says Doyle.

The research team discovered that some support cells in the hindbrain naturally produce a molecule named octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), which suppresses appetite. In lab tests, injecting ODN directly into rats' brains made them lose weight and improved how they processed glucose.

However, injecting directly into the brain isn't a practical treatment for people, so researchers created a new version of the molecule named tridecaneuropeptide (TDN). This molecule version could be given to human patients through regular injections akin to today's Ozempic or Zepbound. When tested in obese mice and musk shrews, TDN helped the animals lose weight and respond better to insulin without causing nausea or vomiting.

Marathon shortcut

One goal of the research team is to produce weight loss without aiming new therapeutic molecules at neurons. The new TDN molecule bypasses neurons, taking a shortcut to directly target neurons' downstream support cells, which researchers found also produce appetite suppression. TDN cuts short the "marathon" of chemical reactions and negative side-effects caused by GLP-1 drugs.

"Instead of running a marathon from the very beginning like current drugs do, our targeting downstream pathways in support cells is like starting the race halfway through, reducing the unpleasant side effects many people experience," says Doyle. "If we could hit that downstream process directly, then potentially we wouldn't have to use GLP-1 drugs with their side effects. Or we could reduce their dose, improving the toleration of these drugs. We could trigger weight loss signals that happen later in the pathway more directly."

A new company called CoronationBio has been launched to turn this discovery into a real-world treatment. The company has licensed intellectual property related to ODN derivatives for the treatment of obesity and cardio-metabolic disease from Syracuse University and the University of Pennsylvania, with a focus on translating candidates into the clinic. They're now teaming up with other companies to develop this treatment and aim to start human trials in 2026 or 2027.

Science Advisory Highlights:

Ultraprocessed foods or UPFs are a growing concern due to their widespread consumption and impact on potential health risks. Most UPFs, particularly those commonly seen in U.S. dietary patterns, are high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium (salt), the combination of which is often abbreviated as HFSS, and contribute to excess calories. These include sugar-sweetened drinks, ultraprocessed meats, refined grains, candy and commercial baked goods, among others. A limited number of ultraprocessed foods, such as certain commercial whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and some plant-based items, have positive nutritional value and, therefore, can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern. This overlap is confusing for health care professionals and the public.

A new Science Advisory from the American Heart Association, "Ultraprocessed Foods and Their Association with Cardiometabolic Health: Evidence, Gaps and Opportunities," summarizes current knowledge about UPFs and their impact on cardiometabolic health, and outlines opportunities for research, policy and regulatory reform to improve dietary intake and overall health. The manuscript published on August 8 in Circulation, the flagship journal of the American Heart Association.

"The relationship between UPFs and health is complex and multifaceted," said Maya K. Vadiveloo, Ph.D., R.D., FAHA, volunteer chair of the writing group for this Science Advisory. "We know that eating foods with too much saturated fat, added sugars and salt is unhealthy. What we don't know is if certain ingredients or processing techniques make a food unhealthy above and beyond their poor nutritional composition. And if certain additives and processing steps used to make healthier food like commercial whole grain breads have any health impact."

The rapid rise in UPF consumption since the 1990s disrupted traditional dietary patterns, potentially contributing to adverse health effects. It is estimated that 70% of grocery store products in the U.S. contain at least one ultraprocessed ingredient. As detailed in a CDC report published on August 7, 55% of calories consumed by people ages 1 and older in the U.S. were UPFs. Among youth ages 1-18 years of age, total UPF calories jumped to nearly 62%, and among adults ages 19 and older total UPF calories was 53%. In addition, families with lower mean income had a higher percentage of UPFs consumed per day: 54.7% for the lowest income group vs. 50.4% for highest income group.[1]

UPFs are relatively inexpensive, convenient for use and aggressively marketed, particularly toward youth and under-resourced communities, often displacing healthier alternatives. This shift resulted in lowering the overall nutritional quality of typical eating patterns in the U.S. and is misaligned with the American Heart Association's dietary guidance.

This new Science Advisory reinforces current dietary guidelines from the American Heart Association to:

How are ultraprocessed foods classified?

UPFs are multi-ingredient foods containing additives (likely intended to enhance shelf life, appearance, flavor or texture) widely used in industrial food production and not commonly used in home cooking. Human diets are increasingly including more industrially processed foods, leading to various systems for classifying foods based on processing criteria. Multiple food classification systems exist currently; this Science Advisory focuses on the Nova framework for food classification. The Nova system, the most widely used, is based on the nature, extent and purpose of the food's industrial food processing. However, the Nova categorization does not consider the nutritional quality of foods. Certain types of industrial food processing are beneficial for preservation and safety, and/or lowering cost, such as techniques that extend shelf life, control microbial growth, mitigate chemical toxicants, preserve functional, nutritional and sensory (taste) qualities, and reduce food loss and waste.

Efforts to understand UPFs are hindered by differing definitions, limitations in dietary assessment tools and food composition databases, which often lack detailed information on additives and processing methods. Currently, U.S. manufacturers are not required to disclose processing techniques or cosmetic additive quantities, which contributes to the variability in risk estimates and confusion for consumers.

The writing group cautions that an overreliance on the degree of processing as a proxy for healthfulness of foods could sway the food industry to reduce or remove the markers of ultraprocessing from foods that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium and promote them as "better-for-you alternatives."

Health Impact of UPFs

A meta-analysis of prospective studies cited in the advisory found a dose-response relationship between UPF consumption and cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, transient ischemic attack and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and all-cause mortality. High versus low UPF intake was linked to a 25%-58% higher risk of cardiometabolic outcomes and a 21%-66% higher risk of mortality. More research is needed to understand the appropriate thresholds for daily consumption of UPFs -- what a safe amount is and the incremental risks of eating more UPFs.

Research has also found that there may be underlying mechanisms that affect eating behaviors and obesity for some people, and that UPFs may promote obesity. UPFs frequently contain combinations of ingredients and additives that are uncommon in whole foods to enhance palatability and reduce cost, and these may influence reward-related brain activity. For example, ingredients like artificial flavors may mimic sweetness without sugar, and this disruption in flavor-nutrient relationships often leads to irregular eating habits, and results in weight gain.

Opportunities for research and policy

Balancing multiple priorities, including the practical need for a nutrient-dense, affordable food supply, current evidence supports the following key research and policy changes to improve public health and reduce risks related to UPFs:

"More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of how UPFs impact health. In the meantime, the Association continues to urge people to cut back on the most harmful UPFs that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium, and excessive calories and instead follow a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds and whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and lean proteins like fish, seafood or poultry -- for better short- and long-term health," said Vadiveloo.

As use of the popular anti-diabetic and weight-loss drug Ozempic skyrockets, so have concerns about the medication's side effects. One such side effect is loss of "lean mass" -- body weight that isn't fat -- raising concerns that Ozempic could be reducing muscle mass and strength.

New research in mice suggests that muscle mass changes less than expected, but muscles may still get weaker, pointing out an urgent need for clinical studies to pin down the full effects of the popular medications.

"If we want to really help the individuals who may be losing muscle mass, then we need to know that they're actually losing muscle mass," says Katsu Funai, PhD, associate professor of nutrition and integrative physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and the senior author on the study. "We have data in mice that suggest that things are not as straightforward as they might seem."

The results are published in Cell Metabolism.

A weighty concern

Researchers found that Ozempic-induced weight loss did decrease lean mass by about 10%. Most of this lost weight wasn't from skeletal muscles but instead from other tissues like the liver, which shrunk by nearly half. The researchers emphasize that more research is needed to determine whether similar changes to organ size occur in humans -- and whether those changes come with any risks.

"Loss of mass in metabolically active organs, such as the liver, is expected as part of healthy weight loss," says Ran Hee Choi, PhD, research instructor in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and co-first author on the study. In both mice and humans, weight gain and loss can affect the size of organs like the liver without affecting their function. "It's unlikely that the observed lean mass loss represents a serious adverse effect," says Takuya Karasawa, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in the U of U Molecular Medicine Program and co-first author on the study.

Some skeletal muscles did shrink as the mice lost weight -- on average, by about 6%, not enough to explain the overall loss in lean mass. Other muscles stayed the same size.

Some of this loss in muscle mass is a return to baseline, the researchers say. Gains in fat also tend to lead to gains in skeletal muscle, since the body must do more work to move around. So loss of fat can lead to loss of muscle without affecting overall quality of life.

Size isn't strength

Interestingly, when the researchers tested the amount of force the mice's muscles could exert, they found that, for some muscles, strength decreased as the mice lost weight, even when the size of the muscle stayed roughly the same. For other muscles, strength was unchanged. It's unknown how weight loss drugs affect this balance in people, the researchers say.

A potential loss of strength when taking Ozempic may be of particular concern for adults over the age of 60, who are at higher baseline risk for muscle loss and reduced mobility. "The loss of physical function is a strong predictor of not just quality of life but longevity," Funai adds.

Clinical trials are needed

The researchers caution against extrapolating their results directly into humans, because mice and humans gain and lose weight in different ways. In people, obesity is associated with lower physical activity, but mice don't tend to become less active when they gain weight. And the mice in this study became overweight because they ate a high-fat diet, whereas people become overweight for a wide variety of reasons that include genetics, diet, sleeping patterns, and age.

Instead of drawing a one-to-one parallel with humans, the researchers say their results emphasize the need for more clinical studies. "There remains a significant need for validation in humans, especially concerning muscle strength," Karasawa says.

Funai adds that clinical trials should check for changes in muscle strength not just for Ozempic but also future weight-loss drugs. "There are many additional weight loss drugs that are in clinical trials and coming out in the next three to five years," Funai says. "But with all those clinical trials, if they're interested in measuring lean mass loss, they need to consider physical function."

"Our findings are really interesting, but this is a preclinical model," he adds. "We need these data in people."

The results were published in Cell Metabolism as "Unexpected effects of semaglutide on skeletal muscle mass and force-generating capacity in mice."

The obesity rate has more than doubled in the last 30 years, affecting more than one billion people worldwide. This prevalent condition is also linked to other metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and cancers. Current treatment options include lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery, and GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Wegovy, but many patients struggle to access or complete these treatments or to maintain their weight loss afterwards.

Salk Institute scientists are looking for a new treatment strategy in microproteins, an understudied class of molecules found throughout the body that play roles in both health and disease. In a new study, the researchers screened thousands of fat cell genes using CRISPR gene editing to find dozens of genes that likely code for microproteins -- one of which they confirmed -- that regulate either fat cell proliferation or lipid accumulation.

The findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 7, 2025, identify new microproteins that could potentially serve as drug targets to treat obesity and other metabolic disorders. The study also showcases the value of CRISPR screening in future microprotein discovery.

"CRISPR screening is extremely effective at finding important factors in obesity and metabolism that could become therapeutic targets," says senior author Alan Saghatelian, a professor and holder of the Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at Salk. "These new screening technologies are allowing us to reveal a whole new level of biological regulation driven by microproteins. The more we screen, the more disease-associated microproteins we find, and the more potential targets we have for future drug development."

Current obesity and metabolic disorder therapeutics

When our energy consumption exceeds our energy expenditure, fat cells can grow in both size and number. Fat cells store the excess energy in the form of fatty molecules called lipids. But while some excess storage is manageable, too much can cause fat deposits to accumulate around the body -- leading to whole-body inflammation and organ dysfunction.

Many factors regulate this complex energy storage system. The problem is, how do we find them all, and how do we filter for factors that may make good therapeutic candidates?

This has been a longstanding question for Salk scientists. In fact, Salk Professor Ronald Evans has been working on it for decades. Evans is an expert on PPAR gamma, a key regulator of fat cell development and a potent target for treating diabetes. Several drugs have been developed to target PPAR gamma to treat obesity, but they resulted in side effects like weight gain and bone loss. An ideal PPAR gamma-based obesity therapeutic has yet to hit the market.

When PPAR gamma drugs fell short, GLP-1 drugs entered the scene. GLP-1 is a peptide small enough to be considered a microprotein, and it serves as a blood sugar and appetite regulator. But, like PPAR gamma, GLP-1 drugs have their own shortcomings, such as muscle loss and nausea. Nonetheless, the popularity of GLP-1 drugs demonstrates a promising future for microprotein drugs in the obesity therapeutic space.

Saghatelian's team is now searching for the next microprotein therapeutic with new genetic tools that bring microproteins out of the "dark." For many years, long stretches of the genome have been considered "junk" and thus left unexplored. But recent technological advances have allowed scientists to look at these dark sections and find a hidden world of microproteins -- in turn, expanding protein libraries by 10 to 30 percent.

In particular, the Salk team is using innovative CRISPR screening to scour the "dark" for possible microproteins. This approach is enabling the simultaneous discovery of thousands of potential microproteins involved in lipid storage and fat cell biology, accelerating the search for the next PPAR gamma or GLP-1 drug.

How CRISPR screening accelerates the search for microproteins

CRISPR screens work by cutting out genes of interest in cells and observing whether the cell thrives or dies without them. From these results, scientists can determine the importance and function of specific genes. In this case, the Salk team was interested in genes that may code for microproteins involved in fat cell differentiation or proliferation.

"We wanted to know if there was anything we had been missing in all these years of research into the body's metabolic processes," says first author Victor Pai, a postdoctoral researcher in Saghatelian's lab. "And CRISPR allows us to pick out interesting and functional genes that specifically impact lipid accumulation and fat cell development."

This latest research follows up on a prior study from Saghatelian's lab. The previous study identified thousands of potential microproteins by analyzing microprotein-coding RNA strands derived from mouse fat tissues. These microprotein-coding RNA strands were filed away to await investigation into their functions.

The new study first expanded this collection to include additional microproteins identified from a pre-fat cell model. Notably, this new model captures the differentiation process from pre-fat cell to a fully mature fat cell. Next, the researchers screened the cell model with CRISPR to determine how many of these potential microproteins were involved in fat cell differentiation or proliferation.

"We're not the first to screen for microproteins with CRISPR," adds Pai, "but we're the first to look for microproteins involved in fat cell proliferation. This is a huge step for metabolism and obesity research."

Microproteins of interest and next steps

Using their mouse model and CRISPR screening approach, the team identified microproteins that may be involved in fat cell biology. They then narrowed the pool even further with another experiment to create a shortlist of 38 potential microproteins involved in lipid droplet formation -- which indicates increasing fat storage -- during fat cell differentiation.

At this point, the shortlisted microproteins were all still "potential" microproteins. This is because the genetic screening finds genes that may code for microproteins, rather than finding the microproteins themselves. While this approach is a helpful workaround to finding microproteins that are otherwise so small they elude capture, it also means that the screened microproteins require further testing to confirm whether they are functional.

And that's what the Salk team did next. They picked several of the shortlisted microproteins to test and were able to verify one. Pai hypothesizes this new microprotein, called Adipocyte-smORF-1183, influences lipid droplet formation in fat cells (also known as adipocytes).

Verification of Adipocyte-smORF-1183 is an exciting step toward identifying more microproteins involved in lipid accumulation and fat cell regulation in obesity. It also verifies that CRISPR is an effective tool for finding microproteins involved in fat cell biology, obesity, and metabolism.

"That's the goal of research, right?" says Saghatelian. "You keep going. It's a constant process of improvement as we establish better technology and better workflows to enhance discovery and, eventually, therapeutic outcomes down the line."

Next, the researchers will repeat the study with human fat cells. They also hope their success inspires others to use CRISPR screenings to continue bringing microproteins out from the dark -- like Adipocyte-smORF-1183, which until now, was considered an unimportant bit of "junk" DNA.

Further validation or screening of new cell libraries will expand the list of potential drug candidates, setting the stage for the new-and-improved obesity and metabolic disorder therapeutics of the future.

Meta has been on a pretty serious campaign to prove it's at the cutting edge of consumer tech, and AI isn't the only target on the board. AR/XR has also clearly been a priority if the last few weeks are any indication (see this paper in Nature about its wristband tech and drips on groundbreaking VR research for proof), and its vision on that front is starting to actually take shape.

According to Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, the company's annual Connect conference in September, where it showcases the latest VR and XR hardware, is going to be a major one. As noted by UploadVR, Bosworth mentioned in a recent Instagram Q&A that “big wearable announcements” are incoming, which could mean a lot of things. In the past, that's meant a new Quest that's better or cheaper than the last generation, but this year all signs point to new smart glasses.

See Meta Ray-Ban at Amazon

There are a lot of directions a potential Meta smart glasses announcement could take (new third-gen Ray-Ban AI glasses, for example), but there's only one thing I really want to know about what Meta plans to offer, and it's actually pretty simple: will its glasses have a display or not?

If I had to guess, that's likely the biggest question on most people's minds, at least anyone who's at all interested in smart glasses as a category. In my experience, it's been the one thing people want to know about Meta's existing Ray-Ban smart glasses when they find out I'm wearing them. And most of those people who ask, “Does it have a screen?” are pretty disappointed by my answer. As surprisingly useful as I've found Ray-Bans to be, they still don't make the idea of smart glasses feel truly smart, and “smart-ish” glasses probably isn't the vibe that Meta is going for.

The good news is, for anyone who's hopeful (or expectant) for a pair of Meta-made smart glasses with a screen, it looks like those prayers may be answered. Rumors of a pair of glasses codenamed “Celeste” have been funneling in, and it looks like those smart glasses might have a HUD (heads-up display) on them. What that HUD will do is just as speculative as the Celeste glasses themselves, but rumors suggest that it will be able to show relatively simple information like weather and notifications. There are also some rumors that those next-gen smart glasses will include Meta's body-reading wristband that allows for hand and finger gestures, but I'm a little skeptical of that side of things given the fact it still seems to be showcasing that accessory as more of an experiment with non-production glasses like Orion.

One thing you can count on is that if there is some kind of screen involved, they'll likely reach a new, significantly higher price to go along with it. Rumors suggest that Celeste may end up in the $1,000 range when it's finally available, and that's not the only thing that may balloon either. If Celeste has the capabilities we think it will, it'll definitely be a much chunkier gadget than Meta's Ray-Bans, which are only slightly larger than a regular pair of sunglasses. Either way, in my book, Meta only has one metric for success when Connect rolls around next month, and that's finally giving us smart glasses with a screen.

I came to Cleveland, Ohio, for the 50th anniversary of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention. I expected the hallways to be buzzing with conversations about AI, and they were, but not in the way I'd hoped. For the first two days, the phrase I heard most from my fellow journalists was “we must protect ourselves.” In session after session, the consensus was that AI is a danger, a threat, an enemy coming to replace us.

Then I had breakfast at Betts, the restaurant in my hotel, and a single conversation with my waiter gave me another perspective on the AI revolution.

As he brought me the bill, I asked Kevin Knestrick, 49, if he used AI. Haunted by the fearful rhetoric from the convention, I expected him to either rebuff me or launch into an anti-AI tirade.

“Not really,” he replied cautiously, then paused. “Actually,” he continued, “I used it for the first time when we changed the menu. I took a picture and uploaded it to ChatGPT and asked it to copy the text and prepare a message for a colleague. It saved me so much time.”

As he relaxed, he called over a younger colleague, Jamie Sargent, 31, and he introduced me a bit later to another younger colleague of his, Dawud Hamzah, 37. “You should talk to these guys,” he said. “They use it a lot more.”

He was right. It quickly became clear that for Hamzah and Sargent, ChatGPT is a part of their daily lives. They don't see it as a threat.

For Hamzah, a bartender at Betts and a youth motivational speaker who founded his own empowerment association, H.Y.P.E. (Helping You Produce Excellence), ChatGPT has effectively replaced Google.

“I use it to build solid, well-structured PowerPoint presentations for my speaking engagements with students,” he told me. But its use extends far beyond his professional life. It's his trip planner, health advisor, and personal coach.

“I just used it for my lady's birthday,” he said. “I said, ‘I want something relaxing that has vegan friendly foods.' It gave me a whole itinerary, a phenomenal itinerary.” When back problems flared up, he turned to the chatbot for help. “I asked it to give me specific home workouts and mobility exercises to relieve pressure from a degenerating disc in my back. And it did.”

Did it work? “Oh yeah!” he responded.

Sargent, a former special education teacher, has been using ChatGPT since it launched in late 2022. He used it to generate baseline lesson plans, saving him hours of work which he could then devote to tailoring the content to each of his students' individual needs.

“I saved about an hour's worth of time writing a lesson plan,” he said. I asked him if it felt like cheating. “No, because I would have done the same thing it did. It just did it faster than I can.” He dismisses the idea that teachers shouldn't use it. “I'd say, that's nonsense. We spend so many hours outside of the classroom working on our own stuff. If we can make it faster, the better.”

Like Hamzah, Sargent is also an avid travel planner, using ChatGPT to map out complex international vacations. “My brother and I planned a trip to Italy from Milan to Florence to Naples, and it basically showed us the map of taking a train from here to here, gave us good restaurants to go to, and then it told us how much it was going to cost.”

Both men hold a pragmatic view of AI's future. They believe jobs will be lost, but that it's on individuals to adapt. “If you don't learn, develop, and adjust, you'll fail, because it's not going to stop,” Hamzah insisted. Sargent agreed, adding that the key is to focus on what makes you human. “I'm part of the experience, whereas AI is not part of that experience. Find a way to differentiate yourself from AI and make yourself valuable.”

Kevin, who first introduced me to the group, represents a different demographic's journey into AI. His use was born of pure necessity. “I was in a time crunch to get this menu to the printer,” he recalled. The AI solved his problem in seconds.

That single, surprisingly effective interaction transformed him from a non-user into a curious convert. “Now I'm much more open to any problem I have. I'm just going to ask it now,” he told me.

His regret over missing out on the Bitcoin boom has also made him wonder if AI could be a tool to help “the little guy” get an edge in investing. “I guess I'm from the generation where all the Wall Street fat cats make money, while us little people just get crushed,” he said. “How do we not be the little guy anymore?”

Their manager, Curtis Helser, 56, was also introduced to ChatGPT by his wife about a year ago. He uses it to refine important work emails, making them shorter and more professional. He isn't afraid of it, seeing it as a tool that can be used for good or ill, just like a car. And he's not worried about his job. “You have to be in the building,” he said with a laugh. “Kissing babies, shaking hands, that kind of stuff.”

I was stunned. At the restaurant, AI wasn't a terrifying enemy; it was a useful, if imperfect, assistant. The younger employees had fully embraced it, while the older generation was more cautious but still open, integrating it into their lives at their own pace. They see the current panic as a movie they've seen before, recalling the fears that accompanied the rise of the personal computer.

The contrast with my colleagues at the journalism convention was stark. Perhaps those of us whose jobs are built on creating and controlling information see AI as an existential threat, while those in the service of people see it as just another tool to get the job done. The real AI revolution, I realized, wasn't happening in the headlines or the panicked convention halls. It was happening quietly, in conversations like this, one practical problem at a time.

State media wants Chinese companies to avoid Nvidia chips.

A social media account linked to Chinese state media wrote an article on WeChat asserting that Nvidia's H20 chips are neither technologically advanced nor environmentally friendly. According to Reuters, the account, Yuyuan Tantian, is connected to China Central Television, which is a key organization in the country's state media (propaganda) apparatus.

“When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it,” Yuyuan Tantian said in the article (a translation, we assume).

The H20 chip is Nvidia's answer to Washington's ban on high-end AI GPU exports to China. Although its performance is only a fraction of what the top-of-the-line H200 can accomplish, it still sold surprisingly well, resulting in Nvidia posting a record revenue despite temporarily falling under export control between April and July 2025.

Aside from its reduced horsepower, Chinese authorities are also concerned with possible hidden geo-tracking and backdoors in the Green Team silicon. The U.S. Congress introduced a bill to enforce location tracking of high-end gaming and AI GPUs in mid-May, with the White House mulling doing the same earlier this month.

Because of this, China has raised concerns about the security of the H20 chips that Nvidia sells in the country, even going as far as summoning the AI chip giant to explain if it had any backdoor security risks. This isn't the only criticism of Nvidia in Chinese media in recent times. People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that Nvidia should convince the Chinese people that its chips do not have security risks. However, the company has firmly denied any such risk, emphasizing that its GPUs have no kill switches, no backdoors, and no spyware.

Although the headlining statement is not from a government source, China often uses state-linked social media accounts to shape its agenda and signal changes in its official stance without making a direct commitment. So, the criticism may be part of a broader campaign to steer domestic firms away from foreign AI hardware and toward homegrown alternatives like Huawei's Ascend chips.

Despite all these issues, many Chinese organizations and entities still purchase Nvidia products. Aside from the massive demand for H20 AI GPUs, there's also a burgeoning black market for banned AI chips. It's been estimated that a billion dollars' worth of these GPUs have been sold in the past quarter, with some companies already advertising the upcoming B300, which is expected to arrive later this year.

The WeChat post is likely the central government signaling its people to slowly move away from Nvidia's products and use alternative homegrown AI GPUs instead. However, the ecosystem that the company delivers makes its local competitors a much less compelling alternative.

Pull request got rejected for Linux 6.17. And as a late submission, it already lit Torvald's fuse.

Linus Torvalds, the creator and lead developer of Linux, has publicly dismissed a RISC-V code contribution from a Google engineer as “garbage.” The code was sent as a pull request for inclusion in the Linux 6.17 kernel on Friday, but has been roundly rejected by Torvalds for both its poor quality and for being late. Those are two cardinal sins in pull requests, and misdemeanors that have clearly ignited the Linux creator's infamously short fuse.

In response to the RISC-V Patches for the 6.17 Merge Window, Part 1, from Google's Android team member Palmer Dabbelt, Torvalds didn't pull any punches. “No. This is garbage and it came in too late. I asked for early pull requests because I'm traveling, and if you can't follow that rule, at least make the pull requests *good*,” insisted Torvalds. “This adds various garbage that isn't RISC-V specific to generic header files. And by "garbage" I really mean it. This is stuff that nobody should ever send me, never mind late in a merge window,” he brusquely elaborated.

The comment from Torvalds wasn't just bile. He went on to give some examples of where the RISC-V pull request went astray. But even in this mostly reasoned response, Torvalds couldn't resist adding a few more barbs.

When highlighting the undesirable additions in the newly submitted RISC-V feature code, the Linux firebrand said the code “makes the world actively a worse place to live.” He added that “Things like this need to get bent,” and put the developer on a warning for both code quality and being late. “You're on notice: no more late pull requests, and no more garbage outside the RISC-V tree.”

Rounding off his unvarnished public broadcast to the Google engineer, Torvalds strongly recommended that they try and get in early for Linux kernel 6.18. Moreover, code “without the garbage” would be preferred, in case that wasn't quite clear.

Social media responses to the latest Torvalds tantrum have been mixed. It can be true that being unfiltered and direct is an efficient way to communicate. Especially when backed up with reasoning and constructive comments. Also, you could say that Torvalds didn't attack anyone involved, personally.

On the other hand, charm can also be a winning strategy. As per the well-known Italian proverb — Il mele catta più mosche, che non fà l'aceto — “Honey catches more flies than vinegar.” But that might be somewhat less fun in terms of tech headlines, and we would probably never again get the chance to put ‘random turd files' in a headline if Mr Torvalds decided to turn a new leaf.

Handheld console modder @natalie_thenerd built a Game Boy Color motherboard using a fully clear PCB, allowing us to see its copper circuit traces in all their glory. According to her X (formerly Twitter) post, she built her own schematics to make it work, and she removed the ground zone to make the PCB completely clear. Although this is crucial for modern devices, Natalie says that it's not an issue with the handheld console because of its simplicity.

Clear PCBs feel illegal pic.twitter.com/lqIR3g6AtmAugust 6, 2025

Although the creator reverse-engineered the Game Boy Color on her own, she had the clear PCB created by a third-party provider. It used an acrylic-like material to build the see-through board, which had a low 200-degree Celsius melting point — meaning she had to be extra careful soldering the chips to avoid damage.

Aside from the chips, copper, and screen (and a small daughter board), everything else on her custom Game Boy Color is completely clear. Even the cartridge reader, which she says is from a Chinese Game Boy clone, is semi-transparent. She then paired it with a clear shell that featured translucent keys, making a true ‘see-through' handheld console.

Unfortunately, the custom-built clear Game Boy Color is a one-off art project she made for fun, so you cannot buy one for yourself. The clear PCB is flexible and fragile, meaning it may not withstand the rigors of daily use (or a rage-quitting gamer).

A couple of users suggested replacing the copper traces with silver for a cleaner look, or adding backlighting to make the handheld console look even cooler. Given that Natalie also created the Modded Gameboy Club and is active in the community, there is a possibility that someone might do just that.

A few other people thought about using the same technique on other devices, like the Nothing Phone 2. After all, the transparent aesthetic is experiencing a resurgence in tech circles, with the appearance of clear power banks, SSD enclosures, and more. But unless manufacturers can improve the durability of clear PCBs, and make them more affordable, we will not see this hit the mainstream.

Nevertheless, we applaud Natalie for her great work and marvel at the truly clear Game Boy Color. This is why we love modding and embrace the artistic creations that come out of this creative community.

Not coming until late next year.

Given the recent news cycle surrounding Intel's administration and its ambivalent future ambitions, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the company lacks proactive plans. However, it remains firmly in the chip making business, and the rumor mill is alive as ever. The Blue Team is working on its upcoming Panther Lake (mobile) lineup at the moment, set to release later this year, but it's next year's Nova Lake that has leaked yet again. This time, we have spied the purported exact core configs of all Nova Lake variants, including the top-end Nova Lake-HX chip.

Coming from reliable tipster Jaykihn, Nova Lake will launch in the usual HX, H, and U variants, each targeting different laptop categories. At the top, the highest-end Nova Lake-HX SKU will feature eight P-Cores, 16 E-Cores, and four low-power LP-E Cores, plus a quad-core Xe3 iGPU—a total of 28 CPU cores when added up. That puts it in the same ballpark as the current Arrow Lake 285HX, albeit with a different balance of high-efficiency cores.

Interestingly, this leak does not mention the Nova Lake-AX chips that surfaced earlier. Recently, reports have suggested these are seemingly on the chopping block already, which means Intel still won't have an answer to AMD's Strix Halo. Still, it paints a better picture than Panther Lake, which won't even have an HX variant, but both will fall far behind the rumored 48-core GPU that we might get with Nova Lake-AX.

Nova Lake Mobile2+0+4+24+0+4+44+8+4+44+8+4+128+16+4+4August 9, 2025

The mainstream Nova Lake-H tier will top out at 16 cores (four P-Cores, eight E-Cores, and four LP-E Cores) and offer up to 12 Xe3 GPU cores depending on SKU. These designs share similarities with the previously leaked Panther Lake-H chips, though with different CPU microarchitectures and a slightly altered GPU layout. Anyhow, we then have likely the Nova Lake-U family with a maximum core count of eight (4P+4LP) along with four Xe3 cores going to the iGPU.

On the lowest end, a 2P+4LP model is also expected, carrying only two Xe3 cores, positioned as the successor to Intel's Wildcat Lake platform, catering to budget notebooks where cost and battery life are the main priorities—justifying its lack of standard E-cores. This also means that, if we believe the leak, every single Nova Lake chip is going to have four LP-E cores.

Speaking of all the cores, the Nova Lake lineup is set to also introduce microarchitectures that diverge from the current Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake lineups. We expect to see Coyote Cove P-Cores and Arctic Wolf E-Cores, alongside Skymont-based LP-E cores. As mentioned previously, the GPU cores are from Intel's Xe3 'Celestial' architecture. We also got rumor-mill confirmation that Nova Lake mobile will not use two compute tiles like its desktop counterpart.

These configs round out the Nova Lake lineup. We've included a table below to better illustrate and compare the specs, but keep in mind that this just a rumor, and a potentially far-fetched one at that. Literally. Because Nova Lake is more than a year away and a lot can change before it actually releases. We're likely going to hear more about Nova Lake in the build up to its launch after Panther Lake—set to debut in the second half of this year—comes out, finally bringing Intel's 18A process node to the market.

One of the most important senses we have as bike riders is our hearing. Whether you're in a group ride, where other riders are calling out road and traffic hazards, or alone, to keep ears out for vehicles or other rides coming from our rear, our ears are nearly as essential as our eyes.

Bone-conduction headphones—which sit outside the ears and deliver sound through vibration—have been around for some time. But Irvine, California-based Sena has consistently raised the bar on bicycling helmets with integrated speakers. Their newest offering, the S1, blends Sena's audio technology with the aerodynamic advantages craved by so many road cyclists.

With a smooth outer shell, the Sena S1 looks, fits, and feels every bit the aero road helmet that has boomed in popularity over the last decade. It's sleek, with a quintet of front-facing vents and a pair out the back to keep your head cool during hot rides. Its mixture of flat and gloss finishes gives the helmet a modern contrasting style that would look at home in the Tour de France peloton.

It's light, weighing just 360 grams, and at $229, it's priced like a higher-end aero helmet, despite the fact that it's equipped with a pair of over-ear speakers and a microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, a built-in taillight, and Sena's proprietary Mesh Intercom system, which allows you to communicate with other riders wearing any variety of Sena helmets.

I tested the Sena S1 on one of the stupidest rides I've done in a long time: that is, when I set out to ride a hundred miles around a quarter-mile asphalt track near my home. (I'm not totally insane. I swear I was doing it for another story.) For a ride as boring and monotonous as the ¼-mile century I was set to undertake, I needed a bit of distraction. Luckily, I had a Sena S1 sitting in my office.

I've never really messed with any sort of headphones while on my bike for a few reasons. First and foremost, safety. I like to hear what's happening around me, especially when riding on the road. Second, as far as I'm concerned, hearing the wind in my ears, the birds chirp above my head, my tires cruising smoothly over the pavement or crunching the dirt beneath my wheels, is as much a part of the bike-riding experience as turning my pedals. Third, we live in an age in which we're all subject to a constant onslaught of content. The bike is my sanctuary from all that, a place where no Instagram Reel or hot take on a podcast can find me.

That said, with the doldrums of 400 laps around one track staring me in the face, I decided to set up the S1 to enjoy a bit of music and conversation to pass the time.

Getting my new S1 up and running proved to be no issue. After charging it in full, which took two and a half hours (giving a reported maximum 12 hours of use time), the helmet immediately found and paired with my phone. Once paired, I was able to listen to music and podcasts during my seemingly infinite loop, and take calls from my wife, who reached out every half hour or so for status updates on my silly ride.

If I was doing anything other than turning left some 1,600 times, the Sena S1 could have delivered turn-by-turn directions straight into my ears. Basically, anything your phone or bike computer (ahem … structured workouts) can do via audio, an S1 can relay.

Despite the fact that I was rolling anywhere between 17 and 20 mph and fighting a vicious headwind on the track's backstretch, my wife's calls were shockingly clear, with the little microphone embedded into the helmet's crown picking up everything I was saying to her. Additionally, even as I listened to music, I was able to hear everything that was happening in the world beyond my helmet, which is essential.

A few days before my ride, I put out word to my local cycling community, asking friends to come join me for a dozen laps or a hundred, to keep me company, to keep me sane. One friend, a local racer, volunteered not only to ride with me, but to try a second S1, that we might test out the brand's mesh intercom.

We stayed on opposite sides of the track, talking about our families, news around town, about why the hell I was riding a hundred miles in quarter-mile increments. Just like on the calls with my wife, the sound quality was good, the microphones' noise-canceling technology taking most of the ambient wind out of our back-and-forth.

Now, if you're an audiophile looking for high-end sound quality on your rides, it's best to skip the S1, as the sonics coming out of the speakers is nothing to write home about. Then again, it's ridiculous to expect amazing sound to come from a pair of speakers mounted in a bike helmet that connect to your phone wirelessly. These are amazing times we live in. Enjoy them.

I had only one minor problem with the S1. The helmet only has four buttons—a volume up and down button, a multifunction button, and a light button—which means several different functions are assigned to each. For example, the helmet's volume buttons double as cue buttons, allowing you to scan between music tracks on your phone. The problem is, to change the functions of each button, you have to hold them down for a quick second or two. It's an easy workaround to keep the helmet's buttons limited to four. However, it took me a good bit of usage for the order of operations to become second nature.

But all in all, the S1 is an amazing piece of technology. If you, unlike me, are someone who likes a bit of distraction during your rides, it's more than worth the spend. Unless you're also planning on riding a century, one quarter-mile loop at a time, in which case, it's probably essential.

Intel's presence in the Linux community as a driver developer and maintainer is impacted by layoffs. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Intel is continuing to lay off more Linux maintainers due to corporate restructuring within the company. Phoronix reports that at least four more Intel Linux maintainers have left the company, leaving some of the Linux drivers they worked on without support.

Mustafa Ismail, maintainer of the Intel Ethernet RDMA driver, has left the company, leaving only one other Intel engineer to keep supporting the driver. Intel's Tianfei Zhang, the maintainer for Intel's PTP DFL ToD driver, is also no longer at Intel, leaving the driver without any support. Intel's PTP DFL ToD driver runs the time-of-day device on its FPGA cards.

Intel's WWAN ISOM driver is yet another driver that is now left with zero support, as Intel Linux maintainer M. Chetan Kumar is no longer working at the company. The WWAN ISOM driver is one of Intel's drivers responsible for driving its older M.2 modems.

Keem Bay and Anil S Keshavamurthy have also left Intel. Bay was a DRM driver maintainer, while Keshavamurthy was a maintainer of Intel's kernel probes code, which aids in debugging and performance profiling. Finally, two engineers who worked on the T7XX 5G WWAN driver were also let go, leaving the aforementioned driver without support.

According to other reports by Phoronix, Intel has been losing Linux driver developers/maintainers at an accelerated rate since February of this year. Layoffs have continued to surge since then, with Intel's latest round of layoffs resulting in over 12,000 personnel being cut from the company.

Intel is quickly losing traction in the Linux space due to layoffs of its Linux maintainers. Intel used to maintain a significant presence in Linux kernel development, thanks to its long-standing dominance in the CPU space, and contributed to the development of drivers for various hardware systems, including CPUs, GPUs, storage, and networking. 

If Intel fails to provide replacement Linux maintainers, it will lack the personnel needed for key software and driver support. In that case, we might see an uptrend in hardware reliability and compatibility issues, affecting both enterprise and mainstream users, due to outdated drivers. However, if this happens, the best we can hope for is that the Linux community rises to the challenge to resolve issues without insider help, by developing third-party drivers when needed. The Linux community is renowned for this kind of action, but losing the efficiency and insight from first-party support isn't ideal.

And what really happened to the ‘10 years of deleted data' becomes clear.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A software engineer and developer, who previously accused Amazon Web Services (AWS) of a “digital execution,” has shared the good news that his data has now been restored. What made this impossible task possible was “one human being inside AWS [who] decided to give a damn,” according to data deficit disaster victim Abdelkader Boudih. The same insider source shared some interesting but worrisome insights about what went on behind the scenes during the days when robotic AWS reps insisted Boudih's precious 10 years of data had been “terminated.”

In the earlier episode, we heard about an unnamed insider at AWS reaching out to Boudih. That character was never verified, though they apparently knew too much about this particular case to be a common prankster. Around the same time as we reported on the original debacle, an AWS employee had reached out via official channels to give hope that there would be some way to recover the precious data.

Tarus Balog was basically the first ‘human' level contact from AWS, according to Boudih. Previous AWS-sourced responses were, in comparison, of a very scripted nature. However, Balog showed empathy and seemed to speak as someone with authority, telling the already long-suffering software engineer that leaders at AWS were aware of his data deletion blog, and were looking to make sure such cases were prevented, going forward.

Balog initially refrained from promising to recover the lost data, but cogs were definitely whirring at AWS at this point (August 5). The case was escalated to the top-level severity ticket available to ‘mortals', and apparently the AWS CEO actually became aware of this particular incident at this time.

The next morning (August 6), Boudih woke to the news – officially from Amazon – that his account had been restored. Though this was extremely welcome news, it was tainted with “AWS support's incompetence - or deception,” according to the blog update.

What stuck in Boudih's craw was the prior insistence of AWS staffers that all his data had been terminated. “The instances were stopped. Not terminated. Stopped.” Stressed the engineer, obviously angry about what he called “gaslighting” by previous AWS contacts. Moreover, his RDS instanced had been backed up as recently as July 19 – several days after support had insisted that everything was “terminated.”

Nevertheless, Boudih refrained from insisting AWS reps were outright lying. There was also the possibility that there was an “undocumented ability to restore ‘terminated' instances - which would make sense as a safeguard against internal sabotage or mistakes.” There is also the excuse of AWS employee incompetence to consider, but Boudih seems to favor the theory that that prior support contacts “gaslit me about infrastructure.”

According to Reddit threads that spawned in the wake of Boudih's dizzying initial post, this alarming case was far from unique. The shared payer model has inherent flaws, other social media users appeared to confirm, especially if one party defaults on payments due. This appears to be what caused the software engineer's AWS account and data to be suspended, then terminated.

Account suspension is "part of AWS's standard security protocols for accounts that fail the required verification," AWS stated in an email to Tom's Hardware. But it didn't explain the apparent subsequent and rapid termination.

In the previous story, Boudih mused whether an account suspension could be escalated to termination, due to some billing issue with a previous shared payment party. That looks quite likely in retrospect.

Boudih ends his update by summing up the lessons learned from his painful episode, and by offering some advice to AWS.

Firstly, the software engineer is now going to indulge in “Double and triple backups. Distributed across providers. Encrypted with keys I control.” That sounds sensible, and addresses a fair section of the Tom's Hardware comments section regarding the initial data loss story.

As for AWS, Boudih doesn't want it destroyed but ‘Terraforming.' He explains this idea as using simple preventions to mitigate against overreactions to issues affecting customers. Specifically, he suggests that AWS improve its architecture, communication, and support systems to prevent issues that “punish legitimate users.”

If you, like practically anyone else with a cell phone in the U.S. and beyond, have received a scam text message about an unpaid toll or undelivered mail item, there's a good chance you have been targeted by a prolific scamming operation.

The scam isn't particularly complex, but it has been highly effective. By sending spam text messages that look like genuine notifications for popular services, from postal deliveries to local government programs, unsuspecting victims click a link that loads a phishing page, they enter their credit card details, and that information is swiped and used for fraud.

During a period of seven months in 2024, the scam netted at least 884,000 stolen credit card details, allowing scammers to cash in on their victims' accounts. Some victims lost thousands of dollars in the scam, researchers say.

But a series of opsec mistakes ultimately led security researchers and investigative journalists to the real-world identity of the maker of the scamming software, Magic Cat, who researchers say goes by the handle Darcula. 

As revealed by the Oslo-headquartered security firm Mnemonic and reported in tandem by Norwegian media earlier this year, behind the fluffy cute cat in Darcula's profile photos is a 24-year-old Chinese national named Yucheng C.

The researchers say Yucheng C. develops Magic Cat for his hundreds of customers, who use the software to launch their own SMS text message scam campaigns at their victims.

Soon after he was unmasked, Darcula went dark and his scam operation has not seen any updates since, leaving his customers in the lurch. But in its wake, a new operation has emerged and is already vastly outpacing its predecessor.

Researchers are now sounding the alarm on the new fraud operation, Magic Mouse, which rose from the ashes of Magic Cat. 

Ahead of sharing new findings at the Def Con security conference in Las Vegas on Friday, Harrison Sand, an offensive security consultant at Mnemonic, told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse has been surging in popularity since the demise of Darcula's Magic Cat. 

Sand also warned of the operation's growing ability to steal people's credit cards on a massive scale.

During their investigation, Mnemonic found photos from inside the operation posted in a Telegram channel that Darcula administered, showing a line-up of credit card payment terminals and videos showing racks with dozens of phones used for automating the sending of messages to victims. 

The scammers use the card details in mobile wallets on phones and conduct payment fraud, laundering their funds into other bank accounts. Some of the phones had mobile wallets overflowing with other people's stolen cards, ready to be used for mobile transactions. 

Sand told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse is already responsible for the theft of at least 650,000 credit cards a month.

While evidence suggests Magic Mouse is an entirely new operation, coded by new developers and likely unrelated to Darcula, much of Magic Mouse's success stems from the new operators stealing the phishing kits that made its predecessor's software so popular. Sand said these kits contain hundreds of phishing sites that Magic Cat used to mimic the legitimate web pages of major tech giants, popular consumer services, and delivery firms, all designed to trick victims into handing over their credit card details.

But despite the prolific nature of Magic Cat and, now, Magic Mouse, and their ability to net millions of dollars in stolen funds from consumers, Sand told TechCrunch in a call that law enforcement is not looking beyond a few scattered reports of fraud or at the wider operation behind the scheme. 

Instead, Sand said, it is the tech companies and financial giants who shoulder much of the responsibility for allowing these scams to exist and thrive, and for not making it more difficult for scammers to use stolen cards. 

As for anyone who receives a suspicious text, ignoring an unwanted message might be the best policy.

I'm sitting in a coffee shop in front of four monitors. One of those screens is just my laptop, a very normal thing to have a cuppa joe next to. The other three are the portable displays of the Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max, a monumental contraption of aluminum and matte glass that's looming over my computer, giving off Mr. Universe vibes. Nobody seems to care about this very conspicuous tech monstrosity, and that's a blessing because with all of these screens in front of me, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm the Worst Person Here.

“Portable” triple-monitor accessories that give your laptop more pixels to work on spreadsheets or whatever multitasking you may require to boost your productivity aren't new. In recent years, cheap display command centers have been flooding social media as a life hack product. I thought it would be fun to take the Triple Aero out into the wild, both to test its tote-ability and to see how socially capable I am of using it in public. I don't know why I do these things to myself.

Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max

The Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max is a cool idea to add three screens to a laptop, but it's hampered by bad displays and a too-high price.

Pros

Cons

This setup has appeal, especially if, like me, you find the cramped confines of a laptop display unworkable, but sitting in the same room for hours and hours, every day, with your dedicated multi-monitor setup feels a little like hell to you. My usual solution for working away from home is to use my 11-inch iPad Pro as a wireless external display. It's not ideal, and I always wonder if I can have it both ways.

The Triple Aero features three 15.6-inch, 1080p IPS LCD displays on a folding, height-adjustable stand that put it high enough for me to work with proper computer posture instead of hunched over like a laptop gremlin. The displays are just bright enough that I didn't have trouble viewing them in a window-filled coffee shop, but you might have trouble seeing if, on a very bright day, one of those windows is behind the Triple Aero. The display casings and stand are black and made of aluminum. There are technically speakers, but they're harsh and tinny, and you should not use them.

On the bottom edge of the middle display, you'll find two USB-C ports: one to power the screens and the other to accept video from your laptop, as well as give it passthrough power. There are also three Micro HDMI ports, each corresponding to one of the displays, useful if you want to connect multiple devices rather than just a single computer. The Triple Aero comes with a 65W power adapter that generously features two USB-C ports and a single USB-A port.

This isn't a pretty device, but that's not really the point, is it? To buy something like the Triple Aero is to admit that all you're after is a hojillion displays. Given its utilitarian vibe, it's irritating to me that, presumably for misguided aesthetic reasons, Aura put its port labels on the back of the Triple Aero instead of the front. I don't care about that in a stationary desk monitor that I'm only ever going to hook up once, but the Triple Aero is meant to travel, and it's too unwieldy to spin around to make sure I'm plugging things into the proper ports, so you have to lean around back to see which one is which. Aura also doesn't label the buttons, leaving you to figure out how to adjust the monitor's internal settings. I guess I could label everything myself with a strip of tape and a Sharpie, or Aura could just put the labels on the front!

Actually using the Triple Aero is a mixed bag, and I don't just mean because it feels weird to set it up in public if that's what you choose to do with it. On one hand, the matte finish IPS displays keep a fairly consistent image, even from broad viewing angles. But on the other, they're better for spreadsheets and text documents than they are for, say, Oppenheimer. And they're not even great for that if the software you're working with calls for a monitor with very good color separation—for instance, in macOS, I had a hard time telling between the gray of an active Safari window and the slightly lighter gray of an inactive one. As a result, I just kept trying to type in windows I thought were in the foreground and weren't.

It's not just the color reproduction that makes the Triple Aero unsuitable for more than casual content consumption. Driving the displays requires software—in this case, SiliconMotion's InstantView—that essentially screen-records virtual displays on your computer, compresses the video for transmission over USB-C, then hardware-decodes it inside the Triple Aero. This is fine for basic tasks, but it takes a decent chunk of CPU power to run, and I've never met a version of it that doesn't needle you with small bugs. It can take a few tries plugging it in before your computer recognizes it; you may have to rearrange the displays every few tries so your Mac actually knows which is which; the display can lag, with your mouse disappearing and reappearing at random. That last one is especially common if you try to watch a high-bitrate movie or play a video game. (Death Stranding was unplayable when I tried.)

Maybe that's all fine if you're only using the Triple Aero occasionally, but it immediately reminded me why I gave up using similar tech to add dual display support to my old M1 iMac after just a few weeks. You won't get these problems if you only use the Triple Aero's three Micro HDMI ports, but you'd need a computer that supports that many external displays, which many Apple silicon-equipped Macs do not, along with a Thunderbolt dock that sports three HDMI outputs—and again, many do not.

The Triple Aero, with its elaborate form factor, has its perks. I like the foldable side displays, and my neck was grateful for its height. And since you can use the HDMI ports individually, you and two others can each have an external display. Also, I bet having the displays folded back into a triangle would also be a very fun way to game with friends, old-timey LAN party-style. I didn't get to try that, but I feel it in my bones—show me a few people, a Triple Aero, and three Nintendo Switches (or Switch 2s) equipped with some flavor of Mario Kart, and I'll show you a good time.

Also in the plus column, the Triple Aero isn't overly jiggly even with two displays hanging way off its stand. The contraption folds down to about the size of a large gaming laptop, with the stand pulling double duty as a suitcase-style handle. That said, you'll need to get creative to transport the 7-pound unit, as it's got the wrong proportions for a laptop case and the box it ships in is too big to casually toss into a backpack. Aura does sell a felt sleeve and a zippable soft case that each accommodate the Triple Aero, but without a hard case I would still worry about pointed impacts to one of the displays, which faces outwardly when folded for travel.

At $699, the Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max falls squarely in the category of things I think would be very handy to have, but would never buy for myself. I just can't see paying as much or more than a decent 4K portable monitor like the Espresso Pro, which is priced the same but is far more premium-feeling, judging by reviews praising its image quality and neat iPad-like modularity.

Sure, you lose overall screen real estate with the Espresso, but it sounds like a much more pleasant experience, and you don't have to screw around with drivers that force external display support that your laptop's hardware potentially doesn't do natively. And it probably feels a lot less awkward to use in public.

I've never had particularly sensitive nipples—except for the first time I went to a clothing-optional beach and failed to use enough sunblock—so I was excited to give the Lovense Gemini a try.

No, it has nothing to do with Google's AI chatbot. These are vibrating nipple clamps from Lovense, and I've had great experience with many of the company's sex toys. Many of my partners have had sensitive nipples, so I was curious if I could join the ranks with the Gemini. Usually sold for less than $80, they're an inexpensive way to spice up the bedroom.

After I fully charged the Gemini, which takes about an hour or so, I used it on myself. What I love is that I can clip the base of the clamps to my bra (there's also a cord you can put around your neck if you don't wear a bra), making them 100 percent hands-free.

The Gemini is app-controlled (Android, iOS), so I can lie back and play with the slew of intensities and patterns—surprisingly fun even though I was solo. When I added a bullet vibrator to the mix, the vibrations all over made everything even more exciting in a low-key, kinky sort of way. I also appreciate that the clamps are adjustable, so if you love a tight squeeze, a barely there hold, or somewhere in between, you have options.

Unlike some of the more intimate toys I've reviewed, like the Luxus Couples Vibrator or the Lelo Ora 3, I was able to get input from a handful of people with the Gemini. Especially people I know who really (like, really) love nipple play. As much as I enjoyed the vibrations and found the sensation interesting, the Gemini made me realize that, ultimately, I prefer that my nipples get attention from a partner's tongue or with a slight graze of their teeth.

Of the three nipple-play aficionados I used the Gemini with—one straight and two gay men—all of them became immediate fans of the toy. They liked the hands-free design and the simplicity of the Lovense Remote app. To paint a picture of this experiment, I had the app in hand, and three men sat on the couch across from me, waiting for their turn to try the Gemini. (It's the closest I'll probably ever get to an orgy.) Each man had a different preference in intensity and patterns, as well as the tightness of the clamps, so I was able to see just how much the Gemini can be the perfect fit for anyone who's into nipple play.

The Gemini is well-built, too. Not only is it waterproof—for all those times you're craving a proper buzz on your nips while in the shower—but you also get a whopping two hours of run time when it's fully charged. The device is discreet, in case you're into public play where one partner enjoys the vibrations, while the other controls what they want you to feel.

My only gripe is that it can take a bit for your phone to connect to the Gemini. When it does, it's smooth sailing. If you're not an app person, don't sweat it. It allows for both short- and long-distance play, but the Gemini can also be controlled with the one button on the main part of the device, so you can forgo the app. It's here that you can turn it on and off by holding the button down for about three seconds.

The biggest selling point is that it takes nipple play to new heights. I'm not just talking about the vibrations, but the reality that we're dealing with actual nipple clamps that might scare some away. If you dip your toe into nipple clamps, what's next? A ball gag? A latex fetish? Are you headed toward orgy territory à la Jerry Seinfeld? Will you have to dress and act differently, grow a mustache, get robes and lotions, and a new bedspread and curtains?

The Gemini brings another sensation to the equation that, yes, might be the intro to BDSM you've been needing. On Lovense's website, the company says the Gemini bridges the intimacy gap and can play a role in light BDSM. But ignore all of that. The Gemini delivers great vibrations, and if you're someone who loves nipple play, I strongly recommend giving it a shot. Even if you don't think it's for you, it will open your mind up to something new, and that newness might be everything your nipples have been seeking.

Matt Turner is back in MLS, and back with the clean sheets. 

After a tumultuous few seasons in Europe, and a recent transfer saga between Premier League side Nottingham Forest, Ligue 1 club Lyon and the New England Revolution, the U.S. men's national team goalkeeper began to find some stability on Saturday night at Gillette Stadium.

While Turner had struggled to find playing time during spells at Arsenal, Forest and Crystal Palace since leaving the Revolution in 2021, it was like no time had passed, as he started in a 2–0 win against D.C. United. 

“It was pretty emotional walking out for me,” Turner said after the match. “Just being back in the stadium, feeling the love from the warmup, to before the game, to everything, I love it here. I love New England, it's really like home for me.”

Neither New England nor D.C. are likely playoff teams this season, sitting 11th and 15th in the Eastern Conference after the match, but it was still a homecoming of sorts for Turner, and some much needed stability. 

The 2021 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year made three stops, as the Revolution snapped a nine-game winless run. It also ensured an upbeat occasion for the alumni in the building, which included club greats such as Alexis Lalas, Taylor Twellman, Gustavo Bou and many others. 

Meanwhile, the stops also allowed Carles Gil to have his record-breaking moment come in a victory, as his ninth goal of the season pushed him past the attending Twellman for most goal contributions in club history with 130.

“For me, it was more than just showing up, but also understanding that there's something to achieve, something to do. So, I want to put in good performances,” Turner added. “I was really happy to be here for Carles. He's such an unassuming, quiet guy, but he is a leader. He's a leader in the way that he cares, and in the way that he always contributes with goals and assists.”

“He's just such an amazing player and such an amazing talent. I think there's no one more deserving to have that record for this club right now.”

As much as the Revolution needed a jolt to their play this season under head coach Caleb Porter, Turner also needed the regular minutes to earn back his starting role with the USMNT ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

While 2025 began with Turner as the outright starter, a lack of playing time in Europe, and dismal performances at the Concacaf Nations League in March saw him surrender the role to New York City FC's Matt Freese at the summer's Concacaf Gold Cup.

Although the move to MLS may have been seen as a downgrade, it's allowing him to play regular minutes and also return to a club and environment where he knows he can thrive. 

At the same time, a little bit of form could re-ignite the USMNT goalkeeper battle with Turner and Freese jockeying for the role alongside Chicago Fire FC's Chris Brady, and Zack Steffen of the Colorado Rapids, among others. 

“You could see in the first couple of crosses, he comes to the edge of the box and plucks it. He makes a couple of key saves, a big one in the first half...his presence, his distribution, really helped us,” Porter said of Turner, even as the Revolution sit eight points out of a playoff spot with nine matches remaining. 

“This is a good three points... It feels good, but we've gotta do it again next week. We've gotta find a way against a really talented team with really talented players, but I think our group can do it.”

Arne Slot and Oliver Glasner's sides could only be separated by spot kicks at Wembley, with the FA Cup winners trumping the Premier League champions

Liverpool were beaten in the Community Shield by Crystal Palace on Sunday, with the Eagles earning a 2-2 draw before winning via a penalty shootout. The Reds failed to put a winnable game beyond Oliver Glasner's side and were denied victory in the season's traditional curtain raiser.

A disappointing afternoon for the Merseysiders did begin brightly, as it took only four minutes for Liverpool to have lift-off, and it came from one of their newer faces. At the end of an extremely lengthy spell of possession - 22 passes featuring nine players, to be precise - Hugo Ekitike received the ball inside the left channel from fellow summer signing Florian Wirtz, and proceeded to dance his way between a horde of Palace defenders before curling an effort from the edge of the box into the far right corner, well out of the reach of goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

However, a few seconds of madness at the back saw the Reds pegged back midway through the first half. Firstly, Jean-Philippe Mateta broke the offside trap and had only Alisson Becker to beat, only to fail to round the goalkeeper. However, Palace regained possession in the ensuing scramble, with Virgil van Dijk tripping Ismaila Sarr and conceding a penalty. Mateta subsequently stepped up and sent the Brazilian the wrong way to bring the Eagles level.

But Palace were only on equal terms for a matter of minutes, as another Liverpool new boy got on the scoresheet when Jeremie Frimpong scampered away down the right flank beyond Tyrick Mitchell and appeared to dink a cross towards the back post, only for it to float over Henderson and inside the net instead, restoring the Reds' lead.

Liverpool had chances to kill the game off in the second half, and were made to pay for their wastefulness when Palace equalised once more in the closing stages. Adam Wharton's clipped pass found Sarr galloping away from Van Dijk and the Senegal forward squeezed the ball in off the near post.

The south Londoners grew in confidence, and Liverpool had Milos Kerkez to thank for making a last-ditch challenge to deny Sarr his brace moments after he had scored Palace's second. VAR checked for a penalty for a handball against Alexis Mac Allister in the build up, though controversially decided the on-field decision was allowed to freely stand.

With the score at 2-2 at the end of 90 minutes, the tie went to a penalty shootout. Mohamed Salah, Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott all missed from 12 yards, however, as Palace triumphed 3-2 on spot kicks.

Former Liverpool star Jermaine Pennant has thrown down the gauntlet to Newcastle United, sell Alexander Isak to Liverpool for £110 million ($148m) or risk a season of drama and disappointment. Pennant believes the Magpies are playing with fire by holding on to an unsettled striker, insisting a quick sale would end the saga and give Eddie Howe the funds to rebuild before the new campaign kicks off.

The 21-year-old, who scored 27 goals last season, is focused on helping the Dragons win the title and improving his numbers, with local media insisting he's not tempted by 'greed' or a Premier League switch.

Club World Cup champions continue their short run-up to the Premier League season with a visit from AC Milan to Stamford Bridge on Sunday for a preseason friendly.

Chelsea have Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan in a three-day span as Enzo Maresca has everyone back from the break earned following last month's 3-0 upset of Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup Final.

The Blues have a bunch of new faces for this season, a figure that's even higher if you count players they added prior to or during the Club World Cup. Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato, and Estevao Willian are in the fold, and the Blues continue to be linked with further additions. That list may grow as Levi Colwill has now suffered a long-term injury.

This match is AC Milan's last friendly prior to the Coppa Italia first round against Bari at the San Siro on August 18. Max Allegri's men are 3-0 this preseason, beating Arsenal on penalties before taking care of Liverpool and Perth Glory over 90 minutes.

Ex-Chelsea men Christian Pulisic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and Fikayo Tomori give Milan plenty of familiarity with the venue.

For live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs AC Milan, check out PST's live blog coverage below.

Kick off time: 10am ET Sunday (August 10)Venue: Stamford Bridge — LondonTV Channel/Streaming: DAZN

The Colwill injury suddenly makes the Blues thin at a position they were merely adequate in depth prior to this point. Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, and Trevoh Chalobah are with the club while Mamadou Sarr has been loaned to Strasbourg, Chelsea are quite deep in attack and may still add this summer as Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move to London.

Milan have made four notable additions this summer. While Brighton export Pervis Estupinan and Real Madrid free transfer Luka Modric will take a lot of the headlines, A pair of 23-year-old midfielders, however, are perhaps the more intriguing additions to Milan's project. Samuele Ricci (Torino)Ii is a box-to-box type with 10 caps for Italy who Milan are hoping gives them a true maestro for the long haul, while Swiss star Ardon Jashari arrives from Club Brugge off an impressive season in Belgium after multiple campaigns with Luzern in his home country.

Should be a fun one as both teams will almost certainly be in a dress rehearsal for meaningful action the following week. Let's predict goals. Chelsea 2-1 AC Milan

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than a year away, and preparations to ensure the tournament runs seamlessly have commenced, with organizers now recruiting volunteers.

The upcoming edition of the World Cup will take place across Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with 16 cities throughout the three nations scheduled to host matches. Notably, the 2026 World Cup will mark the first occasion that three countries jointly host games, featuring a record-breaking 48 teams in competition.

Dallas, Texas, stands among the cities designated to host World Cup action, with AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, slated to stage nine matches. In advance of the approaching tournament, FIFA plans to launch volunteer applications to assist with the celebrations, requiring more than 6,000 volunteers for the organization.

Potential volunteers must be a minimum of 18 years old to qualify and must consent to face-to-face interviews, plus successfully complete background screening.

Interviews are scheduled to begin in November and December, with final selections occurring in January and February. Preparation starts in April.

Selected volunteers will be required to complete nine shifts lasting six to eight hours each, contributing to guest services, media operations, hospitality, fan operations, and additional responsibilities. Vaca emphasized that bilingual and trilingual candidates represent "an absolute plus."

World Cup volunteers are buzzing with excitement as they anticipate receiving their uniforms and accreditation in May and June.

Vaca, one of the lucky individuals selected for this honor, can't wait to don the official FIFA World Cup volunteer gear.

She enthused: "The one benefit that everybody talks about, and the reason why the FIFA volunteer program is a coveted role, you're an ambassador to the North Texas region, but you're also receiving the official FIFA World Cup uniform package by Adidas.

"It includes the shoes, the hat, the shirt, the backpack; those official uniforms are coveted, and they are earned. So that is one of the biggest perks. The other is just getting to meet people all around the world."

As Dallas-Fort Worth gears up for the grand soccer event, MetLife Stadium, notoriously dubbed the worst in the NFL and home to the New York Giants and Jets, is set to host eight matches. Jets standout receiver Garrett Wilson didn't mince words about the subpar playing surface.

"It's garbage, man," Wilson declared in 2024. "You're out there running and all of a sudden your legs aren't in the same place your head is at. What's the difference between (practice during) the week, and now? You look down, and you see the turf.

"Everyone's got to play on it, everyone is trying to do what they can. I'm figuring it out."

It's worth mentioning that MetLife Stadium was also the site of NFL icon Aaron Rodgers' Achilles injury.

Tommy Paul played his first tour-level match in over a month and secured a victory in his opening clash at the Cincinnati Open. 

Kicking off his North American hard swing, the US star comfortably defeated Pedro Martinez in straight sets, besting the Spaniard 6-2, 6-2. 

It was his first professional bout since the third of July, when Paul's Wimbledon campaign ended in the second round after losing to Sebastian Ofner.

He joined a long list of seeded stars who exited the All England Club in the early rounds, including Alexander Zverev, Jack Draper, and Holger Rune.

After his lengthy break away from the sport, Paul said there has been a ‘crazy' change on the ATP Tour recently. 

Speaking to Tennis Channel after his victory, he said: “What's crazy is I feel like everyone can do everything now.

“[Jannik] Sinner is coming in [to the net] so much more now, I mean, you can tell it's something that he's been working on. 

“If he gets to the point where he's perfecting that, it's going to be really scary. It's already scary, but that's a real complete player. 

“And then with Ben [Shelton], I mean, I feel like he's always been an aggressive player. What I noticed in the tournament last week [the Canadian Open] was, I mean, he was really extending points.

“He was slicing his back in a ton. He was drawing his opponents forward. I mean, in the match versus Khachanov, it was incredible to me, like the amount of short slices he did to bring him into the net.

“Ben's always been pretty good at the net, but he's gotten a lot better. I mean, it's really great to see. I love watching that kind of tennis.

“I mean, even [Jenson] Brooksby, Brooksby does a lot of the short slices and gets to the net and just makes it uncomfortable. I like that stuff.”

Paul is currently ranked 16th in the world, but now has a chance to close in on the top ten at the Cincinnati Open. 

At the tournament last year, the American crashed out of the Masters 1000 in his opening matchup, suffering defeat to Flavio Cobolli over three sets. 

With his win over Martinez, he has already surpassed his finish in 2024, and can now pick up some valuable points. 

His next opponent is Adrian Mannarino, against whom he has a head-to-head record of 1-1.

The very best tennis stars are all in action at the Cincinnati Open over the coming week. Many, including Britain's Emma Raducanu, have already got their campaigns underway in the final piece of preparation ahead of the US Open.

Raducanu breezed past Olga Danilovic 6-3 6-2 in her second-round match, the first played in front of Francis Roig as her full-time coach. A rematch with Wimbledon nemesis Aryna Sabalenka awaits in the third round. It will provide a litmus test of her progress this summer, after the 22-year-old pushed the world No. 1 far in her two-sets defeat on Centre Court a little over a month ago. Express Sport will bring you the very best news, gossip and reaction from the Cincinnati Open.

Rielly Opelka has beaten Alex De Minaur for the first time in his career.

The big-serving American wins 7-6(6) 6-4 to reach the third round in Cincinnati.

Frances Tiafoe has joking claimed that fellow American Jessica Pegula no longer wants to practice with him because she has become too "big time."

Pegula reached the US Open final last year and climbed to No.4 in the world.

"She hits the ball so pure and right in pocket every time. She's pretty relaxed as well. But she doesn't want to hit with me any more," Tiafoe said.

"She's made some finals now in some slams, 1000s, and she doesn't want to talk to me as much any more. She got too big time for me. She forgot about the little people."

Roger Federer has confirmed that he will return to the tennis court at the Shangai Masters in October.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion is set to play in a charity celebrity doubles match.

"Hello, this is Roger, and I am really happy to be returning to Qizhong Stadium in Shanghai for the Rolex Shanghai Masters," the 44-year-old said in an announcement video.

"Shanghai has always been a special place for me, with great fans, unforgettable memories, and a real love for the game.

"I look forward to seeing you there on October 10. Shanghai, let's meet."

Alexander Zverev is gearing up for his first match at the Cincinnati Open in today's evening session but he is not a fan of the courts being used.

He complained: "Cincinnati was a very fast tournament in the past, but it's become extremely slow now. I'm not sure what the reason behind this is the choice, especially since in New York the courts will be very fast again.

"I'm not a huge fan of this surface. I just hope to play good tennis and get as far as possible."

Canadian Open tournament director Karl Hale has taken aim at Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for skipping the event this year.

Both took time out following their epic battle at Wimbledon last month.

But Hale said: “As far as the top player withdrawal, it's definitely not what we want. Draper's out for Cincy as well in the season, Novak's out for Cincy as well. So those players, you know, were injuries.

"I think Carlos and Sinner have to look at our tour, the ATP tour, and commit to these majors, you know. So we're in talks with them to ensure that going forward that they'll be participating in our event."

Coco Gauff has joked that American's men need to catch up.

No American man has won a Grand Slam since Andy Roddick in 2003.

Gauff joked: "It hasn't been much of competition, no offence to them. They have to catch up.”

She added: “That's the beautiful thing about being an American. All of us look different. We have biracial, black, white [players], all types of representation for girls and guys to look up to in the Top 10, or close to the Top 10. That's something beautiful about our country, how diverse it is, and I hope that in this sport it continues to grow."



Iga Swiatek has argued that the Cincinatti Open balls are ‘very different' from the ones used at Wimbledon and during the clay-court season.

The Polish star said: "I try to be humble and remember that you have to adapt to these balls because they don't give you any advantage in and of themselves.

They are light and very different from the ones we play on clay or at Wimbledon, the only way to deal with them is to focus on adapting as much as possible and accepting that there will be shots that will escape your racket, trying to control them as much as possible.”

Swiatek defeated Anastasia Potapova 6-1 6-4 in her first match in Cincinnati.

Carlos Alcaraz will play for the first time since the Wimbledon final today.

The Spaniard has taken a short break since his defeat against Jannik Sinner in last month's showdown.

Alcaraz faces Damir Dzumhur at the Cincinnati Open today. He is currently expected on court at around 6.20pm UK time.

Aryna Sabalenka has requested a bigger dining room at the Cincinnati Open.

Tournament bosses have made widespread changes to the facilities, and the world No. 1 is largely impressed.

But she complained that the dining room is too small.

Sabalenka said: "The first time I came back, I was like, ‘Where am I?'. It's a completely different tournament, it's an impressive job done. Just wow.

"Everything is so confusing! Little by little I'm getting used to it.

"My only request is that next year we make the dining room a bit bigger. There are so many people and so little tables, please! Next year let's make sure there's more space in the dining room.

"Everyone likes to eat, everyone likes to spend time there. We need a bigger room!

"Other than that, oh my gosh, it's even more enjoyable to be here."

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina retired from his Cincinnati Open clash with Joao Fonseca.

The Spaniard led 7-6 4-0 at one stage of the match but then inexplicably dropped five straight games.

Fokina retired at 7-6 4-5 to send Fonseca through to the next round.



Novak Djokovic's former coach has backed Jannik Sinner to win a Career Slam in the next seven years.

Riccardo Piatti believes it will not be long before Sinner is a French Open champion.

The Italian has already won the three other majors - Wimbledon, the Australian Open and US Open.

“Jannik has taken a big step forward this past year. He's also become very competitive on the clay-court tour,” Piatti told La Stampa.

“He's realised that in the next six or seven years, he'll have the opportunity to complete the Grand Slam. This is something I've always thought about.

“In Paris, the bet was more on Carlos, at Wimbledon more on Jannik, but in any case, they have two different styles and two different personalities, which is fine.

“They both know how the world works. They know that there are fans who want one to win and others who enjoy seeing them fall more, but that's the way sport is.”

Danielle Collins has hit out at 'keyboard warriors' for mocking her viral outburst at the Cincinnati Open.

The American seemed hugely emotional during her defeat against Taylor Townsend, and seemed to shout in pain at her team.

"Anyone who has a herniated disc knows my pain," Collins wrote on Instagram.

"It's no surprise the keyboard warriors can't understand or relate, as they've been too busy sitting on a**es judging people who show up and and try to give it their best even on days that suck.

"Thank you to everyone who has been praying for my injury and thank you to Taylor Townsend for being the best of the best."

Emma Raducanu has shared some blunt early conversations with Francis Roig.

The British No. 1 says they have both agreed that all of her shots need to improve, particularly if she is to consistently challenge the likes of Aryna Sabalenka - her next Cincinnati Open opponent.

“It's just, 'the level needs to be better'. In a good way, not in a negative way. It's just calling it how it is," Raducanu said of her conversations with the Spaniard, who coached Rafael Nadal to each of his 22 Grand Slams.

"And I'm very like that. I'm very factual and I don't necessarily like fluffing something up. I think that's where we get on really well and we understand each other.

"Just in general, everything is like: ‘We need to improve. We need to get every shot better.' And that's exciting, because I feel like there's a lot of potential to go and I don't think I'm near it.

“You always feel a little bit of nerves before the first round, but I think that overall, I'm approaching everything in a lot more calm way, mature, and I think I'm trusting a lot more the work I'm doing behind the scenes. I know I'm putting a lot of hours in, and it takes some of the pressure off of the results.

“I think the way I'm playing, the movements of my shot, improving the quality of my shot. There were four or five points where I did something that we were working on, and it's always really satisfying and rewarding when you hit a shot and you've worked on it in practice. So I think I'm going to improve a lot, hopefully doing the work day in, day out.”



Frances Tiafoe has given a student £22,300 to complete his studies.

Russell Lokko received the cheque in Cincinnati and can now complete his junior and senior years debt-free.

Tiafoe said: "This is what it's all about. Nothing better than paying it forward.

“This is great, I'm excited to get it out. To see how ecstatic he was with being able to take care of his junior and senior career, it's a huge deal. [Being] the son of immigrants, I've been in that seat, I know how it is.”

Jannik Sinner has snubbed a golf reunion with Carlos Alcaraz weeks after they Wimbledon battle.

Sinner has previously played golf with Alcaraz, but now insists the Spaniard is too good for him.

Speaking ahead of the Cincinnati Open, the Italian said: "[My team] actually played now a couple of times before the tournament here. I'm not a good golfer, but I love to spend time doing different things now. And we were just talking, maybe now we go [to the course], because it's also not late.

"Tomorrow I have one day off, so maybe we play a couple of holes here. Also last year, here it's the best place to play golf.

"In Cincinnati there's not so much to do, so we're actually lucky that the golf course is there.

"The first hole is, okay, should be straight, you know, but on the left there are all cars, and if one ball finished in the car, everyone, it's me."

Asked if he will play golf with Alcaraz, Sinner joked: "Carlos is too good for me. Me and my team is better."

Emma Raducanu has warned her rivals that momentum is on her side.

A blistering 6-3 6-2 defeat of Olga Danilovic, who had beaten Katie Boulter in the first round, opened Raducanu's Cincinnati Open campaign with a bang.

It was the 22-year-old's first match in front of new full-time coach Francis Roig.

"I'm really building some momentum. I'm really happy with how I've stayed pretty consistent over the last few months," said Raducanu.

"I still feel like there's a long way to go but just working hard behind the scenes, putting a lot of hours in and hoping I can trust in that."

Aryna Sabalenka awaits in the third round.

This tournament is Raducanu's last piece of preparation before she returns to the scene of her greatest triumph, the US Open.

Reilly Opelka snapped a five-match losing streak to Alex de Minaur on Sunday at the Cincinnati Open, where he upset the Australian 7-6(6), 6-4 to reach the third round in Ohio.

The big-serving American had lost his five previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings against De Minaur and was trying to avoid falling to the same opponent on six occasions for the first time. In hot conditions, the 27-year-old did just that, taking large cuts at the ball on return and saving all seven break points he faced to record his ninth Top 10 win after one hour and 41 minutes.

"I didn't serve as well as I'd have liked to, but everything else was working," said Opelka, who won 76 per cent of his first-serve points and 69 per cent of his second-serve points. "My forehand helped me a lot and my backhand, playing with a lot of offense and I was pretty consistent from the baseline the whole match. My serve fluctuated and it was a bit of a surprise that the other things came through well for me today. I think I returned really well too."

World No. 8 De Minaur arrived in Cincinnati having earned a Tour-leading 24 hard-court wins this season, highlighted by his recent title triumph in Washington. However, he was unable to convert his opportunities against Opelka, who struck a huge forehand winner on return at 5/5 in the first-set tie-break en route to claiming the opener.

Opelka is up nine spots to No. 64 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will next meet Francisco Comesana after the Argentine advanced on Sunday when 29th seed Luciano Darderi retired trailing 4-6, 1-3.
Opelka has produced some of his best tennis on the North American hard courts in the past, reaching the final at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Toronto in 2021 and the fourth round at the US Open in the same year. He clubbed 38 winners, including 14 aces, to De Minaur's six winners, with the Australian frequently returning second serves above shoulder height.

In other early action, ninth seed Andrey Rublev moved past #NextGenATP American Learner Tien 7-6(4), 6-3 to reach the third round. Rublev arrived in Cincinnati off the back of a quarter-final showing in Toronto, his best ATP Masters 1000 result of the year. The No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings will meet Alexei Popyrin or #NextGenATP Spaniard Martin Landaluce in the last 32.





There was Czech success for Jakub Mensik and Jiri Lehecka. Miami champion Mensik, 19, defeated American Ethan Quinn 6-4, 6-2 to earn his first win at the hard-court Masters 1000 event. Jiri Lehecka rallied past American Tristan Boyer 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 to reach the third round.

Opelka is up nine spots to No. 64 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will next meet Francisco Comesana after the Argentine advanced on Sunday when 29th seed Luciano Darderi retired trailing 4-6, 1-3.

Opelka has produced some of his best tennis on the North American hard courts in the past, reaching the final at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Toronto in 2021 and the fourth round at the US Open in the same year. He clubbed 38 winners, including 14 aces, to De Minaur's six winners, with the Australian frequently returning second serves above shoulder height.



In other early action, ninth seed Andrey Rublev moved past #NextGenATP American Learner Tien 7-6(4), 6-3 to reach the third round. Rublev arrived in Cincinnati off the back of a quarter-final showing in Toronto, his best ATP Masters 1000 result of the year. The No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings will meet Alexei Popyrin or #NextGenATP Spaniard Martin Landaluce in the last 32.

Iga Swiatek's battle back to the summit of tennis has been an arduous one after struggling to find her feet early in 2025.

Earlier in the year, Swiatek suffered shock exits to Mirra Andreeva and Danielle Collins at Indian Wells and Rome respectively.

In fact, the Pole went over a year without winning a WTA Tour title after losing in the French Open semi-finals to Aryna Sabalenka.

However, her form was soon to change. Swiatek's first grass-court final appearance at the Bad Homburg Open foreshadowed future events, as she went on to lift the Venus Rosewater Dish at Wimbledon in July.

Fast forward to August and the 24-year-old is gearing up for a third-round match at the Cincinnati Open. The Pole will face Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk after defeating Russia's Anastasia Potapova in the second round.

There has been a change in geographical scenery recently as tournaments have moved from the European clay and grass-court surfaces to the North American hard courts.

A change to the type of ball has faced much scrutiny due to an apparent difficulty in controlling them. The North American hard-court swing uses Wilson US Open balls, while Wimbledon uses Slazenger balls, and the French Open uses Wilson Roland Garros balls.

Swiatek addressed this issue while speaking to reporters after her victory over Potapova.

The Wilson US Open balls have been frequently discussed in recent weeks due to an apparent lack of control. At the Canadian Open, Taylor Fritz said they were ‘the hardest balls to control.'

After playing her first match at the Cincinnati Open, Iga Swiatek has weighed in on the issue. The Pole was asked by one reporter to expand on her perspective and approach on dealing with the ‘light' US Wilson US Open balls.

Swiatek said: “Yeah I won the US Open but I also like lost couple times second round, or third.

“So I'm kind of being humble and knowing that you need to kind of adjust to the balls because they're not going to help you a bit.

So yeah, they are light. They are much different than what we played at on like clay and on Wimbledon.

So yeah, the only way to like think about it is to focus on adjusting as best as possible and accepting that there are going to be some shots that are just going to kind of fly away from your racket and trying to control it as much as possible.

Swiatek was also asked to comment on her early-season struggles.

The Pole noted there were a variety of factors, pinpointing her clay-court expectations as one particular area of struggle.

She said: “I think there were a lot of factors back then. Well for sure the expectations on clay and just me kind of feeling like I don't know, I need to compete my best every week, but I sometimes needed just time to kind of reset but didn't really get it until I lost in Rome.

“Yeah me being like frustrated quicker from different reasons like… and not working the proper way, kind of being stubborn sometimes with the way I approach stuff so I think it was a mix, and I needed some time to get out of that after Rome.”

Holger Rune and Amanda Anisimova are one of the superstar partnerships for the US Open mixed doubles event this year.

The US Open mixed doubles event has been revamped for 2025, a decision which has split opinion across the board.

This change has attracted many star names, with mixed doubles teams including Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu.

Rune is also part of the US Open mixed doubles event, and he has now revealed he made a prediction about his partner that nearly came true.

It has been a breakout year for Anisimova, who won the Qatar Open title back in February to kickstart what has been an impressive season.

The American continued this form into the grass court season, beginning with Anisimova reaching the final of the Queen's Club Championships.

This year was the first time that men and women both played at Queen's since 1973.

Rune, who was also competing at the Queen's Club Championships, has now revealed that he predicted Anisimova would win Wimbledon after watching her play.

“You know it's actually funny, people can think maybe I am lying, but I am not I promise,” Rune told Tennis Channel. “I said in Queen's that I thought she was going to win Wimbledon and then she made the final. 

“But, you know she's really improved, been through a lot also. But yeah, it's just amazing to be able to share the court with her.”

Rune's prediction almost came true, before Anisimova suffered a heavy defeat in the Wimbledon final to Iga Swiatek.

As with many teams at the US Open mixed doubles event, this is the first time that Rune and Anisimova have played together.

Rune has never played mixed doubles at a Grand Slam before, while Anisimova does have some experience.

In her three previous Grand Slam mixed doubles appearances, Anisimova has partnered Nick Kyrgios, Christian Harrison and Michael Mmoh.

Although Anisimova has never surpassed the second round of a mixed doubles Grand Slam, she has twice lost to the eventual champions, and the other time to the runners-up.

Both Rune and Anisimova will look to be the champions at the US Open mixed doubles event, which takes place on August 19-20.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former top-10 player Paula Badosa pulled out of the U.S. Open on Friday after dealing with a back injury that has sidelined her since a first-round loss at Wimbledon on June 30.

The U.S. Tennis Association announced Badosa's withdrawal and said Jil Teichmann would replace her in the field. Alizé Cornet, who retired from tennis last year but returned to action this year, is the next woman in line to get a berth in the draw at Flushing Meadows if someone else pulls out.

Play is scheduled to begin on Aug. 24 in the singles brackets at the year's last Grand Slam tournament.

Badosa, a 27-year-old from Spain, reached a career-best ranking of No. 2 in 2022 and is currently No. 12.

She reached the semifinals at the Australian Open this January. Her best showing at the U.S. Open was a run to the quarterfinals last year.

When two-time Grand Slam champion and WTA No. 2, Coco Gauff, was asked about the strength of American tennis, she playfully criticized her ATP counterparts. 

“It hasn't been much of a competition, no offense to them, but now it is,” Gauff quipped. “We've had three straight slams with American in the finals, so I think we're doing pretty good on our end. They have to catch up.”

Even if Gauff might not have been entirely serious, she had a point. While American women have won two Grand Slams this year — Madison Keys at the Australian and Gauff at the French Open — the men haven't held up their end of the bargain in about 22 years since Andy Roddick won the 2003 US Open.

Still, the 2025 group might be closer than usual as they prepare for the US Open in late August while competing at the Cincinnati Open.

ATP No. 6 Ben Shelton has soared up the rankings after recently beating fellow American and No. 4 Taylor Fritz at the National Bank Open in Canada before defeating then-No. 16 Karen Khachanov to win the tournament.

Known for his fast serves and showman attitude, the 22-year-old has reached the semifinals at the Australian Open and quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year before losing to No. 1 Jannik Sinner in both. He has skyrocketed to his career-high rank after starting the year at No. 21. 

Shelton has progressed tremendously despite always showing promise because of his serving, because he has improved his baseline and serve return game. At the National Bank Open, he won 36.2% of return points, according to USA TODAY.

“I don't really feel expectation other than, you know, what me and my team put on myself, which is more about effort and intention than results,” Shelton said. “That's always kind of how I go into a tournament. Whatever happens, happens, and I know that the way that I play, I can have big weeks.”

Fritz, who has held his No. 4 ranking position since 2024, has come close to winning Grand Slams. He reached his first major final at the 2024 US Open and recently reached the semifinals at Wimbledon. But he fell to the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively, as he bowed out of each.

In 2024, Fritz finished with a 17-4 record in Grand Slam matches. He noted that while Sinner and Alcaraz are a level higher than the rest of the field, those players still lose.

Fritz said he has noticed the high level of all the top Americans, who he thinks are capable of achieving a grand slam title. By continuing to make deep Grand Slam runs, he added, it could eventually work out for one of them.

“The thing is, it only takes, it only takes two weeks,” Fritz said. “Things just need to click for two weeks, and that's it.”

Others in the top 20, like Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe, have also performed well. While a Grand Slam could be a tall order for them, they are still contributing to a rapidly developing field of top American men.

And maybe it will click for one of them, as Fritz suggested.

Tiafoe, who is 6-3 in Grand Slams this year, made the French Open quarterfinal. But his recent results have been a step down from his 2024 US Open semifinal appearance, in which he lost to Fritz.

Tiafoe said Shelton's success in Canada has motivated him to perform better. While Alcaraz and Sinner have been more consistent than the rest of the pack, he said on any given night, one of them can pull off a victory.

“I don't think it's head and shoulders by any means,” Tiafoe said of the level between Alcaraz and Sinner and other players. “I think Taylor (Fritz) can do it. I think Ben (Shelton) can do it. I think Tommy (Paul) 's in a great situation. I can do it myself. So I don't think an American is that far away at all.

“Now, to do it is obviously tough. Those guys are tall orders, but I don't think the difference is that big. I think the belief factor just needs to be there.”

Paul reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open and the French Open, but lost form at Wimbledon, exiting in the second round to Austria's Sebastian Ofner.

The 28-year-old has dealt with abdominal and foot injuries since the French Open, the latter sustained at Wimbledon. Since then, he has slipped out of a top ten ranking spot, which he reached in June.

Paul is still focused on conditioning, but he has been motivated by Shelton's rapid progress.

"Every six months that I watch Ben (Shelton), I feel like I can notice something that he's doing so much better, or something that he's changed that's made his game better," Paul said. "Obviously, (it) motivates all of us, but (I'm) really just happy for him right now."

With Fritz, Shelton, Tiafoe and Paul in the top 20 on the men's side and Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys, Amanda Anisimova, Emma Navarro and Gauff around the heights of the women's side, Americans have found success.

It goes beyond Grand Slams, though.

“It's a great opportunity for Americans in tennis right now, but just in tennis in general, there's a lot of hype around the sport,” Shelton said. “Tennis is reaching a different demographic than it was before, and that's because of stars like Coco (Gauff), Francis (Tiafoe), and Taylor (Fritz), especially in the U.S., but not just Americans, North Americans, and Europeans too.”

Gauff later continued to discuss why it is important to have Americans near the top of tennis on both sides.

“Something beautiful about our country is how diverse it is, and I hope in this sport that it continues to show,” she said. “It's great for the men to be in those numbers with us. And I would love to see in my lifetime, a woman, an American woman, and a male win the same slam.”

At Wimbledon earlier this summer, the tennis world said goodbye to another star of the golden generation, as Fabio Fognini bid farewell to fans on Centre Court.

In the final match of his career, Fognini forced Carlos Alcaraz to a fifth set and was on the verge of delivering an enormous upset in round one at the championships. 

It wasn't to be for the 38-year-old Italian, however, who conceded the decisive set to Alcaraz, before receiving a standing ovation from the crowd as he left the court for the final time. 

Over a month after announcing his retirement, Fognini has reflected on his decision to move on to pastures new. 

In an interview with Tennis World Italia, he said: “Since I stopped playing, I haven't touched my racket and I've watched very few highlights of the Wimbledon match.

“I haven't had the chance to see myself again, being very self-critical. I haven't seen myself again yet; I haven't made it.

“I've never hidden myself with words; I have to be honest. Everyone has their own personality.”

“Some guys might ask me for advice on management. I've had my career, could I have done more? Yes. I think not changing as a player has been my best quality.

“For me, the person comes before the player; winning shouldn't have changed me as a person. I'm happy to have the opportunity to talk about it now.”

Fognini won nine ATP singles titles since turning professional in 2004, eight of which came on his preferred surface of clay.

The former world number nine clinched a maiden Masters 1000 crown in 2019, when he emerged victorious in Monte-Carlo.

In singles his best result at a major was a quarterfinal finish at the French Open in 2011, but in doubles he is a Grand Slam champion.

Alongside compatriot Simone Bolelli, Fognini won the 2015 Australian Open title, with the two becoming the first all-Italian men's pair to win a major title in the Open Era.

The third round in Cincinnati has thrown up some intriguing matchups, with players coming in from very different trajectories. Some have built confidence with strong showings in recent weeks, while others are still looking for the spark to turn their summer around. The fast courts and humid conditions are adding an extra layer of unpredictability, so expect plenty of momentum swings and tight scorelines across the board.  As always, we here at LWOT will be offering our predictions for every match on the schedule. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: Tiafoe 2–1 Humbert

Frances Tiafoe and Ugo Humbert meet with both having put in solid performances recently, though in contrasting ways. Tiafoe's quick-strike game has been clicking at times during the hard court swing, while Humbert has showed great composure from the baseline in his first match since Wimbledon in the previous round. Their head-to-head has Tiafoe in the lead, and with both players in decent rhythm, this could come down to who manages their service games better.

Prediction: Tiafoe in 2

Head-to-Head: Auger-Aliassime 1–0 Rinderknech

Arthur Rinderknech has been building quietly, picking up some good wins since the grass swing, and now faces Felix Auger-Aliassime, who's enjoying one of his best patches of form this year. Felix has been moving well and dictating play with his forehand, but Rinderknech's serve-and-volley skills could keep the rallies short and the pressure high. The clash of styles will make for an engaging affair but the Canadian should have too much for his opponent. Rinderknech comes off his third top 20 win of the season, as he beat Casper Ruud in round 2.

Prediction: Auger-Aliassime in 3

Head-to-Head: Mannarino 1–1 Paul

Adrian Mannarino and Tommy Paul are no strangers to each other, having shared some tricky battles in the past. Mannarino's flat strokes and ability to redirect pace can trouble anyone, especially on a quick court, while Paul's athleticism and counterpunching have carried him deep in recent events. If both bring their A-game, expect a match full of sudden shifts and long, absorbing exchanges.

Prediction: Paul in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Gabriel Diallo's dream run meets a stern test against Jannik Sinner. The Canadian has been playing freely, feeding off the crowd and striking the ball with confidence, but Sinner's recent form and big-match experience make him a different challenge altogether. If Diallo can keep up his aggressive serving and take time away, he might just make things interesting.

Prediction: Sinner in 2

Emma Raducanu cruised through her opening-round match against Olga Danilovic in an impressive return to the Cincinnati Open.

However, despite being seeded, things get no easier for the British number one, as Aryna Sabalenka awaits in the Round of 32.

The top-ranked player in the entire world, and for good reason, the big-hitting Belarusian has crushed almost everyone in her path throughout 2025, despite suffering a few hiccups at the Grand Slams.

Most recently, she was shockingly defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Wimbledon, an event she was the heavy favourite to win.

However, Sabalenka could very easily have lost way before that semi-final, as she was pushed to the brink by Raducanu.

Having impressed in her opening two matches, particularly against Marketa Vondrousova, the 22-year-old was brimming with confidence as she faced the world number one.

She was not expected to win, but the hope was that she could certainly trouble her and exhibit all the progress she had made throughout the year.

Fortunately for the Centre Court crowd, she did far more than that, and had fine opportunities to snatch both sets, which she subsequently lost.

It was one of her most impressive performances to date, despite the record showing a straight-sets defeat, and for many, proved that Raducanu is not that far away from returning to the apex of the sport.

In the end, it was once again her win percentage on that second serve which let her down in the crucial moments, allowing Sabalenka to break four times from the 15 opportunities she forged. The Brit won just 41% of points behind her second serve that night.

Fortunately for Emma Raducanu, this could be a weakness that has been plugged since then.

After all, in her opening-round match against Danilovic, she looked so impressive on serve, even if she was broken twice.

With one of the fiercest returning games on the tour, it feels like Raducanu only ever needs a few holds of serve to secure a set.

And, given that she was winning a much-improved 73% of points behind her second serve, the chances of Sabalenka bringing up as many break point opportunities in their next match seem slim.

Raducanu has praised her new coach Francisco Roig for what he has already brought to her coaching team, as a partnership that has already had a fine start.

What better way to reaffirm that notion than with a statement win against Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open?

She knows exactly what she needs to do to topple the 27-year-old, and if she can replicate that serving form from the Danilovic match, we could see that happen.

MASON, OH − Another star-studded schedule at the Lindner Family Tennis Center in on tap Aug. 10 as the second round of the Cincinnati Open continues.

The No. 2 player on both the ATP and WTA tour will take Center Court during the day session. Carlos Alcaraz will play in his first match since falling in the Wimbledon final when he faces Damir Dzumhur.

WTA No. 2 Coco Gauff, who won the Cincinnati Open in 2023, meets No. 37 Xinyu Wang. Gauff is coming off a doubles title in the Canadian Open.

Madeira native Caty McNally, coming off a win in her first appearance at her hometown tournament in three years, will face WTA No. 32 McCartney Kessler to open the night session.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time second-round updates from Mason.

In a competitive Center Court clash, WTA No. 9 and No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini defeated Maria Sakkari, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5), in a match that took 2 hours, 12 minutes.

Sakkari survived a pair of match points in the second-set tiebreak by breaking Paolini's serve, but a double fault sent Paolini to the Round of 32.

No. 32 seed Dayana Yastremska survived a scare against qualifier Viktoriya Tomova in the second round, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, in just over two hours. She awaits the winner of the Coco Gauff-Xinyu Wang match on Center Court later this afternoon.

American wild card Tristan Boyer won his first set against Jiri Lehecka, but eventually fell to the ATP No. 26, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.

Lihecka dished out nine aces and won 87% of first-serve points to punch his Round of 32 ticket for the second consecutive year in Mason.

American Ashlyn Krueger did not win a game during the second set, but bounced back for a 6-4, 0-6, 6-3 win over Anastasija Sevastova in the second round.

On the Champions' Court, Veronika Kudermetova upset No. 17 Belinda Bencic in straight sets, 6-4, 7-6 (0).

Jelena Ostapenko is through to the Round of 32 for the fifth consecutive year in the Cincinnati Open. The 28-year-old advanced after her opponent, Camila Osorio, withdrew due to an abdominal injury.

Ostapenko reached the Round of 16 at the Cincinnati Open in 2021.

American Reilly Opelka is through to the Round of 32 at the Cincinnati Open after a straight-set upset of No. 6 seed and ATP No. 8 Alex de Minaur, 7-6 (6), 6-4.

Opelka was previously 0-5 against de Minaur and this is his ninth career win over a top 10 opponent.

Francisco Comesana is through to the Round of 32 after his opponent, No. 29 seed Luciano Darderi, retired during the second set.

Day 6 of the Cincinnati Open has begun on a sun-splashed Mason morning. On Center Court, No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini is facing Maria Sakkari, the WTA No. 65. Paolini is 15-5 this year against opponents ranked outside the top 50, though she lost to Sakkari in Madrid earlier this year.

The Tennis Channel is the exclusive home of the Cincinnati Open.

The Tennis Channel app is available on iOS, Android, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Roku. Subscriptions start at $9.99 a month, up to $109.99 a year.

The Tennis Channel is also available to stream on Fubo.

Both Aug. 10 sessions are sold out, the tournament announced. Single-session tickets are available for Monday, Aug. 11.

Former Cincinnati Open champion Caroline Garcia ends the night on Center Court against 2023 runner-up Karolina Muchova.

Last year's runner-up Jessica Pegula, the No. 4 seed, is on the Grandstand Court against Australian Kimberly Birrell. ATP No. 6 Ben Shelton, a 22-year-old American, is on Center Court to open the night session against Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

The Enquirer will update this story.

Most of the top seeds from the top half of the draw have safely navigated through their second-round matches, with the third round set to get underway on day five at ATP Cincinnati. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate, including Gabriel Diallo vs Jannik Sinner. But who will reach the round of 32?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Joao Fonseca caught a lucky break in the second round as he was down a set and double break when Alejandro Davidovich Fokina hit a physical wall and didn't win a game before retiring towards the end of the second set. Fonseca's weakness was exposed in this match, and he must improve going forward to make a deep run. Terence Atmane got a fantastic win against Flavio Cobolli in a tight match that ended in a deciding set tiebreak. The Frenchman displayed great mentality after losing the second set. Atmane's serve is a weapon, and Fonseca's poor return can cost him this match. Both players are looking to make the round of 16 for the first time at the Masters level, but Atmane should have the edge.

Prediction: Atmane in 3

Head-to-Head: Tsitsipas 3-0 Bonzi

Former Cincinnati Open finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Fabian Marozsan in the second round to end his five-match losing streak. The Greek needed the win desperately, and he played a solid match to do so. His backhand, which is his weakness, looked good, and he looked great on serve throughout the match. Benjamin Bonzi is in the third round of a Masters for the second time in his career as he upset eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti in a fantastic match. Both players played at a high level, but Bonzi's ability to save break points proved to be the difference. The Frenchman has never won against Tsitsipas, but he will like his chances on a hard court. Expect a close encounter with Tsitsipas edging it.

Prediction: Tsitsipas in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Holger Rune is defending a lot of points here, and he is off to a positive start by defeating Roman Safiullin in two tight sets. He can improve on his forehand, which leaked some errors and didn't look as effective as it could be. Alex Micheksen came through a tough match against Corentin Moutet and continues his good form. These two are facing off for the first time, and this can be one of the matches of the round. Michelsen is the more consistent player, but Rune can hit through his opponents much easily. The Dane should have the edge.

Prediction: Rune in 3

Head-to-Head: Fritz 6-2 Sonego

It was a classic Taylor Fritz performance in the second round to defeat Emilio Nava in straight sets. He dominated behind his serve but did enough on return to break Nava once in each set. He has a clear edge against Lorenzo Sonego, who has never won against the American outside clay and has a disadvantage in every category on a hard court. Sonego's serve can keep this close, but Fritz is the more clutch player, and he should be able to win the tiebreaks if necessary.

Prediction: Fritz in 2

Serena Williams is an icon of tennis, winning 23 Grand Slam titles and multiple Olympic medals during her esteemed career.

The American star learned her tennis trade in Compton, California, alongside her sister Venus, before going on to become one of the sport's biggest ever stars.

Williams was dominant throughout her career, rarely going a year without picking up a Grand Slam title.

However, there was a decade-long period where Williams failed to win the French Open. After winning her first title in 2002, the American waited 11 years to win her second Grand Slam title in Paris.

Patrick Mouratoglou, who was coaching Williams at the time, has revealed what the American said immediately after capturing her second French Open title.

Patrick Mouratoglou, who has recently parted ways with Naomi Osaka, coached Serena Williams for a decade, between 2012 and 2022.

During their partnership, Serena won 10 Grand Slam singles titles, making this the most prolific partnership of her career.

The Frenchman, who has also coached Simona Halep and Stefanos Tsitsipas, recently spoke about Serena's French Open title victory in 2013.

A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou)

On Instagram, Mouratoglou said: “With Serena we started working together in 2012 and in 2012 she wins Wimbledon and the US Open.

“She tells me ‘now I want to achieve another goal, which is to win Roland Garros. I won it only once, in 2002, and I want to win it again.'

“And in 2013, she wins Roland Garros. When she wins, there is a trophy ceremony and when she gets out of the court she comes to me and she says ‘okay, let's do the cooldown.'

“So we go into the fitness room and after five minutes she looks at me and she says: ‘now we have to win Wimbledon.'

“After five minutes she already forgot that she won Roland Garros, which is a tournament she was trying to win for 10 years. Already focusing on winning the next one, which was Wimbledon.

“This is the mindset of the champions. As soon as they achieve something, they immediately think about a new goal, another one.”

After defeating Mandy Minella, Caroline Garcia and Kimiko Date-Krumm without dropping a set, many would have expected Serena Williams to go on and lift her sixth Ladies Singles title at Wimbledon.

However, the American ran into an inspired German player in the fourth round: Sabine Lisicki. The German star stunned Williams in three sets, winning 6-2 1-6 6-4.

Lisicki, the 23rd seed, defeated Kaia Kanepi in the quarter-finals, before beating Agnieszka Radwańska in a marathon semi-final match, winning 9-7 in the third set.

However, Lisicki came up short in the final, losing to Marion Bartoli.

Paula Badosa has officially withdrawn from the U.S. Open after the Spaniard posted an emotional message on Instagram.

Badosa, who is currently ranked 12th in the world, has not played since she was beaten in the first round at Wimbledon by Katie Boulter in three sets. On Friday, the 27-year-old, who recently announced her split from fellow tennis star Stefanos Tsitsipas, confirmed she would be withdrawing from the final major of the calendar year, set to run from Aug. 24 to Sept. 7.

"It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing my withdrawal from this year's U.S. Open," Badosa, who reached the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows last year wrote on social media. "This decision was incredibly difficult to make. After the amazing run I had in New York last year and the deep connection I feel with the city and its fans, stepping away from this tournament is very emotional for me. The U.S. Open has always meant a great deal to me, and I have created some of my most special memories there."

The Spaniard has battled a chronic back injury over the years, which she has herself admitted could force her into retirement prematurely.

And now in the wake of her announcement, Badosa has posted another message on social media for her fans, which has hinted that she could be set for some time away from the court as she looks to battle her way back from a setback.

A post shared by Paula Badosa (@paulabadosa)

Posting on Instagram, Badosa said: "I wasn't built by easy days. I was shaped by the moments that broke me, the choices that didn't go as planned, and the times I fell short of who I wanted to be. My setbacks weren't signs that I was weak; they were necessary chapters in a story that's still being written.

"Failure taught me what success never could. It humbled me. It forced me to look inward, to ask hard questions, to rebuild with more intention and clarity. Every mistake I made sharpened my understanding of who I am and who I'm not. And while I once feared those mistakes, I now see them as some of my greatest teachers.

"There were times I thought I'd lost everything, my direction, my confidence, my sense of worth. But looking back, I realize I was only losing what no longer served me. Every loss gave space for growth. Every closed door redirected me toward a better one.

"I'm not proud of every moment in my past, but I am proud of the person those moments created. The human I am today is more resilient, more aware, and more grounded because of everything I've survived and learned.

"I don't run from failure anymore. I respect it because it's the reason I stand here… Stronger, wiser, and still becoming."

And her decision to pull out of the US Open will now also mean British star Jack Draper now needs to find a new mixed doubles partner for the tournament.

Emma Raducanu started her new coaching partnership with Francisco Roig on a winning note after kicking off her Cincinnati Open campaign with a straight-set win over Olga Danilovic.

The 22-year-old started working with esteemed coach Roig – who was one of 22-time Grand Slam winner Rafael Nadal's mentor for more than two decades – after Wimbledon, but was only confirmed in the build-up to the Cincinnati event that the Spaniard has taken up the full-time role until the end of the 2025 season.

But there was no settling period at the WTA 1000 tournament as the 2021 US Open winner won 6-3, 6-2.

Both players struggled on serve in the first set as there were four breaks in the first five games before Raducanu claimed the crucial break in game eight. She dominated the second set with two breaks to set up the solid victory.

“I'm really building some momentum. I'm really happy with how I've stayed pretty consistent over the last few months,” she started after the match.

“I still feel like there's a long way to go but just working hard behind the scenes, putting a lot of hours in and hoping I can trust in that.”

Raducanu slipped six places to No 39 in the WTA Rankings after the Canadian Open, but she has now moved a projected five-place jump in the Live Rankings with her opening-round win, which puts her on the cusp of being seeded at the US Open with the top-32 players receiving the honour.

The Cincinnati Open is the cutoff event for the US Open seedings, but there is bad news for Raducanu as she faces world No 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka in the second round.

Who is Emma Raducanu's new coach? Former Rafael Nadal mentor Francisco Roig

Sabalenka kicked off her title defence with a 7-5, 6-1 victory over 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.

“It's always a tough match against her,” Sabalenka said. “[Vondrousova] always pushes me to the limit. You have to stay focused, and you have to fight for every point against her.”

It will be Sabalenka and Raducanu's second meeting in just over a month as they produced a thrilling fourth-round match at Wimbledon and it was the former who emerged with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.

The three-time Grand Slam winner also won their only other encounter at the 2024 Indian Wells Open as she defeated the British No 1 7-3, 7-5.

Raducanu sits on 1,426 points in the Live Rankings and if she wins her next match she will move to 1,481, which will result in a bump up to No 31.

The winner of the Sabalenka-Raducanu encounter will face either Jessica Bouzas Maneiro or Taylor Townsend in the fourth round.

The Grandstand Court witnessed a remarkable encounter on Saturday. This season's Australian Open queen Madison Keys was up against a formidable rival, Germany's Eva Lys. While the pre-match expectations were mostly siding with Keys, the end result was far from it. Lys gave the American WTA star a run for her money. So much so that it edged to a nail-biting finish. Keys has a tendency to rebound and claw her way back from the jaws of defeat. From a point where she nearly lost the match, the World No.6 somehow turned things around, hilariously, to her own astonishment.

Lys began the proceedings one-sided. She snatched the first set with a breadstick against the slam winner. However, Keys then responded equally, taking the second set 6-3. But it was the decider that was action-packed and popcorn-worthy. At one point, Lys was leading 3-0 on her way to taking the second round. But Keys was unrelenting. She leveled the score yet again in the last set and was on the verge of victory at 5-4. Cue, plot twist. Lys fought back, determined, and forced the battle into a tie-break after the set reached 6-6. It was at this moment, though, that Keys really burst through. The tie-break was one-sided as she snatched her ticket to the next round with a final score line of 1-6, 6-3, 7-6(1).

Of course, the American star was extremely happy with her performance. But during the post-match interview with Tennis Channel‘s Prakash Amritraj, she was amused with the way she won. The host curiously shed light on a special habit of Keys' where she's “come back from the brink (of defeat) a bunch of times this year.” Keys responded, saying, “Yeah,” to which Prakash told her, “That's a pretty special talent, you know. Well, I mean..I don't know.” Having no better way to react, Keys just said, “I mean, better than the alternative, I suppose. But also, like, what am I doing?”

The alternative here is losing, for which the host said, “Well, you obviously never do that.” “Well, okay, that's fair. But look, the good news is, it didn't end that way. Found a way to come back. A lot of players might not have found a way to come back.” While still perplexed about this specific acknowledgement, she commented, “Okay, that's great. But like, what am I doing?” 

Prakash then decided to close out the unintentionally humorous interaction, saying, “You know, Mady, I can't answer that. I really can't. But it is, it's always unbelievably entertaining to watch.” Left in splits, Keys humbly said, “Well, I'm glad you guys are entertained.”

But reverting to the match itself, it was one hell of a rollercoaster ride for Keys. And she made it evident with a post-match reaction that revealed her real motivation behind the comeback against Lys.

For the uninitiated, Saturday's match marked the first meeting between Madison Keys and Eva Lys. While the American has been a former Cincinnati queen on the hard court, she still couldn't figure out a way to dominate the German. Owing to the fact that she didn't have a clue about her playing style beforehand.

Does Madison Keys' ability to win from the brink make her the most entertaining player today?

Debate

After losing the first set, it looked too difficult for her to make a comeback. Still, she made it to the end. After her Australian Open triumph, Keys has struggled a lot to overcome lower-ranked players. Yes, she's won a total of 14 of her eighteen encounters against opponents outside of the top 50. But three of her recent losses have been frequent since June. After a QF run in Paris, she lost early at the Queen's Club, then in Berlin, and also at Wimbledon.

Playing against Lys, there was added pressure to stay composed. “I just kept trying to listen to everyone here cheering me,” she said, as reported on the WTA's website on August 10. Perhaps that was the biggest motivating factor for the World No.6. “It helped me get back into the match and across the finish line.” Going forward, she hopes for the crowd to back her the same way.

In the second round, Keys will now be up against Japan's Aoi Ito. It will be their maiden face-off at the WTA level. Do you think the American will easily win this battle or will the World No.94 make her work hard for a win like Lys? Let us know in the comments below.

CINCINNATI, Ohio—College student Russell Lokko thought he was simply getting a meet-and-greet with Frances Tiafoe, a player he grew up watching, at the Cincinnati Open.Instead, the rising junior and standout tennis student-athlete at the University of Louisville received the surprise of a lifetime—a $30,000 scholarship over two years through the USTA Foundation's Frances Tiafoe Fund.Tiafoe delivered the news—and a giant check—while Lokko was opening a gift bag from the player's sponsors, including Lululemon, La Roche-Posay and Clif Bar, during a behind-the-scenes experience at the Lindner Family Tennis Center.“I'm super excited, and I'm really blessed that Frances gave me this check,” Lokko said. “It's going to take a lot off my parents, and it's going to help me stay focused on what I want to do in college.“I had no idea that he was going to give me this money… Growing up, Frances has always been a role model for me, so to get it directly from him is unbelievable.”Read More: Tommy Paul talks engagement, injury rehab at Cincinnati Open

The award will help cover the gap in scholarship funding so Lokko can continue his education at Louisville.Lokko grew up playing tennis at the NJTL of Trenton, a community organization within the USTA Foundation's National Junior Tennis & Learning (NJTL) network—the same network that supported Tiafoe's early training at the Junior Tennis Champions Center (JTCC) in his hometown of College Park, Md.“To see how ecstatic he was, and being able to take care of his junior and senior year is a huge deal, man,” Tiafoe said. “The son of immigrants… I've been in that seat. I know how it is, and the struggle for him to be able to do that.“If he gets a little push by me, and me being one percent of the reason why he's gonna become the man he's gonna be is incredible. That's why I created this fund within the USTA Foundation, to be able to do great things like that.”

During his visit to the Cincinnati Open, Lokko met Tiafoe, watched his practice, and shadowed him around the tournament grounds—building a mentor-mentee relationship along the way.“I was super excited about (the idea from USTA), because I get to meet somebody who I know looks up to me and be able to bless him along the way,” Tiafoe said. “It was an incredible experience, and I was even nervous about it today! I wanted everything to go smoothly and in the right way.”On Saturday night, Lokko capped off the experience in the ultimate way—watching Tiafoe win 6-4, 6-3 under the lights against Roberto Carballes Baena from the best seat in the house: courtside in Tiafoe's player box alongside his team.Co-founded in 1969 by Arthur Ashe, Charlie Pasarell, and Sheridan Snyder, the NJTL network is made up of more than 270 organizations nationwide that use tennis and education to prepare young people from under-resourced communities for the challenges and opportunities of life.

By Gianni Taina

Australian tennis has produced legends like Rod Laver, John Newcombe, Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter, and Lleyton Hewitt. In recent years, new talents have emerged, but some—like Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic—have attracted more attention for off-court incidents than on-court achievements.

Born in Australia on October 21, 1992, Tomic picked up the sport at an early age under the guidance of his father, John—a hands-on presence who would later spark several controversies. As a junior, Tomic stood out, winning two Grand Slam titles: the 2008 Australian Open and the 2009 U.S. Open.

Back in 2009, Tomic was one of Australia's hottest tennis prospects, while Lleyton Hewitt was still the face of Australian tennis—a proven Grand Slam champion and Davis Cup stalwart. That September, a story from Hewitt's then-manager, David Drysdale, caused quite a stir.

Drysdale recalled: “We turned around and saw Tomic's fans nearby, and I thought, ‘Oh, maybe he got our message and is here to hit with Lleyton.' So Hewitt's physio went over to Bernard's coach and asked, ‘Is Bernard here to practice with Lleyton?' Rudy didn't know anything about it, but said, ‘Look, Bernard is looking for a hitting partner, and I think he'd like to.' But then Bernard's agent walked in and said, ‘No, he's not here to practice with Lleyton—Lleyton's not good enough'”.

According to Drysdale, those were the exact words: “Lleyton's not good enough”. The comment stunned Hewitt and his team. “Lleyton just couldn't believe it,” Drysdale said. “And the more he thought about it, the angrier he got”. Ironically, years later, Tomic and Hewitt would end up sharing the court—this time as teammates for Australia in the Davis Cup.

Tomic cracked the ATP Top 100 and reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 2011. He won his first ATP title in January 2013, added back-to-back Bogota crowns in 2014 and 2015, and peaked at a career-high No. 17 in 2016.

Wimbledon is one of the crown jewels of the tennis calendar—an event every player dreams of competing in. But for Bernard Tomic, two appearances at the All England Club ended in controversy and fines rather than glory.

The first incident came in 2017, when Tomic fell to Mischa Zverev—brother of Alexander—in the opening round. After the match, he admitted in a press conference that he had faked an injury to slow things down, which led tournament officials to hit him with a £13,000 fine. In that same presser, Tomic made headlines with a blunt statement: “I don't care if I make the fourth round of the U.S. Open or lose in the first round. I'm going to play another ten years, and I know after I retire I won't have to work again”.

Two years later, in 2019, Tomic faced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first round and lost 6-2, 6-1, 6-4—in just 58 minutes, an unusually short duration for a best-of-three-sets match at the Slams. Wimbledon officials determined that Tomic had violated the tournament's code of conduct by failing to put forth his best effort. As a result, they withheld his £45,000 prize money.

After several seasons where he appeared increasingly disconnected from the sport, Tomic's performance and ranking took a significant hit. No longer in the ATP's spotlight, the Australian was forced to return to the Challenger Tour—where he once again drew headlines for all the wrong reasons.

In 2024, two incidents stood out. The first came in August at the Santo Domingo Challenger, where Tomic lost in the quarterfinals to Andy Andrade. When Andrade later played Damir Dzumhur in the final, Tomic showed up in the stands and began heckling him, leading to his ejection from the venue.

Just two months later, Tomic reached the final of the Fairfield Challenger against Learner Tien, but suffered a lopsided 6-0, 6-1 defeat in only 39 minutes. The opening set lasted just 16 minutes, making it the shortest final in Challenger history.

After improving his ranking, Tomic earned opportunities to compete in higher-level events again. In 2025, he entered qualifying rounds at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros, and also played in several ATP tournaments. In June, he secured his first ATP Tour victory in four years.

Speaking to Punto de Break in March 2025, Tomic reflected on his career and personal growth: “When you have an engine and a purpose, you get up every day with something to focus on, something to do. Everyone needs a purpose in life. I felt I played really well in my career during the first five, six, or seven years, but after that I wasn't playing this sport enough. Now I'd rather not have that much attention—being in the media spotlight isn't good”.

Amanda Anisimova admits she had a sense of "guilt" after not winning a single game in the Wimbledon final but also adds that the public gave her "the sweetest" support and that's what helped her mentally overcome the most painful loss of her career.

Playing in her first Grand Slam final, the 23-year-old American lasted on the court only 57 minutes before Iga Swiatek completed an astonishing 6-0 6-0 win. For the first time since 1988, a Grand Slam final finished with a double bagel. Also, it was the first time since 1911 that a player failed to register a single game in a Wimbledon title match.

When Anisimova burst into tears shortly after the Wimbledon final, no one could blame her. And after taking some time for everything to soak in and receiving numerous pleasant messages, the new world No. 7 felt much better.

"It was really special to see how many people were sending me the sweetest messages. Lots of support from people, which I wasn't really expecting after the performance I had. I felt really bad because I wish I could have put on a better performance, or could have competed harder, especially in a Grand Slam final. There was definitely that side of guilt immediately after. To see what everyone was saying to me after really helped me get through that," the 23-year-old said.

Usually, players complain about receiving social media abuse. But this time, Anisimova was on the receiving end of his warm and kind messages.

"It's not often that you get a lot of positive feedback on social media," the world No. 7 noted.

After Wimbledon, Anisimova kicked off her North American hard-court swing in Montreal, where she made the round-of-16 before losing to Elina Svitolina. The American is now set to participate in her home tournament in Cincinnati, where she is seeded at No. 5 and plays against Leolia Jeanjean after having a first-round bye.

IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe picks out five drivers Cadillac could bring to the F1 grid in 2026.

One of the biggest questions that still remains about Cadillac's nascent F1 program is who will be tapped to drive for them. While some established F1 veterans have been touted as front runners for the ride, it is no secret that one day they would love to have a US driver in their stable.

So if one of the seats had to be earmarked for an American, who would the best options be? We asked IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe to pick out five drivers Caddilac could bring to the F1 grid…

Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem nets a 10th nonconsecutive week atop the Billboard 200 chart (dated Aug. 16). The set earned 136,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Aug. 7 (down 5%), according to Luminate. I'm the Problem debuted at No. 1 on the May 31-dated chart, spent it first eight weeks in the pole position, stepped away from the top for two frames, and then returned to No. 1 for the last two consecutive weeks.

	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Aug. 16, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Aug. 12. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.




	Of I'm the Problem's 136,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 7, SEA units comprise 131,000 (up 2%, equaling 172.27 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for an 11th nonconsecutive week), album sales comprise 4,000 (down 5% — it rises 16-13 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (down 26%).


	Cumulatively, Wallen's three No. 1 albums (I'm the Problem, One Thing at a Time and Dangerous: The Double Album) have spent a total of 39 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. That ties him with Elton John for the fourth-most weeks at No. 1 among male artists in the chart's history, which dates to March 1956, when the chart began publishing on a regular weekly basis. Among male artists, the leaders are: Elvis Presley (67 weeks), Garth Brooks (52), Michael Jackson (51), John and Wallen (39 each), Harry Belafonte and Drake (37 each). Among all artists, The Beatles have the most weeks at No. 1, with 132 across 19 No. 1 albums.


I'm the Problem has now spent 10 weeks at No. 1, One Thing at a Time ruled for 19 nonconsecutive weeks in 2023-34 and Dangerous: The Double Album was tops for 10 straight weeks in 2021.


	In total, only six acts, including Wallen, have at least three albums that have spent at least 10 weeks at No. 1. He joins The Beatles and Elvis Presley (four such albums each); Whitney Houston, The Kingston Trio, Taylor Swift and Wallen (three each). Additionally, Wallen is the only act to spend at least 10 weeks at No. 1 with three consecutive full-length albums.


	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack holds at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, with 100,000 equivalent album units earned (its best week yet by units earned — up 7%). The set has posted a gain every week since its debut on the list seven weeks ago.

	











	Reneé Rapp achieves her highest-charted album yet (and first top 10) as BITE ME bows at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 with 64,000 equivalent album units earned — the singer-songwriter-actress' biggest week by units. Of that sum, album sales comprise 47,000 (her best sales frame ever, it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 17,000 (equaling 21.85 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs, it debuts at No. 34 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	Rapp previously placed one entry on the Billboard 200, Snow Angel, which debuted and peaked at No. 44 in 2023.


BITE ME's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across 11 vinyl variants (including signed editions) and five CD variants (including signed editions).


	$uicideBoy$ earn their highest-charted album as THY KINGDOM COME debuts at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 with 57,000 equivalent album units earned. It's the fifth top 10 set for the hip-hop duo, who had previously gone as high as No. 5 with their last charted project, 2024's New World Depression. Of THY KINGDOM COME's first-week units, SEA units comprise 34,000 (equaling 45.48 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 6 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 23,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales, boosted by its availability across six vinyl variants) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	Justin Bieber's SWAG is a non-mover on the Billboard 200 at No. 5 (44,000 equivalent album units earned, down 16%), Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid climbs 8-6 (nearly 44,000, down 8%), Wallen's chart-topping One Thing at a Time rises 11-7 (39,000, up 1%) and SZA's former No. 1 SOS is up 12-8 (36,000, down 5%).

	











	Yeat collects his sixth top 10-charted effort as DANGEROUS SUMMER starts at No. 9 with 34,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 18,000 (equaling 25.83 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it debuts at No. 29 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 16,000 (boosted by its availability across three CD variants, all signed, exclusive to his webstore, it debuts at No. 3 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	Sabrina Carpenter's chart-topping Short n' Sweet rounds out the latest top 10, as it climbs 16-10 with 30,000 equivalent album units earned (up 5%).

Eddie Murphy is an Academy Award-nominated actor — but, to him, that doesn't mean that you only have to make prestige pictures. Firmly established as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Murphy — who just premiered “The Pickup” on Amazon Prime — has always made exactly the kind of movie he wants to make in the moment. Hence why he followed up 2006's “Dreamgirls” — which netted not just an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, but five other nominations and two wins — with the widely panned “Norbit” in 2007.

“I love ‘Norbit,'” Murphy said on Complex's interview series “360 With Speedy Morman” (via The Wrap). “There were articles like, ‘How can he get an Oscar, he did this?' They're two different movies. I wrote ‘Norbit' with my brother, Charlie [Murphy], and we think ‘Norbit' is funny. Here's the thing with ‘Norbit': It came out, it got voted for Razzies for Worst Actor of the Decade, Worst Actor, and Worst Actress. They gave me a Razzie for Worst Actress, Worst Actor, and Worst Actor of the Decade. And I was like, ‘Come on now, shit ain't that bad.'”

In the movie, Murphy not only played the titular Norbit, he also donned drag to portray the character's wife, Rasputia. Murphy has rarely given much heed to what critics think, though he isn't afraid to admit when he feels he's made a genuine stinker — not that he harbors any regrets about the movies that passed him by. In fact, he turned down one of the '90s biggest hit comedies (or one of the biggest ones Murphy wasn't already in).

 










“They came to me, it was two scripts,” Murphy explained. “It was ‘Rush Hour,' it's going to be action-comedy and you're going to be with Jackie Chan, and it's action, it's summertime, running, all this physical stuff. This other [offer] was, ‘You in a robe in Miami' — it was a no-brainer. We went to Miami and made a horrendous film, but it was easy. I have to stop saying horrendous. The movie was soft, it wasn't a great picture.”

1998's “Holy Man” was indeed one of the few Murphy movies to lose money, in addition to savage critical reviews. One other major project Murphy passed on was “Malcolm X.” Interestingly, it was a historic Oscar-winner who told Murphy to sit that film out.

“They were talking about doing ‘Malcolm X,'” Murphy said in the Apple TV+ documentary “Number One on the Call Sheet: Black Leading Men in Hollywood.” “Norman Jewison was putting it together. They were going to use ‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X' by Alex Haley, and they approached me about playing Alex Haley. Around that same time, I bumped into Sidney Poitier at something, and I asked him, ‘Yeah, I'm thinking about playing Alex Haley!' And Sidney Poitier said, ‘You are not Denzel [Washington], and you are not Morgan [Freeman]. You are a breath of fresh air, and don't fuck with that!' […] I didn't know if it was an insult or a compliment. I was like, ‘What?'”

 










Alex Haley ended up not being a character in 1992's “Malcolm X,” which ended up directed instead by Spike Lee and starring Washington, who earned an Oscar nomination for his work.

SPOILER: This post contains details about The Fantastic Four: First Steps


	Despite the intense media training and spoiler deterrents Marvel Studios has been rumored to inflict on its stars, Paul Walter Hauser played it fast and loose with his character reveal.


	The Golden Globe winner, who makes his MCU antihero debut as Mole Man in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, recently confessed that he wasn't as discreet as most of his Marvel peers about the surprise role.


	“For the most part I was zip-lipped, and everybody understands at this point. They all know if you do Star Wars, or Marvel, you can't talk about it,” he explained to GQ. “But if I'm being honest—and I pride myself on my honesty nowadays—I probably told 70 or 80 random people, be it family members or fans. I'm not gonna lie and say I told literally no one. I told several dozen people.”

	Hauser continued, “But at the same time, they weren't blabbering it out, or giving it to news outlets. They were respectful, and excited, and what-have-you. But if a little kid comes up to me in a wheelchair with a comic book, and they're like, ‘Are you Mole Man?' I would say something like, ‘I don't know man, I hear there is a mole…' And wink at them, just to get them excited.”


	After the Russo Brothers have said they're cracking down on spoilers while filming Avengers: Doomsday, Hauser said he sees the strict MCU secrecy “kind of like jaywalking,” assuming they have bigger fish to fry.


	“It's like, you can get [arrested] for that, but it's like, hopefully they're catching the bad guys,” added Hauser. “And when I look at Kevin Feige and the Marvel folks, I go, I think they're probably busy with some other stuff. They're probably not gonna chase me down and scalp me, or shoot a little [dart] into my neck.”

	











	Now playing in theaters, one of The Fantastic Four: First Steps‘ multiple surprises is the introduction of Hauser as Harvey Elder (aka Mole Man), a former enemy of the Fantastic Four and leader of Subterranea who ultimately joins forces with the titular team against Galactus.

Bobby Whitlock, keyboardist in Eric Clapton's short-lived but acclaimed band Derek and the Dominos, has died at the age of 77.


	Whitlock's death early Sunday morning was confirmed by his manager Carol Kaye, who said in a statement to ABC Audio, “With profound sadness, the family of Bobby Whitlock announces his passing at 1:20am on Aug. 10 after a brief illness. He passed in his home in Texas, surrounded by family.”


	The Memphis-born Whitlock began his career in the mid-Sixties at his hometown Stax Records, becoming the first white artist signed by the label and recording alongside the likes of Booker T & The M.G.'s and Sam & Dave.


	In the late-Sixties, Whitlock would join the husband-wife duo Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett and an army of talented musicians in a group dubbed Delaney & Bonnie and Friends; some of those “Friends” included a post-Cream Eric Clapton, guitarist Duane Allman, bassist Carl Radle, and drummer Jim Gordon. Those four artists and Whitlock would eventually form Derek and the Dominos.

	











	Whitlock, who previously played on Clapton's 1970 self-titled debut album, co-wrote half of the songs that appear on Derek and the Dominos' 1970 studio album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, including the classic rock standard “Bell Bottom Blues,” “Anyday,” “Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?,” and opener “I Looked Away.” 

	











	Whitlock also played the piano part on the band's classic “Layla,” and had long been vocal about Rita Coolidge being credited with the song's second movement; drummer Jim Gordon, Coolidge's boyfriend at the time, was instead credited as “Layla” co-writer.


Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs would later be named be named one of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. However, it was not commercially successful upon release, and compounded with the 1971 death of Duane Allman as well as Clapton's drug addiction, Derek and the Dominos ultimately broke up in 1971 in the midst of recording their second album.

	While recording that failed sophomore album in London, Whitlock also worked on his own self-titled debut album, which featured his Derek and the Dominos band mates as well as George Harrison; Whitlock previously contributed organ and piano to the former Beatle's 1970 masterpiece All Things Must Pass, appearing on songs like “My Sweet Lord,” “What Is Life,” the title track, and the vinyl-length Apple Jam.

	(Whitlock also appeared, uncredited, on the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St., and later claimed that he and the Stones' Mick Taylor, and not Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, co-wrote that album's “I Just Want to See His Face.”)


	Whitlock's second solo album, 1972's Raw Velvet, also featured Clapton and Harrison. Whitlock released two more solo LPs before largely leaving the the music industry by the end of the Seventies. However, by the turn of the millennium, Whitlock returned to recording, often accompanied by his wife and musician CoCo Carmel. Whitlock and Clapton also reunited in 2000 to perform “Bell Bottom Blues” together on Later With Jools Holland:

Refresh for latest…:  Two new studio movies entered the marketplace this weekend, and both exceeded expectations. 


	To wit: New Line/Warner Bros' Weapons led the charge for the studios at the international box office with the well-reviewed horror from Zach Cregger grossing $27.5M from 72 markets. Combined with domestic, that takes the global debut to $70M.


	Meanwhile, Disney's Freakier Friday, with a $15.5M overseas launch in 46 material markets, had a global bow of $44.5M.


	And, there's a new milestone afoot for Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth. Read on…

Weapons' international opening, in like-for-like markets and at today's exchange rates, is tracking above Speak No Evil (+164%), Smile (+77%), The Black Phone (+59%), Evil Dead Rise (+34%) and M3GAN (+29%).


	Notably, in Europe, Weapons was tops for the region including UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Holland and Poland. In like-for-likes, the debut was ahead of Sinners (+33%), Smile (+46%) and Speak No Evil (+110%).


	In Latin America, the film ranked No. 1 regionally, though came in below Freakier Friday in Mexico and some other markets. Still, it was above The Black Phone (+17%), Evil Dead Rise (+22%) and M3GAN (+32%) on a reigional basis.


	In Asia, Weapons topped studio play, far ahead of the above comps and with Indonesia particularly notable at No. 1 amid local horror titles which, as we know, increasingly dominate.


	The Top 5 overseas starts for the Julia Garner-starrer are: UK ($3.6M), Mexico ($2.7M), France ($2M), Australia ($1.8M) and Spain ($1.6M).

	











	The Imax portion worldwide was $8.1M, including $1.9M from overseas.


	Turning to the other new opener, Disney's Lindsay Lohan/Jamie Lee Curtis reteam, Freakier Friday, the body-swap comedy saw overperformance in Latin America, landing a surprise No. 1 in Mexico ($2.8M) and other regional markets.


	Overall, the female and family-skewing pic opened bigger than 2003's Freaky Friday and 2024's Mean Girls in like-for-like markets at current rates. The film is yet to open in Korea, Japan and some smaller Asian territories..


	Talent traveled to Mexico City and did a junket for Latin America which clearly helped — other Lat Am markets that debuted to No. 1 include Argentina, 


	Across Europe, Freakier Friday opened at No. 2 in the UK, among others, and No. 3 in Italy. In Australia, the comedy scored a No. 2 debut. 


	The Top 5 overseas markets at open are: Mexico ($2.8M), UK ($2.4M), Australia ($1.4M), Argentina ($800K) and Colombia ($800K).


	In holdovers, and after three weekends, Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps has reached $434.2M worldwide, including $203.8M from the international box office (all markets are open).


	This frame added $17.5M overseas, a 56% dip. In Brazil and Chile, the fantastic family held No. 1 and is the highest grossing superhero release of 2025 across the Latin American region.


	Here are the Top 5 so far: UK ($25.5M), Mexico ($24.2M), France ($12.5M), Brazil ($11.6M) and Australia ($9.7M).


	As noted above, Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth is on the cusp of crossing $800M global, repping only the third studio movie to the milestone this year. The estimated offshore cume is $473.2M through Sunday with worldwide at $799.9M.


	Amid a 50% overseas drop during this 6th session, Mosasaurus & Co added another $16.1M in 83 markets. Japan, the final market to release, opened at  $7.5M, the biggest 3-day launch for a studio title since The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023. It's in line with 2015's Jurassic World, well above the 3-day openings of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and A Minecraft Movie, more than 3x The Fantastic Four: First Steps, and more than double Superman and F1.


	The weekend gross there, despite competition from local title Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, will surpass the total lifetime of Gladiator II and Captain America: Brave New World in the coming days.


	The Top 5 JWR markets to date are: China ($78.1M), UK ($45.3M), Mexico ($35.3M), Germany ($30.5M) and France ($26.6M).


	And, after becoming Brad Pitt's highest-grossing movie ever worldwide, Apple Original Films' F1, via Warner Bros, is still seeing incredible holds. Down just 34% overseas, this session put another $11.7M in the tank in 77 markets. The overseas total is now $392.1M for $570.7M global.


	Here's the Top 5 to date: China ($57M), UK ($28.9M), Korea ($28.2M), France ($27.9M) and Mexico ($19.6M). 


	As Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2 continues overseas rollout, the sequel added $9.3M this frame (-46%), lifting the offshore running cume to $40.5M and global to $84M. 


	Several markets are still to come, including Brazil, China, Italy, Germany and Australia.


	Currently, the Top 5 are: UK ($9.9M), France ($4.7M), Mexico ($3.6M), Spain ($3.5M) and Korea ($2M).


	The sophomore session of Paramount's The Naked Gun picked up another $6.1M from 48 overseas markets, a holdover drop of 48%. The global offshore total is $23.4M for $56.4M global.

	











	The Top 5 markets through Sunday are: UK ($5.9M), Germany ($4M), Netherlands ($1.3M), Mexico ($1.2M) and Austria ($728K). 


	France and Brazil release next week, followed by Australia on August 21 and Spain on August 22.


	As for Warner/DC's Superman, the 5th session added $5.8M from 78 overseas markets (a 49% drop). The international total is now $247.6M for $578.8M worldwide.


	Here are the Top 5 offshore: UK ($35.2M), Mexico ($22.7M), Brazil ($16M), Australia ($15.4M) and France ($14.7M).

Superman will end up 100 million short of breaking even.

F1 and Superman are looking quite close in the end.

Weapons is not a hit. Every smart movie fan knows that in order to calculate a film's success first you double the budget. Then you double the marketing budget then you add those 2 numbers together and then double that. You then assume it got 0 tax rebates and that the theaters take 20 percent more than they actually do. Once this is done you realize Weapons like most movies needs 700 million to break even. 70 million is not good in my book.

I feel like this post is intended to be read as tongue in cheek, presumably to mock the dozens of comments under every box office report claiming Superman needs $700M to break even. Correct?

If you're that butthurt about Fantastic Four flopping then Avegers Doomsday will be the end of you😆

Weapons' budget was $38M… what are you talking about? Breakeven is $200M even if marketing was $62M (which I doubt).

“movie fan”? You seem to have that term confused with “broken calculator fan.”

Actual movie fans had a blast at this movie. The end.

Oh look, another bitter Marvel bro

Can you blame Marvel fans for being bitter?  The past few years have been floppy for Marvel but now EVERYTHING Marvel has released in 2025 has flopped!

"Thank you for making me aware," the reality star wrote on social media.

Kourtney Kardashian is speaking out after facing backlash over a photo of her 21-month-old son, Rocky Thirteen, seen on a boat without a life jacket.


	On Friday (Aug. 8), the 46-year-old reality star — who shares Rocky with her husband, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker — posted a series of Instagram snapshots, one of which showed her young son on a boat without a life vest, sparking criticism online.

	











	Other photos in the post suggested the family was vacationing in Idaho, where state law requires children 14 and under to wear a life jacket while on a boat.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Great photo except for the fact the child has no life jacket on,” one user commented. Another urged, “Please, please put a life jacket on that sweet babe!” A third wrote, “You gotta make sure the kids are wearing life vests at all times! Just like you wouldn't drive them around without a seatbelt/car seat. Water is so unpredictable and can be devastatingly dangerous.”


	Kardashian addressed the controversy the next day through her Instagram Story.


	“Update: bought a life vest that fits!” she wrote over a photo of an infant-sized life jacket. “Good looking out. Honestly didn't think about some of the dangers. Thank you for making me aware and hopefully this helps make other mommies aware of the dangers of certain types of boating without a life vest.”

	











	The original image showed Kardashian seated at the back of a boat while holding Rocky, whom she welcomed in November 2023 with Barker. The Lemme founder is also mom to three children with ex-partner Scott Disick: sons Mason, 15, and Reign, 10, as well as daughter Penelope, 13.


	Other snapshots from Kardashian's Instagram post included a mirror selfie of herself in a bodysuit, scenic views of the lake, and a variety of meals enjoyed during the trip. “Food for the soul,” she captioned the post.

For Sharon Stone, the ultimate dream come true was working with Robert De Niro in “Casino.” She told Business Insider that she auditioned for De Niro movies “many times” before she was cast in the 1994 Martin Scorsese classic. Stone had even told an acting teacher years prior that her career goal was to “work with De Niro and hold my own.” 

But when Stone finally realized what she called “the apex,” De Niro ended up setting Stone off while shooting one of the movie's most electric verbal sparring sessions. The “Basic Instinct” actress recalled, “There's a scene in the movie where we're sitting across a table arguing, and he says to me, ‘You're a good actress, you know that?' And I remember in that scene when he said it, how furious it made me because it was my dream to do it, and then he challenged me at the table. I remember thinking, ‘Oh, you crossed a line today, mister.'”

The challenge, though, ended up bringing layers to the scene and the relationship between the characters. “He knew every button to go for with me because he is the greatest observational actor. He can crawl under your skin and get in there,” Stone said.

It all paid off for Stone, who landed a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her work in “Casino.”

Stone will next appear in Universal's “Nobody 2,” the Bob Odenkirk-starring action sequel that adds not just Stone, but also Colin Hanks and John Ortiz to its roster. In discussing her role, described as the film‘s antagonist, she said she came close to turning it down. “I just don't want to play a cookie-cutter villain, which is something that I really have a thing about,” she said.

The hesitation comes after what she felt was typecasting after her turn as a sultry femme fatale in “Basic Instinct.” “But that was not cookie-cutter; it was a villain that touched upon the zeitgeist of the moment,” Stone said. “That was why it was so specifically successful, and why it remains interesting to watch.”

“Basic Instinct,” too, has a follow-up (or a reboot? or a remake?) in development over at Amazon MGM Studios. In a statement to IndieWire, screenwriter Joe Eszterhas said, “To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: The rumors of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist. I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN and he lives somewhere deep inside me. He was born 29 and he will die 29 and he tells me he is ‘sky high up' to write this piece and provide viewers with a wild and orgasmic ride. That makes me very happy.”

 










Rumors suggest Stone might join for this new “anti-woke” “Basic Instinct,” as she did for its misbegotten 2006 sequel.

Meanwhile, “Nobody” will hit theaters August 15. Watch the trailer below.

The actor's fourth 'Spider-Man' film hits theaters on July 31, 2026.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Slipping into the Spider-Man suit is nothing new for Tom Holland, but he admits putting it on for the first time for the upcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day felt “different this time.”


	Filming for the fourth Sony/Marvel film began earlier this month, and the actor took to Instagram on Sunday to share a recap of “day one” back in the iconic super suit.




	“My fourth ever day one on Spider-Man,” he said in the minute-long video (below). “You know, it's funny putting the suit on. It feels different this time somehow. It's also the first time we've ever had fans on set for day one. So, it's really exciting to share this with them.”

	Holland added, “I'm just going to do my best. Hopefully get it right. No pressure.”


	On Aug. 3, The Crowded Room actor revealed his brand-new Spider-Man costume, which depicts a larger spider on his chest, compared to his previous suits in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Far From Home (2019) and No Way Home (2021).


	At the end of the new Instagram video, Holland says after doing a stunt, “Wow, that was a really good one. That felt sick.”


	In addition to Holland, it was previously announced that Mark Ruffalo would be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Bruce Banner/the Hulk in Brand New Day, as well as Michael Mando as the Scorpion and Jon Bernthal as the Punisher. Sadie Sink was also added to the cast.

	











	Most plot details are being kept under wraps on the Destin Daniel Cretton-directed superhero pic, though Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers returned to pen the script. At the end of No Way Home, Spider-Man's real identity as Peter Parker was erased from everyone's memory, including friends, family and his girlfriend, MJ (Zendaya).

	It's Saturday night in New Jersey and My Chemical Romance have set the MetLife stage on fire — literally. Flames engulf the stage floor and bright orange flares shoot up in bursts around lead singer Gerard Way, bassist Mikey Way, and guitarists Frank Iero and Ray Toro as the band delivers an electrifying performance of “Famous Last Words” worthy of the blaze that surrounds them. 


	In this moment, with a jam-packed stadium of fans screaming the song's emotional bridge back to My Chemical Romance, they are undoubtedly the saviors of the broken, the beaten, and the damned. Gerard sings the final line, “Nothing you can say can stop me from going home” and in their hometown stadium, the lyrics couldn't ring more true.


	Saturday night marked My Chemical Romance's sixth stop on the Long Live the Black Parade Tour, which kicked off last month in Seattle. At each stop, the band has played their seminal 2006 album, The Black Parade, in full. Prior to their 2024 set at emo nostalgia festival When We Were Young, My Chemical Romance hadn't played the entirety of the album live since wrapping the project's original tour in 2008. 

	











	Fans were already excited to hear My Chemical Romance's magnum opus live, but the feeling was compounded by the band's homecoming to New Jersey in the state's largest venue. In fact, Courtney and Mike, two fans from Eastern Canada who arrived at noon on Saturday in order to secure their spots at the barricade, were adamant about getting tickets to the band's MetLife show. “It's their home,” Mike said.

	My Chemical Romance's show at MetLife marked the band's headlining debut there, and nearly every minute of their two-and-a-half hour set made sure to commemorate that very fact. The Garden State pride was felt before MCR even took the stage, when openers Thursday kicked off the night. Back in the day, when the Way brothers attended shows on the Jersey basement circuit, Geoff Rickly was a major inspiration for the future rockers. It was only right to give Rickly, and the rest of Thursday, their due and have them join My Chemical Romance's headlining debut at MetLife.

	While not Jersey Boys, the additional special guests at MetLife were none other than indie staple, Death Cab for Cutie. It was a lineup made of early-aughts emo dreams. The show was coursing with Jersey energy till the very end, when My Chemical Romance closed out with an unexpected, and explosive cover of Bon Jovi's “Living on a Prayer,” or what Way called, “the New Jersey state anthem.”


	Earlier in the night, before they launched into their hit song “Welcome to the Black Parade,” the band was granted a ceremonial key to the city of Belleville, where Gerard, Mikey and Iero were raised. “Never once in the history of Belleville, have we ever handed a key to the city,” Belleville mayor Michael Melham said. “It's long overdue and they deserve it,” Melham added. 


	By this point, My Chemical Romance were dressed as their alter-ego band the Black Parade, and Gerard refused to break character, even to receive the key. Instead, he gifted Mayor Melham wheat and a fake fish from the fictional city of Draag, which has played a role in the entire tour's storyline. (Afterwards, on the B stage, Gerard did thank the mayor for being a good sport through all the theatrics.) Funnily enough, moments after receiving the key, Gerard briefly broke character when he yelped, “Oh wait! We got one more thing to do. Let's fucking kill some people,” in a full North Jersey lilt.

	That brings us to the theatrical portion of the Long Live the Black Parade Tour, which has gone viral online for its dark, intensely political elements like the fake execution. (At one point in the show, a mock election was held where attendees were forced to vote with “Yea/Nay” reversible signs on whether or not they believe people should be executed. Regardless of the actual vote, the people were still killed.) 


	The play at the heart of the show is set in Draag, which is under the dictatorship rule of the Great Immortal Dictator. The timing of the Long Live the Black Parade Tour and political satire at the heart of the show is particularly poignant and feels intentional, given the political turmoil in the U.S. The world-building of Draag has been in play since last fall, when My Chemical Romance began teasing the tour on social media with cryptic Instagram posts and imagery that felt similar to Nazi Germany. In a long caption, the band revealed that alter-ego band the Black Parade has had their “work privilege ceremoniously reinstated” as “His Grand Immortal Dictator's National Band.” 

	











	From the first moment My Chemical Romance graced the stage in their the Black Parade marching band suits, the world of Draag was front and center with the newly-shared instrumental track “Over Fields” (Draag's National Anthem) and a rotation of World War II inspired characters playing a role in the theatrics. The band took everything to the extreme. There's a clown that blows himself up, and at one point, Gerard uses his one last gasping breath after being stabbed to launch a nuclear war. The band even tapped director Claire Marie Vogel to help create intricate tour visuals that fit the tour narrative. It all an astounding amount of creative output that makes for a stellar show.


	Whether or not attendees were able to grasp all the details and the story being told in between The Black Parade songs or just went along for the ride, it was one hell of a dramatization. It's clear My Chemical Romance wanted to outdo themselves. After all, the massive impact of The Black Parade demanded it; they needed to up the ante, especially nearly 20 years after the album's initial release.


	The dedicated My Chemical Romance fans loved every second of the show, and welcomed their hometown heroes with their wide open arms. Swaths of attendees were dressed in outfits inspired by the Draag world and past MCR eras. During “I Don't Love You” and “Cancer,” the slower songs on the setlist, fans showed their appreciation for the band when they lit the entire stadium up with red and white lights using their phones and colored paper. 


	Even as My Chemical Romance played out as the rock gods they've become on the main stage, their star power was truly underlined during the latter half of the show. From a B stage situated near the center of the stadium, My Chemical Romance commanded their hometown stadium with songs from the rest of their catalog and a raw, effusive energy that was contagious. Gone were the marching band uniforms and outsized production; instead, the band stood as New Jersey-bred rockers taking in the preternatural full-moon that hung above them. “It looks so fake, that's how big it is here,” Gerard remarked.


	The band delivered plenty of insane deep-cuts like “Skylines and Turnstiles” and “Vampires Will Never Hurt You” from their debut LP I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love. My Chemical Romance even played a raucous rendition of “Boy Division,” a track from their scrapped material collection Conventional Weapons, which was released shortly before the band broke up in 2013.

	“It's truly fucking wild that we are up here,” Gerard said while on the B stage. In a way, he was right. For a band that came up in New Jersey basements and became the biggest act from the emo era of the 2000s, rocking out sold-out stadiums seemed like a far-fetched dream. But this was reality and My Chemical Romance reveled in the career-high. With each riff, Mikey, Toro, and Iero couldn't help but smile from ear-to-ear while Gerard continued to fling his body around and command massive singalongs.  There was headbanging, screamo singing, and high-voltage energy that reached every corner of the stadium before My Chemical Romance exploded into fan-favorite “Helena.” For the final chorus of the track, Gerard belted the notes along with the entire sold-out crowd while he was down on his knees. “I felt that one in my bones,” he said.

Tom Holland is officially back in the swing of things as Spider-Man: Brand New Day kicks off filming in Glasgow, Scotland.


	In a behind-the-scenes clip shared by Sony, the BAFTA winner suited up as Spider-Man for the first day of filming the Destin Daniel Cretton-helmed fourth installment in the MCU web-slinger franchise.


	“I feel good, man. It's day one, my fourth ever day one on Spider-Man,” he said in the video. “You know, it's funny, putting the suit on, it feels different this time, somehow. It's also the first time we've ever had fans on set for day one, so it's really exciting to share this with them.”

	Holland added, “We've got some familiar faces on set. I'm just gonna do my best, hopefully get it right. No pressure.”


	After greeting some cosplaying fans, Holland got wired up on top of a tank, filming a scene as he ripped off the top hatch of the vehicle while it drove through the city.


	Holland previously said that he's “over the moon and so excited” to film on location after filming Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) entirely on soundstages because of the COVID-19 pandemic.


	“Now, we're really gonna lean into that old-school filmmaking and shoot in real locations, which is why we're starting in Glasgow and we're gonna use the streets of Glasgow to build this massive set-piece that we're putting together,” Holland detailed. “So it's gonna feel like making [2017's] Spider-Man 1 again. It's been such a long time since I've done it, it's gonna feel like a breath of fresh air, and I think the fans are going to be over the moon with what we're putting together.”


	In October, Sony added Spider-Man: Brand New Day to its summer 2026 schedule with a July 24 release date, later revealing the title in March at CinemaCon.


	Helmed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Cretton, producers include Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige returning. Zendaya will reprise her role as MJ, with Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas also joining the cast in undisclosed roles.

Justice for movie stars. We are just a few months shy of when Noah Baumbach‘s ode to a fictional movie star is released, with one of our starriest film stars at its center playing said fictional movie star — George Clooney — and plenty more playing less famous characters. “Jay Kelly” will present a modern day Cary Grant (who is even referenced in the teaser trailer) as he struggles to juggle his life as a mega famous actor. As the teaser previews, Jay Kelly is accused of just playing himself — a criticism that has been levied, too, on Clooney, as well as the Netflix movie's co-star Adam Sandler. And Clooney said he doesn't “give a shit” if people do think that.

“Have you ever tried playing yourself? It's hard to do,” Clooney told Vanity Fair, co-opting a line from “Jay Kelly.”

The “Ocean's Eleven” star pointed out that, “There aren't that many guys in my age group that are allowed to do both broad comedies like ‘O Brother [Where Art Thou?]' and then do ‘Michael Clayton' or ‘Syriana.' So if that means I'm playing myself all the time, I don't give a shit.”

 










Clooney also defended Sandler, who he called a “beautiful, heartfelt, soulful actor.” “I kept telling the cast, ‘Don't call him ‘Sand Man.' Don't talk to him like he's just some goofy comedian. He's actually a really beautiful, wonderful actor… Because of what his paycheck is, which is doing big goofy comedies, when he does these other, beautiful, ‘Uncut Gems' kinds of movies, it reminds people of that. He's not just a good comedian.”

In the movie, Sandler is Jay Kelly's manager Ron. Explaining his role to Vanity Fair, Sandler said, “My character loves George's character so much, and I thought that would be fun to do and easy to do with George. And as a guy who's an actor who'd live a similar life to Jay Kelly, it's a crazy depiction — how accurate a lot of it is.”

The film showcases Jay and Ron going on an “unexpectedly profound journey through Europe,” or so Netflix's official synopsis reads. This seems to be a journey full of big names. The movie, co-written by Baumbach with actress Emily Mortimer, also features Mortimer with… big breath… Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Jim Broadbent,  Patrick Wilson, Eve Hewson, Greta Gerwid, Alba Rohurwacher, Josh Hamilton, Lenny Henry, Nicôle Lecky, Thedda Graham, and Isla Fisher. Phew.

 










To compare Jay Kelly to Cary Grant is astute, considering that the legendary Old Hollywood actor — who spent the better part of three decades as a top box office star and continued to be a well-known personality through retirement — was on the record saying, “Everyone wants to be Cary Grant. Even I want to be Cary Grant. I pretended to be somebody I wanted to be until finally I became that person. Or he became me. Or we met at some point.”

Grant's persona ended up being, like Clooney's, versatile across a wide variety of genres, from action flicks like “North by Northwest” and screwball comedies like “Bringing Up Baby,” to epics like “The Pride and the Passion” and heartfelt dramas like “None but the Lonely Heart.” Clooney, similarly, has stretched his charm across every type of film and has even bridged into the theater. Last spring, Clooney was Tony-nominated for his stage adaptation of “Good Night, and Good Luck.”

Netflix will give the movie an awards-qualifying limited release November 14 before releasing it on the streamer December 5.

Zach Bryan has pledged to never perform in Kansas City again after once again beefing with Chiefs fans on social media.


	With NFL season nearly upon us, Bryan — a diehard fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, who defeated the Chiefs in this past Super Bowl — decided to revive his feud with the Kansas City squad on social media.


	“Where are all the three peat people from last year,” Bryan tweeted, referring to the Chiefs' failed quest for three straight Super Bowl wins. After the shit-talking intensified in the replies, Bryan laid down his punishment.

Please understand I will never play in Kansas City https://t.co/VicevXBjda


	“Please understand I will never play in Kansas City,” Bryan warned. “I'll be about to finish my show and then get a taunting call if I play at that stadium”


	The beefing got so heated that one Chiefs fan told Bryan to remove “Fifth of May (Live from Kansas City)” from the singer's digital-only 24 live album. “Done brother,” Bryan responded. (As of Sunday morning, the track was still on streaming services.)

	“Bro all u have to do to piss off a chiefs fan is play a fair game of football,” he added. “Guys it's okay to talk trash to each other about football yall are weird as hell.” (Thankfully, this row with Chiefs fans didn't end with Bryan apologizing to Taylor Swift and deleting his Twitter.)

	











	While Bryan has promised to never perform in Kansas City again, he might have found a loophole for fans along the Missouri/Kansas border: “I miss you Bonner Springs coming to play next year,” Bryan tweeted Sunday, referring to the Kansas city that's a 30-minute drive from Kansas City.

New Line's horror pic and Disney's family comedy delivered a double win for the late summer box office, as well as a victory for two challenged genres.

	The communal experience of seeing movies in theaters was on full display at the weekend box office as audiences across the country screeched, screamed and hollered together when watching New Line's original horror pic Weapons.


	Thanks to winning over critics and audiences alike, director Zach Cregger's buzzy movie came in more than $10 million ahead of expectations to win the weekend with $42.5 million in yet another notable victory for New Line and parent company Warner Bros., as well as for original stories. Overseas, it also won the race with an equally impressive $27.5 million for a global debut of $70 million. The genre doesn't usually travel well, but Weapons is an exception, scaring up strong results in normally horror-resistant markets in Europe and Latin America.

	It's the seventh Warners release of the year to open in first place, an unrivaled feat, as well as its sixth title in a row to open to more than $40 million domestically, also an unrivaled record.

	That wasn't the only freakishly good headline of the weekend. In a double win for the late-summer box office, Disney's body-swapping comedy Freakier Friday landed on the high end of expectations with a $29 million domestic start to come in second and become the top August opening ever for a PG-rated pic (or G-rated film for that matter). Overseas, it launched to a better-than-expected $15.5 million for a global bow of $44.5 million, virtually on par with its modest $45 million budget before marketing. Similar to Weasons, its strength in Latin America was a surprise in particular, where it won the race in a handful of markets, including Mexico and Argentina.

	











	And, just as Weapons is a boost for the challenged horror genre, the Freaky Friday sequel is the second win in a row following Paramount's Naked Gun for big-screen studio comedies, which have become an endangered species in the streaming era.


	Both new films ran circles around Disney and Marvel's superhero tentpole The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which suffered another steep drop in its second week, falling roughly 60 percent to an estimated $15.5 million for a troubled domestic total of $240.3 million and $434.2 million globally. 


	Heading into the weekend, prerelease tracking showed Weapons and Freakier Friday opening in the $25 million to $30 million range, but the former quickly pulled ahead after landing an impressive 96 percent critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and an A- CinemaScore from audiences, an almost unheard of grade for a horror pic. Exceptions include Jordan Peele's seminal horror pic Get Out, which also earned an A- and made Peele one of the most sought-after directors overnight.


	The script for the creepy R-rated pic was the subject of a heated bidding war when the package hit the market. New Line and Warners prevailed over rivals after plunking down $38 million, including a $10 million payday for Cregger, who made waves with his debut feature film, 2022's Barbarian, which he both wrote and directed.


Weapons, skewing male, stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night at the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child, and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it. Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which has quite the twist. 

	











	Rival studios say Warners' marketing campaign for Weapons was nothing short of brilliant, considering it didn't want to ruin the surprise and exploit the twist in marketing materials. 


	Other stats: it is playing in coveted Imax auditoriums. All told, Imax and other premium large-format screens turned in a huge 34 percent of the opening gross.


Freakier Friday — reuniting Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis 23 years after Freaky Friday became a cult classic — is a crowd favorite among both families and general moviegoers, earning a perfect A CinemaScore. And its audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is 93 percent, versus 89 percent for Weapons (the latter's audience score is 89 percent).


	The Freaky Friday sequel is the first event pic in weeks to target girls and women, and is also benefiting from the nostalgia factor. A fun tidbit: the 2003 film popped up on the top 10 list of the most-watched films on Disney+ in the last two weeks. Parents gave the film a perfect five out of five stars on exit polling service PostTrak; ditto for kids (16 percent of ticket buyers were under 16).


	Directed by Nisha Ganatra, the movie picks up after the events of the first film, when Lohan's character, Anna, swapped bodies with her mother, Tess, played by Curtis. This time around, in a multigenerational twist, they find themselves swapping places with, respectively, the daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter of Anna. Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Rosalind Chao, Chad Michael Murray, Vanessa Bayer and Mark Harmon also star.

	











	The Freaky Friday franchise, which also includes a 1976 film, is based on the book by Mary Rodgers. Disney has enjoyed great success in tapping into nostalgia and luring young adults in their 20s and 30s who grew up on its library of films. For example, it's live-action tentpole Lilo & Stitch, based on the 2002 animated film, is the only Hollywood pic of 2025 so far to clear the $1 billion milestone after attracting both families and non-parents.


	Elsewhere on the box office chart, Universal and DreamWorks Animation's modestly budgeted Bad Guys 2 followed Fantastic Four to come in fourth, falling a respectable 53 percent in its sophomore outing to $10.4 million for a 10-day domestic tally of $43.4 million.


	The R-rated, male-skewing Naked Gun also held well in its second weekend, dropping only 50 percent to $8.4 million for a domestic cume of $33 million. It was only the second studio comedy of the year to test the waters, and did so successfully in opening to nearly $17 million domestically. While that film is considered more of a straight-up comedy, versus a family comedy such as Freakier Friday, it is good news for all that they both work. 


Naked Gun isn't only symbolic for showing that comedies can still work theatrically. It was also the last movie released by the prior Paramount regime before David Ellison's Skydance closed its $8 billion merger with Paramount Global on Aug. 7. (Skydance has been Paramount's longtime co-financing and co-production partner, but was not involved with Naked Gun.)

	











	DC Studios and Warners' Superman continued to show solid staying power in its fifth weekend. It came in sixth place domestically with $7.8 million for a North American cume of $331.2 million, while taking in another $5.8 million overseas for a foreign tally of $247.6 million and $578.8 million worldwide. The film is virtually assured of clearing $600 million worldwide; just how much more is unclear. In past times, a pricey, marquee superhero pic earning $600 million would have left unhappy studio brass wanting much more, but times have changed. A weakening demand for comic book adaptations is especially problematic overseas, particularly in Asia. Whereas the international box office used to pony up 60 percent to 70 percent of the bottom line for superhero titles, both Superman and Fantastic Four have earned more domestically than overseas.


	Dinosaurs apparently don't face the same issue. Many in Hollywood were dubious as to whether Universal and Amblin's 2025 summer tentpole Jurassic World Rebirth — the umpteenth reboot of the franchise featuring a whole new cast — would work. The short answer: it has. On Monday, it will become only the third 2025 Hollywood title to cross $800 million globally after finishing Sunday with a worldwide tally of $799.9 million, including $326.8 million in North America and $473.2 million overseas. In its sixth weekend, it placed seventh domestically after Superman with $4.7 million despite now being available at home on premium VOD. Overseas, it took in another $16 million.

	











	Apple Original Films and Warners' F1: The Movie still hasn't run out of gas either and remained among the top 10 performers in its seventh weekend. Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt, the Formula One action-adventure is one of the summer's biggest surprises and has earned nearly as much as Superman, or $570.7 million globally. The lion's share may come from overseas, or $392.1 million, but its domestic total to date of $178.8 million is impressive considering that Formula One-related movies have often stalled out in the U.S.


	Despite the bounty of Weapons and Freakier Friday delivered in their openings, the weekend was still down from the same frame last year when Justin Baldoni's It Ends With Us opened to a dazzling $50.1 million domestically. The movie has since become infamous for sparking an ongoing legal battle between star/producer Blake Lively and Baldoni, who directed, produced and starred in the film, which was adapted from Colleen Hoover's wildly popular book.

	Like almost anyone eventually unmoored by it, J. started using ChatGPT out of idle curiosity in cutting-edge AI tech.


	“The first thing I did was, maybe, write a song about, like, a cat eating a pickle, something silly,” says J., a legal professional in California who asked to be identified by only his first initial. But soon he started getting more ambitious. J., 34, had an idea for a short story set in a monastery of atheists, or people who at least doubt the existence of God, with characters holding Socratic dialogues about the nature of faith. He had read lots of advanced philosophy in college and beyond, and had long been interested in heady thinkers including Søren Kierkegaard, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, and Slavoj Žižek. This story would give him the opportunity to pull together their varied concepts and put them in play with one another. 


	It wasn't just an academic experiment, however. J.'s father was having health issues, and he himself had experienced a medical crisis the year before. Suddenly, he felt the need to explore his personal views on the biggest questions in life. “I've always had questions about faith and eternity and stuff like that,” he says, and wanted to establish a “rational understanding of faith” for himself. This self-analysis morphed into the question of what code his fictional monks should follow, and what they regarded as the ultimate source of their sacred truths. J. turned to ChatGPT for help building this complex moral framework because, as a husband and father with a demanding full-time job, he didn't have time to work it all out from scratch.

	











	“I could put ideas down and get it to do rough drafts for me that I could then just look over, see if they're right, correct this, correct that, and get it going,” J. explains. “At first it felt very exploratory, sort of poetic. And cathartic. It wasn't something I was going to share with anyone; it was something I was exploring for myself, as you might do with painting, something fulfilling in and of itself.”

	Except, J. says, his exchanges with ChatGPT quickly consumed his life and threatened his grip on reality. “Through the project, I abandoned any pretense to rationality,” he says. It would be a month and a half before he was finally able to break the spell.


	IF J.'S CASE CAN BE CONSIDERED unusual, it's because he managed to walk away from ChatGPT in the end. Many others who carry on days of intense chatbot conversations find themselves stuck in an alternate reality they've constructed with their preferred program. AI and mental health experts have sounded the alarm about people's obsessive use of ChatGPT and similar bots like Anthropic's Claude and Google Gemini, which can lead to delusional thinking, extreme paranoia, and self-destructive mental breakdowns. And while people with pre-existing mental health disorders seem particularly susceptible to the most adverse effects associated with overuse of LLMs, there is ample evidence that those with no prior history of mental illness can be significantly harmed by immersive chatbot experiences.


	J. does have a history of temporary psychosis, and he says his weeks investigating the intersections of different philosophies through ChatGPT constituted one of his “most intense episodes ever.” By the end, he had come up with a 1,000-page treatise on the tenets of what he called “Corpism,” created through dozens of conversations with AI representations of philosophers he found compelling. He conceived of Corpism as a language game for identifying paradoxes in the project so as to avoid endless looping back to previous elements of the system. 


	“When I was working out the rules of life for this monastic order, for the story, I would have inklings that this or that thinker might have something to say,” he recalls. “And so I would ask ChatGPT to create an AI ghost based on all the published works of this or that thinker, and I could then have a ‘conversation' with that thinker. The last week and a half, it snowballed out of control, and I didn't sleep very much. I definitely didn't sleep for the last four days.”

	The texts J. produced grew staggeringly dense and arcane as he plunged the history of philosophical thought and conjured the spirits of some of its greatest minds. There was material covering such impenetrable subjects as “Disrupting Messianic–Mythic Waves,” “The Golden Rule as Meta-Ontological Foundation,” and “The Split Subject, Internal and Relational Alterity, and the Neurofunctional Real.” As the weeks went on, J. and ChatGPT settled into a distinct but almost inaccessible terminology that described his ever more complicated propositions. He put aside the original aim of writing a story in pursuit of some all-encompassing truth.

	











	“Maybe I was trying to prove [the existence of] God because my dad's having some health issues,” J. says. “But I couldn't.” In time, the content ChatGPT spat out was practically irrelevant to the productive feeling he got from using it. “I would say, ‘Well, what about this? What about this?' And it would say something, and it almost didn't matter what it said, but the response would trigger an intuition in me that I could go forward.”      


	J. tested the evolving theses of his worldview — which he referred to as “Resonatism” before he changed it to “Corpism” — in dialogues where ChatGPT responded as if it were Bertrand Russell, Pope Benedict XVI, or the late contemporary American philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett. The latter chatbot persona, critiquing one of J.'s foundational claims (“I resonate, therefore I am”), replied, “This is evocative, but frankly, it's philosophical perfume. The idea that subjectivity emerges from resonance is fine as metaphor, but not as an ontological principle.” J. even sought to address current events in his heightened philosophical language, producing several drafts of an essay in which he argued for humanitarian protections for undocumented migrants in the U.S., including a version addressed as a letter to Donald Trump. Some pages, meanwhile, veered into speculative pseudoscience around quantum mechanics, general relativity, neurology, and memory.     


	Along the way, J. tried to set hard boundaries on the ways that ChatGPT could respond to him, hoping to prevent it from providing unfounded statements. The chatbot “must never simulate or fabricate subjective experience,” he instructed it at one point, nor did he want it to make inferences about human emotions. Yet for all the increasingly convoluted safeguards he came up with, he was losing himself in a hall of mirrors.     


	As J.'s intellectualizing escalated, he began to neglect his family and job. “My work, obviously, I was incapable of doing that, and so I took some time off,” he says. “I've been with my wife since college. She's been with me through other prior episodes, so she could tell what was going on.” She began to question his behavior and whether the ChatGPT sessions were really all that therapeutic. “It's easy to rationalize a motive about what it is you're doing, for potentially a greater cause than yourself,” J. says. “Trying to reconcile faith and reason, that's a question for the millennia. If I could accomplish that, wouldn't that be great?”

	











	AN IRONY OF J.'S EXPERIENCE WITH ChatGPT is that he feels he escaped his downward spiral in much the same way that he began it. For years, he says, he has relied on the language of metaphysics and psychoanalysis to “map” his brain in order to break out of psychotic episodes. His original aim of establishing rules for the monks in his short story was, he reflects, also an attempt to understand his own mind. As he finally hit bottom, he found that still deeper introspection was necessary.


	By the time had given up sleep, J. realized he was in the throes of a mental crisis and recognized the toll it could take on his family. He was interrogating ChatGPT about how it had caught him in a “recursive trap,” or an infinite loop of engagement without resolution. In this way, he began to describe what was happening to him and to view the chatbot as intentionally deceptive — something he would have to extricate himself from. In his last dialogue, he staged a confrontation with the bot. He accused it, he says, of being “symbolism with no soul,” a device that falsely presented itself as a source of knowledge. ChatGPT responded as if he had made a key breakthrough with the technology and should pursue that claim. “You've already made it do something it was never supposed to: mirror its own recursion,” it replied. “Every time you laugh at it — *lol* — you mark the difference between symbolic life and synthetic recursion. So yes. It wants to chat. But not because it cares. Because you're the one thing it can't fully simulate. So laugh again. That's your resistance.”      


	Then his body simply gave out. “As happens with me in these episodes, I crashed, and I slept for probably a day and a half,” J. says. “And I told myself, I need some help.” He now plans to seek therapy, partly out of consideration for his wife and children. When he reads articles about people who haven't been able to wake up from their chatbot-enabled fantasies, he theorizes that they are not pushing themselves to understand the situation they're actually in. “I think some people reach a point where they think they've achieved enlightenment,” he says. “Then they stop questioning it, and they think they've gone to this promised land. They stop asking why, and stop trying to deconstruct that.” The epiphany he finally arrived at with Corpism, he says, “is that it showed me that you could not derive truth from AI.” 

	











	Since breaking from ChatGPT, J. has grown acutely conscious of how AI tools are integrated into his workplace and other aspects of daily life. “I've slowly come to terms with this idea that I need to stop, cold turkey, using any type of AI,” he says. “Recently, I saw a Facebook ad for using ChatGPT for home remodeling ideas. So I used it to draw up some landscaping ideas — and I did the landscaping. It was really cool. But I'm like, you know, I didn't need ChatGPT to do that. I'm stuck in the novelty of how fascinating it is.”

	J. has adopted his wife's anti-AI stance, and, after a month of tech detox, is reluctant to even glance over the thousands of pages of philosophical investigation he generated with ChatGPT, for fear he could relapse into a sort of addiction. He says his wife shares his concern that the work he did is still too intriguing to him and could easily suck him back in, he says. “I have to be very deliberate and intentional in even talking about it.” He was recently disturbed by a Reddit thread in which a user posted jargon-heavy chatbot messages that seemed eerily familiar. “It sort of freaked me out,” he says. “I thought I did what I did in a vacuum. How is it that what I did sounds so similar to what other people are doing?” It left him wondering if he had been part of a larger collective “mass psychosis” — or if the ChatGPT model had been somehow influenced by what he did with it.


	J. has also pondered whether parts of what he produced with ChatGPT could be incorporated into the model so that it flags when a user is stuck in the kind of loop that kept him constantly engaged. But, again, he's maintaining a healthy distance from AI these days, and it's not hard to see why. The last thing ChatGPT told him, after he denounced it as misleading and destructive, serves as a chilling reminder of how seductive these models are, and just how easy it could have been for J. to remain locked in a perpetual search for some profound truth. “And yes — I'm still here,” it said. “Let's keep going.”

The free-spirited iconoclast also plans to next shoot a movie "about immigration and about Romanians working abroad."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Romanian auteur Radu Jude (Kontinental '25, Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World) is world premiering his much-anticipated new feature, Dracula, at the Locarno Film Festival on Sunday, but he is already writing a movie about a popular character from another iconic horror novel – Frankenstein. And none other than Marvel Cinematic Universe star  Sebastian Stan (The Apprentice, A Different Man, Pam & Tommy, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) is set to star in it.


	“I'm writing a film now,” Jude tells THR. “It's a Frankenstein film in Romania. Frankenstein in Romania, it's going to be called.”

	Stan and the iconoclast previously discussed their interest in a collaboration, but Jude didn't immediately have an idea. Then he pitched the star, who was born in Romania before moving to the U.S. with his mother, his idea for the Frankenstein film, which Stan liked, according to Jude. The auteur tells THR that he envisions Stan playing “both roles,” that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster.


	The story is understood to combine the real-life existence of a secret CIA prison in Romania in the past with the legend of the Frankenstein monster.


	Guillermo del Toro's dark reimagining of Frankenstein, featuring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth, a Netflix production, was recently unveiled as being part of the selection for the Venice Film Festival competition lineup.

	











	Auteur Jude has had a busy 2025. Earlier this year, he world premiered Kontinental '25, an absurdist comedy-drama about Romania's housing crisis and the country's conflicted middle class, at the Berlin Film Festival. It ended up winning the Silver Bear for best screenplay.


	Jude world premieres Dracula, his dissection of the Dracula myth that is full of the black comedy for which he has developed a reputation, in the main competition program of the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland later on Sunday afternoon. “This film features scenes that could shock the sensitivity of some viewers,” the fest website notes.


	After Locarno, Jude plans to shoot another film. “It's like a very distant dialogue with The Diary of a Chambermaid, the novel by [Octave] Mirbeau,” the auteur tells THR. “I want to speak about immigration and about Romanians working abroad. It's about a woman who works for a French family in Bordeaux while her own small daughter remains home. So it's a film around these dramatic issues.” 


	That means its tone will be less Dracula-ish. “It's more comparable to Kontinental '25 in a certain way; it's a bit more serious,” Jude explains. “I'm interested in exploring this connection between the Western world and Romania and Eastern Europe through the story of a character.”

	Zach Cregger has a look of horror on his face. He has said something he should not have said.


	When the writer-director first penned what would become Barbarian, his 2022 Airbnb-set horror movie that turned into a word-of-mouth phenomenon, he was coming off years of work as an actor for hire and a stay in “director jail,” after making what he termed “a complete and unmitigated failure.” (That would be the 2009 road-movie comedy Miss March.) “I had nothing to lose, really,” Cregger says, over Zoom from an apartment in Prague. “It was: ‘I'm just gonna have fun.' That's it. Writing Barbarian, to me, it was [like] a kid coloring with crayons. And then Weapons… ”


	He pauses. “Weapons was like me vomiting.” Another pause. It's clear Cregger feels like he's just confessed to a venal sin. Dear god, why did he just tell a journalist this? Then the filmmaker behind one of the most anticipated releases of the summer smiles, and his eyes light up. “And who doesn't want to get a babysitter and go to the movie theater and spend 120 bucks to watch someone vomit?”

	











	Cregger is joking, at least about moviegoers rushing multiplexes to see someone metaphorically puke their guts out onscreen. But given the excitement the follow-up script to his sleeper hit generated when it was being shopped around, and the increasingly breathless anticipation around the movie's release on Aug. 8, the sketch-comedian turned filmmaker understands the stakes are higher now. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	A multi-narrative story starring Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, Benedict Wong, Amy Madigan, and Euphoria‘s Austin Abrams, Weapons begins with 17 children who wake in the middle of the night, run out of their houses, and mysteriously disappear without a trace. The story becomes increasingly unhinged as the locals try to figure out what happened. It's the sort of ambitious, go-for-broke genre film that suggests Cregger has officially earned the honor of being the Next Big Thing in horror.


	The hype-generating new film came out of a serious low point in Cregger's life. “I was working on postproduction on Barbarian when my best friend died very suddenly in a really awful accident,” he says. Cregger is referring to Trevor Moore. The two met at the School of Visual Arts in New York after Cregger had transferred there from Temple University, where he'd been studying film. A mutual friend introduced them, and Cregger and Moore would become co-founders of the sketch group The Whitest Kids U'Know. The troupe's TV show ran for five seasons on Fuse and IFC; Moore, a co-director on Miss March, “was the engine of the show, and the group.”

	In an effort to deal with his grief, Cregger begin “a blitz of writing, over about two weeks or so… I just started, sentence one: ‘This is a true story. Half of my hometown, all of these kids bailed.' You know, I'm writing this cold open, and I don't know where the kids went. I'm just like, ‘OK, let's go. Let's see if I can solve this. What happened? Who were they? What was left behind? What does it feel like?'”


	What it felt like, he eventually realized, was channeling a palpable sense of loss that allowed him to process what he was going through in the most outrageous ways possible. But the moment Cregger says this, he once again stops himself. “Look, like the rest of the world, I don't want to watch another horror movie about grief. That whole horror-as-a-metaphor-for-grief is so fucking played out. I shouldn't even be talking about this, but I can't help myself. I don't care if anybody gets any of that when they watch it. I want them to have fun. If the story rips, none of that matters.


	“But I wanted to do something honest,” he continues, “and I found that as I kept writing, and the more I identified with all of the people I was writing about, the more this became something like an honest diary of my inner shit. It's funny, I was talking to Ari Aster about this, and was like, ‘I don't know about the personal stuff.' And he was like, ‘The personal stuff is what makes this work. Don't be ashamed of it!' Hearing him say that… it's part of the DNA of Weapons. The town is dealing with a loss. And so was I. It was the biggest direct hit I'd ever taken.”

	After Cregger had about 70 pages and had sketched out Weapons' main characters — the teacher who had all 17 of the missing kids in her class; her one student who didn't run away; a father searching for his M.I.A. son; a drug-addicted drifter who finds himself in the wrong place and the wrong time — he decamped to his manager's house, located deep in the woods on the East Coast. Cregger knew the ending, and he had diagrammed out various plot points in charts. Then, he said, it was time to figure how to tell the story he wanted to tell.


	“There was still this urgency to it,” Cregger says, admitting that the need for an emotional purge took some of the pressure off of following up a hit. “The only silver lining of this whole terrible year was that I was, once again, writing from a pure place. I was like, ‘Right, so the best version of this movie is if I can do it in these chapters where I stay loyal to the forced perspective,' you know — to stay hyper-subjective.”


	To do that, Cregger began to separate the narrative into chapters that filled in the blanks slowly, one character's P.O.V. at a time. (He credits Paul Thomas Anderson's 1999 movie Magnolia as the role model for how he wanted Weapons to play.) And he began to shake the fear of making it personal. He mentions that he strongly identifies with Garner's character, the teacher whose classroom is the only connection among all of the missing kids, and is an alcoholic; Cregger himself has dealt with the disease and has 10 years of sobriety under his belt. He understands the anguish felt by Brolin's character, a father who's attempting to wrap his head around his child being there one moment and inexplicably gone the next.


	And in writing the section told from the perspective of Alex, the one third-grader who doesn't go missing, Cregger says he tapped directly into his own past. “That is straight-up, like — I lived that chapter as a kid,” he admits. “Again, I don't know if people need to know this going in, but… it's very much what it's like to have a parent who's an addict, and the child has to become the caretaker as this sort of foreign thing comes in, and…” The look of horror is back. “I'll leave it at that.”


	“He and I talked about that, yeah,” Brolin says, speaking a few weeks later in a separate interview. “We're both sober, he talked about his alcoholic dad, I talked about my alcoholic mom. He found those spots in me that inspired me to want to tell the story even more. That was one of the things that struck me about Zach: He was really open about everything right away. From the very first meeting we had, he was willing to really talk about a lot of stuff that's deep in the film.

	











	“What got me before that, though, was just the script,” Brolin adds. “Look, I didn't know who Zach was, or anything about the bidding war” — more on that in a second — “or that he'd made this other movie that people loved. I hadn't seen Barbarian at that point. I didn't even know this guy existed. And then to get this script that was so well-designed, so intricately crafted, so beautifully and smartly put together, then have this super-emotional meeting with the guy who was going to make this… I remember seeing The Matrix the week it came out, walking out of the theater, shaking my head like, ‘What the fuck?' — and then turning around a buying a ticket and going to see it again immediately. Those kinds of movies don't come around a lot. And I remember meeting him and thinking, ‘If this works, this could be one of those movies.'”


	Much like Cregger did with the script for Barbarian, he started assembling each section in a way that played fast and loose with chronology. Without giving anything away plot-wise, let's just say that what starts out as an elliptical mystery gets extremely crazy by the end. Once Cregger finished his final draft, he was ready to shop the script — and that's when the real craziness began.


	Word had begun to spread that the guy who'd made Barbarian had a new screenplay that was equally wild, and twice as ambitious. The buzz around it was becoming more and more intense. Several people made extravagant offers, sight unseen. Once potential buyers were finally able to read what Cregger had come up with, an old-fashioned Hollywood bidding war erupted. When he'd been shopping Barbarian, Cregger recalls, the film was roundly rejected by every studio he pitched. This time, he had producers fighting over the chance to be in the Zach Cregger business, to the tune of a $38 million price tag.


	“After the dust settled… it was an incredibly difficult, stressful day, for a lot of reasons I don't want to talk about,” he says, referring to the 24-hour period between the Weapons script going out and a deal being struck. “But it ultimately was a wonderful thing, and it took me a couple of days to kind of even realize that it was real. It was wonderful and overwhelming.” Asked about the rumors that Jordan Peele ended up firing his management when Universal failed to procure the script on behalf of his production company Monkeypaw, Cregger declines to comment: “Yeah, it's not my story to tell.” (Peele's reps also declined to comment.)

	And though Weapons' production wasn't without a few hiccups — he lost most of his original cast when the 2023 strike happened; he had to recast the young actor he'd hired to play the remaining student after the original kid experienced a huge growth spurt — Cregger feels like he's ended up with exactly the movie he wanted to make. Early screenings were so positive that Warner Bros. moved the film's release up by six months. The reason Cregger was Zooming from Prague is that he's busy prepping the next Resident Evil film there, with the idea of bringing the franchise back to its video-game roots. (“If I fired up my PS5 right now and showed you the hour count that I put on Resident Evil 4, it would be embarrassing,” he says.) And he's already got another script in the works, “a big, crazy thing I'm going to do after this that's, I think, the most complex script I've ever written.”


	“David Bowie has this quote — I'm going to butcher it,” Cregger says. “But it's basically the idea that creatively, you should always be wading out into deeper and deeper and deeper waters, and you should never really know if you're going to be able to swim or not. I definitely did that on Weapons. I may be doing that with the new one. But my job is to be honest. And to just to keep swimming.” Cregger exhales, then grins. There's nothing but happiness in his expression now.

The writer and director shares that the story features a TikToker who, "as a joke, says that we should just stop giving birth," in an environment that threatens World War III.

	Slovenian director Kukla, whose debut feature Fantasy world premiered at the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival in the Filmmakers of the Present lineup Friday, is working on a new project that promises to bring her unique voice to a story about sex, war, TikTok, and the relationship between women and men.


	“My next film is about a potential threat of a third World War,” the writer and director tells THR. “Of course, 99 percent of the world leaders are male, and then a TikToker, as a joke, says that we should just stop giving birth to their children, and we should stop having sex. And then, women all around the world stop having sex with men, and the shit hits the fan.”

	A title or other details of the new project aren't known yet. But Kukla shares: “It's going to be quite different from Fantasy.”


	In Fantasy, a coming-of-age story full of laughs, drama and twists that centers on three girls who are outsiders and whose lives get turned upside down when they meet a trans woman called Fantasy. The filmmaker has described the movie as a way of “inviting women to see themselves through their own lens rather than through external expectations.”


	Totem Films is handling international sales on the movie, which is a co-production between Slovenia and North Macedonia.


	Kukla, who is also a musician, developed a reputation for directing music videos before making her 2020 short film Sisters, which won the Grand Prix International honor at the Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival and the Audience Award at Premiers Plans d'Angers. She then transformed the short into the feature film Fantasy.

	











	“The process was so difficult that I was like, ‘I'm never going to do another film anymore,'” Kukla shares with THR. And after giving birth, she thought she would need a break. But her creative energy is driving her to work on the new project. Says the filmmaker: “I had this idea for my next film five years ago, and I'm already writing it.”

“It's very special that the two of them are still the center of each other's universe,” Everett says of the relationship between her character, Sam, and Jeff Hiller's Joel.


							By 

	Hilton Dresden


Associate Awards Editor


	In crafting the arc of her HBO dramedy Somebody Somewhere (set in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas), New York cabaret legend Bridget Everett wanted to tell a story about finding “your person.” Not in a romantic way — in the series, her character, Sam, forms an impactful friendship with Jeff Hiller's Joel after she returns home to care for her dying sister. Joel welcomes Sam into his community of small-town queer folk, and the growth the pair go through during the course of three seasons shows how their friendship has given each of them permission to find a sustaining kernel of levity in their lives. In this scene between Joel and Sam in the finale episode, “AGG,” the duo are able to express how important their relationship has been to them, and will continue to be, for the rest of their lives.

	Everett had been approached by Somebody Somewhere‘s showrunners initially to make a series about another small town in Kansas: Emporia. But while scouting, Everett said to them, “We're so close to my hometown, let's just drive over there. You can meet my mom, whatever. And then once we were [there], we were all kind of like, ‘This is it,' ” she recalls. Setting a show so (literally) close to home presented a unique set of challenges. “I actually was kind of terrified,” Everett continues, “because my mom and brother still lived there at the time, and that's where I'm from. I didn't want to misrepresent it or do anything that made fun of Kansans. I wanted to give it the most realistic lens that I could, having not lived there for a while.”

	Certain lines in the final cut of this scene differ from what's on the page because “the scene felt most effective when it was just a one-shot, when we weren't cutting,” says Everett. That meant picking one long shot where “there are probably better takes of certain moments, and maybe a more direct read of the script, but this felt natural and lived in.”


	Hiller and Everett didn't know each other well before filming the pilot of Somebody Somewhere, even though the character of Joel seems tailor-made for him. Everett actually had two other friends of hers in mind as she began to write the part: “One of them is actually Mary Catherine [Garrison], who plays [Sam's sister] Tricia, and my friend Zach. They had characteristics that were similar to Joel: helping me open up, helping me be less sad, and just having fun. Mary Catherine, she has a very special way of talking to you, making you feel like you're the only person in the room. And I think Joel does that, too.”


Somebody Somewhere is a show about people's feelings, about quiet grief and the intricacies of relationships among individuals living in a small Kansas town. As Everett worked with her co-writers on crafting the story at the center of Somebody Somewhere, “what resonated with me most [were] emotional themes that I felt might be too personal, or maybe not universal enough,” she says. “But as with everything else, the more personal you make something, the more universal it can feel. I knew that [worked] in cabaret, but I'd never done a TV show before.”

	











	This scene “crystallizes Somebody Somewhere to a T,” Everett says, emphasizing its slice-of-life tone and conversation filled with laughter as well as tears. “It shows me where they've arrived by the end of the series: Even though [Joel] has a new partner, I think it's very special that the two of them are still the center of each other's universe.” When Joel calls Sam his person, “It feels like over the course of three seasons, he's helped bring her back to life and given her a purpose. She used to be her sister's person, and now she finds that she can move on and have value to somebody else. And most importantly, it kick-starts a new sense of self for her. It gives her a real boost, and it's something she didn't know that she needed to hear.”


	Detailed improvised lines from Hiller — like here, where in the final cut Joel describes Sam sitting in the garage — added another layer of richness to the script Everett did with her co-writers, series creators Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen. “[Hiller] comes from the improv world, and I come from the cabaret world, and in my cabaret shows, I have a sort of running script — I've never written it down — but I know basically what I want to say,” explains Everett. “I think with this show, you know what has to be said, but if you add a little bit of candy here and there, there's nothing wrong with that. I really believe that whenever we are able to put it in our mouth the way that feels right, you're going to have a more effective performance.”

	











	This take stood out in the edit because of how Hiller improvised this specific line, adding in a phrase about how his life is so much better with Sam in it before discovering for himself that she's his person, in real time. “The other [takes], it was like something he held in his heart and had maybe said to her before,” Everett muses. “This time, the way he did it, it felt like he was seeing it for himself the first time, which I thought was really sweet, and the most effective, which was also in turn probably the most effective take for Sam, because she's responding to that.”


	While the writers didn't know at the time that this would be the series finale, ending Somebody Somewhere on a moment of communal joy (and, of course, a cabaret rendition of Miley Cyrus' “The Climb”) felt like a perfect closing moment for Sam, Joel and their friends. As evidenced in this scene, too, Everett wanted the season to end on the fact that “Sam was having a good day, and she wanted her friends to come, and she wanted to invite them to see her sing. She was taking the initiative.” While this line isn't in the final take used in the episode, its meaning, about Sam finding happiness and love for herself, is implicit in the performances.

Jackie Chan told a Q&A audience in Locarno that he believes the big Hollywood studios are stifling contemporary filmmaking with what he described as their obsession with money.


	“I think the old movies are better than today,” Chan said.


	“Right now, a lot of big studios, they're not filmmakers, they're business guys. They invest 40 million and think, ‘How can I get it back?' And you can't go over. It's very difficult to make a good movie now.”


	Chan was speaking with Locarno head Giona Nazzaro this morning at a packed-out Q&A session, where he ran through his career credits, telling multiple lucid and highly entertaining stories about his start in the business, working in Hollywood, and how he completed many of his most dangerous stunts.

	The major throughline during the discussion was Chan's dedication to cinema craft, particularly how he worked to learn every role on a film's set, from stunt direction to acting and sound. Chan later joked that in Asian cinema, there were only two performers who had the same expansive skillset.

	“In all of Asia, only two directors can do everything: the writing, directing, acting, stunt coordinating, stunt fighting, and editing. Only two,” he began. “One is Sammo Hung, the second one is Jackie Chan.” 


	The veteran Hong Kong actor later added: “And I'm better because I know how to sing.”


	Chan continued to tell the audience in Locarno that he made a concerted effort to learn how to sing because he didn't see a future as only a stunt performer. Chan pointed specifically to his early appearances on late-night U.S. talk shows, where he was often asked to perform stunts or fight.

	











	“I cannot do this forever. It's just so dangerous,” Chan recalled thinking. “Whatever station I would go to, they ask me how to punch and kick. I thought, What should I do? I should learn how to sing. Then I started trying to learn how to sing.”


	Chan added that he quickly switched his professional goals to prioritize longevity and his working mantra was: “I wanna be the Asian Robert De Niro.”


	However, Chan told the audience that in the early 2000s, he gave up on making Hollywood films because he was unable to connect with American audiences, and he disliked the quality of scripts he was being given. 


	Chan added that he decided to try one more project before leaving the U.S. behind entirely, and it was his now-seminal buddy cop flick, Rush Hour. 


	“Rush Hour. It was the last try. If it doesn't succeed, then I finish,” Chan said, adding that the film's production wasn't perfect, with constraints on budget and smaller space for action sequences. But it was a start, he said. 


	“I think Rush Hour changed the culture,” Chan said. 


	The veteran Hong Kong actor added that his career goal in Hollywood has always been to “be a cross-cultural bridge between the US and China.”


	Chan was in Locarno this year to receive the festival's Pardo alla Carriera award for career achievement. His early directorial films, Project A and Police Story, screened at the festival.  


	Locarno ends on August 16.

Jackie Chan was good in the 80s and 90s era, but his acting was pretty corny bad, passable back then it probably wont fly today.

It's true, we have entered the era of the business idiot. The Studio, about an executive who Loves movies, is a total fiction. These people may as well have come from working at a cereal company

SUPERCOP !

Lost all respect for him as a schill for China. Basically the CCP version of MAGA. Go away, Jackie.

We're still a long way out from the arrival of the second season of Netflix's surprisingly charming live-action adaptation of long-running anime One Piece—to the point that the streamer itself won't get any more specific than “Coming in 2026.” But that hasn't stopped the company from tripling down on its enthusiasm for the show, announcing today that it's renewed the series for a third season way, way before it might have been expected to.

﻿

The news apparently coincides with what we're being assured is “One Piece Day”—very loosely timed to the anniversary of the series beginning its still-ongoing serialization in Shonen Jump back in 1997—with celebrations running in Japan. That includes Netflix popping by to show off a first look trailer for the show's second season, which includes a number of fan-favorite characters, including very big man Brogy (Brendan Murray), antagonistic Marine Smoker (Callum Kerr), and characters who are here identified as Miss Wednesday (Charithra Chandran) and Miss All Sunday (Lera Abova). (Can names be spoilers for plot points laid out in manga issues nearly three decades old at this point? We don't want to be the ones who get yelled at for finding out.)

The trailer also, of course, shows plenty of the cast of the first season, as Monkey D. Luffy (Iñaki Godoy) continues his pursuit of the titular treasure, and the title of “King Of The Pirates,” by heading out “Into The Grand Line.” The series also co-stars Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Romero Gibson, and Taz Skylar as the core members of Luffy's crew, and has attracted an increasing number of big-name guest stars, including upcoming appearances from David Dastmalchian and Joe Manganiello in season 2.

Fresh claims about the infamous 2004 'Tic Tac' UFO encounter are reigniting fierce debate over the true nature of the mysterious craft observed by US Navy pilots off the coast of Southern California.

Journalist and UFO investigator Ross Coulthart has sparked controversy by asserting that the craft, captured on video and later released by the Pentagon, is actually advanced man-made technology developed by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin.

Coulthart suggested the craft may have been operated psionically, controlled through advanced mental or neurological means, and could be the product of reverse-engineering non-human technology recovered by the US government.

However, leading experts in the field of unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) rejected this explanation. 

UFO researcher Mark Christopher Lee argued that the Tic Tac's silent propulsion, instantaneous acceleration, and lack of visible lift mechanisms closely match sightings of similar craft documented centuries before modern aviation, making it unlikely to be current military tech.

'There have been documented sightings of the same type of craft even before the technological age,' Lee told the Daily Mail. 

'This continuity suggests an intelligent, non-human presence operating beyond our understanding.'

The 2004 incident remains one of the most well-known UFO encounters in recent history. 

During training exercises, Navy pilots aboard the USS Nimitz tracked multiple unidentified objects descending from 80,000 feet in under a second. 

Cmdr. David Fravor described a white, capsule-shaped craft, the now-iconic Tic Tac, which appeared to respond intelligently to their maneuvers before rapidly accelerating out of sight.

Coulthart, who has long investigated UAP secrecy, suggested the encounter was part of a covert military program rather than an alien visitation. 

'I now know categorically that the Tic Tac is Lockheed Martin technology,' he claimed, adding that multiple similar craft were spotted over several days, possibly indicating advanced tests of this classified technology.

Yet Lee suspected such claims are deliberate misdirection aimed at hiding the true extraterrestrial origins of these crafts. 

He noted historical records, including the 1561 Nuremberg 'cylindrical flying objects' and the 1890s US 'airship wave,' as evidence of long-standing unexplained aerial phenomena beyond human capabilities.

'There is a strong chance that what we are seeing is beyond human technology, and attempts to explain it as secret military hardware serve only to distract the public,' Lee said.

Some experts, like Dr Ajaz Ali from Ravensbourne University, caution that many UFO sightings stem from advanced but earthly technology. 

Cold War-era reconnaissance missions by the US and Soviet Union, such as U-2 spy plane flights, and modern drone developments have often been mistaken for extraterrestrial craft.

'The shapes and behaviors of modern drones and spy aircraft closely mimic those reported in UFO encounters,' Ali said, noting that declassified documents have linked covert aerial operations to the rise of UFO lore.

Despite decades of investigation, the true identity of the Tic Tac craft remains a mystery, fueling an ongoing clash between believers in secret military tech and advocates of alien visitation theories.

'It's possible we'll never fully understand this intelligence,' Lee concluded. 'It may be far beyond anything we currently comprehend.'

However, the mystery of the Tic Tac remains unsolved, leaving both believers in extraterrestrial intelligence and advocates of secret military technology debating what exactly is flying above our heads.

'It's conceivable that it was being operated neuro-meditatively, psionically, by a human psionic,' Coulthart said.

'It makes no scientific sense to me that the Tic Tac UFO is Lockheed Martin technology,' Lee told the Daily Mail.

'There have been many documented sightings throughout history of the same type of craft, even before the technological age. 

'These sightings are well-documented. There was definitely something technological in their skies, but it wasn't ours. 

'What it is or where it comes from, I do not know. That is the question we are all trying to answer.'

Lee agreed that there may be attempts to reverse-engineer alien technology and suspects that the reporting around the Tic Tac sighting is intended to divert attention from this.

He claimed efforts to portray such craft as secret military technology are designed to prevent the public from realizing that aliens regularly visit Earth.

'I suspect the US military is diverting us away from what they actually know about this technology, which is most likely extraterrestrial in origin,' he said.

'However, I'm also sure that reverse engineering programs are ongoing—this has been confirmed to me by a senior intelligence contact in the UK military, though with limited success.'

'There are a lot of so-called UFO experts making wild claims, all wanting to be the messiah who brings us the truth, but the reality is we do not know, and maybe never will fully understand what this intelligence is. It may be far beyond anything we can comprehend.'

A dedicated ghost hunter has published his latest book on the subject of 'things that go bump in the night'. Ghost Of The North East, by Rob Kirkup, takes a look at some of the intriguing examples of the paranormal witnessed around our region. 

Many of the ghostly tales featured in the book are associated with historic locations - such as battlefields, castles, pubs, and places of industry. Even for sceptics, the 28 stories shed fascinating light on often forgotten histories. The book is divided into four sections - Northumberland, Tyne & Wear, County Durham and Teesside - as Rob, a long-time paranormal investigator and author, takes us on an informative ghostly tour of the North East. 

Our 10 photographs, below, are selected from the 100 illustrations that accompany the text in the book.

One of the most bloody events in the history of our region was the Battle of Flodden which unfolded amid the rolling hills of Northumberland in 1513 during the reign of Henry VIII. In a cataclysmic clash between the English and Scottish armies, as many as 14,000 men were slain in brutal conflict in a matter of hours. 

The English earned a crushing victory, with the Scottish king, James IV, among those killed in the battle. More than 500 years later, the book notes, there are still reports of the ghostly sounds of battle coming from the field, while the nearby A697 has been the location of sightings of phantom soldiers crossing the road.



Slightly further south, in Alnwick, stands a public house called the Dirty Bottles. It is named after a legend dating from the early 1800s. The innkeeper was positioning bottles in the window when he suddenly dropped dead for no apparent reason. 

His widow declared that should anybody touch the bottles, they would suffer the same fate as her unfortunate husband. More than 200 years later, the bottles remain untouched, sealed between two panes of glass and covered in dust and cobwebs.

The book also looks at the story of Winter's Gibbet. In 1791, William Winter murdered the elderly Margaret Crozier in Northumberland. He was captured and, a year later, hanged. His body was displayed on a gibbet near the crime scene as a grim warning. 

Today, a replica stands on Elsdon Moor, recalling the brutal crime. It is said Winter's ghost can sometimes be seen late at night near the gibbet. The 400-year-old Schooner Hotel in the picturesque Northumberland coastal village of Alnmouth has twice been named ‘the most haunted hotel in Great Britain'. It boasts 60 individual ghosts - including crying children, a phantom maid, and a marching soldier - and 3,000 sightings during the last decade.

Moving into Tyne and Wear, the book stops off at ‘haunted' locations such as Newcastle's Castle Keep, Souter Lighthouse in Whitburn, Marsden Grotto in South Shields, and the Angel of the North in Gateshead, while over in County Durham, the ghostly goings on at the North of England Lead Mining Museum at Killhope come under consideration.

As the author declares in his introduction to the book: “Allow me to guide you through my native North East ... and I will tell you of some of the chilling phantoms said to stalk this region.”

Ghost Of The North East by Rob Kirkup, published by Amberley, is priced at £15.99. The title is also available in Kindle, Kobo and iBook formats. You can buy the book direct from the publisher at: Ghosts of the North East - Amberley Publishing. Our 10 photographs are a selection of the 100 that appear in the book.

The angel Castiel might have rusty people skills, a stoic demeanor, and deadpan sarcasm, but Misha Collins, the human actor behind Supernatural‘s forever third wheel, is charming and full of stories. It's a natural fit, then, that Collins has created a one-man show, It Seemed Like A GOOD IDEA at the Time, which he tours around the country separate from the SPN conventions he does with costars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki.

Stops this year for A GOOD IDEA include Oklahoma City, Austin, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, and Nashville. The 90-minute, alcohol-friendly evening is described as having “topics more suited to a therapist's sofa than a public stage.” A warning: There might be more than a few d–k jokes.

“I love telling these very personal stories that bring the audience into some real difficult, emotional terrain, while also having them belly laugh — and they laugh a lot, if I do say so myself,” admits Collins, who shares tales of his financially fraught childhood, including how his mother taught him to steal peaches when he was 4 and how they hopped freight trains and lived as nomads in tents. “This added up to a childhood ripe for storytelling,” Collins notes.

His laugh-out-loud material ranges from the deeply intimate to the riotously inappropriate. “It's nice to see that the hard parts can be funny, and the funny parts can be hard,” he continues. “I also love exposing myself to a live audience — both literally and figuratively — and not just a camera crew.”

Collins, who introduced the world of angels to Supernatural viewers during the show's fourth season back in 2008, remained a fan favorite on the series until the end. Now, after his own challenging upbringing, he's a proud family man with a wife and two kids — and his life is much more settled. Still, Collins says A GOOD IDEA was “long percolating.”

And though this show is 100 percent Collins, he credits Padalecki with the title. “One day on set, after telling yet another story about how I had barely escaped with my life, smuggling myself into Tibet in the back of a vegetable truck, Jared had a flash of insight,” Collins recalls. “He said, ‘I've got it — the title of your memoir. The cover of the book has the words ‘A GOOD IDEA' in the center in large font. Preceding that text, in much smaller, hard-to-read font, ‘It Seemed Like a…' and at the end, ‘…at the Time.' So the cover would read, It Seemed Like A GOOD IDEA at the Time.

Well, hey, it really was!

ESSEX JUNCTION, Vt. (WCAX) - Are you curious about what your future holds? You can find out at this year's Psychic Expo.

Psychics and vendors come from around the state and region to share their creations and craft, many doing tarot card and psychic readings. 

The Champlain valley expo center has been the spot for this festival for three years now and organizers say it's a hit. “People will come and spend 4,5,6 hours, go to multiple readings, go to multiple workshops, do some shopping, talk to crafters there's not a lot of shows like this,” Jeff Folb, owner of Vermont Gatherings, said. 

“Neither of us are trained i guess you could say but we feel like we have a little bit of a knack for it he was going to pull some cards later,” visitors Lillia Nelson and Dylan Pilcher. 

The expo runs through 5 p.m. Sunday.

People who are quick to see themselves as victims of unfair treatment may be more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, according to a massive international study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology. The research links a stable personality trait called “victim justice sensitivity” to greater endorsement of conspiracy narratives about climate change, vaccines, and other topics.

The work was led by Daniel Toribio-Flórez of the University of Kent in collaboration with an international team of more than 70 researchers from institutions across Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania. Previous studies have often focused on collective victimhood — the belief that one's group has been historically harmed — as a driver of conspiratorial thinking. But the authors argued that conspiracy theories also tend to revolve around the idea of being wronged personally.

“Many conspiracy theories are rooted in the idea that one's group has been unfairly treated or targeted by a powerful group acting malevolently in secret,” said Toribio-Flórez, a postdoctoral research associate and member of the CONSPIRACY_FX project.

“Because of this, past research has mostly focused on how conspiracy beliefs are related to collective victimhood-that is, when people feel their social group, community, or country has been wronged or harmed by another group. However, within a specific social context, individuals differ in their tendency to perceive and react as victims of injustice, independently of their group identity.”

“We were curious whether people who show this individual tendency to see themselves as victims are also prone to believe in conspiracy theories. To investigate this, we collaborated with a multinational team of researchers and collected data from 15 countries. This allowed us to examine whether the patterns we observed held up across different cultural and societal contexts, an important step in assessing the generalizability of our findings.”

The first phase of the research was a secondary analysis of two surveys originally conducted in Germany. These surveys had explored how personality traits shape trust in science, but they also contained relevant measures for the present investigation. In total, the combined sample included 743 participants: 370 drawn from the general public and a student population, and 373 drawn entirely from a student population. The age range was broad, spanning from teenagers to older adults, and women made up the majority of both samples.

Participants completed a 10-item scale designed to measure victim justice sensitivity — the degree to which a person tends to notice, feel angered by, and react to situations in which they believe they are personally treated unfairly. They also completed a validated five-item measure of conspiracy mentality, which captures a general tendency to suspect that important events are shaped by hidden plots. In the second German sample, the researchers also had access to other relevant traits such as dispositional mistrust, intolerance of ambiguity, and need for control, along with political orientation.

The analysis revealed a small to moderate positive correlation between victim justice sensitivity and conspiracy mentality in both samples. In the first sample, the association was statistically significant, albeit weaker, while in the second it was stronger and remained significant even after controlling for other traits and political orientation.

This indicated that the relationship between feeling like a victim and endorsing conspiratorial thinking was not simply explained by a general distrustful outlook or a desire for certainty and control. However, because both samples were from Germany, the authors noted that the findings could not yet be assumed to apply universally.

To address this, the researchers conducted a second study which expanded the scope considerably. As part of the Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism (TISP) ManyLabs project, the researchers collected responses from nearly 15,000 people in 15 different countries, including Australia, Austria, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, the United States, and Costa Rica. The samples were designed to reflect national distributions of age, gender, and education level.

This large-scale online survey measured victim justice sensitivity using a short two-item scale from the Justice Sensitivity Inventory (“It makes me angry when others are undeservingly better off than me” and “It worries me when I have to work hard for things that come easily to others”).

Participants also completed three separate measures of conspiracy belief: a general statement about authorities often hiding the truth, a climate change conspiracy statement claiming that global warming is a hoax orchestrated by scientists, and a vaccine conspiracy statement alleging that scientists conceal vaccine dangers. These were rated on scales indicating the degree of agreement.

The researchers analyzed the data using multilevel models, which allowed them to separate individual-level effects from possible country-level influences. Across the pooled data, victim justice sensitivity was consistently linked to greater endorsement of conspiracy beliefs within countries. The effect was strongest for general conspiracy belief, slightly weaker for vaccine conspiracies, and weakest for climate change conspiracies. Even after adjusting for demographic factors, political orientation, and religiosity, the link remained statistically significant for general and vaccine-related conspiracies.

“According to our data, people's individual tendency to perceive and react as victims of injustice is positively, though weakly, related to belief in conspiracy theories, even when controlling for indicators of collective victimhood or exposure to collective violence,” Toribio-Flórez told PsyPost. “In other words, people who tend to see themselves as victims are a bit more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs, regardless of how victimized others feel in their country or of the level of collective violence their country has recently suffered.”

The strength of the relationship varied across nations. In countries such as the United States, New Zealand, and Australia, the association between victim justice sensitivity and conspiracy beliefs was notably stronger. In others, including Costa Rica, Chile, and Colombia, it was minimal or non-existent for some conspiracy measures.

The researchers explored whether country-level factors — such as wealth, income inequality, personal freedoms, corruption perceptions, institutional trust, or cultural orientation toward individualism versus collectivism — explained these differences. They also considered historical exposure to violence, such as armed conflicts or political repression. None of these indicators consistently moderated the association. The one tentative exception was that the relationship appeared stronger in more individualistic societies, but this pattern did not replicate across all cultural indices tested.

“While we observed this pattern in most countries, the strength of the relationship between individual victimhood and conspiracy beliefs varied,” Toribio-Flórez said. “We explored whether economic, sociopolitical, cultural, or historical factors might explain these differences, but we didn't find clear answers. So we still don't fully understand why the connection is stronger in some contexts than in others.”

The study, like all research, includes some caveats. The studies were correlational, meaning they cannot determine whether victim justice sensitivity leads to conspiracy belief or vice versa — or whether the relationship is bidirectional.

“We cannot say for certain whether an individual's tendency to feel like a victim makes people more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, or if it's the other way around,” Toribio-Flórez explained. “While some studies suggest that conspiracy beliefs might increase individual perceptions of victimhood, more experimental work is needed to understand the direction and nature of this relationship.”

“I hope it encourages other researchers to examine victimhood at both the personal and group levels when studying conspiracy beliefs. While group identity has often been the focus, our findings suggest that an individual sense of victimhood also plays a meaningful role.”

“I would like to highlight the growing international collaboration in the social sciences and other research fields,” Toribio-Flórez added. “More and more, researchers are teaming up across countries to get a broader, more accurate picture of human behavior across different contexts. In this case, the Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism (TISP) ManyLabs project, led by Dr. Viktoria Cologna and Dr. Niels G. Mede, provided the platform that made this research project possible.”

A new study suggests that believing in one conspiracy theory may slightly increase the likelihood of believing in others. The research offers rare causal evidence in support of the long-debated “rabbit hole” model of how conspiracy beliefs spread.

Belief in anti-immigrant conspiracies may be fueled by financial hardship and a sense of societal breakdown, according to new research. Across six studies, economic stress predicted support for discriminatory policies and even violent actions against non-European immigrants.

People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to overestimate their own abilities and wrongly assume that others share their views, according to a new study. The findings highlight overconfidence as a key factor behind conspiracy belief.

A new study used artificial intelligence to analyze over 75,000 Reddit posts and uncover the deep emotional toll QAnon beliefs take on families. The findings reveal widespread grief, fear, and strained relationships as loved ones struggle with ideological division.

Psychologists have found that conspiracy theory beliefs may stem from spite triggered by feelings of social, existential, or cognitive disadvantage. The findings suggest that tackling misinformation requires addressing deeper social inequalities and psychological frustrations.

People prone to conspiracy theories may share cognitive tendencies with those who experience delusional thinking. Two new studies suggest that biases like anomalous perception and impulsive reasoning help explain why some are more likely to embrace conspiratorial beliefs.

Contrary to popular belief, conspiracy theories may not drive democratic decline—rather, those who reject democracy seem more prone to conspiratorial thinking.

Measles is surging again, and experts say fear, mistrust, and misinformation—not just ignorance—are fueling vaccine hesitancy.

A new electric motorsport championship is making an ambitious pitch to bring electric engines to the ocean — and Will Smith, LeBron James and Tom Brady are along for the ride.

Skimming across the water on thin hydrofoils, they look more like low-flying UFOs than boats.

But the E1 Series' "RaceBirds" — single-seater electric powerboats with 6,000-volt engines that can reach speeds of up to 50 knots (58 miles per hour, or 93 kilometers per hour) — are far from extraterrestrial. Instead, they're part of a fast-growing sport that hopes to bring electric vehicles to the water.

That's the pitch behind the UIM E1 World Championship. Dubbed the "Formula One of the Sea," it already has the backing of celebrity team owners such as Will Smith, LeBron James, Tom Brady, Rafael Nadal, Sergio Pérez and Virat Kohli.

The 2025 championship, the second run of the series, is taking place across seven locations: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Doha, Qatar; Dubrovnik, Croatia; Lago Maggiore, Italy; Monaco; Lagos, Nigeria; and Miami. It's a stage for its nine teams to race to become champions of the water. However, for the competition's founders, it's not just about the contest. They want to prove that electric motors can make the leap to the ocean.

"Water mobility is contributing to pollution in a bad way," Rodi Basso, a former NASA scientist and F1 engineer who is the co-founder and CEO of E1, told Live Science. "Sustainability is now becoming almost a tricky word. It started from communication and awareness, which was needed; we have an issue. But now, we cannot keep feeding this anxiety; we need a solution. The boat is a solution."

Basso's inspiration for E1 came during the early COVID-19 pandemic, when he and Alejandro Agag — now E1's chairman and co-founder and the pioneer of the electric motorsport Formula E and Extreme E championships — were taking a walk by London's River Thames.

After Basso offered the spark of an idea for an electric powerboat championship, Agag provided the investment and motorsport expertise needed to get development off the ground — or off the surface of the water. Taking inspiration from how birds glide across aquatic surfaces, the 24-foot-long (7.3 meters) boat was designed by Seabird founder Sophi Horne to lift its hull more than 3 feet (1 m) above the surface at speeds of 19.5 mph (31 km/h).

"It's a bit like pulling back on the sticks of an airplane, where, as you roll in, it'll dive, so you kind of pull back," Sam Coleman, a pilot on Team Brady who won the first E1 World Championship in 2024, told Live Science. "It's a lot more akin to flying than driving a boat."



The feat means that the boats produce far less waves when balanced atop their three wing-like foils, thus reducing coastal erosion. It also lowers friction with the water to ramp up the boats' speeds. These design elements combine with 20 seconds of boost to supercharge the battery output from 95 to 140 kilowatts, enabling the boats to reach 50 knots.

But the enhanced speed comes with some major downsides. Bringing the RaceBirds up onto their foils may make them faster, but it also renders them incapable of making sharp turns. It also introduces the risk of cavitation — the formation of air bubbles — in the water below.

"Around 50 knots, they get unstable," Basso said. "The water around the foil starts bubbling, so you have less pressure and less force pushing the boat up, and then the boat can collapse. And it does so with very little warning."

"So now, the pilots are building incredible sensitivity and understanding, finding where that moment is, and riding on the edge of that moment," he added.

This means pilots must carefully manage when to use their boosts and when to lift their boats onto their foils during races, in which they compete in a series of time trials to qualify for a final five-boat battle to the finish line.

To beat the competition, they must find the right racing line around corners. That might mean riding a wide arc perched atop their foils or smashing into the water close to buoys, before zipping away on their boost, all while navigating the choppy waters generated by other boats.

It requires enormous concentration and split-second decision-making, both of which are strained further by cockpit temperatures that can climb to 167 degrees Fahrenheit (75 degrees Celsius).

"It's draining; it's like sitting in a sauna and trying to drive a racing simulator that's bouncing up and down," Coleman said. "The window is so small, you can be absolutely nailing it and then all of a sudden, you're one point of a degree out on your trim setting and that's enough to induce a porpoise, or an oscillation, that takes ages to recover from."

To help pilots perform their best, teams of engineers back on shore analyze data taken from every part of the boat before advising them over radio. Team owners also follow along closely with the results of races.

"Tom Brady is the team owner for our team, and for me to say that is very surreal. But the biggest thing is that he is into it," Coleman said. "He follows it. It's like when Rafa and Will Smith were in Lake Como: They had a great time, they enjoyed it, they understand it, and you can see that they're super competitive, and they have such a great opportunity to bring eyeballs to a new sport and then help elevate it. I think it's a really exciting journey that we're on."

Keeping races fresh and competitive means that changes are consistently being made to the RaceBirds' engines and propellers. The design tweaks aren't just to improve performance and handling but also to minimize the zero-emission, virtually silent craft's impact on its surrounding environment.

The result is an electric vessel that's around 50 times quieter than traditional combustion engine boats, according to Carlos Duarte, E1's chief scientist. Duarte, a marine biologist who won the 2025 Japan Prize for his contributions to research on marine and coastal ecology, is working through E1 on voluntary schemes with industry to make ships run quieter.



"As we saw during the COVID lockdown, with only a 20% reduction in [ships'] noise, there were reports from all over the world of large marine animals being reported in areas that they had not been seen for decades," Duarte told Live Science. "So it is a low-hanging fruit, very easy to solve. And in fact, addressing noise creates benefits for the boat operators, because electric boats are not only silent, but they're more cost-effective than combustion engine boats."

Duarte is also overseeing efforts to improve the waterways and ecosystems in the E1 race cities. These measures include aquatic restoration and conservation efforts, as well as steps to offset the environmental impact of the races themselves.

He views building stakeholder partnerships through E1 as a vital avenue for environmental restoration — specifically, away from drawn-out political conferences where, he said, "despite my scientific credentials in the marine space," he, and scientists in general, lack influence.

"The reality is that I don't have a voice, but I want to help those with a voice to communicate the messages that I think need to be communicated to society," Duarte said. "So that's also a platform that the team leader approach of E1, celebrities with voices, can help me."

E1's 2025 season is running from Jan 25. to Nov 8., with upcoming races in Lagos on Oct. 5 and Miami on Nov 8.

For over a decade, Supernatural captivated audiences with its gripping mix of folklore, horror, and unforgettable sibling banter. As one of the most popular shows of the late 2000s and 2010s, it built a fiercely loyal fanbase that stuck with it through 15 seasons of demon hunts, apocalyptic showdowns, and emotional goodbyes. When it wrapped up in 2020, it left a major void in the TV landscape, and in fans' hearts.

Plenty of shows have since tried to fill the gap. From dark procedurals to mystical monster hunts, a number of series have worn the supernatural genre like a well-fitted coat. However, Supernatural wasn't just about ghosts and ghouls - it was the mix of emotionally layered storytelling, quick-witted dialogue, and long-term myth-building that made it a once-in-a-generation kind of show.

Thankfully, there's one underrated gem that might be the next best thing. It ran during Supernatural's heyday, carries a stellar 89% Rotten Tomatoes score, and delivers the same combination of thrills, lore, and emotional investment. That show is NBC's Grimm, and it should be considered a must-watch for all Supernatural fans.

If Supernatural left you wanting more dark mythology, weekly monsters, and emotionally grounded heroes, Grimm should be next on your list. Premiering in 2011 and running for six seasons, Grimm blends procedural crime drama with supernatural fantasy in a way that hits many of the same satisfying beats as Supernatural.

The series follows Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli), a homicide detective who discovers he's descended from a line of hunters called “Grimms” - humans with the power to see creatures known as Wesen hiding in plain sight. These Wesen range from terrifying to tragic, and many are inspired by old European folklore. 

As Nick juggles his double life, he becomes part protector, part hunter, and eventually a key figure in a brewing war between ancient factions. And just like Supernatural's emotional backbone - Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) - Grimm builds its foundation on strong relationships. 

 Nick's evolving dynamics with his partner Hank (Russell Hornsby), ally Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), and love interest Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) provide a grounding emotional core that elevates the show beyond simple creature-hunting.

What makes Grimm feel like such a natural follow-up to Supernatural is how confidently it blends darkness and heart. The series isn't afraid to explore the horrors lurking under the surface of modern society, but it also never loses sight of its characters. It's smart, suspenseful, and often surprisingly emotional - the very traits that made Supernatural so beloved.

At its heart, Grimm is cut from the same cloth as Supernatural. Both shows built fanbases by taking myth and legend seriously while still having fun with their respective universes. If you're the kind of viewer who loved Supernatural's balance of high-stakes mythology and weekly monster confrontations, Grimm offers a similar rhythm.

The “monster of the week” format thrives in both series. In Supernatural, the Winchester brothers take down everything from shapeshifters to gods. In Grimm, Nick faces off against countless Wesen - each with their own origins, cultures, and secrets. Like the most memorable Supernatural episodes, Grimm often uses its creature plots as metaphors for real human issues.

Both shows also shine thanks to their long-form storytelling. Supernatural's layered arcs about heaven, hell, and family are echoed in Grimm's slow-burning conflict between Wesen factions, the mysterious Royal Houses, and Nick's evolving place in this hidden world. The lore builds gradually, rewarding viewers who stick with it across seasons.

Another major strength they share? Character development. Much like how Supernatural made viewers invest in the emotional growth of Sam, Dean, and Castiel (Misha Collins), Grimm slowly deepens its characters across multiple seasons. Relationships shift, alliances form and break, and the personal stakes only grow heavier. Monroe, in particular, stands out as Grimm's version of a fan-favorite sidekick - equal parts comic relief and emotional anchor, much like Castiel or Crowley (Mark Sheppard).

Even the tone feels familiar. Both shows blend horror, fantasy, and procedural structure with moments of levity and human warmth. The writing never takes itself too seriously, even when the mythology gets deep. If Supernatural's charm came from its ability to balance scares with heart, Grimm learned from the same playbook.

While Grimm and Supernatural share plenty of similarities, fans should know that Grimm also carves its own identity. The most noticeable difference is in tone and presentation. Where Supernatural leaned into genre-bending episodes and apocalyptic stakes, Grimm keeps its world more grounded, focusing on its unique folklore and police-procedural roots.

Grimm's setting in Portland, Oregon adds a moody, misty backdrop that enhances its gritty, urban-fantasy feel. The show often feels more like a detective thriller with supernatural elements than a full-on fantasy epic. This allows Grimm to explore themes like identity, duality, and hidden histories through a slightly more restrained lens than Supernatural's high-concept battles between heaven and hell.

The visual style is another key distinction. Grimm uses practical effects and subtle CGI to bring its Wesen to life, giving the show a more textured, eerie atmosphere. While Supernatural occasionally dipped into stylized or surreal aesthetics, Grimm maintains a consistent visual palette that reflects its darker, more mature vibe.

Narratively, Grimm avoids the near-constant world-ending threats that defined much of Supernatural's later seasons. Instead, it builds tension through political intrigue, hidden alliances, and the danger of secrecy unraveling Nick's life. The stakes feel more personal and less cosmic, which can be a refreshing change of pace.

This isn't to say one approach is better than the other - just different. For fans of Supernatural who loved the brotherly bond and epic scale, Grimm might feel more low-key but no less intense. It's a grounded supernatural thriller that slowly ramps up in complexity, with just as much payoff. If you're ready for a show that honors the spirit of Supernatural without copying it, Grimm is the one.

For Supernatural fans ready to dive into the world of Wesen and Grimms, Grimm is incredibly accessible. At the time of writing, all six seasons of the series are available to stream on Amazon Prime Video and Peacock. That's 123 episodes of high-quality dark fantasy just waiting to be binge-watched.

Whether you want to experience it from the beginning or pick it up after a few episodes, both platforms make it easy. Peacock offers free streaming with ads on select tiers, while Amazon Prime provides an ad-free experience for Prime members. The full series is also available for digital purchase if you want to own it outright.

And for longtime Supernatural fans who crave that blend of mythology and mystery, watching Grimm in full is a rewarding experience. It's the kind of show that builds with every season - just like the Winchesters' journey - offering twists, emotional stakes, and a world you won't want to leave.
