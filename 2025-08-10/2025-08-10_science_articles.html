                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But to astrophysicist and black hole expert Cosimo Bambi, the idea is not so far-fetched. If successful, this century-long mission could return data from nearby black holes that completely alter our understanding of general relativity and the rules of physics. "We don't have the technology now," says author Cosimo Bambi of Fudan University in China. Previous knowledge on how stars evolve suggests that there could be a black hole lurking just 20 to 25 light-years from Earth, but finding it won't be easy, says Bambi. Because black holes don't emit or reflect light, they are virtually invisible to telescopes. Instead, scientists detect and study them based on how they influence nearby stars or distort light. "There have been new techniques to discover black holes," says Bambi. "I think it's reasonable to expect we could find a nearby one within the next decade." Traditional spacecrafts, powered by chemical fuel, are too clunky and slow to make the journey. At that pace, the craft could reach a black hole 20 to 25 light-years away in about 70 years. Does a black hole truly have an event horizon, the boundary beyond which not even light can escape its gravitational pull? Do the rules of physics change near a black hole? Does Einstein's theory of general relativity hold under the universe's most extreme conditions? "It may sound really crazy, and in a sense closer to science fiction," says Bambi. "But people said we'd never detect gravitational waves because they're too weak. People thought we'd never observe the shadows of black holes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have discovered potentially the most massive black hole ever detected. It exists in one of the most massive galaxies ever observed - the Cosmic Horseshoe - which is so big it distorts spacetime and warps the passing light of a background galaxy into a giant horseshoe-shaped Einstein ring. It is thought that every galaxy in the universe has a supermassive black hole at its center and that bigger galaxies host bigger ones, known as ultramassive black holes. "Most of the other black hole mass measurements are indirect and have quite large uncertainties, so we really don't know for sure which is biggest. However, we've got much more certainty about the mass of this black hole thanks to our new method." "By combining these two measurements we can be completely confident that the black hole is real." Lead researcher, PhD candidate Carlos Melo, of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in Brazil, added: "This discovery was made for a 'dormant' black hole - one that isn't actively accreting material at the time of observation. "What is particularly exciting is that this method allows us to detect and measure the mass of these hidden ultramassive black holes across the universe, even when they are completely silent." "But those accretion-based estimates often come with significant uncertainties. "Our approach, combining strong lensing with stellar dynamics, offers a more direct and robust measurement, even for these distant systems." "We think the size of both is intimately linked," Professor Collett added, "because when galaxies grow they can funnel matter down onto the central black hole. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, hosts a 4 million solar mass black hole. The Andromeda Galaxy and our Milky Way are moving together and are expected to merge in about 4.5 billion years, which is the most likely time for our supermassive black hole to become a quasar once again, the researchers say. "It is likely that all of the supermassive black holes that were originally in the companion galaxies have also now merged to form the ultramassive black hole that we have detected," said Professor Collett. Now that they've realized their new method works for black holes, they hope to use data from the European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope to detect more supermassive black holes and their hosts to help understand how black holes stop galaxies forming stars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GLP-1 drugs target brain neurons that control appetite but frequently cause side effects. Nausea and vomiting force 70% of patients to stop treatment within a year. Syracuse University chemistry professor Robert Doyle is leading a multidisciplinary team that has identified a different brain target for treating obesity and diabetes, potentially offering weight loss without gastrointestinal distress. But researchers are looking beyond neurons to study "support" cells such as glia and astrocytes that could aid appetite reduction. A collaborative research effort has revealed that support cells play a role in reducing feelings of hunger, although this process has not been studied in-depth. "We wanted to know whether support cells might produce new peptides or new signaling molecules that might be critical in body weight reduction," says Doyle, a medicinal chemist and the Jack and Laura H. Milton Professor of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at Syracuse University. Doyle is also a professor of pharmacology and medicine at SUNY Upstate Medical University. In lab tests, injecting ODN directly into rats' brains made them lose weight and improved how they processed glucose. However, injecting directly into the brain isn't a practical treatment for people, so researchers created a new version of the molecule named tridecaneuropeptide (TDN). One goal of the research team is to produce weight loss without aiming new therapeutic molecules at neurons. TDN cuts short the "marathon" of chemical reactions and negative side-effects caused by GLP-1 drugs. Or we could reduce their dose, improving the toleration of these drugs. We could trigger weight loss signals that happen later in the pathway more directly."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ultraprocessed foods or UPFs are a growing concern due to their widespread consumption and impact on potential health risks. Most UPFs, particularly those commonly seen in U.S. dietary patterns, are high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium (salt), the combination of which is often abbreviated as HFSS, and contribute to excess calories. These include sugar-sweetened drinks, ultraprocessed meats, refined grains, candy and commercial baked goods, among others. A limited number of ultraprocessed foods, such as certain commercial whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and some plant-based items, have positive nutritional value and, therefore, can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern. This overlap is confusing for health care professionals and the public. "The relationship between UPFs and health is complex and multifaceted," said Maya K. Vadiveloo, Ph.D., R.D., FAHA, volunteer chair of the writing group for this Science Advisory. "We know that eating foods with too much saturated fat, added sugars and salt is unhealthy. What we don't know is if certain ingredients or processing techniques make a food unhealthy above and beyond their poor nutritional composition. It is estimated that 70% of grocery store products in the U.S. contain at least one ultraprocessed ingredient. Among youth ages 1-18 years of age, total UPF calories jumped to nearly 62%, and among adults ages 19 and older total UPF calories was 53%. This new Science Advisory reinforces current dietary guidelines from the American Heart Association to: UPFs are multi-ingredient foods containing additives (likely intended to enhance shelf life, appearance, flavor or texture) widely used in industrial food production and not commonly used in home cooking. Efforts to understand UPFs are hindered by differing definitions, limitations in dietary assessment tools and food composition databases, which often lack detailed information on additives and processing methods. Currently, U.S. manufacturers are not required to disclose processing techniques or cosmetic additive quantities, which contributes to the variability in risk estimates and confusion for consumers. The writing group cautions that an overreliance on the degree of processing as a proxy for healthfulness of foods could sway the food industry to reduce or remove the markers of ultraprocessing from foods that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium and promote them as "better-for-you alternatives." High versus low UPF intake was linked to a 25%-58% higher risk of cardiometabolic outcomes and a 21%-66% higher risk of mortality. More research is needed to understand the appropriate thresholds for daily consumption of UPFs -- what a safe amount is and the incremental risks of eating more UPFs. For example, ingredients like artificial flavors may mimic sweetness without sugar, and this disruption in flavor-nutrient relationships often leads to irregular eating habits, and results in weight gain. Balancing multiple priorities, including the practical need for a nutrient-dense, affordable food supply, current evidence supports the following key research and policy changes to improve public health and reduce risks related to UPFs: "More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of how UPFs impact health. While scientific statements inform the development of guidelines, they do not make treatment recommendations. Additional co-authors and members of the writing group include Vice  Chair Christopher D.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One such side effect is loss of "lean mass" -- body weight that isn't fat -- raising concerns that Ozempic could be reducing muscle mass and strength. New research in mice suggests that muscle mass changes less than expected, but muscles may still get weaker, pointing out an urgent need for clinical studies to pin down the full effects of the popular medications. "If we want to really help the individuals who may be losing muscle mass, then we need to know that they're actually losing muscle mass," says Katsu Funai, PhD, associate professor of nutrition and integrative physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and the senior author on the study. Researchers found that Ozempic-induced weight loss did decrease lean mass by about 10%. Most of this lost weight wasn't from skeletal muscles but instead from other tissues like the liver, which shrunk by nearly half. The researchers emphasize that more research is needed to determine whether similar changes to organ size occur in humans -- and whether those changes come with any risks. "Loss of mass in metabolically active organs, such as the liver, is expected as part of healthy weight loss," says Ran Hee Choi, PhD, research instructor in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and co-first author on the study. In both mice and humans, weight gain and loss can affect the size of organs like the liver without affecting their function. Some skeletal muscles did shrink as the mice lost weight -- on average, by about 6%, not enough to explain the overall loss in lean mass. Some of this loss in muscle mass is a return to baseline, the researchers say. It's unknown how weight loss drugs affect this balance in people, the researchers say. In people, obesity is associated with lower physical activity, but mice don't tend to become less active when they gain weight. And the mice in this study became overweight because they ate a high-fat diet, whereas people become overweight for a wide variety of reasons that include genetics, diet, sleeping patterns, and age. "There remains a significant need for validation in humans, especially concerning muscle strength," Karasawa says. "There are many additional weight loss drugs that are in clinical trials and coming out in the next three to five years," Funai says. "Our findings are really interesting, but this is a preclinical model," he adds. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This prevalent condition is also linked to other metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and cancers. Salk Institute scientists are looking for a new treatment strategy in microproteins, an understudied class of molecules found throughout the body that play roles in both health and disease. In a new study, the researchers screened thousands of fat cell genes using CRISPR gene editing to find dozens of genes that likely code for microproteins -- one of which they confirmed -- that regulate either fat cell proliferation or lipid accumulation. The findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 7, 2025, identify new microproteins that could potentially serve as drug targets to treat obesity and other metabolic disorders. "CRISPR screening is extremely effective at finding important factors in obesity and metabolism that could become therapeutic targets," says senior author Alan Saghatelian, a professor and holder of the Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at Salk. But while some excess storage is manageable, too much can cause fat deposits to accumulate around the body -- leading to whole-body inflammation and organ dysfunction. The problem is, how do we find them all, and how do we filter for factors that may make good therapeutic candidates? This has been a longstanding question for Salk scientists. In fact, Salk Professor Ronald Evans has been working on it for decades. Several drugs have been developed to target PPAR gamma to treat obesity, but they resulted in side effects like weight gain and bone loss. An ideal PPAR gamma-based obesity therapeutic has yet to hit the market. But, like PPAR gamma, GLP-1 drugs have their own shortcomings, such as muscle loss and nausea. For many years, long stretches of the genome have been considered "junk" and thus left unexplored. But recent technological advances have allowed scientists to look at these dark sections and find a hidden world of microproteins -- in turn, expanding protein libraries by 10 to 30 percent. CRISPR screens work by cutting out genes of interest in cells and observing whether the cell thrives or dies without them. From these results, scientists can determine the importance and function of specific genes. "We wanted to know if there was anything we had been missing in all these years of research into the body's metabolic processes," says first author Victor Pai, a postdoctoral researcher in Saghatelian's lab. This latest research follows up on a prior study from Saghatelian's lab. The previous study identified thousands of potential microproteins by analyzing microprotein-coding RNA strands derived from mouse fat tissues. These microprotein-coding RNA strands were filed away to await investigation into their functions. The new study first expanded this collection to include additional microproteins identified from a pre-fat cell model. Next, the researchers screened the cell model with CRISPR to determine how many of these potential microproteins were involved in fat cell differentiation or proliferation. "We're not the first to screen for microproteins with CRISPR," adds Pai, "but we're the first to look for microproteins involved in fat cell proliferation. This is a huge step for metabolism and obesity research." Using their mouse model and CRISPR screening approach, the team identified microproteins that may be involved in fat cell biology. They then narrowed the pool even further with another experiment to create a shortlist of 38 potential microproteins involved in lipid droplet formation -- which indicates increasing fat storage -- during fat cell differentiation. While this approach is a helpful workaround to finding microproteins that are otherwise so small they elude capture, it also means that the screened microproteins require further testing to confirm whether they are functional. Pai hypothesizes this new microprotein, called Adipocyte-smORF-1183, influences lipid droplet formation in fat cells (also known as adipocytes). It also verifies that CRISPR is an effective tool for finding microproteins involved in fat cell biology, obesity, and metabolism. It's a constant process of improvement as we establish better technology and better workflows to enhance discovery and, eventually, therapeutic outcomes down the line." They also hope their success inspires others to use CRISPR screenings to continue bringing microproteins out from the dark -- like Adipocyte-smORF-1183, which until now, was considered an unimportant bit of "junk" DNA.
