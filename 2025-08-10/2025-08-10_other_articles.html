                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, leading experts in the field of unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) rejected this explanation. UFO researcher Mark Christopher Lee argued that the Tic Tac's silent propulsion, instantaneous acceleration, and lack of visible lift mechanisms closely match sightings of similar craft documented centuries before modern aviation, making it unlikely to be current military tech. 'This continuity suggests an intelligent, non-human presence operating beyond our understanding.' During training exercises, Navy pilots aboard the USS Nimitz tracked multiple unidentified objects descending from 80,000 feet in under a second. David Fravor described a white, capsule-shaped craft, the now-iconic Tic Tac, which appeared to respond intelligently to their maneuvers before rapidly accelerating out of sight. Coulthart, who has long investigated UAP secrecy, suggested the encounter was part of a covert military program rather than an alien visitation. 'I now know categorically that the Tic Tac is Lockheed Martin technology,' he claimed, adding that multiple similar craft were spotted over several days, possibly indicating advanced tests of this classified technology. Yet Lee suspected such claims are deliberate misdirection aimed at hiding the true extraterrestrial origins of these crafts. He noted historical records, including the 1561 Nuremberg 'cylindrical flying objects' and the 1890s US 'airship wave,' as evidence of long-standing unexplained aerial phenomena beyond human capabilities. 'There is a strong chance that what we are seeing is beyond human technology, and attempts to explain it as secret military hardware serve only to distract the public,' Lee said. Cold War-era reconnaissance missions by the US and Soviet Union, such as U-2 spy plane flights, and modern drone developments have often been mistaken for extraterrestrial craft. 'The shapes and behaviors of modern drones and spy aircraft closely mimic those reported in UFO encounters,' Ali said, noting that declassified documents have linked covert aerial operations to the rise of UFO lore. 'It's possible we'll never fully understand this intelligence,' Lee concluded. However, the mystery of the Tic Tac remains unsolved, leaving both believers in extraterrestrial intelligence and advocates of secret military technology debating what exactly is flying above our heads. 'It's conceivable that it was being operated neuro-meditatively, psionically, by a human psionic,' Coulthart said. That is the question we are all trying to answer.' Lee agreed that there may be attempts to reverse-engineer alien technology and suspects that the reporting around the Tic Tac sighting is intended to divert attention from this. He claimed efforts to portray such craft as secret military technology are designed to prevent the public from realizing that aliens regularly visit Earth. 'I suspect the US military is diverting us away from what they actually know about this technology, which is most likely extraterrestrial in origin,' he said. 'However, I'm also sure that reverse engineering programs are ongoing—this has been confirmed to me by a senior intelligence contact in the UK military, though with limited success.' 'There are a lot of so-called UFO experts making wild claims, all wanting to be the messiah who brings us the truth, but the reality is we do not know, and maybe never will fully understand what this intelligence is. It may be far beyond anything we can comprehend.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A dedicated ghost hunter has published his latest book on the subject of 'things that go bump in the night'. Many of the ghostly tales featured in the book are associated with historic locations - such as battlefields, castles, pubs, and places of industry. Even for sceptics, the 28 stories shed fascinating light on often forgotten histories. The book is divided into four sections - Northumberland, Tyne & Wear, County Durham and Teesside - as Rob, a long-time paranormal investigator and author, takes us on an informative ghostly tour of the North East. Slightly further south, in Alnwick, stands a public house called the Dirty Bottles. It is named after a legend dating from the early 1800s. His widow declared that should anybody touch the bottles, they would suffer the same fate as her unfortunate husband. More than 200 years later, the bottles remain untouched, sealed between two panes of glass and covered in dust and cobwebs. He was captured and, a year later, hanged. Today, a replica stands on Elsdon Moor, recalling the brutal crime. It is said Winter's ghost can sometimes be seen late at night near the gibbet. It boasts 60 individual ghosts - including crying children, a phantom maid, and a marching soldier - and 3,000 sightings during the last decade. Moving into Tyne and Wear, the book stops off at ‘haunted' locations such as Newcastle's Castle Keep, Souter Lighthouse in Whitburn, Marsden Grotto in South Shields, and the Angel of the North in Gateshead, while over in County Durham, the ghostly goings on at the North of England Lead Mining Museum at Killhope come under consideration. As the author declares in his introduction to the book: “Allow me to guide you through my native North East ... and I will tell you of some of the chilling phantoms said to stalk this region.” The title is also available in Kindle, Kobo and iBook formats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The angel Castiel might have rusty people skills, a stoic demeanor, and deadpan sarcasm, but Misha Collins, the human actor behind Supernatural‘s forever third wheel, is charming and full of stories. It's a natural fit, then, that Collins has created a one-man show, It Seemed Like A GOOD IDEA at the Time, which he tours around the country separate from the SPN conventions he does with costars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. “I love telling these very personal stories that bring the audience into some real difficult, emotional terrain, while also having them belly laugh — and they laugh a lot, if I do say so myself,” admits Collins, who shares tales of his financially fraught childhood, including how his mother taught him to steal peaches when he was 4 and how they hopped freight trains and lived as nomads in tents. “This added up to a childhood ripe for storytelling,” Collins notes. “It's nice to see that the hard parts can be funny, and the funny parts can be hard,” he continues. Now, after his own challenging upbringing, he's a proud family man with a wife and two kids — and his life is much more settled. Still, Collins says A GOOD IDEA was “long percolating.” And though this show is 100 percent Collins, he credits Padalecki with the title. “One day on set, after telling yet another story about how I had barely escaped with my life, smuggling myself into Tibet in the back of a vegetable truck, Jared had a flash of insight,” Collins recalls. “He said, ‘I've got it — the title of your memoir.

ESSEX JUNCTION, Vt. (WCAX) - Are you curious about what your future holds? You can find out at this year's Psychic Expo.

Psychics and vendors come from around the state and region to share their creations and craft, many doing tarot card and psychic readings. 

The Champlain valley expo center has been the spot for this festival for three years now and organizers say it's a hit. “People will come and spend 4,5,6 hours, go to multiple readings, go to multiple workshops, do some shopping, talk to crafters there's not a lot of shows like this,” Jeff Folb, owner of Vermont Gatherings, said. 

“Neither of us are trained i guess you could say but we feel like we have a little bit of a knack for it he was going to pull some cards later,” visitors Lillia Nelson and Dylan Pilcher. 

The expo runs through 5 p.m. Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The research links a stable personality trait called “victim justice sensitivity” to greater endorsement of conspiracy narratives about climate change, vaccines, and other topics. Previous studies have often focused on collective victimhood — the belief that one's group has been historically harmed — as a driver of conspiratorial thinking. “Many conspiracy theories are rooted in the idea that one's group has been unfairly treated or targeted by a powerful group acting malevolently in secret,” said Toribio-Flórez, a postdoctoral research associate and member of the CONSPIRACY_FX project. “Because of this, past research has mostly focused on how conspiracy beliefs are related to collective victimhood-that is, when people feel their social group, community, or country has been wronged or harmed by another group. However, within a specific social context, individuals differ in their tendency to perceive and react as victims of injustice, independently of their group identity.” To investigate this, we collaborated with a multinational team of researchers and collected data from 15 countries. This allowed us to examine whether the patterns we observed held up across different cultural and societal contexts, an important step in assessing the generalizability of our findings.” These surveys had explored how personality traits shape trust in science, but they also contained relevant measures for the present investigation. In total, the combined sample included 743 participants: 370 drawn from the general public and a student population, and 373 drawn entirely from a student population. They also completed a validated five-item measure of conspiracy mentality, which captures a general tendency to suspect that important events are shaped by hidden plots. In the second German sample, the researchers also had access to other relevant traits such as dispositional mistrust, intolerance of ambiguity, and need for control, along with political orientation. The analysis revealed a small to moderate positive correlation between victim justice sensitivity and conspiracy mentality in both samples. As part of the Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism (TISP) ManyLabs project, the researchers collected responses from nearly 15,000 people in 15 different countries, including Australia, Austria, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, the United States, and Costa Rica. The samples were designed to reflect national distributions of age, gender, and education level. This large-scale online survey measured victim justice sensitivity using a short two-item scale from the Justice Sensitivity Inventory (“It makes me angry when others are undeservingly better off than me” and “It worries me when I have to work hard for things that come easily to others”). These were rated on scales indicating the degree of agreement. Across the pooled data, victim justice sensitivity was consistently linked to greater endorsement of conspiracy beliefs within countries. “In other words, people who tend to see themselves as victims are a bit more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs, regardless of how victimized others feel in their country or of the level of collective violence their country has recently suffered.” In others, including Costa Rica, Chile, and Colombia, it was minimal or non-existent for some conspiracy measures. The researchers explored whether country-level factors — such as wealth, income inequality, personal freedoms, corruption perceptions, institutional trust, or cultural orientation toward individualism versus collectivism — explained these differences. They also considered historical exposure to violence, such as armed conflicts or political repression. The one tentative exception was that the relationship appeared stronger in more individualistic societies, but this pattern did not replicate across all cultural indices tested. The studies were correlational, meaning they cannot determine whether victim justice sensitivity leads to conspiracy belief or vice versa — or whether the relationship is bidirectional. “We cannot say for certain whether an individual's tendency to feel like a victim makes people more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, or if it's the other way around,” Toribio-Flórez explained. “While some studies suggest that conspiracy beliefs might increase individual perceptions of victimhood, more experimental work is needed to understand the direction and nature of this relationship.” “I hope it encourages other researchers to examine victimhood at both the personal and group levels when studying conspiracy beliefs. While group identity has often been the focus, our findings suggest that an individual sense of victimhood also plays a meaningful role.” In this case, the Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism (TISP) ManyLabs project, led by Dr. Viktoria Cologna and Dr. Niels G. Mede, provided the platform that made this research project possible.” An Examination of the Relationship Between Conspiracy Beliefs and Dispositional Individual Victimhood,” was authored Daniel Toribio-Flórez, Marlene S.

Belief in anti-immigrant conspiracies may be fueled by financial hardship and a sense of societal breakdown, according to new research. Across six studies, economic stress predicted support for discriminatory policies and even violent actions against non-European immigrants. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to overestimate their own abilities and wrongly assume that others share their views, according to a new study. The findings highlight overconfidence as a key factor behind conspiracy belief. A new study used artificial intelligence to analyze over 75,000 Reddit posts and uncover the deep emotional toll QAnon beliefs take on families. The findings reveal widespread grief, fear, and strained relationships as loved ones struggle with ideological division. Psychologists have found that conspiracy theory beliefs may stem from spite triggered by feelings of social, existential, or cognitive disadvantage. The findings suggest that tackling misinformation requires addressing deeper social inequalities and psychological frustrations. People prone to conspiracy theories may share cognitive tendencies with those who experience delusional thinking. Two new studies suggest that biases like anomalous perception and impulsive reasoning help explain why some are more likely to embrace conspiratorial beliefs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new electric motorsport championship is making an ambitious pitch to bring electric engines to the ocean — and Will Smith, LeBron James and Tom Brady are along for the ride. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Skimming across the water on thin hydrofoils, they look more like low-flying UFOs than boats. But the E1 Series' "RaceBirds" — single-seater electric powerboats with 6,000-volt engines that can reach speeds of up to 50 knots (58 miles per hour, or 93 kilometers per hour) — are far from extraterrestrial. Dubbed the "Formula One of the Sea," it already has the backing of celebrity team owners such as Will Smith, LeBron James, Tom Brady, Rafael Nadal, Sergio Pérez and Virat Kohli. "Water mobility is contributing to pollution in a bad way," Rodi Basso, a former NASA scientist and F1 engineer who is the co-founder and CEO of E1, told Live Science. "Sustainability is now becoming almost a tricky word. It started from communication and awareness, which was needed; we have an issue.

Taking inspiration from how birds glide across aquatic surfaces, the 24-foot-long (7.3 meters) boat was designed by Seabird founder Sophi Horne to lift its hull more than 3 feet (1 m) above the surface at speeds of 19.5 mph (31 km/h). "It's a bit like pulling back on the sticks of an airplane, where, as you roll in, it'll dive, so you kind of pull back," Sam Coleman, a pilot on Team Brady who won the first E1 World Championship in 2024, told Live Science. The feat means that the boats produce far less waves when balanced atop their three wing-like foils, thus reducing coastal erosion. But the enhanced speed comes with some major downsides. Bringing the RaceBirds up onto their foils may make them faster, but it also renders them incapable of making sharp turns. And it does so with very little warning." "So now, the pilots are building incredible sensitivity and understanding, finding where that moment is, and riding on the edge of that moment," he added. This means pilots must carefully manage when to use their boosts and when to lift their boats onto their foils during races, in which they compete in a series of time trials to qualify for a final five-boat battle to the finish line. That might mean riding a wide arc perched atop their foils or smashing into the water close to buoys, before zipping away on their boost, all while navigating the choppy waters generated by other boats. It requires enormous concentration and split-second decision-making, both of which are strained further by cockpit temperatures that can climb to 167 degrees Fahrenheit (75 degrees Celsius). "It's draining; it's like sitting in a sauna and trying to drive a racing simulator that's bouncing up and down," Coleman said. "The window is so small, you can be absolutely nailing it and then all of a sudden, you're one point of a degree out on your trim setting and that's enough to induce a porpoise, or an oscillation, that takes ages to recover from." To help pilots perform their best, teams of engineers back on shore analyze data taken from every part of the boat before advising them over radio. Team owners also follow along closely with the results of races. "Tom Brady is the team owner for our team, and for me to say that is very surreal. It's like when Rafa and Will Smith were in Lake Como: They had a great time, they enjoyed it, they understand it, and you can see that they're super competitive, and they have such a great opportunity to bring eyeballs to a new sport and then help elevate it. I think it's a really exciting journey that we're on." Keeping races fresh and competitive means that changes are consistently being made to the RaceBirds' engines and propellers. The design tweaks aren't just to improve performance and handling but also to minimize the zero-emission, virtually silent craft's impact on its surrounding environment. The result is an electric vessel that's around 50 times quieter than traditional combustion engine boats, according to Carlos Duarte, E1's chief scientist. Duarte, a marine biologist who won the 2025 Japan Prize for his contributions to research on marine and coastal ecology, is working through E1 on voluntary schemes with industry to make ships run quieter. "As we saw during the COVID lockdown, with only a 20% reduction in [ships'] noise, there were reports from all over the world of large marine animals being reported in areas that they had not been seen for decades," Duarte told Live Science. "So it is a low-hanging fruit, very easy to solve. And in fact, addressing noise creates benefits for the boat operators, because electric boats are not only silent, but they're more cost-effective than combustion engine boats." These measures include aquatic restoration and conservation efforts, as well as steps to offset the environmental impact of the races themselves. He views building stakeholder partnerships through E1 as a vital avenue for environmental restoration — specifically, away from drawn-out political conferences where, he said, "despite my scientific credentials in the marine space," he, and scientists in general, lack influence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For over a decade, Supernatural captivated audiences with its gripping mix of folklore, horror, and unforgettable sibling banter. Plenty of shows have since tried to fill the gap. However, Supernatural wasn't just about ghosts and ghouls - it was the mix of emotionally layered storytelling, quick-witted dialogue, and long-term myth-building that made it a once-in-a-generation kind of show. Thankfully, there's one underrated gem that might be the next best thing. That show is NBC's Grimm, and it should be considered a must-watch for all Supernatural fans. If Supernatural left you wanting more dark mythology, weekly monsters, and emotionally grounded heroes, Grimm should be next on your list. Premiering in 2011 and running for six seasons, Grimm blends procedural crime drama with supernatural fantasy in a way that hits many of the same satisfying beats as Supernatural. The series follows Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli), a homicide detective who discovers he's descended from a line of hunters called “Grimms” - humans with the power to see creatures known as Wesen hiding in plain sight. These Wesen range from terrifying to tragic, and many are inspired by old European folklore. As Nick juggles his double life, he becomes part protector, part hunter, and eventually a key figure in a brewing war between ancient factions. Nick's evolving dynamics with his partner Hank (Russell Hornsby), ally Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), and love interest Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) provide a grounding emotional core that elevates the show beyond simple creature-hunting. What makes Grimm feel like such a natural follow-up to Supernatural is how confidently it blends darkness and heart. It's smart, suspenseful, and often surprisingly emotional - the very traits that made Supernatural so beloved. At its heart, Grimm is cut from the same cloth as Supernatural. Both shows built fanbases by taking myth and legend seriously while still having fun with their respective universes. In Supernatural, the Winchester brothers take down everything from shapeshifters to gods. In Grimm, Nick faces off against countless Wesen - each with their own origins, cultures, and secrets. Like the most memorable Supernatural episodes, Grimm often uses its creature plots as metaphors for real human issues. Both shows also shine thanks to their long-form storytelling. Supernatural's layered arcs about heaven, hell, and family are echoed in Grimm's slow-burning conflict between Wesen factions, the mysterious Royal Houses, and Nick's evolving place in this hidden world. The lore builds gradually, rewarding viewers who stick with it across seasons. Much like how Supernatural made viewers invest in the emotional growth of Sam, Dean, and Castiel (Misha Collins), Grimm slowly deepens its characters across multiple seasons. Monroe, in particular, stands out as Grimm's version of a fan-favorite sidekick - equal parts comic relief and emotional anchor, much like Castiel or Crowley (Mark Sheppard). The most noticeable difference is in tone and presentation. Where Supernatural leaned into genre-bending episodes and apocalyptic stakes, Grimm keeps its world more grounded, focusing on its unique folklore and police-procedural roots. Grimm's setting in Portland, Oregon adds a moody, misty backdrop that enhances its gritty, urban-fantasy feel. This allows Grimm to explore themes like identity, duality, and hidden histories through a slightly more restrained lens than Supernatural's high-concept battles between heaven and hell. While Supernatural occasionally dipped into stylized or surreal aesthetics, Grimm maintains a consistent visual palette that reflects its darker, more mature vibe. Narratively, Grimm avoids the near-constant world-ending threats that defined much of Supernatural's later seasons. Instead, it builds tension through political intrigue, hidden alliances, and the danger of secrecy unraveling Nick's life. The stakes feel more personal and less cosmic, which can be a refreshing change of pace. For fans of Supernatural who loved the brotherly bond and epic scale, Grimm might feel more low-key but no less intense. It's a grounded supernatural thriller that slowly ramps up in complexity, with just as much payoff. For Supernatural fans ready to dive into the world of Wesen and Grimms, Grimm is incredibly accessible. That's 123 episodes of high-quality dark fantasy just waiting to be binge-watched. The full series is also available for digital purchase if you want to own it outright. It's the kind of show that builds with every season - just like the Winchesters' journey - offering twists, emotional stakes, and a world you won't want to leave. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. With the help of allies, Nick confronts dark forces threatening both worlds.

Disney revolutionized animation in the 1990s with some of the studio's best movies ever, but there were plenty of other animated hits worth watching. After 6 years, Dick Wolf lays the groundwork for Gabby Dawson's (Monica Raymund) return to Chicago Fire season 14, albeit in a subtle way. From Little House on the Prairie to Arrested Development, Jason Bateman's best TV show characters are memorable, hilarious, and incredibly profound. Superman has officially outgrossed a 2016 DC Extended Universe movie at the domestic box office after already shattering its critical reception. After Jamie Lee Curtis' new legacy sequel earned a 73% Rotten Tomatoes score, the star takes to social media to call out one especially harsh review.</p>
