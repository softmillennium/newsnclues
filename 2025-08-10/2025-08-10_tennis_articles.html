                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tommy Paul played his first tour-level match in over a month and secured a victory in his opening clash at the Cincinnati Open. Kicking off his North American hard swing, the US star comfortably defeated Pedro Martinez in straight sets, besting the Spaniard 6-2, 6-2. It was his first professional bout since the third of July, when Paul's Wimbledon campaign ended in the second round after losing to Sebastian Ofner. He joined a long list of seeded stars who exited the All England Club in the early rounds, including Alexander Zverev, Jack Draper, and Holger Rune. After his lengthy break away from the sport, Paul said there has been a ‘crazy' change on the ATP Tour recently. Speaking to Tennis Channel after his victory, he said: “What's crazy is I feel like everyone can do everything now. “[Jannik] Sinner is coming in [to the net] so much more now, I mean, you can tell it's something that he's been working on. It's already scary, but that's a real complete player. What I noticed in the tournament last week [the Canadian Open] was, I mean, he was really extending points. “Ben's always been pretty good at the net, but he's gotten a lot better. “I mean, even [Jenson] Brooksby, Brooksby does a lot of the short slices and gets to the net and just makes it uncomfortable. With his win over Martinez, he has already surpassed his finish in 2024, and can now pick up some valuable points. His next opponent is Adrian Mannarino, against whom he has a head-to-head record of 1-1.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many, including Britain's Emma Raducanu, have already got their campaigns underway in the final piece of preparation ahead of the US Open. Raducanu breezed past Olga Danilovic 6-3 6-2 in her second-round match, the first played in front of Francis Roig as her full-time coach. A rematch with Wimbledon nemesis Aryna Sabalenka awaits in the third round. You can follow LIVE tennis news below... You can check out at any time. Rielly Opelka has beaten Alex De Minaur for the first time in his career. Frances Tiafoe has joking claimed that fellow American Jessica Pegula no longer wants to practice with him because she has become too "big time." "She hits the ball so pure and right in pocket every time. But she doesn't want to hit with me any more," Tiafoe said. "She's made some finals now in some slams, 1000s, and she doesn't want to talk to me as much any more. She got too big time for me. Roger Federer has confirmed that he will return to the tennis court at the Shangai Masters in October. The 20-time Grand Slam champion is set to play in a charity celebrity doubles match. "Hello, this is Roger, and I am really happy to be returning to Qizhong Stadium in Shanghai for the Rolex Shanghai Masters," the 44-year-old said in an announcement video. "Shanghai has always been a special place for me, with great fans, unforgettable memories, and a real love for the game. "I look forward to seeing you there on October 10. Roger Federer is coming back to Shanghai \ud83e\udd29Join us on October 10th for the @rogerfederer and Friends Celebrity Doubles Match!#rolexshanghaimasters pic.twitter.com/6gpnkFfl6B Alexander Zverev is gearing up for his first match at the Cincinnati Open in today's evening session but he is not a fan of the courts being used. He complained: "Cincinnati was a very fast tournament in the past, but it's become extremely slow now. "I'm not a huge fan of this surface. Canadian Open tournament director Karl Hale has taken aim at Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for skipping the event this year. Both took time out following their epic battle at Wimbledon last month. So those players, you know, were injuries. "I think Carlos and Sinner have to look at our tour, the ATP tour, and commit to these majors, you know. So we're in talks with them to ensure that going forward that they'll be participating in our event." Coco Gauff has joked that American's men need to catch up. No American man has won a Grand Slam since Andy Roddick in 2003. Gauff joked: "It hasn't been much of competition, no offence to them. She added: “That's the beautiful thing about being an American. That's something beautiful about our country, how diverse it is, and I hope that in this sport it continues to grow." The Polish star said: "I try to be humble and remember that you have to adapt to these balls because they don't give you any advantage in and of themselves. They are light and very different from the ones we play on clay or at Wimbledon, the only way to deal with them is to focus on adapting as much as possible and accepting that there will be shots that will escape your racket, trying to control them as much as possible.” The Spaniard has taken a short break since his defeat against Jannik Sinner in last month's showdown. Alcaraz faces Damir Dzumhur at the Cincinnati Open today. He is currently expected on court at around 6.20pm UK time. Aryna Sabalenka has requested a bigger dining room at the Cincinnati Open. But she complained that the dining room is too small. "My only request is that next year we make the dining room a bit bigger. Next year let's make sure there's more space in the dining room. "Other than that, oh my gosh, it's even more enjoyable to be here." Alejandro Davidovich Fokina retired from his Cincinnati Open clash with Joao Fonseca. Novak Djokovic's former coach has backed Jannik Sinner to win a Career Slam in the next seven years. Riccardo Piatti believes it will not be long before Sinner is a French Open champion. “Jannik has taken a big step forward this past year. He's also become very competitive on the clay-court tour,” Piatti told La Stampa. This is something I've always thought about. “In Paris, the bet was more on Carlos, at Wimbledon more on Jannik, but in any case, they have two different styles and two different personalities, which is fine. They know that there are fans who want one to win and others who enjoy seeing them fall more, but that's the way sport is.” The American seemed hugely emotional during her defeat against Taylor Townsend, and seemed to shout in pain at her team. "Anyone who has a herniated disc knows my pain," Collins wrote on Instagram. "It's no surprise the keyboard warriors can't understand or relate, as they've been too busy sitting on a**es judging people who show up and and try to give it their best even on days that suck. "Thank you to everyone who has been praying for my injury and thank you to Taylor Townsend for being the best of the best." Emma Raducanu has shared some blunt early conversations with Francis Roig. 1 says they have both agreed that all of her shots need to improve, particularly if she is to consistently challenge the likes of Aryna Sabalenka - her next Cincinnati Open opponent. “It's just, 'the level needs to be better'. "Just in general, everything is like: ‘We need to improve. We need to get every shot better.' There were four or five points where I did something that we were working on, and it's always really satisfying and rewarding when you hit a shot and you've worked on it in practice. So I think I'm going to improve a lot, hopefully doing the work day in, day out.” Frances Tiafoe has given a student £22,300 to complete his studies. Tiafoe said: "This is what it's all about. “This is great, I'm excited to get it out. To see how ecstatic he was with being able to take care of his junior and senior career, it's a huge deal. Jannik Sinner has snubbed a golf reunion with Carlos Alcaraz weeks after they Wimbledon battle. Sinner has previously played golf with Alcaraz, but now insists the Spaniard is too good for him. "Tomorrow I have one day off, so maybe we play a couple of holes here. Also last year, here it's the best place to play golf. "In Cincinnati there's not so much to do, so we're actually lucky that the golf course is there. "The first hole is, okay, should be straight, you know, but on the left there are all cars, and if one ball finished in the car, everyone, it's me." Asked if he will play golf with Alcaraz, Sinner joked: "Carlos is too good for me. A blistering 6-3 6-2 defeat of Olga Danilovic, who had beaten Katie Boulter in the first round, opened Raducanu's Cincinnati Open campaign with a bang. It was the 22-year-old's first match in front of new full-time coach Francis Roig. "I still feel like there's a long way to go but just working hard behind the scenes, putting a lot of hours in and hoping I can trust in that." This tournament is Raducanu's last piece of preparation before she returns to the scene of her greatest triumph, the US Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In hot conditions, the 27-year-old did just that, taking large cuts at the ball on return and saving all seven break points he faced to record his ninth Top 10 win after one hour and 41 minutes. "I didn't serve as well as I'd have liked to, but everything else was working," said Opelka, who won 76 per cent of his first-serve points and 69 per cent of his second-serve points. "My forehand helped me a lot and my backhand, playing with a lot of offense and I was pretty consistent from the baseline the whole match. My serve fluctuated and it was a bit of a surprise that the other things came through well for me today. 8 De Minaur arrived in Cincinnati having earned a Tour-leading 24 hard-court wins this season, highlighted by his recent title triumph in Washington. However, he was unable to convert his opportunities against Opelka, who struck a huge forehand winner on return at 5/5 in the first-set tie-break en route to claiming the opener. 64 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will next meet Francisco Comesana after the Argentine advanced on Sunday when 29th seed Luciano Darderi retired trailing 4-6, 1-3. He clubbed 38 winners, including 14 aces, to De Minaur's six winners, with the Australian frequently returning second serves above shoulder height. In other early action, ninth seed Andrey Rublev moved past #NextGenATP American Learner Tien 7-6(4), 6-3 to reach the third round. Rublev arrived in Cincinnati off the back of a quarter-final showing in Toronto, his best ATP Masters 1000 result of the year. There was Czech success for Jakub Mensik and Jiri Lehecka. Miami champion Mensik, 19, defeated American Ethan Quinn 6-4, 6-2 to earn his first win at the hard-court Masters 1000 event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek's battle back to the summit of tennis has been an arduous one after struggling to find her feet early in 2025. Earlier in the year, Swiatek suffered shock exits to Mirra Andreeva and Danielle Collins at Indian Wells and Rome respectively. In fact, the Pole went over a year without winning a WTA Tour title after losing in the French Open semi-finals to Aryna Sabalenka. Swiatek's first grass-court final appearance at the Bad Homburg Open foreshadowed future events, as she went on to lift the Venus Rosewater Dish at Wimbledon in July. There has been a change in geographical scenery recently as tournaments have moved from the European clay and grass-court surfaces to the North American hard courts. A change to the type of ball has faced much scrutiny due to an apparent difficulty in controlling them. Swiatek addressed this issue while speaking to reporters after her victory over Potapova. The Wilson US Open balls have been frequently discussed in recent weeks due to an apparent lack of control. The Pole was asked by one reporter to expand on her perspective and approach on dealing with the ‘light' US Wilson US Open balls. Swiatek said: “Yeah I won the US Open but I also like lost couple times second round, or third. Swiatek was also asked to comment on her early-season struggles. The Pole noted there were a variety of factors, pinpointing her clay-court expectations as one particular area of struggle. She said: “I think there were a lot of factors back then. Well for sure the expectations on clay and just me kind of feeling like I don't know, I need to compete my best every week, but I sometimes needed just time to kind of reset but didn't really get it until I lost in Rome. “Yeah me being like frustrated quicker from different reasons like… and not working the proper way, kind of being stubborn sometimes with the way I approach stuff so I think it was a mix, and I needed some time to get out of that after Rome.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — Former top-10 player Paula Badosa pulled out of the U.S. Open on Friday after dealing with a back injury that has sidelined her since a first-round loss at Wimbledon on June 30. The U.S. Tennis Association announced Badosa's withdrawal and said Jil Teichmann would replace her in the field. Alizé Cornet, who retired from tennis last year but returned to action this year, is the next woman in line to get a berth in the draw at Flushing Meadows if someone else pulls out. Play is scheduled to begin on Aug. 24 in the singles brackets at the year's last Grand Slam tournament. 2 in 2022 and is currently No. Her best showing at the U.S. Open was a run to the quarterfinals last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When two-time Grand Slam champion and WTA No. 2, Coco Gauff, was asked about the strength of American tennis, she playfully criticized her ATP counterparts. “We've had three straight slams with American in the finals, so I think we're doing pretty good on our end. Even if Gauff might not have been entirely serious, she had a point. 6 Ben Shelton has soared up the rankings after recently beating fellow American and No. 4 Taylor Fritz at the National Bank Open in Canada before defeating then-No. He has skyrocketed to his career-high rank after starting the year at No. Shelton has progressed tremendously despite always showing promise because of his serving, because he has improved his baseline and serve return game. At the National Bank Open, he won 36.2% of return points, according to USA TODAY. “I don't really feel expectation other than, you know, what me and my team put on myself, which is more about effort and intention than results,” Shelton said. “That's always kind of how I go into a tournament. 4 ranking position since 2024, has come close to winning Grand Slams. But he fell to the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively, as he bowed out of each. He noted that while Sinner and Alcaraz are a level higher than the rest of the field, those players still lose. Fritz said he has noticed the high level of all the top Americans, who he thinks are capable of achieving a grand slam title. By continuing to make deep Grand Slam runs, he added, it could eventually work out for one of them. “Things just need to click for two weeks, and that's it.” Others in the top 20, like Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe, have also performed well. And maybe it will click for one of them, as Fritz suggested. Tiafoe, who is 6-3 in Grand Slams this year, made the French Open quarterfinal. But his recent results have been a step down from his 2024 US Open semifinal appearance, in which he lost to Fritz. Tiafoe said Shelton's success in Canada has motivated him to perform better. While Alcaraz and Sinner have been more consistent than the rest of the pack, he said on any given night, one of them can pull off a victory. I think Tommy (Paul) 's in a great situation. So I don't think an American is that far away at all. Those guys are tall orders, but I don't think the difference is that big. I think the belief factor just needs to be there.” Paul is still focused on conditioning, but he has been motivated by Shelton's rapid progress. "Obviously, (it) motivates all of us, but (I'm) really just happy for him right now." “Tennis is reaching a different demographic than it was before, and that's because of stars like Coco (Gauff), Francis (Tiafoe), and Taylor (Fritz), especially in the U.S., but not just Americans, North Americans, and Europeans too.” Gauff later continued to discuss why it is important to have Americans near the top of tennis on both sides. “Something beautiful about our country is how diverse it is, and I hope in this sport that it continues to show,” she said. “It's great for the men to be in those numbers with us. And I would love to see in my lifetime, a woman, an American woman, and a male win the same slam.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some have built confidence with strong showings in recent weeks, while others are still looking for the spark to turn their summer around. The fast courts and humid conditions are adding an extra layer of unpredictability, so expect plenty of momentum swings and tight scorelines across the board. As always, we here at LWOT will be offering our predictions for every match on the schedule. Their head-to-head has Tiafoe in the lead, and with both players in decent rhythm, this could come down to who manages their service games better. Arthur Rinderknech has been building quietly, picking up some good wins since the grass swing, and now faces Felix Auger-Aliassime, who's enjoying one of his best patches of form this year. Felix has been moving well and dictating play with his forehand, but Rinderknech's serve-and-volley skills could keep the rallies short and the pressure high. The clash of styles will make for an engaging affair but the Canadian should have too much for his opponent. Rinderknech comes off his third top 20 win of the season, as he beat Casper Ruud in round 2. Adrian Mannarino and Tommy Paul are no strangers to each other, having shared some tricky battles in the past. Mannarino's flat strokes and ability to redirect pace can trouble anyone, especially on a quick court, while Paul's athleticism and counterpunching have carried him deep in recent events. If both bring their A-game, expect a match full of sudden shifts and long, absorbing exchanges. Gabriel Diallo's dream run meets a stern test against Jannik Sinner. If Diallo can keep up his aggressive serving and take time away, he might just make things interesting. He holds an English Literature degree from the University of Nigeria Nsukka and quickly found a niche in the world of sports journalism. He is a big football fan who has supported Manchester United for most of his life. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, the 27-year-old, who recently announced her split from fellow tennis star Stefanos Tsitsipas, confirmed she would be withdrawing from the final major of the calendar year, set to run from Aug. 24 to Sept. 7. "It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing my withdrawal from this year's U.S. Open," Badosa, who reached the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows last year wrote on social media. "This decision was incredibly difficult to make. After the amazing run I had in New York last year and the deep connection I feel with the city and its fans, stepping away from this tournament is very emotional for me. The U.S. Open has always meant a great deal to me, and I have created some of my most special memories there." The Spaniard has battled a chronic back injury over the years, which she has herself admitted could force her into retirement prematurely. And now in the wake of her announcement, Badosa has posted another message on social media for her fans, which has hinted that she could be set for some time away from the court as she looks to battle her way back from a setback. A post shared by Paula Badosa (@paulabadosa) Posting on Instagram, Badosa said: "I wasn't built by easy days. I was shaped by the moments that broke me, the choices that didn't go as planned, and the times I fell short of who I wanted to be. My setbacks weren't signs that I was weak; they were necessary chapters in a story that's still being written. "Failure taught me what success never could. Every closed door redirected me toward a better one. "I'm not proud of every moment in my past, but I am proud of the person those moments created. And her decision to pull out of the US Open will now also mean British star Jack Draper now needs to find a new mixed doubles partner for the tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu started her new coaching partnership with Francisco Roig on a winning note after kicking off her Cincinnati Open campaign with a straight-set win over Olga Danilovic. Both players struggled on serve in the first set as there were four breaks in the first five games before Raducanu claimed the crucial break in game eight. I'm really happy with how I've stayed pretty consistent over the last few months,” she started after the match. “I still feel like there's a long way to go but just working hard behind the scenes, putting a lot of hours in and hoping I can trust in that.” Emma Raducanu gets strong verdict on top 10 and Grand Slam hopes from Serena Williams' ex-coach Sabalenka kicked off her title defence with a 7-5, 6-1 victory over 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova. “It's always a tough match against her,” Sabalenka said. It will be Sabalenka and Raducanu's second meeting in just over a month as they produced a thrilling fourth-round match at Wimbledon and it was the former who emerged with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-4. Raducanu sits on 1,426 points in the Live Rankings and if she wins her next match she will move to 1,481, which will result in a bump up to No 31. Sabalenka and Raducanu prepare for a third career meeting at the Cincinnati Open. Aryna Sabalenka will be the No 1 seed at US Open, but the battle for final few seeding positions continues. "I'm not saying that wouldn't work but it would be a surprise given her words during the Petchey experiment." Rick Macci speaks to Tennis365 about Emma Raducanu's potential.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Grandstand Court witnessed a remarkable encounter on Saturday. This season's Australian Open queen Madison Keys was up against a formidable rival, Germany's Eva Lys. Lys gave the American WTA star a run for her money. Keys has a tendency to rebound and claw her way back from the jaws of defeat. From a point where she nearly lost the match, the World No.6 somehow turned things around, hilariously, to her own astonishment. However, Keys then responded equally, taking the second set 6-3. At one point, Lys was leading 3-0 on her way to taking the second round. It was at this moment, though, that Keys really burst through. The tie-break was one-sided as she snatched her ticket to the next round with a final score line of 1-6, 6-3, 7-6(1). Of course, the American star was extremely happy with her performance. But during the post-match interview with Tennis Channel‘s Prakash Amritraj, she was amused with the way she won. The host curiously shed light on a special habit of Keys' where she's “come back from the brink (of defeat) a bunch of times this year.” Keys responded, saying, “Yeah,” to which Prakash told her, “That's a pretty special talent, you know.

Photo by Corinne Dubreuil/ABACAPRESS.COM London United Kingdom PUBLICATIONxNOTxINxFRAxUK Copyright: xDubreuilxCorinne/ABACAx The alternative here is losing, for which the host said, “Well, you obviously never do that.” “Well, okay, that's fair. But look, the good news is, it didn't end that way. A lot of players might not have found a way to come back.” While still perplexed about this specific acknowledgement, she commented, “Okay, that's great. Prakash then decided to close out the unintentionally humorous interaction, saying, “You know, Mady, I can't answer that. But it is, it's always unbelievably entertaining to watch.” Left in splits, Keys humbly said, “Well, I'm glad you guys are entertained.” But reverting to the match itself, it was one hell of a rollercoaster ride for Keys. And she made it evident with a post-match reaction that revealed her real motivation behind the comeback against Lys. Owing to the fact that she didn't have a clue about her playing style beforehand. After losing the first set, it looked too difficult for her to make a comeback. After her Australian Open triumph, Keys has struggled a lot to overcome lower-ranked players. But three of her recent losses have been frequent since June. After a QF run in Paris, she lost early at the Queen's Club, then in Berlin, and also at Wimbledon. Playing against Lys, there was added pressure to stay composed. “I just kept trying to listen to everyone here cheering me,” she said, as reported on the WTA's website on August 10. In the second round, Keys will now be up against Japan's Aoi Ito. It will be their maiden face-off at the WTA level. Do you think the American will easily win this battle or will the World No.94 make her work hard for a win like Lys?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bolavip, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective. Australian tennis has produced legends like Rod Laver, John Newcombe, Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter, and Lleyton Hewitt. In recent years, new talents have emerged, but some—like Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic—have attracted more attention for off-court incidents than on-court achievements. Born in Australia on October 21, 1992, Tomic picked up the sport at an early age under the guidance of his father, John—a hands-on presence who would later spark several controversies. As a junior, Tomic stood out, winning two Grand Slam titles: the 2008 Australian Open and the 2009 U.S. Open. Back in 2009, Tomic was one of Australia's hottest tennis prospects, while Lleyton Hewitt was still the face of Australian tennis—a proven Grand Slam champion and Davis Cup stalwart. So Hewitt's physio went over to Bernard's coach and asked, ‘Is Bernard here to practice with Lleyton?' Rudy didn't know anything about it, but said, ‘Look, Bernard is looking for a hitting partner, and I think he'd like to.' But then Bernard's agent walked in and said, ‘No, he's not here to practice with Lleyton—Lleyton's not good enough'”. According to Drysdale, those were the exact words: “Lleyton's not good enough”. “Lleyton just couldn't believe it,” Drysdale said. Ironically, years later, Tomic and Hewitt would end up sharing the court—this time as teammates for Australia in the Davis Cup. 1 and US Open champion who retired at 25 amid physical bullying struggles He won his first ATP title in January 2013, added back-to-back Bogota crowns in 2014 and 2015, and peaked at a career-high No. But for Bernard Tomic, two appearances at the All England Club ended in controversy and fines rather than glory. After the match, he admitted in a press conference that he had faked an injury to slow things down, which led tournament officials to hit him with a £13,000 fine. In that same presser, Tomic made headlines with a blunt statement: “I don't care if I make the fourth round of the U.S. Open or lose in the first round. Two years later, in 2019, Tomic faced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first round and lost 6-2, 6-1, 6-4—in just 58 minutes, an unusually short duration for a best-of-three-sets match at the Slams. Wimbledon officials determined that Tomic had violated the tournament's code of conduct by failing to put forth his best effort. As a result, they withheld his £45,000 prize money. After several seasons where he appeared increasingly disconnected from the sport, Tomic's performance and ranking took a significant hit. Just two months later, Tomic reached the final of the Fairfield Challenger against Learner Tien, but suffered a lopsided 6-0, 6-1 defeat in only 39 minutes. After improving his ranking, Tomic earned opportunities to compete in higher-level events again. In 2025, he entered qualifying rounds at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros, and also played in several ATP tournaments. Bernard Tomic of Australia plays a forehand during a practice session ahead of the 2025 Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Speaking to Punto de Break in March 2025, Tomic reflected on his career and personal growth: “When you have an engine and a purpose, you get up every day with something to focus on, something to do. Now I'd rather not have that much attention—being in the media spotlight isn't good”.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amanda Anisimova admits she had a sense of "guilt" after not winning a single game in the Wimbledon final but also adds that the public gave her "the sweetest" support and that's what helped her mentally overcome the most painful loss of her career. Playing in her first Grand Slam final, the 23-year-old American lasted on the court only 57 minutes before Iga Swiatek completed an astonishing 6-0 6-0 win. When Anisimova burst into tears shortly after the Wimbledon final, no one could blame her. "It was really special to see how many people were sending me the sweetest messages. There was definitely that side of guilt immediately after. Usually, players complain about receiving social media abuse. But this time, Anisimova was on the receiving end of his warm and kind messages. "It's not often that you get a lot of positive feedback on social media," the world No. After Wimbledon, Anisimova kicked off her North American hard-court swing in Montreal, where she made the round-of-16 before losing to Elina Svitolina.
