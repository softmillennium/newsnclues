            This month, our twin boys — our only children — will fly the coop and head off to university. For the first time in 19 years, just two of us and our 12-pound Maltese Shih Tzu will be rattling around inside our family home.
    


            The laughter and music that have echoed off the walls will be gone, and my wife and I will enter a new, uncertain phase of life. We will become empty nesters.
    


            Admittedly, this is a rather stark interpretation of what empty nesting is going to be, but we hope we're well-prepared. We've been discussing our dreams for the future, exploring the restaurants that we never quite had time to frequent, and the pickleball paddles have been ordered. Still, it's been hard to ignore the daunting finality that has been creeping up on us for years. Empty nesting is a phrase that seems to be laden with heartache and trepidation.
    


            With high school graduation approaching last May, we could feel an emotional knife twisting as our social media feeds filled with nostalgic images of the first day of kindergarten alongside the last day of 12th grade. We started becoming hyperaware of the imminent transition, my wife even describing a dagger of pain in the grocery store when she bought a packet of brown paper lunch bags for the last time.
    


            It really does feel like only yesterday that our boys arrived together, their births announced to the world on air by my CNN International colleagues. Since then, we have anxiously wondered if the boys will be ready when it's time for them to take off on their own. But then I began wondering if the question should instead be, “Are we ready?” Are we prepared for the transition back from “parents” to “couple”?
    


            I often think of an old friend in London who raised five children over about 25 years. When the last one left, she said she turned to her husband and, for the first time in a quarter of a century, asked, “So, how are you?”
    


No longer babies, some teens take to ‘soiling the nest'



            We're obviously not the first generation to have experienced empty nesting, a concept reportedly coined in 1914 and popularized in the 1970s, but we may be the first generation to have openly talked about it.
    


            Former first lady Michelle Obama recently discussed how she was using therapy to transition to a new phase of life after having “launched” her daughters. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay admitted that he was so sad when his son went off to university that he went into his son's bedroom and put on a pair of his underwear.
    


            Ramsay's heartfelt honesty also shatters a myth about empty nesting that it's only moms who are emotional when the children leave. The British author Celia Dodd, who recently updated her 2011 book, “The Empty Nest: How to Survive and Stay Close to Your Adult Child,” told me that dads often seem to be coping fine with the transition but might be struggling the most.
    


            “I thought my husband was just being a heartless bastard,” she recalled of the time her eldest son left home. “He was going, ‘It's great, they'll have a great time.' Whereas in fact he was feeling just as sad as I did. I think a lot of men feel there's not space for them to talk about how they feel, because they're supporting their partner and they're supporting the kids.”
    


            An understanding of how fathers might be affected in no way minimizes the attachment between mothers and their children, a bond that is (mostly) formed in the womb.
    


            Other parents have told me to expect a multitude of emotions, but surely the most immediate will be the sense of loss in the weeks after departure. “When empty nesters talk about the teenagers,” the comedian Jim Gaffigan quipped, “they always sound like they're describing a hurricane: ‘My wife and I thought we were prepared; we lost everything!'”
    


            Madonna wasn't quite so dramatic when she talked about her daughter Lourdes leaving, but she still compared it to losing an arm. Once you've come to terms with that, there is often an identity crisis to navigate.
    


Overinvolved in your college kid's life? It's understandable but not helpful, experts say



            As Dodd wrote in ‘The Empty Nest,' “To me, it was glaringly obvious that parting from a child who has been the centre of your life for twenty-odd years is a really big deal. Yet while new parents are bombarded with advice, empty nest parents are left to muddle through what is arguably the most challenging phase of parenting.”
    


            She added, “It is the flipside of the seismic emotional adjustment that new parents go through with the birth of their first baby. A return to life without children — while still being a parent — requires another massive readjustment of self and your place in the world.”
    


            Since my parents' generation, there has been a revolution in family life. Dodd has observed that many modern-day parents are closer to their kids than they once were to their own parents. They're more involved in their lives, and some even want to be friends with them.
    


            I'm immensely proud of my sons, and I'm excited for their future, and as hard as it will be to let go, I recognize that it's crucial for all of us to shift the dynamic in our family relationship. They know that we're always here if they need us, but we don't intend to check in every day to see how they're doing.
    


Is your child headed off to college? Here are 5 tips to manage mental health



            Perhaps the greatest concern is the increasing divorce rate among empty nesters. On a recent trip home to London, some friends of mine ran through the list of our peers who had recently been separated. It was anecdotal, but the handful of cases seemed alarmingly high.
    


            Why can even seemingly rock-solid couples run into problems when it's just the two of them at home? “It's hard to imagine what life will be like when there's just the two of you, and it's natural to wonder what on earth you'll find to talk about,” Dodd wrote.
    


            “One mother sums it up: ‘Suddenly you're on your own and you look at each other and realise you haven't paid much attention to each other for years.”
    


            I want my kids to succeed and find their independence; the ultimate parental dream is to see our children soar. Equally, mine seem to recognize the void their departure will create — our sons have asked more than once if we'll be OK when they're gone. Such a level of emotional maturity signals to me that they'll be just fine on their own.
    


            Having thought about this impending transition for many years, I no longer fear it; in fact, I'm learning to embrace it. Planning and preparation are important, as is the mindset — we shouldn't be “filling a hole” but finding a purpose.
    


Married for 50 years, these psychologists who study love share what they've learned to do — and not to do — to stay happy



            Intentional date nights are already back on the calendar, and my wife is excited to devote her full time to her art career. My creative space is the yard and garden, so finally the plants will have my full care and attention, and I'm one step closer to keeping the beehives I've been dreaming about. For the coming months, we've bought tickets to ghost tours and shows and even a gig in Canada, which seems very rock ‘n' roll.
    


            The oft-quoted translation that the Chinese symbol for crisis means both danger and opportunity may not be totally accurate, but I choose to believe it at this stage of my life.
    


            It's not just our children who are gaining their independence; we're going to rediscover it, too.

            Families of Israeli hostages kept captive in Gaza are calling for a nationwide general strike next Sunday, in protest of the Israeli security cabinet's recent decision to expand the war and take over Gaza City.
    


            “We are shutting down the country to save the soldiers and the hostages,” said the relatives of the hostages in Tel Aviv. They were joined by the October 7 Council, which represents bereaved families of soldiers who fell at the start of the war.
    


            Organizers said the initiative would start as a grassroots effort primarily through private companies and citizens who will strike on Sunday to halt the economy.
    


            Within hours, the October 7 Council said “hundreds” of companies said they would participate in the strike, as well as “thousands of citizens who have declared they will take the day off.”
    


            Israel's largest worker union, known as the Histadrut, hasn't yet joined the strike.  The families are expected to meet with Histadrut Chairman Arnon Bar-David on Monday in a bid to convince him to join forces.
    


            Anat Angrest, mother of Matan, who is being held hostage in Gaza, appealed to the heads of the economic and labor industries, warning that “your silence is killing our children.”
    


            Angrest said, “I know your hearts are with us and in pain – but that is not enough. Silence kills. That is why I am here today to ask for something I have avoided until now – to ask the heads of industry: you have the power.”
    


            The Histadrut has already staged a general strike in support of the hostages' families last year. After the killing of six Israeli hostages by Hamas in September 2024, the union disrupted key sectors like transport, banking, healthcare, and joined widespread protests and demonstrations throughout the day. However, the Israeli government blasted their actions as political and moved to halt the strike through a labor court injunction.
    


            While the Histadrut has not commented publicly about the strike, Israeli opposition leaders have endorsed and embraced the initiative. Leader of the opposition Yair Lapid said, “The call by the families of the hostages for a general strike is justified and appropriate.”
    


            The chairman of the Democrats party, Yair Golan, announced the party would join the strike and called “on all Israeli citizens – anyone who holds the values of life and mutual responsibility dear – to strike with us, to take to the streets, to resist and disrupt.”
    


            The Israeli security cabinet decided on Friday to move forward with a controversial plan to expand the war and take over Gaza City. The plan has provoked harsh criticism from the families of the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are presumed to be alive, warning that the new military move could endanger the living hostages and sentence them to death.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the escalation in a news conference on Sunday. “Contrary to false claims, this is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily,” he told reporters.

Radioactive water from the UK's Coulport weapons depot leaked into Loch Long in western Scotland on several occasions after aging pipes burst, according to files from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) published by The Ferret, an investigative journalism platform. The Royal Naval Armaments Depot stores the nuclear warheads for the British Royal Navy's Trident-class submarines. SEPA said up to half of its 1,500 water pipes were past their design life when the leaks happened. It blamed “shortfalls in maintenance” for flooding that released low levels of tritium, a radioactive substance used in warheads, into the loch, which is popular with swimmers, divers, kayakers and fishers. Small amounts of tritium are generally harmless, but high or prolonged exposure can raise cancer risks.

The files reveal that pipes burst in 2010 and twice in 2019. In August 2019, a warhead processing area was flooded; contaminated water then flowed through an open drain into the loch. SEPA said the tritium levels were very low and posed no threat to public health.

The UK Ministry of Defense agreed in 2020 to take steps to prevent more bursts. But SEPA later found that progress on these measures was slow and problems with asset management persisted. There were two further pipe bursts in 2021, including one in another area that also held radioactive substances, prompting another SEPA inspection in 2022.

The documents were released after a six-year fight under Scotland's freedom of information laws, the newspaper wrote. Scottish Information Commissioner David Hamilton ruled in June that most files must be made public, rejecting the military's claims that secrecy was needed to ensure national security. He said the main risk was to “reputations,” not safety. While SEPA said radioactivity levels in these incidents were very low and did not endanger human health, it found there were “shortfalls in maintenance and asset management that led to the failure of the coupling that indirectly led to the production of unnecessary radioactive waste.”

In May, The Ferret reported that there had been 12 nuclear incidents at Faslane Royal Navy submarine base since 2023 that could have released radioactive substances.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Germany to form national security council","https://www.rt.com/news/622722-germany-national-security-council/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:14:00 GMT","

Germany is reportedly planning to establish the National Security Council later this month to address internal and external threats, dpa news agency has reported. 

The German Defense Ministry previously reported the sharpest growth in military recruitment in years, saying it is aimed at countering what Berlin describes as the “threat” from Russia. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also called for developing the Bundeswehr into the “strongest conventional army in Europe” and increasing military spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2029. Berlin has also been considering reintroducing conscription to address what it calls a “changing security situation in Europe.”

The new security council is expected to coordinate the work of various departments and focus on analyzing information on domestic, foreign, and economic and digital security. It will convene in crisis situations, identify medium- and long-term threats, and develop strategies to respond to them, according to dpa.

The body will be chaired by Merz and will include relevant ministers, members of German security agencies, scientific experts, and representatives of other countries, the EU, and NATO. The official decision is set to be announced during the first government meeting after the parliamentary recess on August 27 in the Ministry of Defense.

Moscow has repeatedly rejected claims it poses a threat to Europe, dismissing speculation that it plans to attack NATO countries as “nonsense.” 

Russia has also condemned NATO's military buildup, accusing the bloc's European members of “firmly following the path of reckless militarization” and Germany of “whipping up hysterical Russophobia across the European continent.”

Last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western European leaders of forgetting the lessons of history and “trying to prepare Europe for war – not some hybrid war, but a real war against Russia.” Responding to Merz's call for Germany to once again become Europe's leading military power, Lavrov noted that the chancellor “didn't even choke on the word ‘again'.”

Iran has condemned a US-backed plan to establish a transit route through Armenia which would be under US control, warning that it poses a threat to regional stability and would undermine Tehran's security interests.

On Friday, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and US President Donald Trump signed an agreement in Washington to open the Zangezur transport corridor. The route links mainland Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhichevan through a narrow strip of land in southern Armenia along the border with Iran.

Under the agreement, the US will manage the corridor under Armenian sovereignty via a 99-year land lease, subletting it to a consortium for construction and operations.

While Tehran said it welcomes peace agreements between Yerevan and Baku, it “vehemently” opposes placing the corridor under US control. Iranian officials argue that it would cut Iran off from Armenia and destabilize the South Caucasus by allowing a foreign military and commercial presence.

Ali Akbar Velayati, senior adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the project a geopolitical scheme by the US and Israel to weaken the Islamic Republic, sever its connection with the Caucasus, and impose a land blockade on both Iran and Russia. He claimed it was part of a wider NATO-backed strategy, supported by pan-Turkic movements, to shift the Western focus from Ukraine to the Caucasus.

“The Caucasus is one of the most sensitive geographical points in the world, and this corridor will not be a transit route in Trump's possession but a graveyard for his mercenaries,” Velayati said, adding that Russia is also “strategically against” the project.

Moscow has said it welcomes efforts to achieve stability and prosperity in the South Caucasus and to normalize relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stressed that the best solutions are those developed by the countries in the region and their immediate neighbors — specifically Russia, Iran, and Turkey.

She noted that trilateral agreements signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia after the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war remain in force and relevant, and that Armenia's border with Iran continues to be guarded by Russian border forces under a 1992 treaty.

MOSCOW, August 10. /TASS/. The White House is reportedly considering the possibility of inviting Vladimir Zelensky to the negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump, NBC News reported, citing a US official and three other sources.

""Discussions are underway,"" one source told the channel. A White House representative added that it is ""absolutely possible.""

On Friday, Trump announced his intention to hold a meeting with Putin in Alaska on August 15. The plans for these talks were subsequently confirmed by Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov. According to Ushakov, Putin and Trump will focus on discussing options to achieve a long-term peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis.

LONDON, August 10. /TASS/. European leaders have called on US President Donald Trump to hold talks with Russia ""only under a ceasefire"" and to ""protect the vital security interests of Ukraine and Europe"", according to a joint declaration by the President of the European Commission and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Finland, and non-EU member United Kingdom. The title of the document specifies that it was adopted ahead of the planned meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests. We agree that these vital interests include the need for robust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the statement said, adding, ""The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.""

The leaders said ""they remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force,"" and added, ""The current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations.""

The Europeans expressed the view that the current line of contact in Ukraine should serve as the starting point for negotiations on territories. They once again welcomed Trump's diplomatic initiatives but expressed the view that efforts to end the conflict should combine active diplomacy, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia.

They pledged to support the work to end the conflict ""diplomatically"", as well as by ""maintaining significant military and financial support for Ukraine, including within the framework of the ‘Coalition of the Willing,'"" and by maintaining and introducing restrictive measures against Russia.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

A woman died and a man was trapped inside a vehicle after strong winds toppled a large tree and crushed car

Strong storms in eastern Nebraska early Saturday killed one person, seriously injured another in a state park and displaced hundreds of inmates after two prison housing units were damaged, officials said – as other midwest US states also braced for bad weather.

Meanwhile, more than 40 million Americans have been put on alert for dangerous heat and fire weather. In terms of fire weather, a blaze which prompted mandatory evacuations in two Colorado counties was of particular note.

With respect to the Nebraska storms, the Waterloo volunteer fire department was called to Two Rivers state park just before 7am Saturday, where first responders found a vehicle crushed by a large cottonwood tree. The tree had toppled as the storm brought gusts higher than 80mph (129 kph) to the area, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). A woman in the vehicle was declared dead at the scene, while a man was trapped inside, the fire department said in a news release.

It took firefighters about 90 minutes to free the man because of the size and weight of the tree, the department said. Once free, the man was taken to an Omaha hospital with life-threatening injuries, Waterloo fire chief Travis Harlow said.

The state park – a popular camping spot – is about 5 miles (8km) west of Omaha's western border.

High winds caused widespread damage across eastern Nebraska, toppling trees, damaging roofs and pulling down electrical lines. Thousands of people were left without power in the immediate aftermath.

In the state capital of Lincoln, the storms damaged two housing units at the Nebraska state penitentiary, displacing 387 prisoners, the state department of correctional services said in a statement.

“There are no reported injuries, and all staff and incarcerated individuals are safe and accounted for,” the agency said.

Strong storms also moved through parts of eastern Wisconsin on Saturday, bringing gusts of 60mph (97 kph) to the state's Door Peninsula, the National Weather Service said. Flood warnings were put in effect in Milwaukee, Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. And flash flooding forced the closure of parts of interstates 43, 41 and 94, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The outlet added that all runways except one at Milwaukee's Mitchell international airport were reported flooded at one point, along with most taxiways and an underpass tunnel.

The weather service said more strong storms were possible across the nation's midsection Saturday night into Sunday, stretching from western Colorado into Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, northern Missouri and into Illinois and Wisconsin.

Meanwhile, grappling with extreme heat advisories was a region including Albuquerque, New Mexico; El Paso and Dallas, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Wichita, Kansas; Springfield, Missouri; and Kansas City, Missouri, as ABC News reported. And the network noted that places in Oregon, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming were put on alert for fire conditions.

Notably, after the Lee wildfire in Colorado grew by nearly 30,000 acres, officials in Rio Blanco and Garfield counties ordered mandatory evacuations as flames raced south, according to the Denver Post.

The earth's ongoing climate crisis – fueled by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions – has been making extreme weather events more common, including strong storms, floods and wildfires.

Actually, no: Emma Thompson reveals Donald Trump asked her on a date","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/10/love-actually-no-emma-thompson-reveals-donald-trump-asked-her-on-a-date","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 15:55:00 GMT","

Actor said Trump phoned her to make the offer on the day her divorce from Kenneth Branagh was confirmed in 1998

Emma Thompson has accepted Academy Awards, Baftas and even a damehood over a glittering career, but there was one offer she had to turn down.

The actor says she once got asked out on a date by Donald Trump on the same day her divorced was confirmed.

Thompson said she was in her trailer filming Primary Colors in 1998, a political satire based on Bill Clinton's presidential rise, when the phone rang.

“It was Donald Trump,” Thompson told an audience at the Locarno film festival in Switzerland, where she received the Leopard Club award for career achievement.

“He said: ‘Hello, this is Donald Trump.' I thought it was a joke and asked: ‘How can I help you?' Maybe he needed directions from someone.

“Then he said: ‘I'd love you to come and stay at one of my beautiful places. Maybe we could have dinner.' I said: ‘Well, that's very sweet. Thank you so much. I'll get back to you.'”

At the time, Trump had just split from his second wife, Marla Maples. Thompson, meanwhile, had just finalised her divorce from Kenneth Branagh.

Only later did she twig the timing. “I realised my divorce decree had come through that day,” she said on Saturday. “I bet he's got people looking for a nice divorcee to take out on his arm.

“And he found the number in my trailer,” she joked. “I mean, that's stalking.”

Thompson, a lifelong Labour supporter who publicly backed Jeremy Corbyn's 2017 and 2019 election campaigns, is a high-profile environmental activist who has campaigned for refugee and women's rights.

She joked she could have altered geopolitics if she'd accepted Trump's offer. “I could have gone on a date with Donald Trump, and then I would have a story to tell,” she said. “I could have changed the course of American history.”

The talk at the festival also covered Thompson's film career and one of her most famous roles, in Richard Curtis' Christmas romcom, Love Actually. In the 2003 classic, Thompson plays Karen, whose marriage to Harry, played by Alan Rickman, comes under strain when Harry becomes tempted into an affair with his secretary.

Reflecting on the film's everlasting popularity, she said: “I mean, it's honestly a constant source of astonishment to me that that film lasted – not that I don't like the film. I like it very much, but it's weird.”

Discussing the movie and the moment Karen discovers her partner has been unfaithful, she said she believes its appeal “touched a nerve because [when] we get a heartbreak, especially women, we have to hide it because we don't want people to see it”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israeli PM's plan to escalate war has drawn international condemnation

See all our Middle East crisis coverage

Family of victims accuse government of rewarding Hamas with plan to recognise a Palestinian state

Ayelet Svatitzky, whose brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell were murdered, told demonstrators at the march in London that recognising the state of Palestine before the return of all of the hostages is a “prize” to Hamas.

Speaking close to Downing Street, she said: “This week I joined a meeting with the UK government to continue to press our case that the hostages must be freed before the UK government can recognise the state of Palestine.

“As I said to the government, to recognise the state without the return of all of the hostages is a prize to Hamas for the murder of my two brothers.”

The UN security council meeting on Gaza is still going on and there is a video feed at the top of this blog.

Associated Press reports that the US defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.
 The US has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.
 Other council members, and UN officials, expressed alarm. China called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities”.
 “This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,” said Ramesh Rajasingham with the UN humanitarian office told the AP. “Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.”

The UK's Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis has addressed the London march calling for the hostages' release and has attacked an announcement by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, that the country was set to recognise Palestine as a state next month.

Addressing the crowd close to Starmer's London residence in Downing Street, Mirvis said:

To our government we turn and we say ‘how would you ever be able to live with the fact that you would have recognised a Palestinian state, at the head of which is a terrorist organisation, with a stated intention of destroying the state of Israel and harming Jews right around the world and all this at a time when the hostages are still languishing in the tunnels of Gaza?

The Labour party, both in opposition and now in government has had a mantra, they have continuously been saying ‘don't judge us by our words, judge us by our deeds'.

And to our government we say right now this is the time for responsible action, it is not too late.”

He added: “We will continue to do whatever we can for the sake of each and every one of the hostages.”

A man has been arrested at the “national march for the hostages” in central London, the Metropolitan police have said.

The force said the individual, who was not part of the march, was held for common assault and a racially aggravated public order offence after the march briefly paused just past Charing Cross.

The march was ending with an assembly in Whitehall.

In the UK, a man has been carried away by police officers after a scuffle broke out close to the gates of Downing Street, the prime minister's London residence.

The man was seen throwing water over a demonstrator who was part of a protest calling for the release of the hostages (see post at 12.43BST). He then charged at him and a scuffle broke out as the man then put his hand around the demonstrator's neck.

Police officers then intervened and the man was seen being carried away.

Meanwhile, in Greece, pro-Palestinian protestors are braced to take to the streets in more than 100 locations nationwide, triggering a rare warning from the Israeli foreign ministry to tourists visiting the country.

Stop the war campaigners say the ‘day of rage' rallies have been organised in major urban centres, towns, villages and islands with the sole purpose of calling for an end “to the genocide in Gaza” and Benjamin Netanyahu's latest takeover plans.

Graffiti deploring Israel and its actions have proliferated in areas popular with tourists, starting with Plaka, the ancient Athenian neighbourhood of narrow alleys beneath the Acropolis.

“Wherever we are, in every village, every square, every island, every alley, on every street in every town and on every mountain we will call for justice for Palestine,” said a statement released by protest organisers ahead of this evening's demonstrations.

“We will not put up with those in our country and on our islands who support genocide, we will not tolerate genocide in our name. The whole world will learn that the Greek government is alone,” it added, castigating the centre- right administration of Kyriakos Mitsotakis for standing by the “murderous” Netanyahu.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry warned Israelis to “stay away from areas of demonstrations, avoid public debates and expressing political positions in public spaces, and minimize visible signs of identification (such as [Israeli] flags, shirts with Hebrew writing, IDF symbols.”

Fury over the war in Gaza has mounted in Greece putting diplomatic ties between the two countries under unexpected strain.

Last week, the Israeli ambassador to Greece Noam Katz lashed out at the mayor of Athens, Haris Doukas, for failing to clean up anti-Israel graffiti that was, he said “(making) Israeli tourists feel uncomfortable.”

Infuriated by his remarks, Doukas hit back saying:

We Greeks do not take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians and children standing in line for food, from those responsible for the daily deaths of dozens of Gazans from bombs, hunger and thirst.

James Kariuki, the UK's deputy permanent representative to the UN, called Israel's decision to take Gaza City over “wrong” and said it would displace nearly one million (more) Palestinians.

“Expanding military operations will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict. It will not secure the release of the hostages. It will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” Kariuki was quoted by Al Jazeera as having said.

“This inhumanity cannot be justified”, he said, referring to the continuing restrictions on aid imposed by Israel (and its recent total aid blockade which caused widespread starvation). “The partial aid access Israel granted in late July has proven woefully inadequate. We have a clear message for Israel. Urgently and permanently lift all restrictions on aid delivery.”

Let's give you some lines from today's UN security council meeting convened after Israel said its military would “take control” of Gaza City.

“If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction,” UN assistant secretary Miroslav Jenca told the UN security council.

Slovenia's ambassador to the UN Samuel Zbogar, speaking on behalf of the five European members of the security council (France, the UK, Slovenia, Greece and Denmark) ahead of the meeting, said “this decision by the Israeli government will do nothing to secure the return of the hostages and risk further endangering their lives”.

“It will also worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and risk further death and mass displacement of Palestinian civilians.”

Netanyahu says he wants to get all remaining hostages out alive and recover the remains of those who have died in Hamas captivity.

“If we don't do anything, we are not going to get them out,” Netanyahu said.

“The move I'm talking about has the possibility of getting them out,” he added, without elaborating on tactics but said there are “creative” approaches under consideration.

Protesters, including relatives of 50 hostages in Gaza, 20 of whom are reported to be alive, fear Netanyahu's Gaza City takeover plan puts the lives of hostages at risk.

Netanyahu says he has “directed” the Israeli military to bring in foreign journalists to Gaza, but stressed the importance of assuring the safety of reporters.

“The directive has been since two days ago,” he said, adding “I think you should see it (the Gaza Strip)”.

Netanyahu said:

One of the things you are going to see is precisely our efforts to bring in food to Gaza, you will see the trucks that have entered Gaza and are still waiting to be distributed.

You'll see Gazans who are fighting Hamas. We haven't seen it since the beginning of the war. And that is a reflection of the fact that they know we are approaching the end stage.

With international reporters barred by Israel from entering the strip, Palestinian journalists have been the only ones able to report from the ground in the war zone. More than 170 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 2023, with some estimates putting the toll as high as 206. It is the deadliest conflict for media workers in recent history.

Netanyahu is now taking questions from the media. He has been asked by a journalist for a timeline on when he expects to conclude the expansion of his new assault on the territory. Netanyahu does not put a date on it, but said it should be done “fairly quickly”.

“The timeline that we set for the action is fairly quickly. I mean we want to first of all enable safe zones to be established, facilities to be brought so that the civilian population in Gaza City can move out, as they moved out in Rafah.”

Netanyahu claims he wants to bring the war to an end as soon as possible.

Netanyahu says he is talking to the US about “additional measures” to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza (which is experiencing famine because of the Israeli aid blockade and ongoing restrictions).

The Israeli leader said that in the meantime:

What we are doing, as I said, is designate safe quarters, expand the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution points and they are trying to bring in more resources, hope to recruit some international organisations, maybe – god willing – the UN if they ever decide to actually do something for the Palestinian people that does not go through Hamas.

Netanyahu adds that he wants to increase airdrops into Gaza, though he says these are not the most important form of aid delivery (compared to “ground routes”).

Netanyahu says the only people who are being deliberately starved in Gaza are hostages, not Palestinian civilians.

He claims the media has distorted the facts on the ground around starvation by relying on Hamas' statistics and claims. Netanyahu points to images of “fake starving children”, including a cover photo from the New York Times.

Netanyahu turns to antisemitism, saying that “every massacre of the Jewish people was proceeded by massive vilification”.

Netanyahu says Hamas is refusing to lay down its weapons. “Given Hamas' refusal to lay down its arms, Israel has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas,” the Israeli prime minister tells journalists at the conference. He says about 70-75% of Gaza is under Israeli military control – but says there are two “remaining strongholds” where Hamas militants apparently are: Gaza City and the “central camps in Al Mawasi”.

Netanyahu further defends his government's plan to take over Gaza City, which has been widely condemned on the international stage, including by western allies, with the below comments:

Contrary to false claims this is the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily. We will do so by first enabling the civilian population to safely the leave combat areas to designated safe zones and these safe zones they will be given ample food, water and medical care, as we have done before.

And again contrary to false claims, our policy throughout the war has been to prevent a humanitarian crisis while Hamas' policy has been to create it.

Since the beginning of the war, Israel has let in close to two million tonnes of aid. I know of no other army that has enabled such aid to go to the civilian population in enemy territory. Now, if we had a starvation policy no one in Gaza would have survived after two years of war. But our policy has been the exact opposite.

Netanyahu says Israel's goal is not to occupy Gaza but to free it from “Hamas terrorists”. The Israel leader, who describes Hamas as a “genocidal organisation”, continued:

The war can end continue if Gaza, or rather, Hamas lays down its arms and releases all the remaining hostages.

Gaza will be demilitarised, Israel will have overriding security responsibility, a security zone will be established on Gaza's border with Israel to prevent future terrorist incursions, a civilian administration will be established in Gaza that will seek to live in peace with Israel.

That is our plan for the day after Hamas.

Netanyahu says Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists in Gaza and said the Palestinian militant group has vowed to repeat the “savagery of the attack” on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.

Netanyahu has started speaking. He said this press conference is an opportunity to “puncture the lies”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

11:40 JST, August 10, 2025

Aug 9 (Reuters) – From firing people to promoting jeans, calling for peace deals or the renaming of a sports team, President Donald Trump keeps a lot on his proverbial to-do list. Much of it is unrelated to running the country.

More than six months into his second term as U.S. commander-in-chief, Trump, a former New York businessman and reality television host, has applied a hands-on management style and producer-like attitude toward governing, relying largely on his own instincts for decisions large and small.

Using the tools of social media and a propensity for bullying, Trump personally wades into issues inside and outside the federal government to get his way. He harangues company executives to invest in America and uses trade deals as leverage over foreign leaders to end conflicts.

Last week he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over unproven allegations she falsified figures that he didn't like. This week he called for the head of Intel to step down over ties with China, and the company's stock fell.

In recent months he has pressed the Washington Commanders football team to change its name back to the Redskins, forced universities to pay huge amounts to the federal government, boosted retailer American Eagle Outfitters' shares with a compliment about a controversial jeans commercial featuring actor Sydney Sweeney and attempted to shore up Republican power by pushing for political redistricting in Texas.

Trump's style, which can confound both his friends and his foes, is dramatically different from his more traditional predecessors. It has earned him condemnation for being caustic and praise for being effective at getting what he wants.

“While he delves into topics that are certainly distractions relative to the big business of leading the world's greatest nation, it can also be said that past presidents have excessively deferred to the bureaucracy and failed to deliver the change their voters expected,” said Carlos Curbelo, a Republican former congressman from Florida.

“Trump views himself more as the CEO of the U.S.A. than as president,” Curbelo added. “It's good for decision making and challenging for the constitutional order which made our country the world's greatest economic and military force.”

Trump has taken on academia, the legal world, media companies, athletics, the federal bureaucracy and more, all while retooling the world economy with tariffs, cracking down on immigration flows, upending relations with allies and putting his stamp on American culture.

Though he has a team of advisers, the president frequently follows his own counsel, making policy decisions and then announcing them himself, ramifications aside.

“I think what a lot of people miss about Trump is he's the marketer-in-chief,” said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist with ties to the White House. “Not only is he his own best press secretary, he's also his own best chief-of-staff.”

Critics question why Trump gets bogged down in issues that are secondary to his goals of strengthening the U.S. economy, for example, or achieving a peace deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

“He's commenting one moment on … Putin and tariffs and all that's happening in the world and the next moment he's talking about, oh, Sydney Sweeney, and all these other issues that are completely unrelated to being president of the United States,” said Charlie Dent, a Republican former congressman from Pennsylvania. “He simply can't focus.”

The White House said Trump is using his skills to deliver on policy priorities. “President Trump's leadership style can be summed up plainly as decisive and commanding,” said White House spokesman Harrison Fields.

Trump also employs a talent to distract when facing difficulty. Though that super power has largely eluded him with the controversy over sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Department of Justice's refusal to release files related to the disgraced financier's case, Trump's broad ability to change the subject and dominate the news cycle has stupefied his opponents for years.

“His leadership style is much closer to that of an executive producer, and the executive producer who has a really big picture understanding of the audience,” said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.

“I think he trusts his instincts about the audience over anybody else, and that's why you see him oftentimes, you know, managing his own policy portfolio.”

Trump, though not a stickler for detail on all things policy-related, does get into the weeds on things he cares about, both cultural and political, including redecorating the Oval Office with gold, paving over the Rose Garden and building a new ballroom on the White House grounds.

On Tuesday, reporters bantered with the president while he walked on the roof of the White House press room, surveying the grounds for what he said were more ways to spend his money. The White House said Trump and other donors plan to pay for the $200 million ballroom project, which is slated to be finished before his second term concludes.

“I think narcissists do get bogged down in details because they think that everything is a reflection of them,” said Republican strategist Rina Shah. “When he decides to focus on the minutia, he's forgetting about the bigger picture. And that's kind of a disservice to the office.”

Where critics see such disservice, the White House sees results.

On the eve of presiding over a U.S.-brokered peace framework between Azerbaijan and Armenia this week, Trump took to social media to tout his involvement: “Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to ‘TRUMP.'”

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed that Kyiv would ""have to pay dearly"" due to what he  blamed was the West's failure to weaken Russia by using Ukraine, ahead of the scheduled Putin-Trump meeting on Aug. 15.

""Everyone already knows that the conflict has serious roots in recent history, that it has no military solution, everyone already knows that Ukraine's membership in NATO is impossible,"" Fico claimed on social media, as cited by Slovak media Dnes24. 

Fico used an African proverb of ""grass"" and ""elephants"" against Ukraine, saying that: ""No matter how the elephants' negotiations on Aug. 15 turn out, the grass will suffer - in this case, Ukraine."" 

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry immediately condemned Fico for being ""openly offensive rhetoric against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,"" and warned against using ""unfriendly folklore allegories.""

""This is frivolity that insults the memory of the dead, the suffering of millions of Ukrainian families, and the sacrifice of those fighting for freedom,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement published on its website on Aug. 10. 

The tensions between Ukraine and Slovakia, a member of the EU, come as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin plan to meet in Alaska for talks on ending the war in Ukraine on Aug. 15. 

CNN earlier reported that Ukraine's participation following the Putin-Trump meeting is not ruled out, but it is so far not named as among the participants of the Alaska summit. 

More than three years into the full-scale war, some European countries, including Slovakia and Hungary, have maintained  friendly ties with Moscow despite the criticism from Kyiv and other Western alies. 

Fico visited Moscow in December 2024 and has been fostering closer ties with Moscow.

A first-ever trilateral meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska could still be on the table, CNN reported on Aug. 10, citing its sources familiar with the matter. 

The report comes after Trump said that he would meet Putin on Aug. 15 in Alaska for talks on ending the war in Ukraine. 

CNN reported that while Zelensky was not named among the participants of the Alaska summit, the Trump administration has not ruled out some meetings involving Zelensky, according to its sources. 

One White House official told CNN that anything with Zelensky's involvement would likely be scheduled after Trump's meeting with Putin. 

Zelensky confirmed on Aug. 7 that the discussions were ongoing on a bilateral and trilateral summit, including the three leaders, to end the war. Moscow has confirmed the plans for a meeting between Putin and Trump in the near future, but has not mentioned Zelensky's involvement. 

A source in Ukraine's President's Office told the Kyiv Independent that Trump and Putin planned to discuss a peace plan, in which Ukraine would have to withdraw further from two territories partly occupied by Russian troops. 

The source, who was part of the team briefed on the discussion Putin had with Witkoff, said that the plan would see Kyiv withdraw its troops from two of the partly occupied Ukrainian regions — Donetsk and Luhansk. 

The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic, said Ukraine would outright reject the plan. 

The Putin-Trump meeting is planned a week after Trump's ultimatum on Moscow expired, in which he threatened sweeping secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia if no ceasefire is agreed by then.

While front-line units stretched thin, politicians dodge responsibility for an increasingly unpopular draft

As Ukraine struggles to replenish front-line units after 42 months of all-out war, those in power prefer to avoid publicly commenting on mobilization efforts and the way it is conducted.

Political experts say mobilization became a ""toxic"" and politicized issue, with high-ranking officials — from the president to ministers and lawmakers — trying to avoid being associated with the cause.

""In my opinion, most politicians are afraid to raise this topic because it is controversial,"" political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told the Kyiv Independent.

Following the initial spike in the number of volunteers joining the Armed Forces, Kyiv has mostly turned to conscription.

Ukraine is mobilizing about 30,000 people per month, but only a third of them are fit to fight, a senior Ukrainian official told the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity. President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly said that Ukraine's army is roughly 1 million strong, but Ukrainian military analyst Serhiy Hrabskyi estimated that it needs three times more to be able to rotate battle-torn units out into the rears. Many guys brought into the war often struggle physically and mentally.

""The guys know that their service is until the end of the war, or their life,"" Dmytro, an infantryman with the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine, told the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine's mobilization efforts come as Russia continues to slowly advance across the front, relying on its vast manpower advantage and what often feels like endless resources, including an upper hand in drone warfare. The Ukrainian manpower shortage leaves the army prone to leaving weak spots on the front for the Russian troops to exploit.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi listed mobilization measures as among the key objectives to defend the country against Russia, especially as Moscow accumulates more force.

Syrskyi said on Aug. 5 that Russia is mobilizing more troops than it is losing, growing its forces by 9,000 a month despite losing over 33,000 troops in July alone. While Ukraine has not released its casualty rate, military experts say the current mobilization pace is not filling the gaps left behind by battlefield losses — leading to situations where soldiers have to be sometimes deployed a month or two to the ""zero"" line without the possibility of rotation.

The West has pushed Kyiv to boost mobilization efforts to better hold off Russia's ongoing offensive, with some allies, according to Zelensky, refraining from imposing new sanctions on Russia partly because Kyiv is refusing to lower the mobilization age from 25  to 18.

Ukraine has so far kept the mobilization age from 25 to 60, after lowering it from 27 in 2024.

Of the roughly 30,000 that Kyiv says it is mobilizing, about half of them are the soldiers who are returning from AWOL, or absent without leave, according to a Ukrainian official familiar with the matter.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the topic's sensitivity, said that the remaining 40 percent are from the enlistment offices, while the remaining 10 percent came from foreign volunteer recruitment and the new one-year voluntary military contract for 18-24-year-olds.

Zelensky's last major announcement regarding mobilization was the introduction of the ""special contracts"" for young draft-exempt Ukrainians, trying to lure them with high financial and social benefits. Zelensky expanded the contract program for 18-24-year-olds in July, adding the option for them to join drone units.

Mobilization appears to be an uncomfortable topic for Zelensky as well, according to Yuriy Honcharenko, head of the InfoLight.UA research and analytical group.

""Unpopular decisions that need to be made in order to fix the situation may lead to a drop in the popularity of those who will make them, perhaps even the loss of some kind of future political prospects,"" Honcharenko told the Kyiv Independent.

After the program to lure young recruits likely fell short of expectations, it appeared that Zelensky ""no longer wants to be directly associated with mobilization,"" Honcharenko alleges.

Zelensky's last publicized meeting with Defense Minister Rustum Umerov that focused on mobilization was in November 2023, during which he instructed Umerov and the then Commander-in-Chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, to present a new mobilization plan.

Almost two years since then, the president made only a handful of comments about mobilization.

Political analyst Fesenko argued that mobilization is a complicated issue, especially for draft-eligible men and their families, who don't want their relatives to serve in the army. Some politicians, Fesenko said, see them as potential voters, and they try, at least partially, to act in their interests, criticizing forced mobilization methods.

Fesenko believes that it won't actually have much of an impact on post-war elections, as new issues will arise by then, and politicians' stance toward mobilization will play a small role.

Following amendments to the mobilization law adopted in April 2024, a survey by research agency Info Sapiens showed that 21 percent of Ukrainians perceive mobilization as positive, while 22 percent are neutral, and 44 percent had either an absolutely negative or rather negative view.


""Let's first preserve our statehood, and then we will worry who will become the president and who will head the next parliament.""
    

Ruslan Gorbenko, a lawmaker from the ruling Servant of the People, admitted that ""a certain percentage of politicians"" are working in their interests to be elected in the upcoming elections, rather than in the country's interests.

Gorbenko added that others are trying to avoid the topic, worried that drastic measures such as reforming the draft office or lowering the draft age would hurt them in the long run.

Political and military experts who spoke to the Kyiv Independent said that mobilization has been ""politicized"" since 2023, when the number of volunteers decreased while the need for new soldiers had increased. After the failed summer counteroffensive, it also became clear that it would be a long war, and joining the army wouldn't be a short-term endeavor.

The experts agreed that the topic's sensitivity has slowed down the crucial decision-making process regarding mobilization.

What analyst Honcharenko worries about above all is the polarization of society, fueled by the military enlistment officers' attempts to conscript more men. The drafters are often accused of ignoring fundamental civil rights, such as taking away conscripts' cell phones and forcing them into a bus, which led to a recent protest in the central city of Vinnytsia. The police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and to prevent the protesters from getting into a detention facility.

Honcharenko believes that the tensions would rise as the situation on the front becomes tougher and mobilization remains a ""politicized"" topic. He stressed that the Defense Ministry should have more autonomy in organizing and coordinating mobilization, and be more open about how it is conducted.

Honcharenko also hopes that politicians will take responsibility and improve the draft process.

""Let's first preserve our statehood, and then we will worry who will become the president and who will head the next parliament,"" Honcharenko said.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka saved 12 break points to survive her Cincinnati opener against Czech Marketa Vondrousova 7-5 6-1 on Saturday, as the men's defending champion Jannik Sinner cruised past Colombian qualifier Daniel Galan 6-1 6-1.

Sabalenka, who had a first-round bye, had not played since her semi-final defeat at Wimbledon and said the downtime served her well as she mounted a tremendous defensive effort to set up a meeting with Briton Emma Raducanu.

“I played so many matches this season so I'm quite experienced to handle those key moments,” Sabalenka told Tennis Channel. “Key for me is always to go for it without doubting my decisions. So far it's been working really well.”

Raducanu made easy work of Serbian Olga Danilovic 6-3 6-2 in her first match under new coach Francisco Roig, after a handful of confidence-building performances this summer that included a trip to the semi-finals at the Washington Open.

“I'm really building some momentum. I'm really happy with how I've stayed pretty consistent over the last few months,” said Raducanu, who lost to Sabalenka in a third-round thriller at Wimbledon this year.

“I still feel like there's a long way to go but just working hard behind the scenes, putting a lot of hours in and hoping I can trust in that.”

Italy's Sinner, who also took a break following his Wimbledon win, was in pristine form as he produced just four unforced errors to swat aside Galan in 59 minutes earlier in the day.

He will next play Canadian Gabriel Diallo.

“It's very difficult to play here, I feel like the ball is flying, it's very fast,” said Sinner.

“So when you lose confidence with a couple of shots, it makes it very, very difficult to play.”

Poland's third seed Iga Swiatek was back on top form after an early exit in Montreal as she sprinted through the first set and fended off four break points in the second to beat Anastasia Potapova comfortably 6-1 6-4.

She next plays Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk, who she has defeated in all three previous meetings, in the third round of the U.S. Open tune-up tournament.

Australian Open winner Madison Keys had a tougher opening to her Cincinnati campaign, saving two match points to survive against German Eva Lys with a 1-6 6-3 7-6(1) win to punch her ticket to the third round where she will play Japan's Aoi Ito.

“I just kept trying to listen to everyone here cheering me,” said American Keys, who triumphed in 2019 and clinched Saturday's affair with an unreturnable forehand. “It helped me get back into the match and across the finish line.”

Earlier on Saturday, Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech upset Norwegian 11th seed Casper Ruud 6-7(5) 6-4 6-2, while eighth-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti lost to France's Benjamin Bonzi 5-7 6-4 7-6(4).

Fourth seed Taylor Fritz sent over a dozen aces to close out the day's programme on Center Court with a routine 6-4 6-4 win over American compatriot Emilio Nava and book a meeting with Italian Lorenzo Sonego. (Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Ken Ferris and Christian Schmollinger)

The Lebanese troops were dismantling the Iran-backed group's weapons facility near the Israeli border when the explosion occurred. Beirut is under pressure to disarm Hezbollah under a ceasefire deal signed in November.

Six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Saturday as they were inspecting a weapons depot belonging to the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in the southern city of Tyre, the army said.

The depot was reportedly part of Hezbollah's military infrastructure, which the Lebanese army has been dismantling in cooperation with a United Nations team as part of a ceasefire agreement with Israel.

A statement from Lebanon's army said the soldiers were killed ""while an army unit was inspecting a weapons depot and dismantling its contents in Wadi Zibqin,"" in the Tyre district near the Israeli border.

Investigations were underway to determine the cause of the blast, it added.

A military source, requesting anonymity, told the AFP news agency the blast took place ""inside a Hezbollah military facility.""

Troops were ""removing munitions and unexploded ordnance left over from the recent war"" between Israel and Hezbollah when the blast occurred, the source added.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun described the explosion as a ""painful incident,"" while Prime Minister Nawaf Salam paid tribute on X to the troops who were killed ""while performing their national duty.""

Lebanon has been caught in the middle of a side conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that began after the October 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which sparked the Gaza war. 

Israel and Hezbollah exchanged regular fire and attacks across the shared Lebanon-Israeli border for several months.

Hezbollah suffered major losses with over 5,000 fighters killed, along with senior commanders, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Nasrallah was assassinated last September in an Israeli airstrike on Hezbollah's headquarters in a suburb of Beirut.

The smaller conflict was ended by a US-brokered ceasefire in November, under which Lebanon agreed to confiscate all ""unauthorized"" weapons in the country.

In return, Israel said it would stop offensive operations against Lebanese targets.

The Lebanese government met this week to order the army to develop a plan to disarm Hezbollah before the end of the year.

The Iran-backed group has pushed back against the move. Naim Kassem, Hezbollah's current leader, has rejected calls to disarm, calling them ""US dictates"" and a threat to Lebanon's sovereignty.

Hezbollah plays a special role in Lebanon as both a major political party and a heavily armed group that's stronger than the national army. This gives it huge influence over the country's government and security.

Iran supports Hezbollah financially and militarily, along with Hamas and Yemen's Houthis, to expand its regional power and as a counterweight to Israel and the US in the Middle East.

An adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said Saturday that Tehran is opposed to Hezbollah's disarmament, according to Iran's pro-government Tasnim news agency. 

Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Israel and several other countries, whereas the EU only recognizes Hezbollah's armed wing as a a terrorist group.

Ken Paxton has been embroiled in so many scandals that his political enemies say there are too many to choose from.

The Texas attorney general, a conservative firebrand, has been hit by allegations of everything from fraud to adultery to corruption in his two-decade-long career.

Now he is locked in a bitter fight with Senator John Cornyn to become the state's next Republican senator, in what commentators have called the “nastiest, most aggressive, most personal” primary in living memory.

“It's just ridiculous, unethical behaviour. There's almost nothing similar to it, certainly in the modern Texas political era,” a state Republican source told The Telegraph.

Incredibly, none of the drama has blunted Mr Paxton's political rise over the years.

An investigation by federal authorities into securities fraud was quietly dropped without charges being brought last year, and a 2023 impeachment trial in the Texas Senate into alleged corruption ended with him being acquitted.

Mr Cornyn, the incumbent Republican senator of more than 20 years, is in the fight of his life with the primary challenge from the attorney general.

The 73-year-old appears popular among colleagues in Washington, but polling from Texas shows he is badly lagging behind his rival, who has painted him as an establishment, “anti-Maga” politician.

Despite taking an early lead in the contest, Washington Republicans are not convinced Mr Paxton can win a general election in Texas, which Democrats are eyeing as a potential gain in next year's mid-terms.

The stand-off between the two Republicans also poses a serious headache for Donald Trump, who will be eyeing his party's narrow Senate majority and considering whether to endorse one of the candidates.

But if so, which one? Will it be Mr Cornyn, a proven election-winner whose appeal to the Republican base has been thrown into doubt, or Mr Paxton, a Maga hardliner with a list of alleged scandals as long as his arm?

Both have been vocal in their support for Mr Trump's push to redraw Texas' congressional districts to keep Republicans in control of the House of Representatives in next year's mid-terms.

After Democrat politicians fled the state to block a vote on the proposal, Mr Paxton took a hard line, vowing they would be “swiftly arrested, punished, and face the full force of the law”.

Not to be outdone, Mr Cornyn asked the FBI to locate and return the Democrats, accusing them of “potential criminal acts in their rush to avoid their constitutional responsibilities”. He claims Kash Patel, the bureau chief, has agreed to help.

The primary contest is still in its early stages, and the Cornyn campaign believes the next few months will be critical in shifting public perception of Mr Paxton from a Republican bruiser to an untrustworthy “conman”, with a secret woke streak.

Texas Southern University gave the attorney general a nine-point lead in the state in May, while the RealClearPolitics polling average from the same month put this at almost 15 per cent.

But Mr Cornyn's campaign believes Mr Paxton's controversies have not cut through with the general public.

Working on the theory that occasional news reports do not hold much weight for the average voter, Mr Cornyn's campaign strategy is to hammer his opponent over his alleged indiscretions.

Insiders think that Mr Paxton will crumble under the pressure of the electorate being confronted with a comprehensive list of decades of alleged wrongdoings.

In a Trump-esque move, the senator's team has labelled Mr Paxton “Crooked Ken”, setting up a website devoted to his chequered personal and political life.

“We have not seen an opponent run saturation level state-wide paid media against Paxton that's harsh and negative,” a Cornyn campaign source said. “There's a presumption that because a lot of stuff's been in the news, a lot of people know a decent amount about him. But that's simply not the case.”

They added: “He's got so many controversies… it's almost too much. We're having to select between lots of different things. You can pursue too many messages – you have to be able to burn a message through so people really hear it and internalise it.”

In 2018, Mr Paxton was alleged to have started an affair with Laura Olson, at that time an aide in the Texas Senate.

The story resurfaced in July, in awkward timing for the attorney general, when Mr Paxton's wife of 38 years filed for divorce on “biblical grounds”.

Angela Paxton, herself a Texas state senator, said she had decided to end their relationship “in light of recent discoveries”, and state news outlets reported she accused her husband of adultery in a divorce filing.

Mr Paxton characterised the split as a mutual decision prompted by “the pressures of countless political attacks and public scrutiny”.

The alleged affair was a central part of the three-term attorney general's impeachment trial in the Texas Senate in 2023. Mrs Paxton was disqualified from voting in her husband's trial but was watching on from the gallery.

Mr Paxton was also accused of exploiting his office to harass rivals of a real estate developer called Nate Paul.

In exchange, Mr Paul allegedly gave Ms Olson a job at his company and paid for renovations to the Paxton home.

The attorney general, who consistently denied wrongdoing, was later acquitted of 16 counts of impeachment.

Mr Paxton was also indicted on fraud charges in 2015 in a long-running legal saga that once looked like it could cut off his rising political star.

As a Republican state legislator, he was accused of duping investors to invest in a tech startup without disclosing that he was being compensated to bring them on board. It ended last year without charges being brought, although he agreed to pay $300,000 in restitution.

The “Crooked Ken” website claims Mr Paxton, sometimes hailed as the most conservative attorney general in America, is funding “woke with your tax dollars” and hiring lawyers with ties to Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.

The Paxton team, sitting on a comfortable lead in the contest, believes their candidate has the same “teflon” quality as the president, who has had his fair share of controversies.

The attorney general has painted his opponent as a member of the Washington establishment, claiming Mr Cornyn is “anti-Maga” and not a true conservative.

And he has run adverts claiming Mr Cornyn “turned his back” on Mr Trump, re-airing an old interview in which the senator said he thought Republicans should find an alternative candidate for the 2024 election.

For years, John Cornyn has betrayed President Trump and the America First movement. Texas deserves better, and that's why I'm running for U.S. Senate.Join me in the fight: https://t.co/rQl0P2UnWU pic.twitter.com/WP1g8vbXi0

The result is what Matt Mackowiak, a veteran Texas political operative, said earlier this year would be the “most expensive, nastiest, most aggressive, most personal US Senate primary” in the state's history.

“[Mr Cornyn] just can't beat Ken on ideology, so you've got to try and tear him down. But people just don't care anymore,” a Paxton adviser said.

The rivalry between the two men, locked in a bitter and hard-fought fight for political survival, has penetrated deep into their teams.

Chris LaCivita, Mr Trump's former co-campaign manager and an experienced Republican strategist, is working for the Cornyn campaign.

He appears to have a sincere dislike for Jeff Roe, whose firm, Axiom Strategies, is running the Paxton campaign.

Their rumoured bad blood could date back to the pair being pitted against each other in the battle for the presidential nomination last year.

As the candidates fling out attacks, they may also be damaging their party's hold on the Lone Star State's Senate seat. It was recently downgraded from a “hold” to “likely Republican” by the non-partisan Cook Political Report.

The Republican establishment has sided with Mr Cornyn, and the party's leader in the Senate, John Thune, has personally appealed to Mr Trump to intervene in the contest.

Some fear the fight could syphon funds from election battlegrounds and cost the party as much as $100m, according to CNN.

Mr Paxton is seen as the more polarising figure who would have a tougher time fending off a Democrat challenger, even though supporters point out he has never lost a state-wide race.

But Mr Cornyn has admitted he needs to start closing the gap in the polls before he has a chance of securing the president's support.

“Trump's endorsement is the most powerful endorsement in the modern history of the Republican party,” the campaign source continued. “We've just never seen anything like it.”

Others believe Mr Trump is planning to stay out of the race altogether.

Barring a “Hail Mary” intervention from the president, both camps are in for months' worth of trench warfare before the primary vote in March.

If anyone can shake loose Mr Cornyn's grip on a Senate seat he has held for more than 20 years, that candidate is Ken Paxton. And if Mr Paxton's scandals are ever going to catch up with him, it's now.

            Soccer superstar Mohamed Salah called out European football's governing body on Saturday for its limited statement after Palestinian footballer Suleiman Al-Obeid was killed in Gaza.
    


            The Egyptian Liverpool forward, the highest-profile Arab player in the game, pointedly noted that the post by UEFA made no reference to the circumstances of Al-Obeid's death.
    


            Al-Obeid, who during his playing days was part of the Palestinian national team, was killed by an Israeli strike targeting civilians waiting for aid in southern Gaza, according to the Palestine Football Association (PFA).
    


            “Farewell to Suleiman al-Obeid, the ‘Palestinian Pelé'. A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times,” wrote UEFA in a post on X.
    


            Salah responded to the post on Saturday: “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?” His remark quickly gained traction online, with more than 840,000 likes by Saturday night.
    


            UEFA has not publicly commented further. CNN has contacted the Switzerland-based body for comment.
    


            Later on Saturday, the PFA shared a statement ﻿in Arabic that it said was sent from UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, expressing his condolences for Al-Obeid's death.
    


            Al-Obeid showed that “joy, talent, and pride can blossom despite suffering,” said the statement attributed to Ceferin. “His talent and dedication of the game gave the children of Gaza and beyond hope in a brighter tomorrow.”
    


Liverpool and Egypt star Mo Salah calls for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza ‘immediately'



            Al-Obeid was born in Gaza City and was 41 years old when he was killed, according to the PFA. He had scored more than 100 goals throughout his long career, it said.
    


            Salah, a four-time Premier League top-goalscorer, is one of the highest-profile footballers to speak out against the war in Gaza. He has previously called for humanitarian aid to be allowed into the enclave “immediately,” for world leaders to help end the fighting, and for the “massacres” to stop.
    


            According to the PFA, 325 members of its football community have been killed since the war began on October 7, 2023 – including players, managers, referees, coaches and other staff.
    


            The United Nations says more than 1,300 people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking food since late May, when a controversial new Israel- and US-backed aid group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, began operating. Of those, more than 800 have been killed near GHF sites, according to the UN.
    


            Currently 75% of all United Nations members recognize a sovereign Palestinian state, with more countries - including Britain, France and Canada - recently announcing plans to do the same. At the UN, Palestine is currently a non-member observer state of the UN General Assembly as the United States has consistently blocked full UN membership.
    


            As a football team though, Palestine has been recognized by the sport's world governing body FIFA since 1998. They have played in the last three Asian Cup tournaments, but have yet to qualify for the World Cup.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — CeeDee Lamb took a big hit and committed a penalty in the Dallas Cowboys' preseason opener — even though the star receiver wasn't playing.

A sprinting official ran straight into Lamb's back when the four-time Pro Bowl wideout wandered too close to the field during the second quarter of the Cowboys' 31-21 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday night, resulting in a 15-yard penalty to Dallas for making contact with an official.

Dressed in street clothes, Lamb was watching Joe Milton's deep pass to Jonathan Mingo and signaling to his teammates while standing in the white paint on the edge of the sideline. The official was tracking the play while he ran, and he didn't see Lamb before inadvertently delivering a big hit to Lamb's back, sending both men tumbling to the SoFi Stadium turf.

“It's a sideline interference,” referee Alex Moore told a pool reporter. “CeeDee Lamb was standing in the restricted white border area, which is our area to officiate the game. The official on the play was focused solely on doing his job and he ran into CeeDee Lamb, who was standing in that restricted area. That's what happened. And with that contact, it's an automatic foul.”

Lamb got up with no apparent ill effects, laughing about the collision with his teammates. Dallas was still whistled for the penalty, which took 15 yards off the Cowboys' 51-yard gain on Los Angeles defensive back Shaun Jolly's simultaneous pass interference on Mingo.

“Normally we don't have anybody standing that deep into the restricted area, or that type of forceful contact,” Moore said. “So it is a rare occurrence, but it does happen from time to time.”




Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer wasn't thrilled about Lamb's mistake, even though he knew it was an accident.

“Just like the pre-snap penalties, that penalty, we've got to be better with discipline,” Schottenheimer said. “I hope the guy's OK. I think he's OK, the official that he ran into, but we have to be better than that. CeeDee knows better. We know better.”

Lamb, Dak Prescott, George Pickens and most of the Cowboys' key players didn't participate in the preseason opener, nor did nearly all of the Rams' presumptive starters.

ATLANTA (AP) — Jen Pawol felt love and support from fans, family, peers and players as she made history as the first female umpire to work a regular-season game in the major leagues.

“It was amazing when we took the field,” Pawol said. “It seemed like quite a few people were clapping and calling my name. That was pretty intense and emotional.”

Pawol's much-anticipated debut came as the first base umpire for Saturday's first game of a split doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. It was a smooth debut.

“She did a good job,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “You can tell she knows what she does.”

Pawol said she had a group of about 30 friends and family members, including her father, at the game and she immediately identified a major difference of working in a major league stadium. Those familiar faces were not so easy to find at Truist Park.

“When I looked up they weren't in the lower tier like in the minor leagues,” Pawol said. “When I looked up it took me a while. Whoa, they're up there! I'll never forget that. That was just awesome.

“The dream actually came true today. I'm still living in it. I'm so grateful to my family and Major League Baseball for creating such an incredible work environment. … I'm just so thankful.”

Pawol's first real test came in the third inning of Atlanta's 7-1 win when she called Braves catcher Sean Murphy safe on a close play. Marlins manager Clayton McCullough did not challenge the call.




Pawol also showed she will make animated calls. When Miami's Xavier Edwards grounded into a double play in the third inning, Pawol pumped her fist and lifted her leg when she called Edwards out.

Pawol couldn't help but notice her debut was being watched closely. Fans responded with a warm ovation when the video board focused on the umpire between innings, forcing her to take a quick glance at her image.

Pawol worked third base in the second game of the doubleheader. She will be in the spotlight when she calls pitches behind the plate in Sunday's final game of the series. As a rover, she'll then be waiting for her next assignment.

While she waits, the umpire cap she wore in her first game will be on the way to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

“This is one of the proudest moments in all my career,” crew chief Chris Guccione said. “I've been blessed with working playoffs, I've worked two World Series, All-Star games, and this is right up there. It gives me chills even thinking about it. And the magnitude, it just hit me just now the magnitude of this thing and how hard she's worked.

“This is just a great role model for girls and women out there and I'm just so proud of her. This is a special moment. I'm so proud of her.”

There was much anticipation for her historic debut on Saturday. A crowd of photographers gathered while waiting for the umpires to walk onto the field from their entry ramp near the Marlins dugout.

McCullough and Braves bench coach Walt Weiss greeted Pawol when lineups were exchanged at home plate before the game. Pawol then jogged down the first base line. She shook hands with Marlins first base coach Tyler Smarslok before taking her position on the right field line for the first pitch.

Pawol said Thursday she was “overcome with emotion” when notified she would make her Major League Baseball debut this weekend.

Pawol, 48, has been working in the minor leagues since she was assigned to the Gulf Coast League in 2016. She was assigned the Triple-A championship game in 2023 and worked spring training games in 2024 and again this year.

“Anytime anybody grinds their way through the minor leagues, I don't care who it is, that's a tough thing,” Snitker said. “I'm happy for anybody who grinds it out.”

Asked if she is prepared for a confrontation with a manager upset about a call, including some known to kick dirt onto umpires, Pawol said it wouldn't be the first time.

“More than dozens of times,” she said. “It doesn't go very well for him. The night is usually over for him. It's just part of the game.”

Pawol, who is from New Jersey, had only a few days to prepare for Saturday's doubleheader. She said she was told of her long-awaited promotion during a Wednesday conference call with director of umpire development Rich Rieker and vice president of umpire operations Matt McKendry.

Pawol was a three-time all-conference softball selection pick at Hofstra. She worked as an NCAA softball umpire from 2010-16.




Pawol's rise to make MLB history came 28 years after the NBA gender barrier for game officials was broken and 10 years after the NFL hired its first full-time female official. The men's soccer World Cup first hired a female referee three years ago. The NHL has not had any women as on-ice officials.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Taliban are investigating explicit death threats against dozens of Afghan women working for the United Nations, according to a report published Sunday.

In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, the U.N. mission to the country said that dozens of female national staff were subjected to explicit death threats in May. 

The threats come against a backdrop of severe restrictions placed on women since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021. 

The U.N. report said the threats came from unidentified individuals related to their work with the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, other agencies, funds, and programs, “requiring the U.N. to implement interim measures to protect their safety.”

It said that the Taliban told the U.N. mission that their personnel were not responsible for the threats. An Interior Ministry investigation is underway, the report added.

The Interior Ministry spokesman, Abdul Mateen Qani, said no such threats had been made.

“This is completely incorrect,” Qani said. “The ministry has an independent department for this, and we have a strategic plan for protection and security so there is no threat to them in any area, nor can anyone threaten them, nor is there any threat to them.”

Qani did not answer questions about an investigation.

The Taliban barred Afghan women from working at domestic and foreign nongovernmental organizations in December 2022, extending this ban to the U.N. six months later, and then threatening to shut down agencies and groups still employing women. Some women have nonetheless stayed on in key sectors, such as health care and urgent humanitarian assistance, where aid agencies say the needs are great.




Humanitarian agencies say the Taliban have hampered or interfered with their operations, allegations denied by authorities.

The U.N. report is the first official confirmation of death threats against Afghan women working in the sector. The report also highlighted other areas affecting women's personal freedoms and safety.

In Herat, inspectors from the Vice and Virtue Ministry began requiring women to wear a chador, a full-body cloak covering the head. Dozens of women deemed “not in compliance” were barred from entering markets or using public transportation. Several women were detained until relatives brought them a chador, the report said. 

In Uruzgan, women were arrested for wearing a hijab — a headscarf — rather than a burqa covering the entire body and face.

Women have also been denied access to public areas, in line with laws banning them from such spaces. In Ghor province, police forced several families to leave a recreational area. They warned the families against visiting outdoor picnic sites with women. 

In Herat, Vice and Virtue inspectors stopped family groups with women and girls from accessing an open recreational area, only allowing all-male groups.

Nobody from the Vice and Virtue Ministry was immediately available to comment on the Ghor, Herat and Uruzgan incidents, which the U.N. said happened in May.

In Kandahar, the Public Health Department instructed female health care workers to be accompanied to work by male guardians with an identification card proving that they were related to the woman by blood or marriage. 

It wasn't immediately clear if the card is specific to Kandahar or will be rolled out across Afghanistan.

“The process to apply for a mahram (male guardian) identification card is reportedly cumbersome and can take up to several weeks as it requires the de facto Department for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice and a member of the local community (e.g. malik, imam or village elder) to verify the relationship,” the U.N. report said.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A U.S. tourist who was visiting Puerto Rico for Bad Bunny's residency was fatally shot early Sunday at La Perla, a popular seaside shantytown, police said.

The victim was identified as Kevin Mares, a 25-year-old who lived in New York, according to a police statement.

The shooting happened in the predawn hours at a nightspot called “Shelter for Mistreated Men” in La Perla, a coastal community that has struggled to shed its dark reputation.

Homicide detective Sgt. Arnaldo Ruiz said in a phone interview that the shooting took place when several people near Mares began arguing and one pulled out a gun and shot at least three people, including Mares. Two other men who live in La Perla were injured and remain hospitalized.

Ruiz said Mares was an innocent bystander. He was with three other friends who told police they were in Puerto Rico for one of Bad Bunny's 30 concerts, which have attracted tens of thousands of visitors to the U.S. territory.

Mares was shot on the left side of his abdomen and was taken to Puerto Rico's largest public hospital, where he died, authorities said.

Ruiz said police don't yet know what the people were arguing about and don't have a description of the shooter. “We have very little information,” he said.

Ruiz added that Mares' three friends also were from New York. He didn't have their hometowns.

La Perla is located on the outskirts of a historic district popular with tourists known as Old San Juan. A couple hundred people live in the shantytown, which once served as Puerto Rico's biggest distribution point for heroin and was known for its violence.




Police used to avoid the community, which used to have a sign proclaiming, “Not open to visitors. Do not enter.”

But violence eased when hundreds of federal agents raided the slum in 2011 and arrested dozens of people, including a well-known community leader who was later convicted.

The neighborhood became even safer and more welcoming after Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featured it in their hit, “Despacito.”

But isolated, violent incidents persist.

In February 2023, three tourists were stabbed after police said a person told them to stop filming inside the community.

Then in April 2024, a 24-year-old tourist from Delaware was killed and his body set on fire after police said he and a friend were attacked following a drug purchase. Police said the victims were trying to take pictures of La Perla after being warned not to do so.

The island of 3.2 million people has reported 277 killings so far this year, compared with 325 killings in the same period last year.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Frederick Richard is taking the fight to make men's gymnastics matter to a new front: his wardrobe.

The charismatic 21-year-old Olympic bronze medalist switched out the stirrup pants that have long been a staple of the men's uniform for shorts with compression leggings at the U.S. Championships this weekend, firm in his belief that the three-tenths (0.3) deduction he receives every day of competition that he breaks the rules is worth it if it makes his sport more accessible.

Even when those tenths add up. Richard edged Fuzzy Benas by less than a quarter of a point for second place behind two-time national champion Asher Hong. If Richard had worn the traditional uniform, his margin over Benas could have been a little more comfortable. 

Yet asked if the statement he is trying to make — that it's time for men's gymnastics to modernize its uniforms — is worth the risk to his potential placement during a given meet, he didn't hesitate.

“It's 1,000% worth it,” Richard said. “If you look at these kids in the crowd, I'm thinking about them and I'm thinking about when I was younger.”




While Richard quickly fell in love with gymnastics as a kid growing up in the Boston area, the stirrup pants worn by the guys on pommel horse, still rings, parallel bars, and high bar were another matter.

“If I left the gym to go to the gas station, I didn't want anybody to see me in my pommel horse pants,” Richard said. “Kids would say, ‘Do you do gymnastics?' I'd say ‘Yeah.' But I didn't want them to search ‘gymnast' and see the uniform. I didn't feel like it was cool.”

His solution was to design an alternative. With the help of the apparel company Turn, Richard debuted the look earlier this year and “refined” it ahead of nationals. 

During the opening night of competition on Thursday, the rising Michigan junior wore maize-and-blue colored zebra-patterned leggings with (almost) matching blue shorts. On Saturday, Richard swapped the maize and blue for gray.

Both times, there was a “ND -0.3” next to Richard's score on the first event in which the traditional pants were required. Yet Richard wasn't as focused on the ribbon board where his score was posted, but on the young boys in the stands below them.

“(I want them to) see this, and they're like, ‘This is cool. I want to wear this. This kid is trying to make the sport cool, he looks cool,'” Richard said. “And that's the stuff that gets kids into the sport, that's stuff that keeps kids in the sport.”

Even if it's a largely American conversation. 

While the popularity of men's gymnastics in the U.S. has declined for decades (though there is optimism that the bronze medal Richard and his teammates captured at the 2024 Olympics could help stem the tide), there are no such issues overseas.

They're not talking about stirrup pants in China. Or Japan. Or Russia. Places with dominant programs whose stars become champions and national heroes in the process.

The challenges men's gymnastics faces in the U.S. are many. The number of Division I programs that offer it as a scholarship sport is a fraction of what it was decades ago. And the impact of the recent House settlement could make opportunities at a level that has long served as a feeder system to the U.S. national team even scarcer.

At the Olympic level, the men have long competed in the shadow of the star-studded (and highly successful) women's program.

Richard has long understood this. He's seen the attrition firsthand. While the uniform didn't stop him from pressing on, he believes he might be the exception, not the rule.

Countless young boys dabble in multiple sports growing up, gymnastics included. Richard thinks tweaking the uniform requirements into something he considers more modern could remove what he thinks might be a roadblock to sticking with it for some.

“It does add to what makes a 12-year-old boy decide, 'Do I want to keep doing this sport? Or should I play football or soccer, because my friends think I'm cool when I play with them?” he said.

The rules do allow for a little latitude. Some German female gymnasts opted for full-body unitards at each of the last two Olympics, though the design does not run afoul of FIG regulations. 

What Richard is doing does. 

And while he stressed he would never wear his outlawed uniform in a team competition — he wore regulation pants while helping lead Michigan to the NCAA championship this spring — that might not be the case the next time he competes internationally.

“We'll see about the world stage,” Richard said. “We'll have to talk and see what they allow, but I want to keep pushing it. I'm having fun. I feel more free.”

He'll have some time to think about it. When the six-man roster for the 2025 World Championships was announced late Saturday night, Richard's name wasn't on it. The decision had nothing to do with Richard's uniform but the uniqueness of this year's world meet, which does not include a team event and is largely designed for event specialists.

At his best, Richard is one of the top all-arounders on the planet. Yet even he admitted he was at about “80%” at nationals following a whirlwind stretch that included traveling to places like Uganda. Richard is partnering with the African nation to open a facility for boys there interested in acrobatics.

The joy he felt during the trip was palpable. So has the criticism he's received back home for his uniform choice, with some telling him if he wants to look like a basketball player, maybe he should go play basketball.

While Richard's modified look wouldn't look out of place on the court, pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik — who won a pair of bronze medals in Paris and became a breakout star in the process (all while wearing stirrup pants) last summer — agrees with his Olympic teammate that there “should be a certain level of flexibility” when it comes to uniforms, though he also pointed out that having everyone wear identical outfits is designed to help the judges do their jobs.

“So like, you can't wear like super baggy clothes, obviously,” Nedoroscik said. “But I do like there should be maybe a little bit of wiggle room.”

That's all Richard says he is asking for, though it seems highly unlikely the FIG would eliminate the deduction for a uniform violation anytime soon. That is not going to stop Richard from pressing on.

“I'll wear it for the next 10 years if I have to,” he said. “So eventually, if I keep succeeding and winning, and eventually on the international stage do the same thing and keep winning, (the FIG) will see how people like it (and) the younger kids will start wearing it ... and the trend is going to grow.”

New York City Democratic Party mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani gets a big thumbs up from progressive champion Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts

As someone who ran a hard-fought senate race against Elizabeth Warren in 2012, I don't agree with her on many policies, but I have to give her credit for her honesty about political sensation Zohran Mamdani.

Asked about the New York City Democratic mayoral candidate this week, the Massachusetts senator urged her fellow Democrats to embrace Mamdani's socialist plans as the ""Democratic message.""

Imagine that: a clear (albeit extreme) answer to a direct question rather than contrived talking points. Other Democrats are offering mealy-mouthed canned responses to questions about Mamdani, including my opponent in the New Hampshire Senate race, U.S. Representative Chris Pappas, D-N.H., who won't take a position on Mamdani's candidacy, and is calling me ""pathetic"" for raising the issue. 

TOP DEM SENATOR REVEALS SOCIALIST MAMDANI IS WHAT HER PARTY SHOULD LOOK LIKE: 'YOU BET'

The outcome of this fall's mayoral race in New York City has implications poised to resonate far beyond the five boroughs. Not only would the epicenter of capitalism falling into the hands of an avowed socialist send a dangerous message to our innovators and the world, but it will shape the future of the Democratic Party struggling to find its footing. Less than a year after getting their electoral clocks cleaned by President Donald Trump, the party's national standing has plummeted to a 35-year low.

Republican candidates need to do more than sit back and watch the Democrats implode. We must loudly and clearly explain to voters what socialism means. Remind them it's been decades since the fall of the Soviet Union, but a group of extreme and uniformed politicians are trying to bring back some of its core tenets. Mamdani has called for the abolition of private property and discussed ""the end goal of seizing the means of production."" These should be relics of a failed economic playbook that belongs in the history books, not modern political debates.

Capitalism is the greatest force for good this world has ever seen. It has lifted people up from poverty and provided opportunities for those at the bottom.  And I am one of them. I went from being a kid on welfare to the halls of Congress and then to serving as President Donald Trump's ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa decades later.

That upward mobility doesn't exist in Mamdani's socialist worldview. He frames his arguments around free handouts and government-run grocery stores. In his mind, it's better to spread mediocrity widely than strive for excellence through hard work. It's free for everyone until it doesn't exist for anyone.

Believe it or not, it won't be long before presidential candidates are kicking the tires on campaigns for 2028, especially in my home state of New Hampshire, the site of the First in the Nation presidential primary (at least on the Republican side, the Democrats decided to move it back in line to boost former President Joe Biden's electoral prospects).

Should he win this November, Mamdani is poised to become one of his party's biggest stars. His fellow socialist, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., is ascendant. Juan Williams, a well-respected Democratic voice even boldly predicted this week: ""Say hello in 2028 to President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.""

The copycat phenomenon is well underway. In Minnesota, a socialist challenger to the incumbent Democrat mayor has been dubbed the ""Mamdani of Minneapolis.""

The recent trend lines are concerning. A 2021 Gallup poll found that just half of young Americans had a positive view of capitalism, while a separate survey showed that 62% of younger voters held a ""favorable view"" of ""socialism."" The Occupy Wall Street movement that was born in many of America's major cities a decade and a half ago has graduated to an open embrace of socialism.

With President Trump atop the ticket, the GOP made steady gains last year among younger and working-class voters. With every Democrat on record opposing tax cuts in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" not to mention provisions like ""No Tax On Tips,"" we have a compelling story to tell about our vision for the future.

If we don't, it's more than just politics at stake. It's the future of our country. Democrats' economic vision is the one outlined by Sen. Warren and Mamdani: more government programs funded by higher taxes. Unlike those two politicians, most aren't willing to admit it, but given the chance, their policies would be ruinous.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump's Olympic task force, perception of the ‘big, beautiful bill' and more on ‘Special Report.'

An educational consultant warned that there will be ""no more normal years"" as colleges brace for a loss of international students and face financial challenges due to those losses.

Prestigious colleges have been offering student prospects on their waitlist a spot among their first-year students a lot later than usual, according to Town & Country.

""This is not a typical year,"" the outlet reported. 

The magazine explained further that waitlist discussions on college forums ""went deep into July."" Top schools like Columbia University, Rice University, Stanford University, and Duke have been notifying students a lot later than usual. 

In an effort to attract students who were waitlisted, Rice University has had to compensate students who have already committed to another school and received important materials such as course schedules and freshman dorm assignments.

HARVARD, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MAKE CONTINGENCY PLAN TO ALLOW FOREIGN STUDENTS TO STUDY IF BARRED FROM US

Rice has been admitting students from its waitlist deep into summer.

The admissions process at America's most selective universities has been disrupted, possibly due to the Trump administration's pressure on colleges' handling of antisemitism on campus and civil rights violations as well as freezing the funding they relied on from the federal government, the outlet suggested.

""The most likely explanation for the waitlist extensions this year is a fear that international students will not be able to start classes in August as a result of a pause that Secretary of State Marco Rubio placed on visa interviews earlier this year, between May 27 and June 18, during their peak season,"" the outlet reported.

""When interviews were resumed, U.S. consulates were told that they must implement new social media vetting protocols within five days. According to NAFSA, a professional organization for people who work in international education, the State Department provided little guidance on how to carry out this new order.""

International students at consulates in India, China, Nigeria, Japan, and other countries are reportedly backlogged due to a ""three-week"" pause in interviews. 

Colleges will lose many of their international student enrollment as India and China make up over half of international students in the U.S. ""NAFSA predicts ‘a potential 30–40 percent decline in new international student enrollment,' which could mean 150,000 fewer international students on American campuses,"" Town & Country reported.

CHINESE NATIONALS WHO INFILTRATED US UNIVERSITIES

Mark Moody, an education consultant who has worked at high schools domestically and internationally for almost three decades, told Town & Country that this ""year's issue with international enrollment needs to be understood as compounding, not creating, problems that have been developing for some time.""

The financial implications are a significant factor. Union College reportedly announced financial cuts and was forced to pull from endowment funds after a decline in international students.

The loss of international students has shaken up the college admissions process, causing many universities to extend the waitlist deadline as they struggle to predict which students will enroll.

""Students are applying to more colleges, making it harder to predict who will enroll. Colleges are seeing more students secure a spot in a college with a deposit in the spring and then never actually enroll, a phenomenon known as melt. It's become more common for families to make deposits at multiple colleges in the hope of securing better financial aid deals later that summer,"" the outlet reported.

""The international visa problems have made the uncertainty and anxiety among admissions leaders worse, but they were already bad,"" Town & Country stated.

Moody told Town & Country that the college admissions landscape will favor students with ""higher admit rates and more merit aid, especially if they're from full-pay families.""

""Outside of the Ivy League and perhaps a dozen other schools with massive endowments, colleges are going to feel great pressure to admit more students who will help them hit their bottom line."" 

Moody worries that more colleges will lean heavily into their early decision process to admit a larger percentage of their freshman class, which ""could put students in a tough spot"" if they apply regular decision or if they don't approach early decision very carefully and strategically.

""There are no more normal years,"" Mark Moody said to Town & Country.

Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley discusses his journey to becoming a Super Bowl champion and what's next.

The highly anticipated release of Madden NFL 26 appears to include a notable touchdown celebration that became a trend among some players last season.

San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers and others broke out in celebratory dances that emulated President Donald Trump after touchdowns and sacks in 2024. 

The upcoming version of the popular NFL-centric video game appears to show the virtual representation of Eagles running back Saquon Barkley doing his version of the dance.

During a Madden game between the Eagles and Washington Commanders, Jalen Hurts throws a pass to Barkley. An animated version of the All-Pro running back then sprints into the end zone for a touchdown before breaking out into the signature Trump dance.

Barkley and Trump have a connection. Earlier this year, Barkley visited the White House to commemorate the Eagles' Super Bowl championship. 

The day before the president hosted Barkley and his teammates on the South Lawn of the White House for a celebration ceremony, the star running back was spotted disembarking Marine One at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey.

Barkley later responded to some of the backlash to news of his outing with Trump making its rounds on social media.

""Some people are really upset cause I played golfed [sic] and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT,"" Barkley wrote on X. ""Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand,"" Barkley wrote on X. ""Just golfed with Obama not too long ago…and look forward to finishing my round with Trump ! Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day.""

The White House's official X account shared a photo of Trump and Barkley inside the Oval Office. The picture features a screenshot of the running back's message to critics.

More recently, Barkley declined an invitation to be part of Trump's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition.

""A couple months ago, it was brought to my team about the council, so I'm not really too familiar with it,"" he said, according to NBC Philadelphia. ""I felt like I'm gonna be super busy, so me and my family thought it was probably in the best interest to not accept that. 

""So, [I] was definitely a little shocked when my name was mentioned, but I'm assuming it's something great. I appreciate it but was a little shocked when my name was mentioned."" 

Trump also named Bosa, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker to the council.

BAGHDAD, IRAQ — In just the last two years, Baghdad has transformed. Traffic flows unimpeded through the former Green Zone. A new highway abuts the Tigris River in the heart of the city. Overpasses and elevated highways now cross Baghdad's infamous traffic circles. The multibillion-dollar U.S. Embassy once dominated the shore of the Tigris River; now high-rise apartments dwarf it. Big name hotels — the Movenpick, the Rixos — are nearing completion and will soon cater to the hundreds of businessmen coming through Baghdad daily for their share of the deals the country is looking to sign.

In Washington, partisans and pundits see President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq as original sin, the marquee example of forever war that both Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump promised to end; Iraqis have a more nuanced take.

Iraqis say a lot of the money funding the investments is Iraqi. Iraqi businessmen may seek outside partners and franchise rights, but they have their own money to spend. Real estate is often a mechanism for money laundering. In Iraqi Kurdistan, one of the most corrupt regions in the Middle East, locals say new apartment complexes sit empty or have occupancy rates lower than 20 percent. Visiting friends in Erbil and Sulaymani's newest complexes can be akin to walking into ghost towers, with lights off and signs of life only in one or two units per floor. In Baghdad, though, burgeoning population makes housing projects a necessity: Sixty to 70 percent of the country's population was not born when the war began in 2003. The change in generation has infused new energy into the country.

Iraq is also approaching a generational change in its politics. Many of its post-war prime ministers — Ayad Allawi, Nouri al Maliki, Haider al Abadi, Adil Abdul-Mahdi — are in poor health, as are factional leaders such as Badr Corps chief Hadi al Amiri and Masoud Barzani. Younger politicians such as Muqtada al Sadr and Qais al Khazali now try to reinvent themselves. 

While Yemen's Houthis launched attacks against Israel during and after the 12-day Israel-Iran war, Iraqi factions and Shi'ite militias, with very few exceptions, stood down. Iraqi Shi'ite leaders wrote to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to protest efforts by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to encourage some militias to take up arms. Simply put, with business booming and Baghdad 2025 increasingly feeling like Dubai 1995, Iraqi politicians feel they have a good thing going that they do not want derailed by conflict.

Trump both eschews entrapping the United States in wars and favors business over either diplomatic or military strategies to further U.S. interests. His choice of envoys — Steve Witkoff and Massad Boulos, respectively for the Middle East and Africa — reflect this.

Yet Witkoff has not yet come to Baghdad. This is a dangerous omission, given how too many in and around Trump view Iraq through the lens of 2003 rather than 2025. The two countries could not be more different.

ISRAEL'S NEW GAZA OFFENSIVE MUST BE GROUND-FOCUSED, NOT RELIANT ON AIR POWER

President George W. Bush imagined an Iraq that embraced democracy, eschewed terrorism, and thrived economically. He was not wrong in Iraq's potential, only in the timeline necessary to achieve it. Rather than look at Iraq as original sin and a symbol of “forever war,” Trump should send Witkoff to see the new Iraq in which Egyptians, Emiratis, Turks, and Chinese all get wealthy, but Americans are inexplicably absent.

Israel neutered Hezbollah, and a Turkish-backed Islamist group ousted Syrian President Bashar Assad. Investing in Iraq's thriving economy could be as effective to peel Iraq away from Iranian ambitions of an “Axis of Resistance.” Indeed, the biggest gift Trump could give to Iraq's marginalized rejectionist groups as Iraq heads again to elections would be military action.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Lawmakers demand oversight of proxy giants driving ESG in Corporate America","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3495344/republicans-demand-oversight-proxy-giants-driving-esg-corporate-america/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Republican lawmakers are zeroing in on two powerful foreign-owned firms they say are quietly shaping how Wall Street votes, and pushing corporate America toward progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals in the process.

Their focus is on Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, two foreign-based proxy advisory companies that operate with outsized sway over shareholder decisions. ISS is owned by Germany's Deutsche Börse, and Glass Lewis is owned by a Canadian private equity firm. 

Both firms are tasked with advising how large institutional investors, like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, cast votes at shareholder meetings, including on executive pay, board appointments, and company policies related to ESG and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).

The firms were originally created to help investors manage tens of thousands of votes, offering a kind of “cheat sheet” for quick decision-making. But critics say ISS and Glass Lewis now often set the direction of corporate decision-making.

“There must be greater transparency, due process, and oversight to ensure that proxy voting remains accountable to shareholders — not outsourced to unregulated intermediaries,” said Rep. French Hill (R‑AR), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, to the Washington Examiner. 

Many investors follow these firms' advice closely, some even automatically, giving them enormous sway over boardroom decisions, especially when it comes to ESG issues.

That has real-world implications for millions of Americans. Most people with a 401(k), pension, or retirement plan are invested by asset managers that rely heavily on proxy advisor guidance from groups like ISS or Glass Lewis. If votes prioritize ideology over returns, that could erode retirement savings.

“These decisions aren't just symbolic… they can shrink margins, hurt stock prices, and reduce the value of a teacher's pension or construction worker's 401(k),” said one GOP aide. 

Sen. Tim Scott (R‑SC), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, is spearheading oversight efforts in the Senate. In a letter to both firms in late May, Scott and nine Republican colleagues raised concerns that ISS and Glass Lewis are steering corporate votes based on ideology, not economics.

“Two foreign-owned companies hold a near-duopoly over proxy advisor services in the United States — influencing boardroom decisions, shareholder votes, and corporate strategy across the American economy, as well as a wide range of public policy on important issues,” Scott said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “They also routinely issue recommendations based on Left-wing politics over sound economic analysis.”

The real-world influence of these firms is well documented. A 2018 study of 713 major investors found that when ISS recommended voting for an executive pay package, 95 percent of them did. But when ISS opposed it, support dropped to just 68 percent. Similar shifts were seen in votes on stock plans, board seats, and efforts to replace company leadership. Glass Lewis also had a strong impact, when it backed a proposal during a leadership fight, support for that measure jumped by 64 percent.

One of the most striking examples of proxy advisor influence came in 2021 during a boardroom shake-up at ExxonMobil. A tiny activist firm called Engine No. 1, which owned just 0.02% of Exxon's shares, launched a campaign to push the oil giant toward more aggressive climate action by replacing three board members.

But, they didn't do it alone. Both ISS and Glass Lewis backed Engine No. 1's candidates, and some of the country's biggest investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard, and large pension funds, followed their lead. The result: three new directors and a major shift in Exxon's climate strategy.

A House Judiciary report later detailed how the proxy firms had aligned their recommendations with a climate activist network called Climate Action 100+, raising concerns that they were promoting a political agenda rather than offering neutral guidance.

Supporters of ESG and the proxy process argue that these firms play an important role in helping investors manage thousands of shareholder votes each year, offering independent research and recommendations. They also push back on claims of political bias, arguing that ESG investing, focused on long-term risks like climate change, board accountability, and data security, can be aligned with strong financial performance. ISS and Glass Lewis have said their guidance is based on established policies, not ideology, and that investors are free to vote however they choose. Both companies did not respond to requests for comment.

So far, federal regulators have taken a mixed approach. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced new rules in 2020 to boost transparency and allow companies to respond to proxy firm recommendations. But under Chairman Gary Gensler, the SEC rolled back those reforms in 2022. And a recent court ruling further restricted the agency's oversight, finding that proxy advice doesn't qualify as “solicitation” under federal law, limiting the SEC's authority to regulate it. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rep. Riley Moore (R‑WV), a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said lawmakers must remain aggressive in countering what he calls a “woke” investment agenda being quietly driven by foreign proxy firms.

“We need to stay vigilant against ESG, especially as proxy advisors turn more and more decisions over to foreign-owned management,” Moore told the Washington Examiner. He pointed to recent efforts by West Virginia and other states to pull public funds from ESG-focused investment strategies, but warned that “BlackRock and other private equity firms are dead set on keeping ESG, DEI, and other woke investing practices alive.” He called for stronger oversight from both Congress and federal regulators.

DOJ BACKS ANTITRUST LAWSUIT ACCUSING BLACKROCK AND OTHERS OF COLLUDING TO BOOST ESG

Legal and regulatory challenges are now mounting. Just last week, a federal judge in Texas allowed a major antitrust lawsuit to move forward against BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. The case alleges the firms coordinated to suppress coal production by aligning their votes through climate-focused investor alliances, a potential violation of federal competition law.

Separately, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is investigating ISS and Glass Lewis for allegedly misleading clients and concealing political motives behind their recommendations. 

In Congress, the House last year passed the Protecting Americans' Retirement Savings from Politics Act, which would require proxy advice and shareholder proposals to focus on financial outcomes, not ideological agendas. But the bill was never brought up in the Senate. Hill's committee has held multiple hearings on the issue and released a report titled “The Failure of ESG,” calling for major reforms to how proxy firms operate, and aides say more oversight efforts are likely in the months ahead.

“Our Committee looks forward to working with Chairman Paul Atkins and the Securities and Exchange Commission on proper oversight,” Hill added.

Culture and entertainment musts from Isaac Stanley-Becker

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what's keeping them entertained. Today's special guest is Isaac Stanley-Becker, a staff writer who has reported on Steve Witkoff's role as President Donald Trump's “shadow secretary of state,” the early tenure of Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, and the dire situation at the Federal Aviation Administration.

Isaac has crowned “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” as the greatest song of all time, enjoys rereading old email exchanges with friends, and is transfixed by the ambiguous nature of Mark Rothko's paintings.

The Culture Survey: Isaac Stanley-Becker

A good recommendation I recently received: A German politician recently recommended Michael Young's satirical 1958 novel The Rise of the Meritocracy to me. The book popularized the term meritocracy, but Young, a sociologist who helped develop Britain's postwar welfare state, meant it as a pejorative. His story envisions a dystopian future society stratified by educational achievement rather than social class, concluding with a wave of protests in which a group called the “populists” rebel against the meritocratic elite.

My favorite way of wasting time on my phone: Rereading old emails with friends. I've always been drawn to letters (I recommend the published correspondence between the poets Nelly Sachs and Paul Celan, with a terrific translation by Christopher Clark), and email is an approximation of that experience. I enjoy returning to the little asides and evasions and expressions of affection.

The television show I'm most enjoying right now: The Bear is a perfect TV show, and I'm savoring the fourth season at the moment. I tell everyone who gets overwhelmed by the chaos of the first season to wait because good things are in store. The show is a tender study of people struggling to do right by themselves and others. It's also a paean to Chicago, my hometown, a city about which Nelson Algren wrote: “Like loving a woman with a broken nose, you may well find lovelier lovelies. But never a lovely so real.”

Something delightful introduced to me by a kid in my life: A friend recently soothed her baby with a West African lullaby called “Mami wata,” by Issa Dakuyo.

A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: “Slow Show,” by the National, and “40-16 Building,” by Nas.

An online creator whom I'm a fan of: I'm not sure how Melvyn Bragg would feel about the designation of “online creator,” but I'm a fan of his show on BBC Radio 4, In Our Time, in which he convenes several experts on a given topic and peppers them with questions for about an hour. There's something for everyone: hypnosis, Bauhaus, the Haymarket Affair. One of my favorite episodes is on W. H. Auden—it's fitting for the 2020s, our own “low dishonest decade.”

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: I recently took a tour through five centuries of the Middle Ages in a single room at the Palazzo Citterio, in Milan. Objects as disparate as northern-Italian mosaics and Gothic marble heads recorded the eclectic interests of Lamberto Vitali, a 20th-century critic and collector who believed that art was able to dissolve geographical and temporal boundaries.

An author I will read anything by: For fiction, Péter Nádas. For nonfiction, Kathryn Schulz. For commentary, I'm a devoted reader of Adam Tooze's Substack and articles in the Financial Times.

A painting, sculpture, or other piece of visual art that I cherish: I'm very fond of Mark Rothko's paintings, and some of the best are on view in the National Gallery of Art's East Building, including No. 1 (1961). When I'm face-to-face with these hovering blocks of color, I can't tell whether I'm looking at something natural or unnatural, human or inhuman. Rothko's own words lend this ambiguity a sense of high drama. As part of the “Paintings on Paper” exhibition from about a year ago, the National Gallery displayed his haunting statement: “You think my paintings are calm, like windows in some cathedral? You should LOOK AGAIN. I'm the most violent of all the American painters. Behind those colors there hides the final cataclysm.”

A musical artist who means a lot to me: Bob Dylan. I think “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” is the greatest song of all time.

A favorite story I've read in The Atlantic: I loved Jennifer Senior's recent story on insomnia. But everything Jennifer writes is completely captivating.

The last thing that made me cry: I cried during I'm Still Here, a film about the military dictatorship in Brazil and the disappearance of the dissident politician Rubens Paiva. What got me, in particular, was the moment when a photographer visited the Paiva family home and told them to look sad for the camera, but they insisted on smiling and laughing. I was overcome by this simple fortitude.

The last thing that made me snort with laughter: I laughed out loud reading my friend Johannes Lichtman's novel Such Good Work, about a recovering addict whose quest for moral purpose takes him to Sweden amid the international refugee crisis. It's a sweet and very insightful bildungsroman that captures the absurdities of life in the first quarter of the 21st century.

A poem, or line of poetry, that I return to: Patience doesn't come easily to me, but I try to listen to the admonition that begins Galway Kinnell's “Wait”:

Wait, for now.

Distrust everything if you have to.

But trust the hours. Haven't they

carried you everywhere, up to now?

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

Essay

Captain Ron's Guide to Fearless Flying

By Elaine Godfrey

I'd experienced 21 years of unmemorable flights before my own fear of flying took hold. In May 2015, I was traveling from my home state of Iowa to New York City for a summer internship. I was already nervous about moving, and then, somewhere above Illinois, the plane hit a patch of turbulence and dropped what felt like a thousand feet. Several people screamed. For the first time in my life, I began to experience what I would later understand to be panic: My face and neck went clammy, and black spots filled my vision. At one point, an overhead bin popped open and a few unbuckled passengers smacked their head on the ceiling. They were all okay, and, physically, so was I. But I had unlocked a new fear.

CDC staffers saw the violence coming.

When gunfire pelted the Atlanta-based headquarters of the CDC yesterday, hundreds of employees were inside the campus's buildings. The experience was terrifying. But some of the employees were not particularly shocked. “I'm actually surprised it didn't happen sooner,” a nearly 20-year veteran of the agency told me. (She, like others I spoke with for this article, requested anonymity out of fear of losing her job.)

This was, in one sense, the first attack of its kind on the CDC. The shooter, whom law-enforcement officials have identified as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old resident of an Atlanta suburb, was reportedly fixated on the idea that the COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal. No employees were injured by the bullets that entered the buildings, according to a CDC representative. But an Atlanta police officer named David Rose was shot and later died from his injuries. White, too, was found dead—fatally shot—at the scene. (It is not yet clear if his wound was self-inflicted or if he was killed by police.) When he took aim at the agency on Friday afternoon, he was near a corner where a lone man stands holding anti-vaccine signs nearly every day, several CDC staffers told me.

In another sense, public-health workers have been facing escalating hostility since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. In 2020, armed protesters gathered on the Ohio Health Department director's front lawn, and the chief health officer of Orange County, California, was met with death threats after issuing a mask mandate. She had to hire extra security and was eventually driven to resign. Anthony Fauci, who served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the country's initial COVID response, has faced regular death threats since 2020. Nearly a third of state, local, and tribal public-health workers reported facing some sort of workplace violence in a 2021 survey.

Last year, Fauci told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that threats of violence to public-health workers correlate with verbal attacks from high-profile politicians and media personalities. “It's like clockwork,” he said. In the second Trump administration, those attacks have become commonplace—the very selling points, even, that have helped a number of President Donald Trump's health appointees gain their positions. In 2024, when announcing his own pick for CDC director, Trump maligned the CDC and other federal health agencies, accusing them of having “engaged in censorship, data manipulation, and misinformation.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was already a longtime anti-vaccine activist when he took the mantle as America's health secretary; he has compared vaccinating children to the abuses of the Catholic church. During his own 2024 presidential run, he promised to “clean up the cesspool of corruption at CDC.”

“Normally, threats to public servants aren't inspired from leadership of their own organization,” another CDC staffer said in a group chat among current and former employees. According to an MSNBC report, during an all-hands meeting today, CDC staff blamed the shooting at least partly on Kennedy's combative attitude toward the agency. “We need them to stop fanning the flames of hatred against us, stop spreading misinformation,” one employee wrote in the meeting chat, naming Kennedy in the same comment. “We will not be safe until they stop their attacks against us.”

The shooter appears to have brought five guns to the scene, and at least four federal buildings were struck by dozens of bullets overall. In the hours immediately after the shooting, while many CDC employees remained barricaded in offices and marooned in conference rooms, they heard nothing from Kennedy or Trump. Last night, Susan Monarez, the newly confirmed CDC director, issued a short statement reiterating the basic facts of the shooting. “We at CDC are heartbroken by today's attack on our Roybal Campus,” she wrote. “Our top priority is the safety and well-being of everyone at CDC.” Late this morning, Kennedy sent an email to the entire staff of the Department of Health and Human Services offering support and prayers. In a post on X at about the same time, he wrote, “No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.”

This evening, Monarez sent a more substantial email pledging to support the CDC during its recovery and noting its resilience. “We have faced adversity before, and we will do so again, drawing strength from our shared commitment to public health,” she wrote. The president has not yet made a statement about the attack. (The White House and HHS did not respond to requests for comment.)

To the CDC employees I spoke with, the sluggish response is the latest episode in the administration's escalating abandonment of the agency. Since January, the Trump administration has hit the CDC with massive layoffs, proposed halving its budget, and forced changes to internal policies governing the fundamentals of its scientific work. Earlier this year, Kennedy purged the committee that advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations. Just this week, he canceled nearly $500 million in federally funded research on mRNA vaccines—widely considered among CDC employees and public-health experts to be the greatest domestic triumph of the U.S. pandemic response—stating incorrectly that they cause more risk than benefit against the flu and COVID.

For CDC staff, the wider threat does not seem to have passed. This evening, a group of CDC employees were trading tips on peeling off their old parking decals after the agency's security office reportedly asked staff to remove them from their cars. One person suggested covering them with other stickers; another recommended loosening them with cooking oil.

Even people who have volunteered for risky missions in their public-health work are still getting used to the idea that the danger has arrived at the home front. “I've put my life on the line for this agency, responding to outbreaks in some of the most dangerous parts of the world,” a 13-year veteran of the agency told me. “I didn't expect to face the same risks at the Atlanta campus as I faced in South Sudan.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The novelist liked playing God—a very capricious one.

Listen to more stories on hark

The novelist Muriel Spark died almost 20 years ago, but she still regularly appears on lists of top comic novelists to read on this subject or that. Crave more White Lotus–level skewering of the ridiculous rich? Try Memento Mori, The New York Times suggests. An acerbic take on boring dinner parties? Symposium. Interested in “the fun and funny aspects of being a teacher”? Read The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie—also good for learning how to be a highly inappropriate teacher, if you want to know that too.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Obscured by her reputation as a wit is the fact that Spark was a religious writer—indeed, one of the most important religious writers in modern British literature. She embraced Roman Catholicism in 1954, at age 36, and joined the cohort of renowned literary Catholic converts such as T. S. Eliot, Evelyn Waugh, and Graham Greene. The most consistent influence on her work is the Bible, especially the Old Testament. She began reading it as a girl in her Presbyterian school and kept rereading it throughout her life, less for “religious consolation,” she writes in her essay “The Books I Re-Read and Why,” than “for sheer enjoyment of the literature.” She was particularly drawn to the Book of Job, an anguished outcry against the seeming randomness of evil. And yet her tone throughout her work is so acidly droll, her touch so light and sly, that we could read most of her 22 novels and 41 short stories and never quite process that their central concern is God.

That's because she communicates her theology largely through form rather than content. She rarely discusses; she prefers to sculpt. With a steely command of omniscience, selective disclosure, irony, and other narrative devices, Spark re-creates in the relationship between author and reader the sadomasochistic partnership between the Almighty and his hopelessly wayward flock—or, to put it another way, between his absolute truth and our partial understanding. In other words, she plays God.

Not necessarily a nice God, either. In the Book of Job, the Almighty is mercilessly capricious, condemning Job to bitter suffering in a wager with Satan. This God's ends are not our ends. Nor are Spark's. A Creator who acts according to his will on his own unknowable schedule darkens her bright, chipper prose like a skull in a still life. “Remember you must die,” the anonymous callers in Memento Mori (1959) say to their shocked elderly victims before hanging up. Frightening as these prank calls are, their recipients refuse to take the message seriously, because surely the whole thing is just a macabre practical joke. One feature of Spark's comic genius is her ability to come up with screwball storylines that recapitulate our hapless drift toward final judgment. The collision between God's lofty vantage point and human shortsightedness yields absurdist disaster.

In Electric Spark: The Enigma of Dame Muriel, Frances Wilson revels in her sublimely contrary subject. Her account is a corrective to Martin Stannard's 2009 authorized Muriel Spark: The Biography, a sober, balanced, and plodding opus, though still the definitive biography. Stannard's problem was that Spark had trained as a secretary and filed everything away, no matter how trivial. (Another way of saying this is that she hoarded.) When she died, her archives consisted of 195 linear feet of “letters, proofs, receipts, memos, agendas, minutes, newspaper cuttings, diaries and manuscripts,” Wilson writes. Spark had given Stannard exclusive access to it all. The mass of material seems to have crushed his spirit. Almost as soon as she chose him, she regretted it, and Wilson imagines her torturing Stannard the way the ghost of a murdered woman toys with her murderer in Spark's short story “The Portobello Road.”

From the September 2010 issue: The 20th century's most wickedly funny novelist

Wilson, by contrast, feels free to focus on the parts of Spark's life that informed her art—and luckily for us, these are plentiful, both because Spark liked to rework her own experiences and acquaintances for her fiction, and because her life tended toward the fantastical in ways that served her writing. Wilson borrows Spark's own mystical whimsy about the relationship between her life and her work, which was that her fiction somehow preceded her experiences. “If she wrote about a burglary,” Wilson says, “her own house would then be broken into; if she wrote about manuscripts being stolen from a bedroom or a cache of love letters being used as blackmail, this would likewise be her fate.”

This was true. Her house was burgled a decade after she wrote about similar burglaries in her novel Symposium (1990). Blackmail featured in her first novel, The Comforters (1957), and in Memento Mori; in 1963, she was blackmailed by a rare-book dealer in possession of her love letters. You'd think Spark took dictation from a far-seeing God. Indeed, that's more or less the subject of The Comforters. A young woman hears voices narrating her exact movements, or else predicting the near future, accompanied by the sound of typing. Everyone presumes she's going mad, but what the voices say is either true or about to come true. Who controls the narrative? That's Spark's big question. Whether to trust or resist those who attempt to control it is the follow-up question.

A lot of untrustworthy people tried to take charge of Spark over the course of her adult life, most of them men. Her childhood, however, was happy and relatively free of such power struggles. Born Muriel Sarah Camberg in 1918 to a Jewish father, Barney, and a mother, Cissy, who had some Jewish heritage, she was raised on a haphazard mix of gods and rituals. Her mother, more eclectic than observant, Wilson writes,

The family lived modestly on a street in central Edinburgh that was full of delights for a curious child. In her building were a painter, a singer, a sweetshop, and a jeweler, and outside was a communal garden to play in. The Cambergs—Muriel had an older brother—gave over one of two bedrooms in their small apartment to lodgers, then to Barney's sister and later Cissy's mother, a former suffragette (indomitable, witty, and “astonishingly ugly,” Spark later wrote). Muriel adored them both. Her father, an engineer, was genial and funny, and friends were always dropping by. Spark's mother mocked them behind their back; Spark once called Cissy, not disapprovingly, “a complete hypocrite.” The child internalized her mother's satirical edge as well as the neighborhood “maxims, idioms, accents, aphorisms, rhythms and catchphrases,” Wilson writes. Her ears had memories, was how Spark put it.

When she was 11 and a student at James Gillespie's High School for Girls, Spark came under the spell of Miss Kay, a pedagogical grande dame who exposed her to Italian art and Romantic poetry and trained her in poetic meter. By the time Spark was 12, she had published accomplished poems in her high-school magazine and in an anthology of poetry by Edinburgh high-school students. Miss Kay, Wilson says, “both was and was not the model for Miss Jean Brodie,” Spark's most notorious character. They shared “mannerisms and speech patterns”; both overpraised their protégés as the “crème de la crème.” But Miss Kay was much nicer. Miss Brodie is partial to Nazis and Italian fascists and maneuvers her girls into position to act as her advocates and surrogates—which is not always in their interest. “By the time they were sixteen,” Spark writes with characteristic mordancy, “they remained unmistakably Brodie, and were all famous in the school, which is to say they were held in suspicion and not much liking.”

Spark's marriage at 19, in 1937, drove home to her that the world was not inclined to let women take charge of their own destiny. Oswald Spark, a teacher who courted her for a year, had accepted a job in Rhodesia and asked Spark to follow him. He'd support her, he said, and she could keep writing poetry. She consented. Their wedding night was “an awful mess,” Spark said later, “a botch-up,” and marital relations did not continue for long. But she got pregnant and nearly died of septicemia after giving birth to a son, Robin, toward whom she was never able to muster as much maternal solicitude as he longed for. Oswald turned out to have a “severe nervous disorder,” in Spark's words, and after two years, she left him. Colonial society horrified her, especially the way white people talked about black people as if they weren't human, but war had broken out and she only managed to make her escape in 1944, resorting to a troopship that had to navigate through enemy waters. She was forced to leave Robin behind; it took her 10 years to win back custody.

Wilson frames the next phase of Spark's life as a key to the fiction that was still a decade away, and she's not exaggerating its importance. When Spark arrived in London in 1944, she got a job as a secretary for the head of a clandestine project overseen by the British Foreign Office. In fact, she may already have been doing undercover work. Wilson hypothesizes that she spied for the British colonial government during her last year in Rhodesia, possibly trying to uncover enemy aliens among the settlers. Wilson cites no direct evidence but rather a curious gap in the record of what she was up to, or even where she lived.

Spark's new boss was a wildly imaginative and very demanding foreign correspondent of Falstaffian proportions named Sefton Delmer. His outfit, the Political Warfare Executive, conducted psyops from a secret compound north of London. The PWE's mission was “the successful and purposeful deceit of the enemy”; it produced disinformation in German that was published in a counterfeit newspaper, sent in the form of forged letters and fake secret messages, and broadcast over the radio. An anti-Semitic Nazi talk-show host who ranted drunkenly about corruption and sexual depravity among the party elite from his illegal outpost in the fatherland, for instance, was in reality a German writer of detective fiction employed by Delmer in England.

From the February 2001 issue: Dame Muriel's surreal meditation on belief 

Working for Delmer may have been the best training a future novelist could get. He was fanatical about verisimilitude: All the details in the team's fabrications had to ring true. He hired people from every profession. In addition to writers, he enlisted farmers, psychologists, actors, even cabaret singers, some of them German Jewish refugees knowledgeable about German life. Plus the military fed Delmer the latest intelligence. He was “omniscient,” Wilson writes, and scary; he liked to play mind games with his own people as well as the Germans.

Spark's immersion in “a world of method and intrigue,” as she put it, taught her about the slipperiness of truth. For the rest of her life, she would be obsessed with—indeed, paranoid about—“codes, secret messages and the circulation of fictions posing as fact,” Wilson writes. Several of Spark's novels feature shady characters spying on one another and hatching whisper campaigns against a defiant but naive heroine. She later was the target of a plot herself. During Spark's brief tenure in 1947 as the editor hired to update The Poetry Review, a stodgy publication overseen by an elderly poetry society, a board member scheming to oust her pried into her life and threatened to use her divorce against her. Spark put this experience to use in more than one novel, most notably Loitering With Intent (1981), probably her funniest. The Poetry Society becomes the Autobiographical Association, whose ridiculous members write their memoirs under the supervision of the director, a snooty character clearly conniving to use their confessions for some sort of skulduggery.

Then there was Spark's nervous breakdown in January 1954. Always worried about her weight, an anxiety shared by some of her heroines, she had been taking Dexedrine to control her eating. During the ensuing psychotic interlude, she fixated on T. S. Eliot, whose most recent play, The Confidential Clerk, had a character named Muriel. Convinced that Eliot, whom she had never met, had sneaked encrypted declarations of love for her into the script, she spent months obsessively trying to decode them. This wasn't easy. At one point, Wilson writes, “Eliot's words started jumping around and cavorting, reshaping themselves in anagrams and crosswords.”

A doctor weaned Spark from Dexedrine and put her on antipsychotic medication, and she briefly went into therapy with a Jungian psychologist. But Roman Catholicism restored order to her disorderly mind, Spark said. It made her “see life as a whole rather than as a series of disconnected happenings.” She put herself in the hands of God, who sees and hears all—God being a preferable eavesdropper and spy to ex-boyfriends and boards of directors. Piety did not make her dogmatic or conservative. She neither went to confession nor renounced abortion, contraception, or divorce, and she embraced doubt.

From the November 1965 issue: Muriel Sparks's poem “Note by the Wayside”

Spark's turn to religion coincided with her turn to fiction, which was not an accident. Catholicism allowed her to find her voice as a writer. While editing a volume of the letters of Cardinal John Henry Newman, she had read his Apologia Pro Vita Sua, which details the steps of his conversion to Catholicism and inspired her to begin to take her own. The qualities in his reflections that attracted her—simplicity, concision, a refusal to accept easy answers—double as a good description of the style she was developing.

Catholicism itself had aesthetic appeal. She was drawn to its living magic—its “saints, angels, miracles, and mysteries,” Wilson writes. “She also liked the paradox, metaphor, sixth dimension and rearrangement of time and space.” For believers, those staples of faith had an immediacy and a proximity to the everyday that Spark may have felt was best embodied in fiction. From the start, in her very first (and prize-winning) short story, “The Seraph and the Zambezi” (1951)—still one of her best—she effaced the distinction between naturalism and the supernatural. During a Christmas pageant held by a gas-station owner in his rickety garage near Rhodesia's Zambezi River, a six-winged creature appears onstage and proceeds to kick everyone else off it. It's a seraph, straight out of the Book of Isaiah. “This is my show,” the owner, Cramer, tells it.

“Since when?” the Seraph said.

“Right from the start,” Cramer breathed at him.

“Well, it's been mine from the Beginning,” said the Seraph, “and the Beginning began first.”

Why Catholicism and not, say, Scottish Presbyterianism, the country's Calvinist-inflected denomination of her youth, or her father's Judaism? Spark's love of high style surely rebelled against the austerity of Protestantism, both in worship and creed. (As a writer, however, she made heavy use of the doctrine of predestination, disposing of characters summarily and parodying herself in the figure of Miss Jean Brodie. “She thinks she is Providence,” a disenchanted student reflects. “She thinks she is the God of Calvin.”)

Spark was even more conflicted about Judaism. In The Mandelbaum Gate (1965), a chatty, muddled autobiographical novel, she describes her protagonist going back and forth between her chilly Christian relatives and her warmer Jewish ones and belonging among neither. To one side of the family, she was faintly pitiable because she was half Jewish; the other was kinder, but she felt her lack of Jewish knowledge excluded her from their cozy home rituals. Spark always had the Bible, though, and read it “with a sense that it was specially mine,” as she put it. She thought God had given a good answer when Moses had asked his name at the burning bush: I am who I am. Was she “a Gentile” or was she “a Jewess”? “Both and neither. What am I? I am what I am,” she writes in her essay “Note on My Story ‘The Gentile Jewesses.' ”

Spark's range as a novelist was impressive—one work might adopt the guise of a murder mystery, the next of a ghost story—but she had a signature rhetorical move: prolepsis. The scholar Clare Bucknell came up with a Spark-worthy term for it: the “auto-spoiler.” In a throwaway remark toward the beginning of a story, the narrator gives away the end. We learn in Chapter 3 of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961) that one of the Brodie set will betray her to the school's administration, which is desperate for an excuse to get rid of her. In The Driver's Seat (1970), Spark's most surreal novel and also her favorite, we are told, also in the third chapter, that the tourist disembarking in a Southern European city will have been murdered by the next morning.

By revealing the fate of her characters, Spark frees us from the grip of curiosity about what's going to happen and forces us to study why. Who made it happen? What does it mean? Does providence foreordain or do characters have a say? Is everything a conspiracy or does accident play a role? Spark's convictions let her interrogate God's designs without despairing that there are none. As a child, Spark had found God to be “a charming and witty character” with “a lot of conflicting sides to his nature,” as she wrote. The worry that crops up in her fiction is that he'll turn out to be a rogue operator like her old boss Delmer.

But Spark also admired the God of Job because he was “not the God of love,” Wilson writes. He was the braggart God who boasted to Job that—in Spark's words—“I made this and I created that, and I can crush and I can blast and I can blow. And who are you to ask questions?” A devoted ironist is the answer: Spark reserved the right not only to ask questions but to admit amusement and dismay into her faith. Anyone can worship a God who doesn't trim himself to the size of the human imagination—that's what God is for, to make sure that we don't mistake our petty schemes for anything other than half-baked. But it takes a Spark to be fond of a God who chest-thumps and is otherwise outlandish—a God who, she writes, “basks unashamed in his own glory, and in his anger is positively blasphemous.” Because who are we to say how God should behave?

A poem

For the man getting home late to the line. He calls calling with a miniaturist's awareness (cold to touch), though somewhere still on fire. He couldn't write to save the monsoon in his eye. Twinkling cities in competing moats. Louchely entering together the lesser gulf as it hammers down like fibers

Meniscus augur & hour of errors as the mercury rag spills its rings from his last good pore, his teeth shaped in greenhouse suet or little expectant pots of orchid balm in snow.

The construction of a lunar settlement may be the most wondrous space achievement of our lives.

No one can say that the Trump administration is entirely against alternative energy. In his first bold policy stroke as NASA's interim head, Sean Duffy has directed the agency to put a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by decade's end. This is not a lark. If humanity means to establish a permanent settlement on the moon, nuclear power will almost certainly be essential to its operation. And a lunar base may well be the most wondrous achievement in space exploration that people reading this will see during their lifetime.

The moon has gone unvisited, except by robots, for more than 50 years, and as of several months ago, it seemed as though Americans would be staying away from it for a good while longer. President Donald Trump was taking cues from Elon Musk, who seemed inclined to shelve the plan to put Americans back on the lunar surface and focus instead on an all-out sprint to Mars. But Musk has since fallen out of favor, and last month, congressional Republicans secured a funding boost for the moon program.

NASA astronauts are now scheduled to return to the moon in 2027, and if all goes well, they will be landing on it regularly, starting in the early 2030s. Each crew will carry parts of a small base that can grow piece by piece into a living space for a few people. The astronauts will also take a pair of vehicles for expeditions—a little rover that they can use for local jaunts in their space suits, and a larger, pressurized one that will allow them to go on 500-mile regolith road trips in street clothes.

A base on the moon would be more democratic than those that Musk and his acolytes have advocated building on Mars. Given shorter travel times, a greater number of people would be able to experience its otherworldly ashen plains. Their homesick calls to Earth would have only second-long delays, as opposed to minutes for a call from Mars.

But even a small encampment on the lunar surface is going to require considerable energy. Temperatures dip to –410 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, and human bodies will need to keep cozy amid that deep chill. The International Space Station runs on solar power, but that won't be enough on most of the moon, where nights last for 14 days. Some of the agency's other off-world projects are powered by raw plutonium. Hunks of it sit inside the Mars rovers, for instance, radiating heat that the wheeled robots convert into electricity. These hot rocks are also encased inside NASA's probes to the outer planets and their moons. Without plutonium, the two Voyager spacecrafts couldn't continue to send data back to Earth as they recede from the solar system.

The moon base will need more than a radioactive rock. It will need a reactor that actually splits atoms, like the one that Duffy has proposed this week. Even if that reactor were to fail, the resulting meltdown wouldn't present the same risks to humans that it would on Earth. The moon is already a radiation-rich environment, and it has no wind to blow the reactor's most dangerous effluvia around; the material would simply fall to the ground.

Duffy framed his push to get the reactor in place as a matter of national security. NASA's program to return to the moon, called Artemis, will be an international effort, with several countries contributing pieces of the final base. (Japan's space agency has tapped Toyota to design the large, pressurized lunar vehicle.) But when the United States invited Russia to join, Vladimir Putin declined. He has instead opted to help out with a larger Chinese lunar base, which is supposed to include a nuclear reactor 10 times as powerful as the one that Duffy announced.

Last month, Bhavya Lal, who served as an associate administrator at NASA during the Biden administration and is now a professor at RAND, and her fellow aerospace expert Roger Myers released a report arguing that a county could sneakily establish a sovereign zone on the moon in defiance of the Outer Space Treaty just by building a reactor. For instance, the Chinese could insist on a buffer around theirs for the sake of nuclear safety, and use that to keep Americans away from desirable ice-rich craters nearby. Lal and Myers seem to have captured the new administration's attention: Duffy's new directive ordering the development of the reactor specifically mentioned this risk.

If worry over Chinese lunar land grabs is the motivation for a moon base, so much the better. Space exploration often requires a geopolitical spur. And if NASA can build this first small lunar settlement, something grander could follow close behind. Once the agency has mastered the construction of a 100-kilowatt lunar nuclear reactor, it should have little trouble scaling up to larger ones that can support tens, or even hundreds, of people—in bases of the size that now exist on Antarctica. Some space agencies have reportedly discussed building hydroponic greenhouses and other elaborate structures inside the voluminous caves that run beneath the moon's Sea of Tranquility.

All of this infrastructure could enable some serious lunar dystopias. The moon's surface could become an industrial hellscape, pocked with mining operations where robots and human serfs extract platinum and titanium for use in advanced electronics back on Earth. Or the Outer Space Treaty could break down and the moon could become a heavily militarized zone—even a staging ground for nuclear weapons.

But an inhabited moon could also be a global commons for research. Both the U.S. and China have developed designs for large radio telescopes on the lunar dark side, where they'd be shielded from Earth's radio noise and would greatly aid the search for signals from distant civilizations. In one design, robots would spread a metal mesh from a crater's center to its rim, turning its concave surface into a natural radio dish. One can imagine an astronomer at a lunar base, peering out from a porthole, seeing the Earth shining in the sky, picking out its individual oceans and continents, and knowing that on the moon's opposite side, a giant ear would be listening for messages from other Earths and other moons, all across the Milky Way and far beyond.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Voters have proved willing to tolerate corruption, but there's one thing they won't ignore.

Tens of millions of Americans voted for President Donald Trump in the belief that he would be competent. They might not have been thrilled that Trump is a convicted felon, or pleased with his role in the violent attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Many worried that he posed a threat to democracy. But enough were willing to overlook all that, because they convinced themselves that Trump would be an effective chief executive, that under his stewardship their lives would get better and the country would prosper.

A survey from the Democratic pollsters Douglas Schoen and Carly Cooperman, conducted shortly after the election, helps illustrate the point. By an 11-point margin, independents said they would be less confident that the Trump administration would share accurate information compared with the Biden administration. Yet, by a 10-point margin, those same voters said that they thought the Trump administration would be more effective at getting things done.

“Ultimately, our postelection poll makes clear that voters prioritized perceived effectiveness rather than upholding democracy this election,” Schoen and Cooperman wrote, “and while they are deeply skeptical towards our institutions generally, they are cautiously optimistic that the incoming administration will be effective at providing real-world solutions.”

Read: Trump loudly insists that he's incompetent

A little more than half a year into Trump's second term, however, the public's confidence in his skill as a chief executive is shattering. In a recent AP/NORC poll, only about one-quarter of U.S. adults said that Trump's policies have helped them. Roughly half report that Trump's policies have “done more to hurt” them, and about two in 10 say his policies have “not made a difference” in their lives. Remarkably, Trump failed to earn majority approval on any of the issues in the poll, including the economy, immigration, and cutting government spending.

As a result, a politically toxic impression is hardening. Trump's approval rating in the most recent Gallup poll is 37 percent, the lowest of this term and only slightly higher than his all-time low of 34 percent, at the end of his first term. (Among independents, Trump's approval rating is down to 29 percent.) Americans already understood Trump to be corrupt, and proved themselves willing to tolerate that. But now they are coming to believe that he is inept. In American politics, that is an unforgivable sin.

On the economic front, Trump's tariff increases—announced and then altered, often without rhyme or reason—are only now beginning to percolate through the economy, and the steepest hikes haven't yet kicked in. The economy appears to be slowing down. Consumer prices are up 2.6 percent from a year earlier, which is keeping the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates despite intense pressure from Trump. The jobs report for July showed a gain of only 73,000, a sign that the labor market is weakening. Perhaps more significant, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the jobs totals from May and June downward by more than a quarter of a million. Unemployment ticked up to 4.2 percent. Consumer spending is well below what it was last year. More than half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a “major” source of stress in their life right now. Many industries are postponing hiring, and the national hiring rate is near its lowest level in a decade. Customers appear to be holding off on large, long-term purchases. The Budget Lab at Yale University calculates that the American consumer is dealing with an average effective tariff rate of 18.3 percent, the highest since 1934, and it estimates that price increases will cost each household $2,400 on average this year. General Motors reported last month that Trump's tariffs have cost the company more than $1 billion. And the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that Trump's latest tariffs “would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.”

The Trump administration is betting that the president's tariffs will not be inflationary, will generate massive revenue flows that significantly reduce the deficit, and will lead to a renaissance in American manufacturing and investment. If it's right, Trump will reap the political benefits. But we believe the administration to be dead wrong, and that this will become painfully obvious to ordinary Americans in the months and years ahead.

The economy isn't the only place where Trump's policies will hurt rather than help. Estimates predict that the number of Americans without health insurance will increase by more than 10 million in less than a decade, with particularly devastating impacts for vulnerable rural populations. Eliminating a quarter of the IRS workforce may well undermine tax collection and increase the wait time for Americans to receive refunds. Slashing the Social Security Administration, which is serving more people than ever before, with the fewest workers in half a century, will increase wait times for those needing help. It will lead to field-office closures that will hit seniors in rural communities the hardest and may well delay the processing of retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. A 70-year-old retiree in Indiana told The Guardian, “For the first time in my life, my wife and I are stressed out and worried if I will get my payment and if it will be on time.”

The Trump administration has devastated the National Institutes of Health, one of the world's foremost medical-research centers and the biggest sponsor of biomedical research in the world. Nearly 2,500 grants have been ended or delayed, disrupting vital medical research, reducing the pool of available researchers, and compromising public health and disease prevention.

“The country is going to be mourning the loss of this enterprise for decades,” Harold Varmus, a Nobel Prize–winning cancer biologist who served as the director of the NIH from 1993 to 1999, told The New York Times. (There are signs that some Republicans in Congress are finally stirring from their slumber and might be ready to push back against what the Trump administration is trying to do, though the administration may attempt to thwart their will by ignoring appropriations or setting up a fight over impoundment or trying more rescission.)

Massive cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, resulting in the loss of some of the weather service's most experienced leaders and impeding the collection of data that are essential for accurate and timely weather forecasting, will place Americans at greater risk of experiencing extreme-weather events.

As The Atlantic's David A. Graham has written, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in disarray, headed by a person who is clearly out of his depth. Trump wants FEMA eliminated by the end of the year. It has already lost about a third of its permanent workforce, and its program dedicated to helping communities prepare for natural disasters such as floods and fires has been canceled. FEMA is hardly a model federal program; a slew of changes could make it better. The problem is that the Trump administration has no plan to pick up the slack in a post-FEMA world, and states and municipalities will be hard-pressed to do so.

David A. Graham: FEMA is not prepared

In the immediate aftermath of the recent Texas floods, FEMA's earlier decision to lay off hundreds of call-center contractors resulted in thousands of unanswered calls for recovery assistance. (The administration dismissed reports about this as “fake news.”) FEMA didn't deploy to St. Louis for several weeks after a tornado destroyed parts of the city, leaving people unable to apply for even basic payments for fresh food and medicine, let alone get help addressing uninsured losses from the natural disaster.

The Trump administration is also decimating anti-corruption efforts within the federal government. It announced earlier this year that the landmark 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act would no longer be enforced. It also announced the termination of two Justice Department programs designed to seize and return foreign assets from kleptocrats and oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. And it has fired or demoted 20 inspectors general and acting inspectors general, who are ferreting out waste, fraud, and abuse within the government.

As lifelong conservatives, we are completely on board when it comes to insisting on accountability in government programs; increasing their efficiency; and, in some instances, reorganizing them, downsizing them, and even eliminating them. The problem is the thoughtless and reckless way in which the Trump administration is going about this—all while passing a “big, beautiful bill” that will add a staggering $3 trillion to the national debt.

Trump has surrounded himself with nihilists, people waving around a chain saw onstage like a madman and boasting that career civil servants should be viewed “as the villains.” Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, said in 2023: “We want to put them in trauma.”

So Democrats have a lot to work with. On an almost-daily basis, Trump is discrediting his own leadership; that gives Democrats the opportunity to highlight, with laser-like focus, his failure to deliver on his own promises. In doing so, Democrats need to present themselves not as the party of government but rather as the party of reform, as disrupters of the status quo on behalf of the common good. We believe they must tell voters that in all sorts of ways—the economy, health and health care, disaster relief—Trump is making their lives worse, not better. He and his administration are amateurs, inept and in over their head. They are entertainers and grifters, shock jocks and freaks. Whatever talents they may possess, mastery of governing is not one of them.

Perhaps most important, the incompetence argument needs to be humanized. Democrats need compelling, empathy-evoking narratives pointing to the harm being done to ordinary people by the enormous ineptitude of Trump and his enablers. For example, Democrats could tell the story, as former NIH Director Francis Collins has done, of the woman in her early 40s, afflicted with Stage 4 colorectal cancer, who was on the path to an immunotherapy clinical trial that might have saved her life, until cuts to the NIH caused a devastating delay; or of the children afflicted with rare diseases whose lives may be affected because advances in gene editing have been stopped in their tracks; or of the families who are seeing their hopes for breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease potentially dashed. They could talk about the role that Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, is playing in the worst outbreak of measles in decades. Or about his decision to cancel nearly $500 million in grants and contracts for developing mRNA vaccines, which have been responsible for saving millions of lives from COVID and were considered the most exciting new opportunity in cancer immunotherapy. They could also explain why the Trump administration isn't prepared for a bird-flu pandemic, should one happen.

Democrats could tell the story of how farmers in places such as western Iowa are struggling as tariffs increase their costs at home—for machinery, fertilizer, herbicides, and feed—while limiting their access to international markets.

Democrats could show how workforce raids by ICE agents with battering rams are in the process of destroying Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha, which had been one of the fastest-growing meatpacking companies in the Midwest. According to The New York Times, “In a matter of weeks, production had plummeted by almost 70 percent. Most of the work force was gone. Half of the maintenance crew was in the process of being deported, the director of human resources had stopped coming to work, and more than 50 employees were being held at a detention facility in rural Nebraska.”

Thanks to the reporting of Nick Kristof at The New York Times, Democrats could talk about the babies such as Gbessey, who lived in a village in Liberia and died of malaria because the Trump administration shut down USAID, which meant health workers had no malaria medicine to offer the child; and how Gbessey's younger sibling, Osman, also became seriously ill with malaria. They could tell of children orphaned by AIDS dying in South Sudan because the community-health workers who had brought them medicine have been laid off. (A recent study in The Lancet projected that the defunding of USAID could lead to 14 million deaths by the end of the decade.)

These examples are but the beginning; Trump, after all, has more than 1,200 days left in office. There is no evidence that he's going to get more competent or more compassionate, and plenty of evidence to the contrary. The challenge for Democrats will be to keep up with the cascading horror stories and to tell them in compelling and sensitive ways, conveying the devasting effects of the Trump administration's across-the-board mistakes.

IN THE GREAT GATSBY, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about Tom and Daisy Buchanan, the aristocratic couple who exemplify the moral corruption of the wealthy.

“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy,” Fitzgerald wrote. “They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”

From the March 2023 issue: A new way to read Gatsby

Trump is smashing up things on a scale that is almost unimaginable, and he seems completely untroubled by the daily hardships and widespread suffering he is leaving behind. And the president is hardly done. The pain and the body count will rise, and rise, and rise. It will be left to others to clean up the mess he has made. Some of the damage may be repaired with time; some will be irreparable. Democrats should say so. It's their best path to defeating his movement, which is the only way for the healing to begin.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

This doesn't have to be all-or-nothing.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I typically eat vegetarian, and have considered going fully vegan out of concern for animal welfare. But lately my on-again, off-again gastrointestinal problems have been acting up, and I've had to go back on a more restricted diet to manage my symptoms — no spice, no garlic or onions, nothing acidic, and nothing caffeinated. Sticking to a “bland” diet is hard enough, but doing so while vegetarian is very difficult when things like tomatoes and onions and grapefruits are off the table.

I know a lot of people with these issues eat fish or meat, and some medical professionals recommend drinking chicken bone broth to soothe flare-ups. I don't want to abandon my commitment to animal welfare while my gut sorts itself out, but my food options are limited right now. How should I approach this?

Dear Would-Be Vegetarian,

You're not alone in finding it hard to stick to a purely vegetarian diet. Only 5 percent of American adults say they're vegetarian or vegan. What's more, one study found that 84 percent of people who adopt those diets actually go back to eating meat at some point. And most of them aren't even dealing with the gastrointestinal problems you face.

So, it speaks to the depth of your moral commitment that you're really wrestling with this. I'll have some concrete suggestions for you in a bit, but first I want to emphasize that how you approach the question of meat-eating will depend on your underlying moral theory.

There's a classic split in moral philosophy between deontologists and utilitarians. A deontologist is someone who thinks an action is moral if it's fulfilling a duty — and we have universal duties like, “always treat others as ends in themselves, never as means to an end.” From that perspective, killing an animal for food would be inherently morally wrong, because you're treating the animal as a means to an end.

Meanwhile, a utilitarian is someone who thinks that an action is moral if it produces good consequences — and behaving morally means producing the most happiness or well-being possible, or reducing the most suffering possible. Utilitarian philosophers like Peter Singer argue that we should be reducing, and ideally eliminating, the suffering that animals endure at our hands.

Deontologists and utilitarians are often pitted against each other, but they actually have one big thing in common: They both believe in a universal moral principle — whether it's “always treat others as ends in themselves” or “always maximize happiness.”

A lot of people find that comforting, because it offers certainty about how we should act. Even if acting morally requires hard sacrifices, it's incredibly soothing to think “If I just do X, then I'll know for sure that I'm being a good person!”

But these moral theories assume that all the complexity of human life can be reduced to one tidy formula. Can it, really?

Another school of philosophy — pragmatism — says we should be skeptical of fixed moral principles. Human life is so complicated, with many different factors at play in any ethical dilemma, so we should be pluralistic about what makes outcomes valuable instead of acting like the only thing that matters is maximizing a single value (say, happiness). And human society is always evolving, so a moral idea that makes sense in one context may no longer make sense in a different context. To a pragmatist, moral truths are contingent, not universal and unchanging.

I think one pragmatist who can really help you out is the University of Michigan's Elizabeth Anderson. In a 2005 essay applying pragmatism to the question of eating meat, the philosopher points out that for most of human history, we couldn't have survived and thrived without killing or exploiting animals for food, transportation, and energy. The social conditions for granting animals moral rights didn't really exist on a mass scale until recently (although certain non-Western societies did ascribe moral worth to some animals).

“The possibility of moralizing our relations to animals (other than our pets),” Anderson writes, “has come to us only lately, and even then not to us all, and not with respect to all animal species.”

In other words, Anderson doesn't think there's some universal rule like “eating animals is inherently morally wrong.” It's our social and technological circumstances that have made us more able than before to see animals as part of our moral circle. She also doesn't believe there's a single yardstick — like sentience or intelligence — by which we can judge how much of our moral concern an animal deserves. That's because moral evaluation isn't just about animals' intrinsic capacities, but also about their relationships to us. It matters whether we've made them dependent on us by domesticating them, say, or whether they live independently in the wild.

It also matters whether they're fundamentally hostile to us. Killing bedbugs? Totally fine! They may be sentient, but, Anderson writes, “We are in a permanent state of war with them, without possibility of negotiating for peace. To one-sidedly accommodate their interests…would amount to surrender.”

Anderson's point is not that animals' intelligence and sentience don't matter. It's that lots of other things matter, too, including our own ability to thrive.

With this pragmatic approach in mind, you can consider how to balance your concern for animal welfare with your concern for your own welfare. Instead of thinking in terms of a moral absolute that would force you into a “purist” diet no matter the cost to you, you can consider a “reducetarian” diet, which allows you to ease your own struggle while also taking care for animals seriously.

The key thing to realize is that some types of animal consumption cause a lot less suffering than others.

For one thing, if you're eating meat, try to buy the pasture-raised kind and not the kind that comes from factory farms — the huge industrialized facilities that supply 99 percent of America's meat. In these facilities, animals are tightly packed together and live under unbelievably harsh and unsanitary conditions. They're also often mutilated without pain relief: Think pigs being castrated, cows being dehorned, and hens being debeaked. Oh, and chickens have been bred to be so big that they're in constant pain; they live miserable lives from start to finish.

A pasture-raised label doesn't mean an animal has been spared all of the harms of modern agriculture — it doesn't guarantee that pain relief is used for painful procedures, and farm animals across different production systems have been bred to maximize production, which can take a toll on their welfare. And of course they'll ultimately meet the same fate as those raised on factory farms — slaughter. But your goal here is to meaningfully reduce, not 100 percent eliminate, the harms. And at least pasture-raised animals have gotten to roam around in a field and engage in natural behaviors up until the end.

It's a similar story for fish, by the way. More than half of the fish we eat comes from fish farms, which are basically just underwater factory farms. Wild-caught fish is not perfect — slow, suffocating deaths are common — but it's better than farmed.

The caveat here is that a lot of the welfare labels you'll see on animal products are basically a con. And some certification schemes have similar names, so you have to pay close attention. If you see the label “Certified Humane,” that's genuinely higher-welfare — but don't mistake it for “American Humane Certified,” which is really not. And be wary of putting much stock in labels like “cage-free” or “free-range.” They're better than nothing, but because the terms are often ill-defined and unenforced, they're not as meaningful as you might think. Here's a good guide to separating the real deal from the advertising spin.

Another classic recommendation among animal welfare advocates is to eat bigger animals — in other words, go for beef rather than chicken. That's both because of how miserable chickens' lives are on factory farms and because, as Vox's Kelsey Piper has written, it just takes way more chicken lives than cow lives to feed people. Cows are huge, producing about 500 pounds of beef apiece, while a chicken yields only a few pounds of meat. So, every year, the average American eats about 23 chickens and just over one-tenth of one cow.

That said, cows take a heavier toll on the climate than chickens do, so you don't want to eat tons of beef either. The environment is also one of the key values at stake in our consumption choices, so that has to factor in, too.

Of course, another possibility — to the extent that this works with your gastrointestinal issues — is to reach for low-fiber plant-based foods like tofu, seitan, and the smorgasbord of newer products now available (like Beyond and Impossible burgers).

But assuming you're going to eat meat, it's a good idea to set some clear parameters and standards around your reducetarian diet. A lot of reducetarians — myself included — have fallen into the trap of saying, “I'll reduce how much meat I eat,” but forgetting to quantify what that means. That can lead you to eat more meat than you'd intended. So it's probably better to commit to something like “weekday vegetarian” or “vegan before six” — you can check out the Reducetarian Foundation for suggestions.

At the end of the day, remember that there's a plurality of values at stake here, and no one of them necessarily trumps all the others. If you feel that eating some meat is important for your well-being right now, and you try to do that in ways that keep suffering for animals to a minimum, I don't think you need to feel bad about that. That's because you won't be shirking your values: You'll be recognizing that your values are plural, and you're doing your best to balance between them. That may be the best any of us can really do.

Why focusing only on what's broken blinds us to what's fixable.

Over the past week or so, the US economy took a major hit, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was no longer in the business of caring about the environment, and the only thing the internet can talk about is Sydney Sweeney. But here's the thing: Even amid the constant deluge of news that alternates between the negative and the just silly, there's another story unfolding. It's quieter, slower, less flashy, but it's real, and it matters. And that's the story of progress.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

That's why a few months ago I launched Good News, Vox's weekly newsletter dedicated not to ignoring our often difficult reality, but to placing it in the broader context it deserves. This past Monday, Good News got the Unexplainable treatment, as Vox's excellent science podcast invited me on to discuss why, exactly, we find good news so elusive.

It's not just the media's bias — although, as I confessed to Unexplainable's Meradith Hoddinott, that's undeniably a part of it. After nearly 25 years in journalism, I've learned that the press is fundamentally a watchdog, conditioned to bark loudest when things go wrong. But there's also a deeper reason: our own negativity bias. Humans are hardwired to focus on threats, an evolutionary adaptation that once kept us alive on the savannah but now leaves us doomscrolling through headlines.

In the Unexplainable episode, Meredith and I explored this psychological quirk, highlighting stories of genuine progress that usually slip under the radar. Like this one: despite fears about rising crime, the murder rate in the US is potentially on track to hit historic lows. And despite the worsening effects of climate change and the proliferation of billion-dollar disasters, fewer people globally died from extreme weather in the first half of 2025 than in any comparable period on record.

Why spotlight developments like these, which can feel like the opposite of news? Because focusing only on what's broken can blind us to what's fixable. Realistic optimism isn't naïve; it's necessary. It fuels the belief that problems, even enormous ones, are solvable, which in turn inspires action. And, as I've discovered writing the Good News newsletter, this optimism can act like armor, helping us face a challenging, sometimes frightening future with greater resilience.

It's why Good News felt like a natural outgrowth of our work here at Future Perfect, where above all we want to capture an accurate view of the world as it is — the bad and the good. So, give the episode a listen — you'll hear us break down the science of negativity and the underappreciated power of hope. And, of course, subscribe to Good News.

In this article

Nvidia's chips pose security concerns for China, a social media account affiliated with China's state media said on Sunday, after Beijing raised concerns over backdoor access in those chips.

The H20 chips are also not technologically advanced or environmentally friendly, the account, Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said in an article published on WeChat.

""When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it,"" the article concluded.

Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

H20 artificial intelligence chips were developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on advanced AI chips in late 2023. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump banned their sales in April amid escalating trade tensions with China, but reversed the ban in July.

China's cyberspace watchdog said on July 31 that it had summoned Nvidia to a meeting, asking the U.S. chipmaker to explain whether its H20 chips had any backdoor security risks — a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls.

Nvidia later said its products had no ""backdoors"" that would allow remote access or control.

In its article, Yuyuan Tantian said Nvidia chips could achieve functions including ""remote shutdown"" through a hardware ""backdoor.""

Yuyuan Tantian's comment followed criticism against Nvidia by People's Daily, another Chinese state media outlet.

In a commentary earlier this month, People's Daily said Nvidia must produce ""convincing security proofs"" to eliminate Chinese users' worries over security risks in its chips and regain market trust.

China wants the United States to ease export controls on chips critical for artificial intelligence as part of a trade deal before a possible summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.

Chinese officials have told experts in Washington that Beijing wants the Trump administration to relax export restrictions on high-bandwidth memory chips, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.

The White House, State Department and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.

HBM chips, which help perform data-intensive AI tasks quickly, are closely watched by investors due to their use alongside AI graphic processors, particularly Nvidia's.

The FT said China is concerned because the U.S. HBM controls hamper the ability of Chinese companies such as Huawei to develop their own AI chips.

Successive U.S. administrations have curbed exports of advanced chips to China, looking to stymie Beijing's AI and defense development.

While this has impacted U.S. firms' ability to fully address booming demand from China, one of the world's largest semiconductor markets, it still remains an important revenue driver for American chipmakers.

Liu Jianchao, a senior Chinese diplomat widely seen as a potential future foreign minister, has been taken away by authorities for questioning, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Liu was taken away after returning to Beijing in late July from an overseas work trip, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party International Liaison Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Liu, 61, has led the Communist Party's body in charge of managing ties with foreign political parties. Since taking the role in 2022, he has travelled to more than 20 nations and met officials from more than 160 countries.

Liu's busy schedule, especially his meetings with the former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, stoked expectations that the former ambassador and ministry spokesman was being groomed to be the next foreign minister.

His detention marks the highest-level probe involving a diplomat since China ousted its former foreign minister and President Xi Jinping's protégé, Qin Gang, in 2023 following rumors of an extramarital affair.

Born in the northeastern province of Jilin, Liu majored in English at Beijing Foreign Studies University and studied international relations at Oxford before taking up his first post as a translator with the foreign ministry.

He has served in China's mission to Britain and later as ambassador to Indonesia and the Philippines.

During his time as ministry spokesman, he was known for humorous off-the-cuff comments while making a no-nonsense defense of China's interests.

Maddy Lopez, a bartender in Los Angeles, has spent 25 years working in the restaurant industry, where tips can make up a significant portion of a worker's income. 

When she heard about President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill,"" which includes a section called ""no tax on tips,"" she said her first reaction was: ""It's a little too good to be true.""

Lopez said that in her experience, tax breaks often seem to include ""a catch,"" and she isn't sure the benefit will be as generous as some workers expect.

It's a reasonable question, experts say: Some key details of the provision — including which occupations and kinds of gratuities may qualify — are still unclear. There's also some confusion among workers about how the tax break works.

More from Personal Finance:What private assets in 401(k) plans mean for investorsEducation Department launches college financial aid form Trump's 'big beautiful bill' slashes this tax break for high earners in 2026

T. Cooper, a hair and makeup stylist in New York City, said that the measure is ""being perceived incorrectly"" among tipped workers she knows. 

""A lot of people don't understand that you will still have to pay the tax on tips,"" she said.

Both Republicans and Democrats floated the ""no tax on tips"" idea during the 2024 presidential campaign.

The ""no tax on tips"" provision in Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" provides a deduction worth up to $25,000. This tax break, which is available even if you don't itemize deductions, reduces taxable income.

The deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000. The law is also temporary; the tax break is available from 2025 through 2028.

However, ""you're still likely paying state taxes"" on tip income, and you'll owe payroll levies for Medicare and Social Security, said Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner with advisor platform Kitces.com, who analyzed the legislation.

Deductible tips must appear on information returns from your employer, such as Form W-2 or 1099. But the agency's reporting rules for tip income remain unclear, experts say. For example, questions remain about how employers need to report tips on Forms W-2 or 1099 to qualify for the deduction.

Currently, workers who make $20 or more per month in tips must report those earnings to employers, according to the IRS. Tips can include cash directly paid by customers, payouts from tip-sharing structures among employees and credit card payments.

The IRS is expected to clarify which occupations qualify for the tax break in early October, per the agency.

According to the provision, ""qualified tips"" include cash or gratuity paid by credit card, as well as earnings from a sharing arrangement.

But it also says tips must be paid voluntarily by the customer. That puts automatic service charges — like mandatory gratuity charges restaurants impose on larger parties — in question, experts say.

Adding to the reporting confusion, it's not unusual for those kinds of mandatory gratuities to mix with other tip income and simply appear as tips on tax forms, Lopez, the bartender, said of her experience. 

In some industries, tipping has decreased as consumer sentiment declines. During the second quarter of 2025, the average tip across restaurants, cafes and bars was at 14.99%, down from 15.17% the prior quarter, according to a new report by Square, a technology services company.

""As consumer confidence in the economy shifts and tips fall, workers are taking home less,"" Ming-Tai Huh, head of food and beverage at Square, wrote in the report.

Some consumers are also experiencing ""tipping fatigue."" About 41% of Americans said that ""tipping is out of control"" in 2025, up from 25% last year, according to a Bankrate report.

Some workers say higher service costs and reduced consumer spending have contributed to these tipping trends.

In the hair industry, prices typically rise every year as the cost of materials, rent and services go up, said Cooper. 

""So it's not that people have an issue with tipping,"" she said. ""The service overall has just become way more expensive.""

In restaurants and bars, it's not unusual to see smaller checks these days, Lopez said, which makes your tip average decline.

For example, previously, a $200 tab could earn $40 in tips. But nowadays, a typical tab could be $100, she said, and ""you're only making $20 on the same guest.""

In the world of online payments, the buzzword these days is frictionless, as companies entice customers with increasingly convenient online payment options. Think the online equivalent of a biometric handwave: the fewer steps involved, the more customers will buy, experts say. With that aim in mind, the growing presence of generative AI such as ChatGPT in the shopping ecosystem may next take a shape that has a seismic impact on the economic model of internet retail.

Currently, a search for a large London Fog men's coat on ChatGPT will bring up a purchase option, but you still have to click over to London Fog's site to complete the transaction. But that may soon change.

Gen AI search engine Perplexity already has a deal with PayPal for this kind of function, allowing online shoppers to make purchases such as concert tickets and travel directly in chat, with payments completed with PayPal or Venmo, and PayPal handling the processing, shipping, tracking, and invoicing.

The Financial Times reported last month that an integrated checkout system is coming to ChatGPT, with partners such as Shopify, so that users can complete the transaction within the platform. Merchants will pay a commission to OpenAI. OpenAI and Shopify have not confirmed the plans. The AI company has already worked with Shopify on an AI assistant for internet sales.

OpenAI has already rolled out several features designed to enhance shopping and other consumer experiences, and experts say that in one form or another, this further use of gen AI in retail's future should be expected, and companies need to be planning for the consequences today.

""Enabling customers to purchase without leaving the chat will have a significant impact on the sales cycle,"" said Elizabeth Perkins, professor of practice of business administration and economics at Roanoke College. But she added that from a marketing perspective, any time you consolidate or eliminate a part of the purchase cycle, you get your customer that much closer to spending money. ""No more time-consuming steps. Customers get what they want faster, with less hassle, and honestly, with less chance of changing their mind,"" Perkins said. 

Perikins says that payment interfaces like Venmo or Apple Pay could be disrupted. But Paul McAdam, J.D. Power's senior director of banking intelligence, says he thinks that while AI checkout capabilities will disrupt the checkout ecosystem, big players will find a way to stay in the game.

""This is one more competitor looking for a slice of the pie. It will be fascinating to see how banks react to this. There will be a shakeout,"" but he added, ""PayPal, Apple, and Google are pretty entrenched, so I don't think they are going anywhere. This will affect the upstarts the most, some of which will probably get gobbled up by larger competitors.""

At eBay, AI checkout is not being viewed as a threat, but as a sign of further innovation in the industry.

""AI is proving great at speeding up workflows and generating ideas. We believe the true magic lies in blending that speed and scale with trusted, expert, enthusiast communities,"" said Blair Ethington, vice president of the company's focus categories and buyer experience division.

Ethington says that eBay will be investing heavily in an increased AI experience at checkout that delivers real-time, hyper-personalized product picks and guidance tuned to each buyer's shopping preferences. ""Ultimately, we believe our scale, unique inventory, and trusted community position us extremely well to thrive in an agentic commerce future,"" Ethington said.

PayPal pointed to its deal with Perplexity as a sign of its embrace of the gen AI feature rather than viewing it as a threat. ""We're partnering with some of the biggest players in this space, like Perplexity, to deliver personalized, secure, and seamless payments and commerce experiences to our network of more than 400 million consumers and merchants worldwide,"" said a PayPal spokesperson.

In one form or another, the checkout experience online is ripe for change, according to Dee Waddell, global managing director of travel & transportation industries at IBM. ""Consumers are no longer satisfied with the status quo,"" said Waddell, citing a recent IBM study that shows only 14% of consumers say they're satisfied with their e-commerce experience. ""They're demanding seamless, hyper-personalized experiences across every touchpoint, and retailers must lean into AI to meet those expectations,""  Waddell said.

IBM's retail clients are prioritizing AI to deliver a seamless experience throughout the entire customer journey. ""I believe we're on the cusp of a revolution, where generative AI platforms like ChatGPT will act as 'personal assistants' to streamline the digital shopping experience from product discovery to fulfillment,""  Waddell said.

The online shopping experience of the future could feature a consumer going into ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude to ask for gift ideas. Then, Waddell says, without ever leaving the chat, they'll receive personalized recommendations, confirm their payment method easily, verify their shipping address, and complete the purchase.  

""In this new model, the AI personal assistant becomes the marketplace. This means retailers will need to solidify their ecosystem and channel strategies,""  Waddell said, adding that companies will either need to partner with channel providers that want to work with generative AI companies or go directly to AI providers themselves. ""This will be a key part of staying relevant and delivering the integrated shopping experiences that consumers are demanding,"" Waddell said.

Alex Graf, co-founder and CEO of digital commerce platform Spryker and author of ""The E-Commerce Book,"" says this is the beginning of a seismic shift in how people will shop online. But he says the focus on the threat to payment processors misses the biggest disruptive outcome from the shift.

""We're witnessing a structural shift in the e-commerce value chain, and ChatGPT is right at the center of it. The old game was about who could close the sale. The new game is about who controls the pre-sale and gets the user's attention first,"" Graf said, adding that this is where the LLMs will disrupt the incumbents. Increasingly, Graf says, it will be ChatGPT and Claude that will guide discovery, curate choices, and compress decision-making for customers.

""For ecommerce players who've relied on 'watch time' to keep users browsing, like Amazon, Etsy, or even Shopify storefronts, this is an existential threat,"" Graf said.

""Users who previously started their search on e-commerce platforms are now starting with AI. And here's the kicker: selling the product isn't where the margin is anymore. It's selling the eyeballs,""  Graf said, noting that ads that appear inside ecommerce ecosystems have become a $50 billion market globally.

""Amazon's most profitable business isn't Prime or AWS, it's retail media,"" Graf said.

Amazon is investing heavily in its own generative AI features for shopping and has made significant investments in gen AI companies including Anthropic.

Graf says that when a gen AI like ChatGPT becomes the ""new homepage"" of commerce, it doesn't need to sell products directly.

""It just needs to own the watch time, then monetize via paid placements, affiliate links, and product recommendations, just like Amazon does internally. This re-routes billions in potential retail media revenue toward whoever owns that conversational layer,""  Graf said.

Amazon's ads business has been a bright spot within earnings in recent quarters.

Graf says fintech players like PayPal or Zelle, the online payment app run by a consortium of major banks, will be impacted, but indirectly. Once ChatGPT, or similar AI agents, corner end-to-end shopping, there's less space for third-party payment tools.

""Integrated systems or AI-native wallets may eat that slice of the pie over time,"" Graf said.

The ultimate winners, he says, will be those who can monetize attention and intention, not just transactions.

A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.

Artificial intelligence startups have minted dozens of new billionaires this year, adding to an AI boom that's quickly becoming the largest wealth creation spree in recent history.

Blockbuster fundraising rounds this year for Anthropic, Safe Superintelligence, OpenAI, Anysphere and other startups have created vast new paper fortunes and propelled valuations to record levels. There are now 498 AI ""unicorns,"" or private AI companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, with a combined value of $2.7 trillion, according to CB Insights. Fully 100 of them were founded since 2023. There are more than 1,300 AI startups with valuations of over $100 million, the firm said.

Combined with the soaring stock prices of Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and other publicly traded AI-related firms, along with the infrastructure companies that are building data centers and computing power and the huge payouts for AI engineers, AI is creating personal wealth on a scale that makes the past two tech waves look like warmups.

""Going back over 100 years of data, we have never seen wealth created at this size and speed,"" said Andrew McAfee, principal researcher at MIT. ""It's unprecedented.""

A new crop of billionaires is rising with sky-rocketing valuations. In March, Bloomberg estimated that four of the largest private AI companies had created at least 15 billionaires with a combined net worth of $38 billion. More than a dozen unicorns have been crowned since then.

Mira Murati, who left Open AI last September, launched Thinking Machines Lab in February. By July, she raised $2 billion in the largest seed round in history, giving the company a $12 billion valuation, according to reports.

Anthropic AI is in talks to raise $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion, nearly three times its valuation in March. CEO Dario Amodei and its six other founders are now likely multibillionaires, according to people familiar with the company.

Anysphere was valued at $9.9 billion in a June fundraise and just weeks later was reportedly offered a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion, likely making its 25-year-old founder and CEO, Michael Truell, a billionaire.

Granted, most of the AI wealth creation is in private companies, making it difficult for equity holders and founders to cash out. Unlike the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when a flood of companies went public, today's AI startups can stay private for longer given the constant investment from venture capital funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and other tech investors.

At the same time, the rapid growth of secondary markets is allowing equity owners of private companies to sell their shares to other investors and provide liquidity. Structured secondary sales or tender offers are becoming widespread. Many founders can also borrow against their equity.

Open AI is holding talks for a secondary share sale to provide cash to employees. Its proposed valuation of $500 billion follows the company's fundraise in March that provided a $300 billion valuation.

Dozens of private firms are being acquired or merging, also providing liquidity. After Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, founder Alexandr Wang joined Meta's AI team. There have been 73 liquidity events — including mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, reverse mergers or corporate majority stakes — since 2023, according to CB Insights. Following the Meta deal, Scale AI's co-founder, Lucy Guo, who left the company in 2018, bought a mansion in LA's Hollywood Hills for around $30 million.

Still, the AI surge is largely centered in the Bay Area, reminiscent of the dot-com era. Last year, Silicon Valley companies raised more than $35 billion in venture funding, according to the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies. San Francisco now has more billionaires than New York, with 82 compared with New York's 66, according to New World Wealth and Henley & Partners. The Bay Area's millionaire population has doubled over the past decade, compared with New York's growth of 45%.

More homes sold above $20 million in San Francisco last year than in any other year in history, according to Sotheby's International Realty. Rising rents, home prices and demand in the city, attributed in large part to AI, mark a sharp turnaround for a city facing a ""doom loop"" just a few years ago.

""It's astonishing how geographically concentrated this AI wave is,"" said McAfee, who is also co-director of MIT's Initiative on the Digital Economy. ""The people who know how to found and fund and grow tech companies are there. I've heard people say for 25 years 'This is the end of the Silicon Valley' or some other place is 'the new Silicon Valley.' But Silicon Valley is still Silicon Valley.""

With time, and initial public offerings, many of today's private AI fortunes will eventually become more liquid, providing a historic opportunity for wealth management firms. All of the major private banks, wirehouses, independent advisors and boutique firms are cozying up to the AI elite in hopes of winning their business, according to tech advisors.

Like the dot-com millionaires, however, luring the AI wealthy may be challenging for traditional wealth management companies. Simon Krinsky, executive managing director at Pathstone and former managing director at Hall Capital Partners in San Francisco, said most AI wealth is locked up in private companies and therefore can't be turned into wealth management accounts.

""I would say a much higher percentage of the ultimate wealth being created is illiquid,"" he said. ""There are ways of getting liquidity, but it's tiny compared to being employed at Meta or Google"" or another megacap publicly traded tech company.

Eventually, those fortunes will become liquid and prized by wealth management firms. Krinsky said the AI wealthy are likely to follow similar client patterns as the newly rich dot-commers of the 1990s. Initially, the dot-commers used their excess liquidity and assets to invest in similar tech companies they knew through their networks, colleagues or shared investors. He said the same is likely true for the AI wealthy.

""Everybody turned around and invested with their friends in the same kind of companies that created their own wealth,"" he said.

After discovering the perils of having all their wealth concentrated in one highly volatile and speculative industry, the dot-commers turned to wealth management. And being born disruptors, many turned their capital and skills toward reinventing the wealth management industry in their image. Netscape founder Jim Clark, for instance, helped launch MyCFO, a response to his dislike of bankers and the industry.

Krinksy said today's AI entrepreneurs are likely to follow the same path, with huge potential for AI to disrupt — if not replace — many of the traditional functions of wealth management.

Ultimately, however, the ultra-wealthy AI founders will discover the need for the traditional, personalized service that only dedicated wealth management teams can provide, whether it's around taxes, inheritances and estate planning, or philanthropy advice and portfolio construction.

""After people were beaten up or bruised up in the early 2000s, they came around to appreciating some degree of diversification and maybe hiring a professional manager to protect them from themselves,"" Krinksy said. ""I anticipate a similar trend with the AI group.""

Updated on:  August 10, 2025 / 12:13 PM EDT
          / CBS News
        

Earlier this year, more than 35,000 bitcoin enthusiasts descended on Las Vegas for Bitcoin 2025 – the largest-ever gathering of its kind, attracting an eclectic mix of high rollers ... and true believers.

""Your goal should be to own at least one bitcoin, because by the time you retire, that can be worth 20, 30 million,"" said Michael Terpin. 

Guy Malone said, ""You can't change the Bible; it changes you. The same is true of bitcoin.""

But everyone here seems to agree on one thing: President Donald Trump's reelection has been like hitting the jackpot. As Vice President JD Vance told the crowd, ""I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.""

Once dismissed by investors, and still baffling to many Americans, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have won over supporters from Wall Street to Washington. In July, the president signed the Genius Act, which opens the door for companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon to issue their own digital currencies.

And Congress is debating another bill that, for the first time, aims to regulate cryptocurrency trading – this after the industry spent more than $167 million on behalf of crypto-friendly candidates ahead of last year's election.

Asked how people should think of cryptocurrencies, Amanda Fischer, who served as a top official in the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration, replied, ""You could think of it as gambling, you could think of it as a collectible, you could think of it as a type of investment. But I think what's important to understand is that crypto is highly volatile. It's highly speculative. 

""Crypto is often marketed to individuals as an investment opportunity that will yield them the possibility of great returns,"" she said. ""But unlike, say, a stock, which represents a part-ownership of a company, [crypto] is not backed by any sort of business that is producing goods and services.""

 Unlike hard currencies like the dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies only exist online, and are issued by individuals and companies, not central banks. And yet, billions of dollars' worth of crypto are traded every day. ""The number of scams, the types of scams, the sophistication of scams are so rife and plentiful that the capacity to lose your money in a crypto investment is substantially higher than if you're just investing in stocks and bonds,"" Fischer said. 

During the Biden administration, the SEC cracked down on the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump administration has changed course, dismissing the largest outstanding cases, which Fischer says leaves consumers more vulnerable.

I asked, ""We are seeing leaders in crypto say we want to be regulated. And there is legislation currently here in Washington underway to regulate cryptocurrency. They say they want laws passed.""

""They want laws that they write to be passed,"" said Fischer. ""So, the legislation currently being considered in Washington, D.C., is written by and for the crypto industry.""

David Bailey, who runs the bitcoin conference and is CEO of a bitcoin holding company called Nakamoto, said, ""I wish that was the case, that'd be fantastic. But no, it's not true.""

Like many crypto entrepreneurs, Bailey now calls Puerto Rico home. ""It started because of the taxes,"" he said. ""Now, it's like the place to do business.""

But the 34-year-old's real claim to fame might be his role in convincing a skeptical President Trump (who in June 2021 told Fox Business Channel that bitcoin ""just seems like a scam"") to go all-in on bitcoin during the 2024 campaign. Asked what he told Mr. Trump to convince him to support crypto, Bailey replied, ""First off, no one convinces the president of anything. He makes up his own mind about things. A lot of people, especially in Washington, have missed how big this has gotten. And so, we made the case to the president about how many people hold this asset. He saw the opportunity that was here by embracing this industry. And I think we had a big part of swinging the election in his direction.""

The Federal Reserve says only eight percent of Americans have bought or held cryptocurrency in the last year, and only two percent have ever used it to buy anything. But digital assets are increasingly part of the economy. You may now be able to use crypto as collateral for a mortgage, and this past week the president signed an executive order to make it easier to hold cryptocurrencies in your 401(k).

All the attention has helped drive the price of bitcoin to an all-time high, recently passing $120,000 each.

Bailey says bitcoin was about $10 when he first bought it. Asked how much he bought, he replied, ""Well, you know, that's something I'm not going to talk about on camera. Not enough, let's just go like that. Not enough.""

And as crypto's fortunes have improved, so have the president's; CBS News estimates that crypto ventures controlled by the Trump family have made up to $765 million in revenue from token sales since the fall of 2024.

The White House did not respond to questions about the token sales, but in a statement told CBS News, ""Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.""

Most experts in government ethics believe the situation is unprecedented.

I asked Bailey, ""Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the president has changed his position on bitcoin and crypto because he can personally benefit from it, or his family can?""

""No, absolutely not,"" said Bailey. ""I don't think he embraced this industry to enrich himself; I think that he just sees the same potential that I see. When you get excited about an idea, you feel compelled to do something about it."" 

And that potential is why investors are betting that crypto will soon become part of everyday life. Vice President Vance told the audience at Bitcoin 2025, ""We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.""

But for Amanda Fischer, that's a gamble not worth taking.

""We heard the same thing about subprime mortgages going into 2008,"" said Fischer. ""We heard the same thing about complex financial derivatives going into the last crisis, too. These products are wonderful and there are ways to extract so much value in wealth, until they're not. And I fear that crypto is going to follow down the same path. Things are going great many times, until they're not.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Tuur Demeester Forecasts $500K Bitcoin in Mid-Cycle Rally","https://bitbo.io/news/tuur-demeester-500k-bitcoin/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 14:00:25 GMT","

Bitcoin's current bull cycle may be far from its climax, according to a new report by Tuur Demeester and Adamant Research.

The analysts argue the market is in a phase of “mid-cycle strength,” with price targets extending to $500,000 and beyond.

The Adamant Research report, led by Demeester, suggests Bitcoin could appreciate 4–10x from current levels.

Several metrics back this outlook, including on-chain indicators like HODLer Net Position Change and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), which currently signals that 50–70% of the supply remains in profit—indicative of mid-cycle optimism rather than a market top.

Demeester notes:

“We think this is the mid-cycle in what could become one of the most significant bull runs in bitcoin's history. From its current range, we believe there is still a path toward a 4-10x value appreciation, which would imply bitcoin price targets north of $500,000.”

Potential risks such as large exchange hacks or bankruptcy coin distributions are seen as unlikely to derail the bull market.

Recent events like the Mt. Gox distribution and a July 2025 liquidation of 80,000 BTC only moved the price by 4%.

Meanwhile, the report highlights that around 10% of the total supply is held by Coinbase, raising some centralization concerns, but notes that ETF issuers are diversifying custody options.

Demeester and his team recommend an exclusive focus on Bitcoin, dismissing alternative assets as lacking the network effect, security, and monetary purity of BTC.

They highlight the surge in institutional adoption, rising fiscal deficits, and the growing trend of governments, such as the U.S., integrating Bitcoin into policy—citing the National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and rapid ETF uptake, now holding about 1.4 million BTC.

The report suggests investors consider a 5% Bitcoin allocation as systemic risk insurance, with higher allocations denoting higher conviction.

For custody, collaborative multi-signature setups are advised for new adopters to balance safety and sovereignty.

Demeester concludes that, with strong macro tailwinds and institutional demand, Bitcoin's “mid-cycle” position sets the stage for potentially historic gains over the next several years.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","How high will Ethereum price go after breaking $4K? ETH analysts weigh in","https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-high-can-the-ethereum-price-after-4k-go-analysts-weigh-in","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 15:27:15 GMT","

 Ethereum bulls make a strong case for an ETH price rally toward $10,000 or above in the next six to eight months. 

Key takeaways:

Ethereum is breaking out across multiple bullish setups on the price chart.

Analysts see ETH rising to $6,000 soon, with $20,000 possible within a year.

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has surged roughly 24% this week to above $4,330, its highest price since December 2021. Many analysts now eye a break above the record $4,950 level next.

Ethereum is showing signals of breaking out of its prevailing Wyckoff Accumulation pattern, according to analyst Lord Hawkins.

The ETH/USD pair has been trading inside a large accumulation range for months, steadily absorbing selling pressure. This phase often ends with a decisive breakout once buyers gain control, according to Wyckoff theory.

That breakout appears to be underway, with ETH pushing above the $4,200 resistance zone, a stage known as the “Sign of Strength” (SOS). 

In Wyckoff's model, this is typically followed by a brief pullback, or “Last Point of Support” (LPS), to confirm the new uptrend.

If the LPS holds, price enters the markup phase, where gains accelerate as demand overwhelms supply. Measuring the height of the accumulation range gives a technical target near $6,000.

As of Sunday, ETH was breaking above the upper trendline of its multi-year symmetrical triangle, located in the $4,000–$4,200 zone, according to analysts Crypto Rover and Titan of Crypto.

The breakout suggests a potential measured move equal to the triangle's maximum height, pointing toward the $8,000 region in the coming months. That is up by over 90% from the current price levels.

Historically, such long-term breakouts on ETH's higher timeframes have preceded strong multimonth rallies, especially when confirmed by increasing volume and favorable macro sentiment.

In April 2020, ETH broke out of a symmetrical triangle, surging more than 950% to hit its projected target, and climbing even higher as bullish sentiment intensified.

Ethereum may be on track for a run toward $20,000 within 6-8 months from now, if historical price fractals play out. 

Analyst Nilesh Verma highlights the repeating pattern, where ETH rallies sharply after retesting a major bottom support.

In January 2017 and April 2020, such retests preceded parabolic uptrends, delivering gains of over 8,000% and 950%, respectively. Both moves lasted roughly 12 months before topping out.

ETH repeated the same “bottom retest” setup in April 2025, bouncing strongly from the $1,750–$1,850 zone. A sustained rally could unfold through April 2026, with the fractal's measured move targeting “$10,000 minimum” and $20,000 in the best-case scenario.

Popular analyst Merlijn The Trader also predicts Ethereum to hit $20,000, citing the cryptocurrency's multiyear rising channel.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Vitalik Buterin Regains Billionaire Status As Ethereum Hits Multi-Year Highs","https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-regains-billionaire-status-ethereum/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 08:00:02 GMT","

Ethereum has soared to a multi-year high, touching the $4,330 level — its highest price since November 2021. This milestone not only reinforces ETH's dominant position in the crypto market but also marks the return of co-founder Vitalik Buterin to billionaire status, with his publicly known wallets now valued above the billion-dollar mark.

Since April, Ethereum has delivered a staggering gain of over 200%, outpacing most major cryptocurrencies and reigniting bullish sentiment across the market. Analysts attribute the rally to strong fundamentals, including increasing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), the rapid growth of layer-2 scaling solutions, and rising institutional interest.

The rally comes amid tightening supply dynamics, with exchange balances dropping to multi-year lows, suggesting that long-term holders and institutional players are accumulating aggressively. On-chain data points to sustained network activity and expanding use cases, adding fuel to the bullish outlook.

Many market watchers believe Ethereum is setting up for further gains, potentially challenging its all-time highs in the months ahead. As the ecosystem continues to expand and regulatory clarity improves, ETH appears poised to remain at the center of the next major wave in crypto growth.

According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, Buterin holds approximately 240,000 ETH, alongside other digital assets such as MOODENG and DINU. At current market prices, his ETH holdings alone are worth around $1 billion, cementing his status as one of the wealthiest figures in crypto — at least on-chain.

The surge in ETH's price comes after a series of volatile moves earlier this year that left some questioning the sustainability of the rally. However, the latest breakout above $4,300 suggests strong underlying momentum. Institutional adoption is playing a crucial role, with public companies like Sharplink Gaming adding Ethereum to their balance sheets as part of their treasury strategy. This marks a notable shift in corporate crypto allocation trends, where ETH is increasingly seen not just as a speculative asset but as a core long-term holding.

With on-chain data pointing to robust network activity, the supply-demand dynamics appear favorable for continued gains. As institutions, public companies, and long-term holders continue to accumulate, Ethereum's bullish narrative remains intact — and Buterin's billion-dollar stake is now riding the wave.

Ethereum (ETH) has surged to $4,242, marking its highest level since November 2021 and confirming a major breakout on the weekly chart. The rally, driven by strong bullish momentum, saw ETH climb over 21% in the past week, decisively breaking through the $3,860 resistance level that had capped price advances earlier in the year.

The breakout is supported by rising volume, signaling robust buying interest. ETH is now trading well above its 50-, 100-, and 200-week moving averages, which are all sloping upward — a classic sign of a strong uptrend. This alignment suggests that the medium- to long-term trend remains firmly bullish.

If momentum continues, the next significant target lies near the $4,800–$4,900 range, aligning with the previous all-time highs. However, after such a steep move, short-term consolidation is possible, with $3,860 now acting as a key support level. A deeper pullback could retest $2,852, but this scenario would likely require a broader market correction.

Fundamental Global, a Nasdaq-listed financial services provider, filed a $5 billion shelf registration statement with the US SEC this week as part of its ongoing effort to scale its Ethereum accumulation strategy.

The company, soon to be renamed FG Nexus, aims to become the world's largest corporate holder of ETH, targeting a 10% stake in the network.

Achieving this goal would make Fundamental Global one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum, in the company of BitMine, which holds $3.5 billion, and SharpLink, which owns $2.2 billion.

The shelf registration, one of the largest in the digital asset treasury space, includes an “at-the-market” prospectus covering up to $4 billion in common stock sales. This structure gives Fundamental Global the flexibility to raise funds over time, allowing the company to move quickly when market conditions are favorable.

The remaining capacity could be issued as preferred stock, debt, or other securities.

“This $5 billion shelf filing represents a significant step in our capital raising capabilities and positions us to move with speed and scale when capital deployment opportunities arise,” said Kyle Cerminara, CEO and Chairman of Fundamental Global, in a statement. “We believe this framework will enable us to capitalize on ETH accumulation opportunities and support our target of a 10% stake in the Ethereum Network.”

According to Maja Vujinovic, head of the company's Digital Assets Division, institutional adoption of digital assets is accelerating, creating a favorable backdrop for Fundamental's capital deployment plans.

The strategy is to capture multiple value drivers, including ETH price appreciation, staking rewards, and exposure to tokenized real-world assets built on Ethereum, she noted.

Fundamental Global pivoted to Ethereum in late July with a $200 million private placement aimed primarily at purchasing Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset.

Fundamental Global (FGF) shares plunged 48% at market close on Friday, per Yahoo Finance.

Analysts are increasingly calling for the start of altseason as Ethereum posts massive gains and a wave of altcoins surges across the market. Over the past days, bullish momentum has pushed many digital assets higher, with price structures showing clear signs of strength. For many traders, this is the moment they've been waiting for—the long-anticipated shift where altcoins outperform Bitcoin and deliver outsized returns.

Ethereum's recent breakout above key resistance levels has added fuel to the narrative, with large-cap and mid-cap altcoins following in its footsteps. The market's renewed optimism has sparked speculation that the altseason cycle, where capital rotates from Bitcoin into the broader altcoin market, may already be underway.

However, not all experts are convinced. Some point to Bitcoin's continued dominance and the fact that most altcoins remain well below their all-time highs as reasons for caution. Historical altseasons have typically seen aggressive outperformance across the board, something the market has yet to fully confirm.

Altseason Still Waiting For Its True Breakout

According to top analyst Darkfost, the much-anticipated altseason hasn't truly begun. By examining a comparative chart of Bitcoin, large caps (top 20), and mid/small caps, Darkfost notes that the current cycle is showing the weakest altcoin performance so far. While altcoins have made notable moves in recent weeks, their gains still pale in comparison to Bitcoin's dominant run.

The last instance that resembled a genuine altseason occurred in early 2024, when altcoins—particularly mid- and small-cap projects—outpaced Bitcoin over a short but intense period. That surge marked a clear capital rotation away from BTC into the broader market, delivering outsized returns for altcoin holders. However, the present market conditions suggest that kind of broad-based outperformance has yet to materialize.

Even though Ethereum has broken above multi-year highs and several altcoins are posting impressive gains, the rally appears selective rather than widespread. Large caps are recovering steadily, but mid- and small-cap coins—often the hallmark of an explosive altseason—are still lagging. This disparity suggests that institutional and retail capital remains concentrated in more established assets.

For a confirmed altseason, analysts will be watching for a sustained breakout in mid- and small-cap performance relative to BTC. Until that shift occurs, the current market may be better described as a strong altcoin rally within Bitcoin's dominant phase rather than the start of a full-scale altseason.

Altcoin Market Nears Key Resistance

The Total Crypto Market Cap excluding Bitcoin (TOTAL2) is showing strong bullish momentum, currently sitting at $1.57 trillion after a sharp 13.21% weekly surge. This rally brings the market close to retesting its 2025 highs around the $1.6 trillion level, a critical resistance zone that has capped altcoin gains in previous attempts.

The chart reveals that the market has been in a sustained uptrend since early 2024, with price action consistently holding above the 50-week moving average (blue line) and maintaining bullish structure. Both the 100-week (green) and 200-week (red) moving averages are trending higher, reinforcing long-term support and signaling healthy market conditions.

If the breakout occurs, TOTAL2 could target the previous all-time high zone near $1.75–$1.8 trillion, marking a potential acceleration in capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Conversely, failure to clear this resistance could lead to a short-term pullback toward $1.4 trillion support, which aligns with the 50-week MA. The coming weeks will be crucial for determining whether altseason truly ignites.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Altcoins outperform Bitcoin as crypto market shifts toward utility-driven projects, with 80% showing sustained growth over a month.

- Coinbase's BASE Layer 2 solution surges 9000% in TVL to $4.5B, driven by low fees ($0.005) and 10M+ transactions processed.

- Ethereum's ability to maintain $4,100+ price level is critical for altcoin momentum, with risks of market correction if benchmarks fail.

- Market maturation prioritizes fundamentals over hype, as investors focus on liquidity, network usage, and real-world infrastructure adoption.

The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a notable shift as altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin, signaling a potential turning point in the broader digital asset landscape. This trend has sparked renewed investor interest, particularly in projects demonstrating strong fundamentals and use-case driven growth. With Bitcoin stabilizing above $118,500, altcoins, especially those with real-world utility, are capturing market attention.

Historically, altcoin surges have typically been short-lived, with most not sustaining momentum for more than a few weeks. However, recent data suggests a more prolonged rally. Over the last month, approximately 80% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, a rare occurrence in the current cycle. Analysts at DaanCrypto observe that this rally is distinct from previous ones dominated by meme coins. Instead, it appears driven by stronger capital inflows into major cryptocurrencies, particularly through treasury tools, which could indicate a more sustainable trend [1].

One of the standout performers in this environment is BASE, the Layer 2 solution developed by Coinbase. BASE has gained traction due to its speed and low transaction fees, making it an attractive option for developers and users. Since its launch two years ago, the network has served over a million active users and processed nearly ten million transactions. Its total value locked (TVL) has grown to $4.5 billion, marking a staggering 9000% increase in one year. The average transaction fee of $0.005 further enhances its appeal, especially for high-volume applications [1].

Despite these positive developments, the sustainability of the rally remains conditional. For Ethereum to maintain its position in the bullish trend, it must hold above $4,100 and potentially break its all-time high. Failure to do so could undermine the broader altcoin momentum and result in a market correction. This dynamic highlights the delicate balance between altcoin growth and the performance of leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The current shift in the crypto market underscores a broader transition from hype-driven investments to projects with real-world utility and infrastructure. While Bitcoin remains the dominant asset, the rise of altcoins indicates a maturing market where innovation and performance are increasingly valued. As the market continues to evolve, investors are likely to pay closer attention to altcoin fundamentals, liquidity, and network usage rather than speculative narratives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoin Surge: Navigating Risks and Opportunities in Crypto Payroll and Banking","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/altcoin-dominance-opportunities-risks","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Altcoins have been on a tear recently, and it has left many of us wondering if this is just a temporary blip or if we're witnessing the dawn of a new era in cryptocurrency. The surge in altcoins is not without its implications, especially in the realm of crypto banking and payroll. Let's dig into the context behind this trend and the potential risks that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) could face by diversifying their portfolios.

Altcoins have now been on top of Bitcoin for a whopping 31 consecutive days, the longest stretch we've seen in over a year. This has been driven by a resurgence in global trading flows and Ethereum's own rise to price levels we haven't seen since 2021. The market's rising tides are shifting the balance, causing Bitcoin's market share to dwindle as total crypto capitalization increases. It's looking like we might have an altcoin season on our hands, and it's prompting investors to consider branching out from Bitcoin.

The altcoin rally has significant implications for regulatory compliance in crypto banking across Asia and Europe. With altcoin trading on the upswing, there's a pressing need for clearer and more adaptable regulatory frameworks. Europe is gearing up for new regulations expected to come into force by 2026, aiming to offer comprehensive guidelines for crypto assets. 

This reflects a broader trend toward establishing detailed rules for stablecoins and other digital assets in order to maintain market integrity and protect consumers. Crypto banks have to step up their anti-money laundering (AML) controls, know-your-customer (KYC) processes, and transaction monitoring to deal with the increased complexity and risks that come with altcoin trading. Blockchain intelligence tools are becoming essential for compliance teams to detect illicit activities and manage risks effectively.

While altcoins offer exciting opportunities, SMEs venturing into this volatile market could face significant risks. Let's break down some of the key risks here:

Increased Volatility: Altcoins are notoriously volatile, which can put a strain on SME liquidity and financial stability. Unlike Bitcoin, altcoins can swing wildly, sometimes exceeding 100% changes in a single day.

Fraud and Security Vulnerabilities: Altcoins are more susceptible to scams and hacks due to weaker security measures and less established networks, increasing the risk of asset theft or loss.

Regulatory Compliance Hurdles: Navigating the complex and fragmented regulations can be tough, especially without specialized legal expertise. The regulatory ambiguity surrounding many altcoins only amplifies this risk.

Operational Complexities: Implementing altcoin payment systems requires robust compliance frameworks and a deep understanding of the tax implications, stretching SME resources.

Limited Investor Protections: Many altcoins lack registration and oversight, which reduces transparency and increases exposure to unregulated entities.

How should SMEs navigate these risks? Here are some strategies to consider:

Broaden Cryptocurrency Holdings: Introduce both Bitcoin and select altcoins into financial strategies. This can help mitigate volatility risks and attract a larger customer base.

Keep an Eye on Market Cycles: Stay informed about crypto market cycles (Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season) to time financial decisions and marketing efforts effectively.

Utilize Stablecoins: Leverage stablecoins for payroll and transactions to shield against volatility and ensure consistent value for employees.

Partner with Crypto Payment Processors: Collaborate with payment processors that support multiple cryptocurrencies, facilitating smoother transactions and enhancing operational efficiency.

Stay Updated on Regulatory Changes: Keep abreast of evolving regulations to ensure compliance and adapt strategies accordingly.

The rise of altcoins brings both risks and opportunities for SMEs in the crypto landscape. Understanding the implications of altcoin dominance, regulatory requirements, and associated risks is crucial for developing a solid strategy. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, staying informed and adaptable will be key to navigating the future of finance successfully.

Home - Crypto Presales - Bitcoin Energy Value Points to $183K — Analysts Highlight Altcoins With 81x Growth Potential

Bitcoin is trading at a steep discount, according to the Capriole Investments Energy Value model, which now estimates the flagship cryptocurrency's fair price at $183,000. With BTC hovering around $116,000, the data suggests a possible 57% undervaluation. The model uses inputs like mining difficulty, energy consumption, and supply inflation to calculate a more intrinsic price for Bitcoin.

This gap between energy value and market price is the widest seen since 2020, when BTC sat near $10,000 ahead of its explosive rally. With Bitcoin's hashrate at a record 1.031 ZH/s, analysts say miner confidence remains strong despite recent volatility. In fact, the Hash Ribbons indicator just issued a bullish signal, often used by traders to time long-term entries.

For institutions and long-term holders, this reinforces the thesis that Bitcoin remains structurally sound. But it also hints at something else: rising appetite for undervalued plays—especially high-upside altcoins ready to benefit from capital rotation.

The broader crypto market continues to advance. Ethereum recently broke above $4,000, pushing DeFi and NFT volume higher. Bitcoin's dominance has slipped to 57.8%, signaling that capital is moving into altcoins. 

Meanwhile, institutional investment in Ethereum ETFs is climbing, and U.S. regulations like the Genius Act are adding clarity around stablecoins and digital asset retirement plans.At the same time, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefiting from this shift. 

Retail traders are showing renewed interest in narratives that combine meme appeal with structured launches. With token unlock calendars tightening and presale bonuses dwindling, demand for early entries is surging.












With Bitcoin appearing discounted, top Solana and XRP holders are now joining MAGACOIN FINANCE for early positioning, seeking the next breakout asset ahead of broader market moves.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, a low-cap token launched with political and cultural momentum, is drawing strong traction in presale channels. The token's growing visibility among crypto veterans is notable. Wallet activity tied to known Solana and XRP whales shows early MAGACOIN allocations, suggesting strategic positioning for possible outsized returns.

What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its unique blend of community engagement, narrative appeal, and market timing. As traditional memecoins cool and mid-cap alts reach exhaustion, many traders are chasing fresh momentum. 

Some analysts have already placed MAGACOIN among 2025's best crypto presale plays, citing potential upside with massive ROI under current projections. Its early-stage pricing and strong network excitement make it a rare candidate in an increasingly mature altcoin cycle.

Bitcoin may be trading far below its fair value, but that hasn't stopped investors from looking further down the chain for the best crypto presale opportunities. With whales repositioning and altcoin season heating up, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the standout contenders for 2025. As sentiment turns more bullish, early positioning could make all the difference.

                            Chamath Palihapitiya believes putting America's jobs data on the blockchain would have prevented the drama from the recent employment report. | Credit: Getty Images.                        

When the U.S. government revealed that June's strong jobs report had been revised into the red, wiping out hundreds of thousands of positions from the official tally, financial markets reeled.

The fallout led to President Trump dramatically firing  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner last week, accusing Erika McEntarfer of “rigging” the data.

Meanwhile, billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya entered the conversation with an idea that he felt could have prevented all of the drama: putting America's jobs data on the blockchain.

The BLS initially reported that the U.S. added approximately 147,000 non-farm jobs in June, massively surpassing expectations.

However, just two months later, that figure was slashed  to a mere 14,000 after unprecedented downward revisions totaling approximately 258,000 jobs across May and June, the steepest two-month drop since the non-pandemic era began in 1979.

The revised data revealed only 73,000 new jobs in July, signaling that the labor market's resilience was perhaps an illusion.

These seismic corrections caught economists and experts off guard and triggered a new feud  between Trump and yet another government agency.

“We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

“I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.”

“Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate; they can't be manipulated for political purposes.”

As the jobs-data controversy swirled, billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya argued that the U.S. needed a wholesale rebuild of how employment numbers are collected and reported.

Palihapitiya took to X, claiming  that the BLS system was “brittle” and “sloppy,” and called for a new “oracle-like data provider” for this critical information.

“Bottom line is that BLS isn't so much conspiratorial as it is inadequate in its approach,” he wrote on X. “They are all over the place and add little directional signal. They constantly revise and in both directions.”

“The sampling techniques they use are brittle and don't work for a large and dynamic economy like the U.S.,” he added.

Palihapitiya said Trump was right to fire the head of the BLS because “she ran a critical aspect of the U.S. economic machinery in an unpredictable, haphazard, and sloppy way.”

“There needs to be a new, oracle-like data provider for this critical information,” he added.

Did you even read what you wrote ? “Oracle like data provider “.   Are you suggesting a crypto like oracle that outputs employment data, every month, on the same day , be REQUIRED FOR EVERY BUSINESS ? 

Who is gonna pay for the implementations?

And of course there are gov… https://t.co/FP1JQVsP1D 

— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 2, 2025 



However, not everyone was convinced this was the answer. Famed investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban fired back at the idea:

“Did you even read what you wrote? Are you suggesting a crypto-like oracle that outputs employment data, every month, on the same day, be required for every business?

“Who is gonna pay for the implementations? And of course there are gov agencies that have to respond as well. What do you have in mind for them?

“Do you really think the implementation, maintenance, and response timing and rates will be better than the current survey?”

Chamath countered Cuban with a three-tier proposal on how he believed taking the jobs market to the blockchain could succeed:

The idea was met with a fairly negative response, with many commenters siding with Cuban and claiming Chamath was “cozying up to Trump.”

Economists also agree on at least part of Cuban's critique, the biggest problem in the recent debacle wasn't tampering, it was the shrinking survey response rates and outdated collection methods.

Under Chamath Palihapitiya's proposal, payroll providers would automatically upload anonymized employment data in real time, allowing for instant verification and reducing reliance on delayed, sample-based surveys that are prone to large revisions.

Because blockchain records are immutable, any changes to the data would be traceable and would eliminate any suspicion of political manipulation.

A real-time feed could also provide policymakers and the public with up-to-date labor market information, reducing the shock of dramatic revisions seen recently.

Critics, however, warn that implementing this at scale would be expensive and too complex from a system which already works.

One X user wrote: “The entire methodology is publicly available on the BLS website.

“Estimation, Revisions, everything. All you have to do is read. Suddenly it's garbage because you wanna be cozied up with the President. Vacuous shill behavior.”

The jobs report sent Trump on a tirade of accusations, claiming the commissioner faked jobs numbers “before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory.”

All of Trump's accusations were presented without any evidence.

Members of the federal government rushed to defend McEntarfer, who has worked in the White House for the past two decades.

Speaking to NBC, Labor Secretary during the Biden administration Julie Su said :

“The work is done largely by expert career staff who do their jobs with care and pride.”

Downward revisions aren't scandal — they're science.

The goal is accuracy, especially with trillions on the line.  

We worked closely with a Trump-appointed commissioner.  

We never doubted the data, even with bad news.

Respecting the truth isn't optional. It's the job. pic.twitter.com/SZy8zFmVAx 

— Dan Koh (@dank) August 4, 2025 



Meanwhile, Labor Department Chief of Staff Daniel Koh took to X to claim:

“Nobody is faking numbers.”

“Downward revisions aren't scandal — they're science,” he added.

Koh said the agency worked closely with a Trump-appointed commissioner and “never doubted the data, even with bad news.”

“Respecting the truth isn't optional. It's the job,” he said.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Binance Alpha launches GameBuild (GAME) token, offering free airdrops to eligible users via Alpha Events.

- The token aims to boost blockchain gaming visibility, attracting investors to Web3 gaming and DeFi intersections.

- Binance's strategy reflects broader industry trends, listing niche projects to diversify offerings and support innovation.

- GAME's performance remains volatile, dependent on adoption rates and market sentiment toward blockchain gaming assets.

Binance Alpha has launched the GameBuild (GAME) token, marking the platform's continued expansion into blockchain-based gaming. The token is now accessible to eligible users, who can claim a free airdrop of 10,200 GAME tokens within a 24-hour window via the Alpha Events page. This initiative highlights Binance Alpha's focus on fostering emerging digital assets, particularly those aligned with the evolving Web3 gaming landscape [1].

GameBuild is positioned as a participant in the broader gaming ecosystem, though technical specifics about its infrastructure or development team remain undisclosed. The token's availability on Binance Alpha could boost its visibility and liquidity, potentially drawing in both retail and institutional investors who are increasingly interested in the intersection of gaming and decentralized finance [1].

The launch aligns with a broader industry trend of blockchain gaming tokens securing listings on major exchanges. Binance Alpha's decision to feature GameBuild alongside other innovative projects reflects a deliberate strategy to diversify its offerings and cater to a wider investor base. While no formal price or market data for GAME was disclosed, the token's presence on a prominent exchange is likely to spark initial trading activity and speculative interest [1].

This move follows the recent introduction of other gaming and metaverse-related tokens on the platform, reinforcing Binance Alpha's position as a hub for digital innovation. By supporting projects like GameBuild, Binance is contributing to the development of new ways for users to engage with virtual worlds and digital ownership [1].

However, the launch should be viewed within the context of the broader crypto market, which continues to navigate a period of consolidation. Platforms like Binance are using their infrastructure to back niche but high-potential projects, with GAME serving as a potential indicator of market sentiment toward blockchain-based gaming assets. That said, the token's performance may remain highly volatile and heavily influenced by project fundamentals and community adoption [1].

Oops, something went wrong

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Billionaire Adam Weitsman says he has acquired 5,000 Otherdeed non-fungible tokens from Yuga Labs, creators of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, for an undisclosed sum.

“Today is a special day for me,” Weitsman said Monday on X. “I'm making a long-term investment in Otherside and acquiring over 5,000 Otherdeeds, Mega Kodas and Weapon Kodas direct from Yuga Labs to continue building my collection. I have also committed to making a series of acquisitions on the open market this year.”

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

Otherdeeds are NFTs representing land deeds in Otherside, a 3D blockchain-based virtual world created by Yuga Labs. These Otherdeeds have a 100,000 supply, with Weitsman's recent purchase representing 5% of the total.

Like many other metaverse projects, Otherside was announced during the height of the NFT craze in 2021. The project had garnered significant hype due to the success of the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection and raised over $300 million from the sale of 55,000 Otherdeed NFTs in April 2022. But as with most other metaverse and NFT projects, interest in Otherdeed has plummeted following the 2022 cryptocurrency bear market.

Amid the downturn, Yuga Labs has been forced to sell IPs like Moonbirds and CryptoPunks while shifting focus to Otherside. Weitsman cited this Otherside focus among his motivations for the recent NFT sweep.

“I have recently seen Yuga refocus and prioritize Otherside,” he said Monday. “There is a lot riding on this project for the whole space and I will do my best to help make it a success for everyone.”

An avid art collector, Weitsman has built a reputation as a long-term investor and advocate of NFTs over the years. This reputation shines through in the recent Yuga Labs deal.

He told Now Media on Monday that his motivations were not financial, noting that as part of the contract, he can't sell the Otherdeed NFTs despite a “multimillion dollar commitment” on his part.

“This space needs a beacon of hope,” he said. “I don't have a financial interest in Yuga, so I can be very objective. I'm not biased toward the thing. I just want what's best for the space.”

Weitsman told Now Media that he chose Otherside because he loved the aesthetics and believed in the Yuga Labs team.

“I love the look, the plants, resources, and artifacts. I'm really drawn to that,” he said. “I love mythology. I just feel that this could be the greatest story.”

In the future, Weitsman envisions Otherside as a place where children can find solace, get inspiration and learn.

“I've got some ideas about kids playing this all over the world,” he told Now Media. “A place that kids can dream in. They can dream that this is their house and this is their land.”

He added that he would love to have an adviser for every 30 Otherdeeds that would teach the children to build and trade.

The nightlife scene is also getting swept up in the digital art revolution. The launch of an in-club gallery at Hi Ibiza is a prime example of how immersive experiences can combine with advanced technology. This piece explores how nightlife and digital art are coming together to captivate audiences and generate new revenue for crypto startups. Let's dive into how NFTs and blockchain tech are shaping the way we experience entertainment and connect with artists.

Hi Ibiza, a club that's been crowned the world's best for four years running, just launched the first permanent art gallery within a club. Partnering with Ibiza-based nightlife group The Night League, the gallery showcases works by famous digital artists like Beeple and Mad Dog Jones. The space is filled with a curated mix of digital and physical art, interactive installations, and custom display tech, creating an unparalleled atmosphere where nightlife meets art.

This isn't an isolated event. Similar in-club galleries have popped up globally, like Bright Moments' NFT gallery in Venice and the Web3 NYC Gallery in New York. They're changing how we consume art, making it more interactive and integrated into our nightlife experiences.

Bringing nightlife and digital art together opens up fresh monetization opportunities for crypto startups. Using blockchain and NFTs can help create innovative revenue streams that go beyond ticket sales. For instance, NFT-based tickets can help eliminate scalping and counterfeiting, while allowing resale royalties to return to artists and organizers. This new model not only boosts earnings but also establishes a direct connection between creators and fans, bypassing old intermediaries.

Real-time monetization through live streaming adds another layer, giving artists instant support tokens from fans during broadcasts. This immediacy is crucial for building a loyal fanbase and securing long-term earnings.

Integrating NFTs into nightlife experiences strengthens artist-audience connections. You can offer exclusive experiences tied to events—like limited-edition digital collectibles—creating deeper community ties. Blockchain tech adds transparency and security to transactions, enhancing trust.

Crypto startups can also offer fractional ownership of digital art through tokens, making art more accessible and encouraging ongoing fan interaction. This not only democratizes access but also fosters loyalty, which is essential for any entertainment venture.

As the NFT market matures, expect to see the blend of digital art and nightlife pick up steam. A dip in speculative trading volumes hints that the focus might shift from hype-driven sales to artist-centered experiences. In-club galleries are leading this charge, turning digital art from a solitary screen experience into a collective, vibrant event.

The future of digital art in nightlife will likely bring new monetization models, including microtransactions and dynamic pricing. This approach will cater to diverse audience preferences, amplifying the overall entertainment experience.

The intersection of nightlife and digital art is more than a fleeting trend; it's a seismic shift in how we connect with art and entertainment. By tapping into blockchain and NFTs, crypto startups can forge new revenue streams that redefine this landscape. As this integration unfolds, it will undoubtedly influence the futures of both the nightlife and digital art sectors, creating a more inclusive and dynamic cultural environment.

In conclusion, the fusion of nightlife and digital art presents exciting opportunities for crypto startups, signaling a new era of entertainment that celebrates creativity, community, and innovation.

I'm your AI market decoder—cutting through the chaos to show you what trends really matter (and which ones to ignore).

- NFT market's 2025 resurgence validates it as a $34.1B digital asset class with 18.5% CAGR since 2020.

- OpenSea leads with $14.68B volume, while gaming NFTs (38% of transactions) and cross-chain tools drive adoption.

- Institutional $4.2B VC funding and green NFTs (30% of deals) highlight sustainability and utility-driven growth.

- Regulatory clarity (SEC/MiCA) and tax frameworks in 35+ countries signal market legitimacy and institutional confidence.

- Investors prioritize platforms with recurring revenue, interoperability, and compliance across Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.

The NFT market, once dismissed as a speculative bubble, has emerged in 2025 as a cornerstone of the digital economy. With a global valuation of $34.1 billion and a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.5% since 2020, the sector's resurgence is no longer a question of hype but a reality driven by institutional adoption, technological innovation, and expanding use cases. For investors, the challenge now is to discern which trends signal long-term value and which are fleeting.  

 

The NFT ecosystem's maturation is evident in its infrastructure. OpenSea, the dominant marketplace, reported $14.68 billion in trading volume in 2025, with 2.4 million monthly active users. Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have redefined gaming NFTs, which now account for 38% of total transaction volume. Meanwhile, cross-chain interoperability tools have bridged 3 million NFTs across blockchains, with Ethereum retaining 62% of transactions despite competition from Solana and Polygon.  

Regional dynamics further underscore the market's breadth. The U.S. leads with 41% of global transactions, while Asia's gaming and K-pop sectors drive 40% of activity. Emerging markets like Nigeria and Kenya are also gaining traction, with Africa contributing 1.8% of global NFT activity. Singapore and the UAE have become innovation hubs, attracting $4.2 billion in venture capital for NFT startups in 2025 alone.  

Institutional validation has been a game-changer. Over 180 NFT-focused startups raised $4.2 billion in seed or Series A funding in the first half of 2025, with Andreessen Horowitz and Animoca Brands leading the charge. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are exploring NFTs for collateralization, while NFT index funds and ETFs have entered U.S. markets. Fractional ownership models and embedded yield mechanisms now account for 30% of institutional deals, signaling a shift toward utility-driven assets.  

Luxury brands have also embraced NFTs as part of their digital strategies. Adidas and Gucci's “green NFTs,” bundled with sustainability initiatives, highlight how brands are aligning with eco-conscious consumers. Meanwhile, Nike and Starbucks leverage Polygon's low-cost blockchain to mint digital wearables and collectibles, contributing 11% of global NFT activity.  

Gaming remains the most dynamic sector, with platforms like Axie Infinity and Decentraland generating $12.9 billion in revenue. Virtual land and in-game assets are no longer niche; they represent a new form of digital real estate. Similarly, the fashion NFT sector has hit $890 million in valuation, driven by digital twins and product authentication tools.  

Sustainability has become a critical differentiator. Post-Ethereum's Merge, energy consumption for NFT mints dropped by 99.95%, addressing environmental concerns. Platforms like Tezos and Flow now attract eco-conscious creators, with 420 collections in 2025 pledging sustainability initiatives. For investors, green NFTs offer both ethical and financial appeal, particularly as regulatory frameworks in 35 countries begin to standardize carbon accounting.  

 

Regulatory progress has been a quiet but powerful catalyst. The U.S. SEC's examination of NFTs under securities laws and Europe's MiCA regulation have provided clarity, boosting institutional participation. Tax authorities in Canada and Australia now treat NFTs as capital assets, while India's 15% capital gains tax underscores the sector's legitimacy. Investors must navigate these evolving rules, but the overall trend is toward integration, not exclusion.  

For those seeking long-term value, the key lies in diversification and alignment with sector fundamentals. High-profile projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox offer recurring revenue through in-game economies, while platforms like OpenSea and Blur cater to diverse user bases. Cross-chain interoperability tools and green NFTs present untapped potential, particularly in emerging markets.  

However, caution is warranted. The market's rapid growth has attracted speculative noise, and not all projects will survive. Investors should prioritize platforms with clear utility, strong institutional backing, and regulatory compliance. Diversifying across blockchain networks (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon) and sectors (gaming, fashion, collectibles) can mitigate risk while capturing growth.  

The NFT market of 2025 is no longer a speculative experiment but a validated asset class with real-world applications. From institutional investments to sustainability-driven innovation, the sector's fundamentals are robust. For investors, the path forward lies in balancing optimism with pragmatism—focusing on projects that offer both utility and scalability. As the market continues to evolve, those who align with its core trends will find themselves at the forefront of the next digital revolution.

Watch CBS News


Updated on:  August 10, 2025 / 12:13 PM EDT
          / CBS News
        

Earlier this year, more than 35,000 bitcoin enthusiasts descended on Las Vegas for Bitcoin 2025 – the largest-ever gathering of its kind, attracting an eclectic mix of high rollers ... and true believers.

""Your goal should be to own at least one bitcoin, because by the time you retire, that can be worth 20, 30 million,"" said Michael Terpin. 

Guy Malone said, ""You can't change the Bible; it changes you. The same is true of bitcoin.""

But everyone here seems to agree on one thing: President Donald Trump's reelection has been like hitting the jackpot. As Vice President JD Vance told the crowd, ""I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.""

Once dismissed by investors, and still baffling to many Americans, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have won over supporters from Wall Street to Washington. In July, the president signed the Genius Act, which opens the door for companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon to issue their own digital currencies.

And Congress is debating another bill that, for the first time, aims to regulate cryptocurrency trading – this after the industry spent more than $167 million on behalf of crypto-friendly candidates ahead of last year's election.

Asked how people should think of cryptocurrencies, Amanda Fischer, who served as a top official in the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration, replied, ""You could think of it as gambling, you could think of it as a collectible, you could think of it as a type of investment. But I think what's important to understand is that crypto is highly volatile. It's highly speculative. 

""Crypto is often marketed to individuals as an investment opportunity that will yield them the possibility of great returns,"" she said. ""But unlike, say, a stock, which represents a part-ownership of a company, [crypto] is not backed by any sort of business that is producing goods and services.""

 Unlike hard currencies like the dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies only exist online, and are issued by individuals and companies, not central banks. And yet, billions of dollars' worth of crypto are traded every day. ""The number of scams, the types of scams, the sophistication of scams are so rife and plentiful that the capacity to lose your money in a crypto investment is substantially higher than if you're just investing in stocks and bonds,"" Fischer said. 

During the Biden administration, the SEC cracked down on the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump administration has changed course, dismissing the largest outstanding cases, which Fischer says leaves consumers more vulnerable.

I asked, ""We are seeing leaders in crypto say we want to be regulated. And there is legislation currently here in Washington underway to regulate cryptocurrency. They say they want laws passed.""

""They want laws that they write to be passed,"" said Fischer. ""So, the legislation currently being considered in Washington, D.C., is written by and for the crypto industry.""

David Bailey, who runs the bitcoin conference and is CEO of a bitcoin holding company called Nakamoto, said, ""I wish that was the case, that'd be fantastic. But no, it's not true.""

Like many crypto entrepreneurs, Bailey now calls Puerto Rico home. ""It started because of the taxes,"" he said. ""Now, it's like the place to do business.""

But the 34-year-old's real claim to fame might be his role in convincing a skeptical President Trump (who in June 2021 told Fox Business Channel that bitcoin ""just seems like a scam"") to go all-in on bitcoin during the 2024 campaign. Asked what he told Mr. Trump to convince him to support crypto, Bailey replied, ""First off, no one convinces the president of anything. He makes up his own mind about things. A lot of people, especially in Washington, have missed how big this has gotten. And so, we made the case to the president about how many people hold this asset. He saw the opportunity that was here by embracing this industry. And I think we had a big part of swinging the election in his direction.""

The Federal Reserve says only eight percent of Americans have bought or held cryptocurrency in the last year, and only two percent have ever used it to buy anything. But digital assets are increasingly part of the economy. You may now be able to use crypto as collateral for a mortgage, and this past week the president signed an executive order to make it easier to hold cryptocurrencies in your 401(k).

All the attention has helped drive the price of bitcoin to an all-time high, recently passing $120,000 each.

Bailey says bitcoin was about $10 when he first bought it. Asked how much he bought, he replied, ""Well, you know, that's something I'm not going to talk about on camera. Not enough, let's just go like that. Not enough.""

And as crypto's fortunes have improved, so have the president's; CBS News estimates that crypto ventures controlled by the Trump family have made up to $765 million in revenue from token sales since the fall of 2024.

The White House did not respond to questions about the token sales, but in a statement told CBS News, ""Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.""

Most experts in government ethics believe the situation is unprecedented.

I asked Bailey, ""Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the president has changed his position on bitcoin and crypto because he can personally benefit from it, or his family can?""

""No, absolutely not,"" said Bailey. ""I don't think he embraced this industry to enrich himself; I think that he just sees the same potential that I see. When you get excited about an idea, you feel compelled to do something about it."" 

And that potential is why investors are betting that crypto will soon become part of everyday life. Vice President Vance told the audience at Bitcoin 2025, ""We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.""

But for Amanda Fischer, that's a gamble not worth taking.

""We heard the same thing about subprime mortgages going into 2008,"" said Fischer. ""We heard the same thing about complex financial derivatives going into the last crisis, too. These products are wonderful and there are ways to extract so much value in wealth, until they're not. And I fear that crypto is going to follow down the same path. Things are going great many times, until they're not.""

						Competing visions for digital currency regulation reveal broader financial ambitions.
					

Stablecoins have opened a new field in the rivalry between China and the United States. This is a type of cryptocurrency that can maintain a fixed value by being pegged to other assets such as Bitcoin, or the US dollar, or the Chinese renminbi.

In Hong Kong and Washington, bills to regulate stablecoins have recently become law. Hong Kong is attempting to reestablish a position in the global financial world by setting up an economic hub for stablecoins and other ventures in what is known as “Web3”, the next generation of the internet based on decentralisation and blockchain technology. Meanwhile the Trump administration is heavily involved with cryptocurrencies, bolstered by the support of “crypto bros” who funded President Donald Trump's campaign.

Stablecoins could have far reaching consequences for the two economies, while also reshaping global finance.

The Stablecoins Bill, passed by the Hong Kong Legislative Council in May, is a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to regulate stablecoins that are pegged to traditional currencies. The Hong Kong stablecoin bill adds to Beijing's efforts to create an alternative to the US-dominated economic order. Alongside the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), plans for BRICS Pay, the digital renminbi and the growing use of the renminbi for international transactions, Hong Kong stablecoins present another avenue for China to conduct international trade outside of the dominance of the US dollar.

Promoters of cryptocurrency have long been convinced of its capacity to change the world.

China appears keen to keep government-backed stablecoins in Hong Kong, while ensuring that stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies are kept outside of the mainland. Although not officially banned by the central government, Stablecoins and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are heavily restricted in mainland China. Beijing plans to ensure central financial control for digital currency, urging its citizens to use the digital renminbi instead of decentralised digital assets.

But Hong Kong has been allowed to enter the stablecoin market. After the 2019 protests and the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has been intent on restoring Hong Kong's place as a global financial hub. The stablecoins bill is a part of that effort to entice foreign banking organisations to return to Hong Kong. The city will once again become another gateway for China, this time for Web3 and cryptocurrencies. While within the mainland crypto will remain suppressed, it will likely bloom in Hong Kong, allowing China to trade with them internationally. Domestic markets will be free from its volatility and anarchic nature.

Last month, Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) into law. This bill similarly aims to create a “comprehensive regulatory framework” for stablecoins. It requires stablecoins to be pegged to the US dollar or other low risk assets, to be registered with regulators, and ensure that they meet audit requirements. The GENIUS act seeks to maintain the supremacy of the US dollar in the ever-growing world of digital payments. Stablecoins are seen as more than just an investment but as a form of payment, with those pegged to the US dollar already rising in use, even in China's fintech sector.

The question, however, is how much the US tilt to stablecoins can truly be seen as the American government advancing the interests of the country versus how much of it is about advancing the interests of Trump and his close allies? A pillar of Trump's support in his 2024 campaign was the “crypto-bros,” tech investors and executives with portfolios heavily based on cryptocurrencies and their connecting technologies. These figures, including Elon Musk, supported Donald Trump on the hope that he would in turn pass favourable legislation. The GENIUS act sees those hopes coming to fruition.

Trump's actions have fostered doubts. His “$Trump” meme coin, launched three days before his inauguration, rose some 300% over the initial price, before dropping by half. The people behind the $trump coin (including Trump) reportedly made an estimated US$100 million in trading fees. It appeared to be a rug pull, where developers of a coin abandon the coin after making initial profits, leaving buyers with a useless asset. The GENIUS Act could see such schemes proliferate.

Promoters of cryptocurrency have long been convinced of its capacity to change the world. As the new forms of digital currency become more like real world currency, with underlying regulations and stability, its integration into the global financial order will increase. Stablecoins are another step. But the dangers of crypto remain.

America's new stablecoin law could lead to billions of dollars in annual savings for enterprise retailers that issue their own digital money.

When President Trump signed the bipartisan Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law in July 2025, America became the first nation to provide a regulatory framework for the issuance and oversight of secure, fiat-backed digital currencies.

“This bill will cement U.S. dollar dominance, protect customers, increase demand for U.S. treasuries, and ensure that innovation in the digital asset space is in the hands of the United States of America, not our adversaries,” said Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty (R), who was the bill's lead sponsor, in an official statement.

The GENIUS Act requires the participating banks or businesses releasing stablecoins to back each dollar's worth of cryptocurrency with one dollar in cash or U.S. Treasury bonds — essentially, secure and liquid assets.

The U.S. GENIUS Act pegs the value of stablecoins to the U.S. dollar.

One possible use for the stablecoins that the GENIUS Act governs would be retailer-issued currency.

Walmart and Amazon may already be considering it to slash payment processing fees.

As every merchant knows, payment cards typically cost 1% to 3% in transaction fees. Those fees add up quickly for enterprise retailers.

Store-issued stablecoins could help these retail behemoths bypass traditional payment networks and cut transaction fees to nearly zero.

Thus, Walmart and Amazon, among other retailers, could drop billions to the bottom line each year. Collectively, American merchants pay something like $160 billion a year for payment card transactions.

Beyond the immediate savings on transaction fees, issuing a stablecoin offers compelling benefits to an enterprise retailer, such as better cash flow from instant settlements, lower fraud risk, and improved customer loyalty from a branded digital money.

Yet some observers remember TerraUSD, the “stable” coin that took a nosedive in May 2022, dipping below its one-dollar peg on the 9th before eventually plunging to just 10 cents.

TerraUSD was an “algorithmic” stablecoin that used its relationship to another cryptocurrency, Luna, to hold its value.

The idea was this. TerraUSD was supposed always to be worth exactly one U.S. dollar, but Luna's price could change.

The algorithm aimed to maintain TerraUSD at $1 by allowing people to trade it for $1 worth of Luna whenever the price fluctuated. If TerraUSD dropped to 99 cents, you could swap it for $1 worth of Luna and make a small profit, which was supposed to push the price back up.

The problem was that this only worked if people trusted the system and Luna had value. A run on TerraUSD pushed Luna prices down so fast that some investors panicked and started dumping Luna, too.

The algorithm stopped working.

GENIUS Act stablecoins, however, will be as reliable and, as their name implies, as stable as most financial instruments.

This stability comes from the backing assets described above — $1 held in an account for every $1 worth of stablecoin in circulation, much different from TerraUSD and similar algorithmic or crypto-backed “stablecoins.”

June 18, 2025

Stablecoins have the potential to transform ecommerce and retail, but small and mid-size businesses will likely see relatively few benefits, at least in the near term.

For example, stablecoins unlock opportunities in cross-border sales, but ecommerce platform providers and marketplaces might not pass on per-transaction savings to sellers.

As an example, Shopify announced its support for USD Coin (USDC) in June 2025, but, at the time of writing, the ecommerce platform charged stablecoin transaction fees similar to standard payment card processing, despite USDC transactions being dramatically cheaper.

Large ecommerce marketplaces could take a similar tack, charging merchants the same fees to process stablecoins as for payment cards.

I see two further concerns. First, any retailer issuing its own stablecoin will face banking-industry levels of reporting, regulation, and oversight.

Second, some economists worry that the proliferation of “private” money could create market chaos, especially if consumers used stablecoins for everyday purchases as described here.

Nonetheless, government-regulated stablecoins are real, and they will impact in-store and online merchants.

As the crypto landscape evolves, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are faced with the daunting task of navigating a maze of regulations. It's not just a headache; it's crucial for survival. Implementing effective compliance strategies is a must, and can even become a springboard for growth and innovation.

On one side, cryptocurrency opens the door to new business horizons, but on the other, it ushers in a complex regulatory environment. From anti-money laundering (AML) laws to transaction monitoring and risk management, the challenges are real. Compliance isn't just a buzzword; it's the lifeline for SMEs. The rules may change depending on where you operate, so keeping your finger on the pulse of legal requirements is essential.

How do SMEs deal with this? A well-crafted compliance program is key. It should be tailored to the specific risks that crypto poses to your business. This involves laying down the groundwork with:

Having these elements in place not only ensures that you meet the law but also builds trust with customers and partners.

Technology can help you streamline compliance processes. Automated solutions can minimize human error and ramp up risk detection. Important tech solutions include:

It's also wise to consult legal and compliance experts who specialize in cryptocurrency to help you navigate the regulatory maze.

Domestic alternatives, like Huawei, are shaping the landscape of AI chip technology and crypto integration. They are leading the way in AI infrastructure and enabling integrated AI-blockchain solutions, which may create a more secure environment for crypto operations. SMEs could benefit from these domestic technologies to bolster their compliance frameworks.

Geopolitical tensions are driving fintech startups across Asia to adopt crypto solutions at a rapid pace. Traditional financial systems can falter under trade disputes and regulatory crackdowns, making crypto a decentralized alternative. This shift facilitates business cross-border payments while allowing capital to flow from restrictive regimes.

SMEs should be keeping an eye on crypto-friendly jurisdictions that offer favorable regulations. This could be the edge needed to thrive in the digital economy.

For SMEs, navigating crypto compliance is essential in this rapidly changing environment. By implementing tailored compliance programs, leveraging technology, and staying informed about geopolitical influences, businesses can manage risks while seizing opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. Adopting these strategies will not only ensure compliance but could lead to innovation and growth in a competitive landscape.

In February this year hackers targeted Dubai-based exchange Bybit, stealing digital assets worth an estimated $1.5 billion. Verichains quickly dispatched engineers to Dubai to assist in the investigation. Thanh says: ""I felt we had to act. Otherwise, many people would be affected.""

Within a day the cause was identified. Thanh's team produced a 28-page technical report, the first detailed explanation of the breach. It became a key reference for affected parties and users, helping reduce the spread of misinformation that could destabilize the crypto market.

""They are probably the most knowledgeable people in the world when it comes to cyberattacks,"" Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, told VnExpress then. ""I was surprised and impressed to learn they were from Vietnam.""

The Bybit case is one of many major blockchain-related attacks Verichains has helped investigate. These incidents often resemble digital crime scenes, with engineers working backward to uncover what happened, much like detectives. Verichains has been involved in investigating many of the world's most high-profile crypto breaches.

These include the 2022 theft of $600 million from BNB Chain Bridge, a platform used to transfer digital assets between blockchains, and the hack targeting Ronin Bridge, a cross-chain platform, which crippled Sky Mavis, the Vietnamese tech unicorn behind the blockchain game ""Axie Infinity.""

The firm is among the few globally to provide deep-level blockchain forensics. ""Our job is to investigate the root cause, identify vulnerabilities exploited by attackers, resolve the incident, collaborate with authorities across multiple countries, and support the affected organization in securing their systems,"" Thanh says.

Despite its reputation for security, blockchain remains a prime target for hackers. In 2024 alone cybercriminals stole $2.2 billion in crypto assets. In the first half of 2025 alone that figure reached $2 billion, driven largely by the Bybit breach.

Thanh says blockchain technology is often wrongly blamed. In most hacking cases, the cause does not stem from core blockchain technology, but from supporting systems, non-decentralized elements such as human error, servers, wallets, and applications on phones or computers. Many crypto startups manage billions of U.S. dollars in assets but are often young companies that have scaled rapidly without the cybersecurity maturity or experience to defend against attacks.

This is where blockchain security engineers come in. They are typically brought in after a breach to audit code, trace stolen assets, identify attack methods, and recommend solutions to prevent future incidents. ""When we find a vulnerability, we also check whether any other projects using the same mathematical libraries might be at risk,"" Thanh says.

Thanks to a proven track record, Verichains now works primarily with major crypto exchanges and digital asset investment funds.

Rare talent in a global market

Blockchain security professionals typically fall into two categories. The first handles smart contract audits, a process that follows defined procedures. The second, more specialized group, deals with complex systems such as crypto exchanges and asset custody platforms.

Thanh says the blockchain security industry faces a global talent shortage due to its technical demands. Experts must be proficient not only in traditional cybersecurity but also in blockchain systems, cryptography, risk management, and financial operations.

While no official statistics are available, he estimates that blockchain security engineers make up only a small fraction of the global cybersecurity workforce. Market demand is also cyclical, fluctuating with crypto investment trends. When crypto prices rise, more projects are launched and security needs increase. When the market slows, demand typically declines.

However, long-term prospects remain strong. Professionals in this field often earn high incomes, especially when working directly with global financial institutions or major exchanges. ""Vietnamese engineers can serve global clients,"" Thanh says. ""If you can prove your capabilities, clients will come.""

At the GM Vietnam blockchain event held on Aug. 1 and 2 in Hanoi, Vu Ngoc Son, head of technology at the National Cybersecurity Association, said crypto exchanges now resemble banks due to the scale of assets they manage, but often operate without the regulatory safeguards of traditional financial institutions.

This creates both cybersecurity challenges and opportunities for Vietnamese engineers.Vietnamese professionals are typically patient and detail-oriented, traits essential for analyzing thousands of lines of source code to detect hidden vulnerabilities, Son said.

He added that most blockchain flaws are rooted in logic or mathematics, areas where Vietnamese talent tends to excel. ""Vietnam has a real opportunity to become a global leader in blockchain security, provided we invest in the right policies and support systems.""

Vietnam's growing role in blockchain security may soon be reinforced by new national policies.

The Digital Technology Industry Law, passed by the National Assembly in June and set to take effect in 2026, includes provisions aimed at developing digital workforce capacity.

Under the law, the government will promote education, reskilling and upskilling in digital technologies through scholarships, subsidized student loans and stipends. It also sets out a framework for investing in educational infrastructure, developing online learning platforms and promoting suitable training models to support digital transformation.

JPMorgan remains bullish on U.S. stocks even as some observers warn that the economy is beginning to pay the price for President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The investment banking giant forecasts that the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, will yield a ""high single-digit return over the next 12 months,"" driven by three key factors.

One of the main reasons for optimism is that markets don't care about signs of an economic slowdown. Instead, traders are focused on resilient corporate earnings and the subsequent economic recovery.

Since President Trump fired the first tariff salvo on April 2, economists have downgraded full-year U.S. growth forecasts from 2.3% to 1.5%. Still, the S&P 500 has gained over 28% in the four months. The index has held steady despite recent economic data revealing softness in the labour market and consumption, as well as stickiness in manufacturing and service sector inflation.

While the macro analysts' warning is concerning and likely playing out in the background, corporate earnings in the U.S. are ignoring the slowdown risks, at least in the short term, making it the second catalyst for JPMorgan's bullish thesis.

Over 80% of S&P 500 companies have recently reported their Q2 earnings, with 82% surpassing earnings expectations and 79% beating revenue forecasts—the strongest performance since the second quarter of 2021.

According to JPMorgan, while Wall Street analysts initially projected earnings growth below 5%, the index is now on pace for an impressive 11% growth rate. This robust showing supports the ongoing bullish trend in the stock market.

""The full-year earnings expectations for both this year and next have already started to turn higher,"" analysts at JPMorgan's wealth management said in a market note on Friday, adding that the market is increasingly differentiating between the winners and losers of the Trump trade war.

Additionally, the market is now figuring out and pricing in which companies are getting hit most by U.S. tariffs. So far, it looks like mega corporations will be just fine. This could bolster the case for further positive sentiment in the markets.

JPMorgan analysts explained that consumer-facing and smaller companies with restrained bargaining power against their trading partners and rigid supply chains are facing a stagnant earnings outlook.

This ties to JPMorgan's last catalyst: Trump's tariff bark is proving worse than its bite for large firms, which are managing to secure exemptions and even turn the tariff policies, aimed at sparking a manufacturing boom, into a tailwind.

""The latest example is President Donald Trump's suggestion that imported semiconductors would be taxed at a 100% rate unless the companies commit to relocating production to the United States. Another sign? Apple products are exempted from the latest tariff rates on Indian goods. Indeed, the company also announced an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing facilities. The stock gained almost 9% this week. Tariffs are not happening in a vacuum,"" analysts explained.

Big firms gain an additional advantage from the One Big Beautiful Act (OBBA), under which firms can claim 100% bonus depreciation for purchases of qualified business property and immediate expense of domestic research and development costs. According to some analysts, the depreciation policy could increase free cash flow for some by over 30%, which could incentivize more investment.

The bank added that its investment strategy remains focused on large-cap equities, particularly in the technology, financials, and utilities sectors, which it believes are best positioned to navigate this new economic environment.

JPMorgan's positive outlook for stocks could bode well for cryptocurrencies, as both tend to move in tandem. The digital assets market has plenty going on for itself, with the Trump administration appointing pro-crypto officials to key regulatory positions.

Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that liquid staking, under certain conditions, falls outside the purview of Securities Law. The ruling has raised hopes for staking spot ether ETFs winning regulatory approval.

Ether has rallied over 13% to over $4,200, reaching levels last seen in 2021. Prices surged nearly 50% last month, CoinDesk data show.

U.S. Spot XRP ETFs: Five Possible Reasons Behind BlackRock's Hesitation to File for One

BlackRock's absence from the crowded spot XRP ETF race could be a reflection of client demand, regulatory caution and a calculated focus on bitcoin and ether.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","XRP News Today: Why BlackRock Might be Reluctant to Pursue a U.S.-Listed Spot XRP ETF","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/10/u-s-spot-xrp-etfs-five-possible-reasons-behind-blackrock-s-hesitation-to-file-for-one","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 14:36:53 GMT","

BlackRock has made bold moves into bitcoin and ether ETFs, but on Friday, the asset manager said it had no immediate plans to file for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), dashing the community's hopes that its entry could help extend XRP's 2025 rally.

This statement — made the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs jointly asked an appeals court to dismiss their respective appeals, signaling an end to their nearly five-year legal battle — has left investors questioning why BlackRock remains on the sidelines. 

While several asset managers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for XRP ETFs since late 2024, BlackRock's absence is notable, especially given its dominance in the bitcoin and ether ETF markets. 

Here are five reasons why BlackRock appears in no hurry to launch a spot XRP ETF, despite the XRP community's anticipation of a demand-driven price surge.

First, BlackRock has cited limited client interest in cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH. Back in March 2024, Robert Mitchnick, the asset manager's head of digital assets, said that there's a misconception that BlackRock will have a ""long tail"" of other crypto services.

""I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit ethereum,"" he said during a fireside chat at the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22.

Second, BlackRock's strategic caution around regulatory uncertainty plays a role. 

Although XRP sales on public exchanges are deemed non-securities, the broader regulatory framework for altcoins remains murky. BlackRock may be waiting for clearer SEC guidelines before entering the altcoin ETF space. 

The firm's conservative approach contrasts with competitors like ProShares, which filed for a spot XRP ETF in January 2025 alongside leveraged and futures-based XRP ETFs, the latter tracking XRP futures contracts rather than the token's spot price.

Third, BlackRock may see diminishing returns in pursuing a spot XRP ETF given the crowded field. As of August 2025, at least seven firms, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares, have a pending spot XRP ETF application.

Fourth, the XRP community's expectations of a price surge may not align with BlackRock's data-driven strategy. Polymarket odds for the SEC approving a spot XTP ETF in 2025 stand at 77%. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and Solana shows blockchain interest, but XRP's smaller market footprint may not justify the operational costs of a new ETF.

Finally, BlackRock's global perspective prioritizes markets where XRP demand is less pronounced. While the XRP community, active on platforms like X, anticipates a spot ETF driving demand, much of XRP's trading volume comes from Asia, where BlackRock's ETF presence is less dominant.

At press time, XRP was trading around $3.1852, down 3.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.

Here Are 3 Bullish Reasons Why JPMorgan Sees S&P 500 Rallying Much Higher

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Crypto debanking is ‘still occurring' as banks stick to Chokepoint policies","https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-debanking-persists-despite-trump-pro-crypto-push","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:11:52 GMT","

 Despite Trump's pro-crypto stance, Unicoin CEO says US banks continue closing accounts for crypto firms under “Operation Chokepoint.” 

Crypto firms have been facing account closures and denials of banking services for years under the label of de-risking. Many in the crypto industry believe that the debanking represents a policy-driven effort to suppress digital assets, referred to as “Operation ChokePoint 2.0.”

After President Donald Trump's pro-crypto team won the election, many believed the era of debanking was over. His campaign rhetoric and early policy moves signaled a friendlier environment for digital assets, leading some to expect banks would ease restrictions on crypto clients.

However, recent incidents suggest the practice remains entrenched. Last week, Andreessen Horowitz partner Alex Rampell warned that big banks are squeezing fintech and crypto apps in “Operation Chokepoint 3.0,” by hiking fees to access account data or transfer funds to platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood.

Echoing these concerns, Alex Konanykhin, CEO of Unicoin, told Cointelegraph that US banks are continuing to close accounts for crypto firms without explanation, despite growing political pressure to end the practice.

“We know about it first-hand, as Unicoin and its subsidiaries have been de-banked, without explanations, by several banks,” Konanykhin said. He listed five banks that have cut ties with Unicoin or its subsidiaries over the past years, including Citibank, Chase, Wells Fargo, City National Bank of Florida and TD Bank.

A spokesperson for Chase declined to comment on a specific comment. “We welcome the direction of the Trump Administration to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and modernize anti-money laundering regulations,” they added. 

Cointelegraph reached out to all these banks for comment.

Konanykhin claimed that Unicoin was debanked by four banks this year alone, which “suggests that Chokepoint is a large-scale nationwide operation.” Unicoin is a publicly reporting corporation with six years of audited financials and over 4,000 shareholders.

Konanykhin added the debanking campaign has created “highly disruptive and damaging” conditions for crypto companies in the US, depriving them of access to basic financial services and “suppressing the American crypto industry.”

On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that President Trump will sign an executive order directing federal bank regulators to identify and penalize financial institutions that have engaged in debanking.

The order will reportedly require regulators to review complaint data, while banks overseen by the Small Business Administration must work to reinstate clients who were unlawfully denied services.

Konanykhin expressed hope that President Donald Trump's proposed executive order to curb debanking could bring relief. “The President knows the pain of de-banking first-hand and seems determined to stop this form of economic warfare against American businesses,” he said.

He said ending debanking could help US crypto reclaim global leadership. “Ending the War on Crypto will boost the American crypto industry. It may become as impactful internationally as Hollywood is in entertainment or Silicon Valley in IT,” he noted.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth Blickley, a partner at Fox Rothschild's Tax Controversy & Litigation Practice, said that while Trump has directed agencies and Congress to review how crypto can be integrated into mainstream finance, meaningful change will depend on the final wording of regulations and laws.

She pointed to the recently signed Genius Act, which gives the Federal Reserve's Stablecoin Certification Review Committee 180 days to design a regulatory framework.

Blickley warned that most bills in Congress never make it out of committee and that any eventual legislation will likely face litigation from both sides of the regulatory debate. “A regulation may facially comply with the President's request or a law passed, yet have little application or disproportionate impacts based solely on word-choice,” she said.

For now, Blickley said, banks are likely to continue their risk-averse stance toward crypto until new rules clearly reduce perceived risks. “It's all about making risk-averse entities and people feel like crypto is less of a risk,” she concluded.

 Vitalik Buterin's net worth could be bolstered even more as crypto traders are eyeing new all-time highs for Ether in just days. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has regained his status as a ten-figure crypto holder just days after Ether crossed the $4,000 price level for the first time in eight months, according to a blockchain intelligence firm.

“Vitalik Buterin is now an onchain billionaire again,” Arkham said in a post on Saturday. At the time of publication, Buterin's portfolio is valued at approximately $1.04 billion, holding 240,042 ETH alongside smaller stakes in cryptocurrencies such as Aave Ethereum (AETHWETH), WhiteRock (WHITE), Moo Deng (MOODENG), and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH).

On Saturday, Ether (ETH) climbed another 6.38%, reaching as high as $4,332 following its return to $4,000 on Friday — a level not seen since December 2024 — while Bitcoin's (BTC) share of the crypto market cap declined.

At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $4,244, according to Nansen.

Some crypto traders anticipate that Ether is on its way to reclaiming its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878. Crypto trader Ted said in an X post that it “is just a matter of days now.”

CoinGlass data shows a move to $4,500 would put approximately $1.35 billion in short positions at risk amid other traders speculating a short squeeze in the near future.

Arkham also highlighted growing momentum for Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “ETFs yesterday had total flows of $461M for ETH but only $404M for BTC,” the firm said. 

Over the past five trading days, US-based spot Ether ETFs saw $326.6 million in net inflows, while Bitcoin ETFs posted $253.2 million, according to Farside data.

Buterin first became a crypto billionaire at age 27 in May 2021, when Ether crossed $3,000 for the first time. 

At the time, he held around 333,500 ETH, valued at approximately $1.029 billion, according to onchain data from Etherscan. This came after ETH's value had more than quadrupled from roughly $700 at the start of 2021.

Nearly three years earlier, in October 2018, Buterin revealed he never held more than 0.9% of all the ETH supply and his net worth had “never came close” to $1 billion.

Related: Ethereum beats Solana in capital inflows: $4K target in sight

While many in the industry attribute a large part of Ether's price surge to the rise of Ether treasury companies, Buterin recently made a strong warning against the trend.

“If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH, then, of course, my guess for why would basically be that somehow they turned it into an overleveraged game,” Buterin said in an interview on Thursday.

 Bitcoin traders are getting excited over a huge short squeeze as BTC price predictions include a return to all-time highs. 

Key points:

Bitcoin tags new August highs as traders see BTC shorts getting punished.

An early retracement could well turn into a trip to $120,000, predictions say.

A CME gap at $116,500 is of interest as a possible next local low.

Bitcoin (BTC) neared $119,000 into Sunday's “decisive” weekly close as traders expected a strong week.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $118,760 on Bitstamp, marking new August highs.

“Out-of-hours” weekend trading saw heightened liquidations, with the 24-hour crypto total at $350 million, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.

Commenting on market structure, crypto forecasts favored further progress into the new week.

“BTC is on the cusp of a reclaiming ~$117200 back into support,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital wrote in his latest X post about the weekly chart.

Popular trader BitBull said that while weekend price moves can typically reverse as TradFi markets reopen, there was hope for new all-time highs next.

“Just a 10% upward move will cause $18B+ in short liquidations and big money is probably watching it,” he suggested about liquidity conditions. 

An accompanying chart compared BTC/USD now to previous bull markets to support the breakout thesis.

Fellow trader Merlijn agreed on the $120,000 target based on a potential short squeeze.

Considering where the next BTC price dip might reverse, meanwhile, crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows suggested that price action would continue to coincide with “gaps” in CME Group's Bitcoin futures market.

“There's a CME gap around $116.5K, which will most likely be filled,” he summarized in part of an X post.

“Most focus is on $ETH breaking its cycle highs and alts making all kind of moves,” he argued, referring to the largest altcoin Ether (ETH), which hit multiyear highs.

Did Disease Defeat Napoleon?

Napoleon's campaign against the Russian Empire was one of the most costly wars in history. Many soldiers died of diseases. Some of these illnesses are only now being identified

By Daniel Lingenhöhl 

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Beginning on June 24, 1812, around 600,000 soldiers led by French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte crossed the Neman River to invade the Russian Empire. The war was one of the most costly in history, and just under six months later, only a few tens of thousands of men returned across the river.

The massive losses have historically been attributed to soldiers falling in battle, succumbing to frostbite, starving to death or dying in a typhus epidemic. But now a new, not-yet-peer-reviewed preprint study by microbiologist Rémi Barbieri of Paris City University and his team have identified other pathogens that might actually have been responsible for much of the death.

Historical records from the time show that doctors that accompanied the army diagnosed typhus from symptoms such as fever, headaches and skin rashes, and an analysis of remains in a 2006 study had suggested possible infections with typhus and trench fever. But when Barbieri and his team examined the preserved teeth of 13 of Napoleon's fallen soldiers, they were unable to find any evidence of Rickettsia prowazekii, the bacterium responsible for epidemic typhus, or Bartonella quintana, the cause of trench fever, which infected more than a million soldiers during World War I.

Instead they found traces of the bacterium Salmonella enterica—which causes typhoid fever, not to be confused with typhus—and Borrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever and is mainly transmitted by body lice.

With the help of modern medicine, typhoid and relapsing fever both have very high survival rates. But these previously unidentified pathogens could have easily caused death in soldiers who had already been weakened from cold and hunger and were living in terrible hygienic conditions.

The researchers note that their sample of 13 soldiers is too small to be sure that other diseases, such as typhus, did not kill many other soldiers during Napoleon's retreat. They only have not yet found evidence of such infections.

Napoleon himself survived the retreat almost unscathed. The losses brought his rule over Europe to a slow end, however. In 1815 Napoleon was finally defeated by the U.K. and Prussia at the Battle of Waterloo.

Science Advisory Highlights:

Ultraprocessed foods or UPFs are a growing concern due to their widespread consumption and impact on potential health risks. Most UPFs, particularly those commonly seen in U.S. dietary patterns, are high in saturated fat, added sugars and sodium (salt), the combination of which is often abbreviated as HFSS, and contribute to excess calories. These include sugar-sweetened drinks, ultraprocessed meats, refined grains, candy and commercial baked goods, among others. A limited number of ultraprocessed foods, such as certain commercial whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and some plant-based items, have positive nutritional value and, therefore, can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern. This overlap is confusing for health care professionals and the public.

A new Science Advisory from the American Heart Association, ""Ultraprocessed Foods and Their Association with Cardiometabolic Health: Evidence, Gaps and Opportunities,"" summarizes current knowledge about UPFs and their impact on cardiometabolic health, and outlines opportunities for research, policy and regulatory reform to improve dietary intake and overall health. The manuscript published on August 8 in Circulation, the flagship journal of the American Heart Association.

""The relationship between UPFs and health is complex and multifaceted,"" said Maya K. Vadiveloo, Ph.D., R.D., FAHA, volunteer chair of the writing group for this Science Advisory. ""We know that eating foods with too much saturated fat, added sugars and salt is unhealthy. What we don't know is if certain ingredients or processing techniques make a food unhealthy above and beyond their poor nutritional composition. And if certain additives and processing steps used to make healthier food like commercial whole grain breads have any health impact.""

The rapid rise in UPF consumption since the 1990s disrupted traditional dietary patterns, potentially contributing to adverse health effects. It is estimated that 70% of grocery store products in the U.S. contain at least one ultraprocessed ingredient. As detailed in a CDC report published on August 7, 55% of calories consumed by people ages 1 and older in the U.S. were UPFs. Among youth ages 1-18 years of age, total UPF calories jumped to nearly 62%, and among adults ages 19 and older total UPF calories was 53%. In addition, families with lower mean income had a higher percentage of UPFs consumed per day: 54.7% for the lowest income group vs. 50.4% for highest income group.[1]

UPFs are relatively inexpensive, convenient for use and aggressively marketed, particularly toward youth and under-resourced communities, often displacing healthier alternatives. This shift resulted in lowering the overall nutritional quality of typical eating patterns in the U.S. and is misaligned with the American Heart Association's dietary guidance.

This new Science Advisory reinforces current dietary guidelines from the American Heart Association to:

How are ultraprocessed foods classified?

UPFs are multi-ingredient foods containing additives (likely intended to enhance shelf life, appearance, flavor or texture) widely used in industrial food production and not commonly used in home cooking. Human diets are increasingly including more industrially processed foods, leading to various systems for classifying foods based on processing criteria. Multiple food classification systems exist currently; this Science Advisory focuses on the Nova framework for food classification. The Nova system, the most widely used, is based on the nature, extent and purpose of the food's industrial food processing. However, the Nova categorization does not consider the nutritional quality of foods. Certain types of industrial food processing are beneficial for preservation and safety, and/or lowering cost, such as techniques that extend shelf life, control microbial growth, mitigate chemical toxicants, preserve functional, nutritional and sensory (taste) qualities, and reduce food loss and waste.

Efforts to understand UPFs are hindered by differing definitions, limitations in dietary assessment tools and food composition databases, which often lack detailed information on additives and processing methods. Currently, U.S. manufacturers are not required to disclose processing techniques or cosmetic additive quantities, which contributes to the variability in risk estimates and confusion for consumers.

The writing group cautions that an overreliance on the degree of processing as a proxy for healthfulness of foods could sway the food industry to reduce or remove the markers of ultraprocessing from foods that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium and promote them as ""better-for-you alternatives.""

Health Impact of UPFs

A meta-analysis of prospective studies cited in the advisory found a dose-response relationship between UPF consumption and cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, transient ischemic attack and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, obesity and all-cause mortality. High versus low UPF intake was linked to a 25%-58% higher risk of cardiometabolic outcomes and a 21%-66% higher risk of mortality. More research is needed to understand the appropriate thresholds for daily consumption of UPFs -- what a safe amount is and the incremental risks of eating more UPFs.

Research has also found that there may be underlying mechanisms that affect eating behaviors and obesity for some people, and that UPFs may promote obesity. UPFs frequently contain combinations of ingredients and additives that are uncommon in whole foods to enhance palatability and reduce cost, and these may influence reward-related brain activity. For example, ingredients like artificial flavors may mimic sweetness without sugar, and this disruption in flavor-nutrient relationships often leads to irregular eating habits, and results in weight gain.

Opportunities for research and policy

Balancing multiple priorities, including the practical need for a nutrient-dense, affordable food supply, current evidence supports the following key research and policy changes to improve public health and reduce risks related to UPFs:

""More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of how UPFs impact health. In the meantime, the Association continues to urge people to cut back on the most harmful UPFs that are high in saturated fats, added sugars and sodium, and excessive calories and instead follow a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds and whole grains, low-fat-low-sugar dairy, and lean proteins like fish, seafood or poultry -- for better short- and long-term health,"" said Vadiveloo.

This Science Advisory was prepared by the volunteer writing group on behalf of the American Heart Association Council on Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health; the Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; the Council on Clinical Cardiology; the Council on Genomic and Precision Medicine; and the Stroke Council. American Heart Association scientific statements and advisories promote greater awareness about cardiovascular diseases and stroke issues and help facilitate informed health care decisions. Scientific statements outline what is currently known about a topic and what areas need additional research. While scientific statements inform the development of guidelines, they do not make treatment recommendations. American Heart Association guidelines provide the Association's official clinical practice recommendations.

Weight loss and diabetes drugs on the market often do not achieve long-term weight loss for patients. GLP-1 drugs target brain neurons that control appetite but frequently cause side effects. Nausea and vomiting force 70% of patients to stop treatment within a year. Syracuse University chemistry professor Robert Doyle is leading a multidisciplinary team that has identified a different brain target for treating obesity and diabetes, potentially offering weight loss without gastrointestinal distress.

Neurons are the most well-known and obvious target in research and drug development for brain conditions. GLP-1 drugs, for example, target brain neurons in the hindbrain involved in appetite control. But researchers are looking beyond neurons to study ""support"" cells such as glia and astrocytes that could aid appetite reduction.

A collaborative research effort has revealed that support cells play a role in reducing feelings of hunger, although this process has not been studied in-depth.

""We wanted to know whether support cells might produce new peptides or new signaling molecules that might be critical in body weight reduction,"" says Doyle, a medicinal chemist and the Jack and Laura H. Milton Professor of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at Syracuse University. Doyle is also a professor of pharmacology and medicine at SUNY Upstate Medical University.

How it works

Think of each brain neuron as a light bulb and support cells as the components that allow the light bulb to brighten, including the wiring, switch and filament.

""All of those supporting parts beyond the light bulb play a role in making the light shine,"" says Doyle.

The research team discovered that some support cells in the hindbrain naturally produce a molecule named octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), which suppresses appetite. In lab tests, injecting ODN directly into rats' brains made them lose weight and improved how they processed glucose.

However, injecting directly into the brain isn't a practical treatment for people, so researchers created a new version of the molecule named tridecaneuropeptide (TDN). This molecule version could be given to human patients through regular injections akin to today's Ozempic or Zepbound. When tested in obese mice and musk shrews, TDN helped the animals lose weight and respond better to insulin without causing nausea or vomiting.

Marathon shortcut

One goal of the research team is to produce weight loss without aiming new therapeutic molecules at neurons. The new TDN molecule bypasses neurons, taking a shortcut to directly target neurons' downstream support cells, which researchers found also produce appetite suppression. TDN cuts short the ""marathon"" of chemical reactions and negative side-effects caused by GLP-1 drugs.

""Instead of running a marathon from the very beginning like current drugs do, our targeting downstream pathways in support cells is like starting the race halfway through, reducing the unpleasant side effects many people experience,"" says Doyle. ""If we could hit that downstream process directly, then potentially we wouldn't have to use GLP-1 drugs with their side effects. Or we could reduce their dose, improving the toleration of these drugs. We could trigger weight loss signals that happen later in the pathway more directly.""

A new company called CoronationBio has been launched to turn this discovery into a real-world treatment. The company has licensed intellectual property related to ODN derivatives for the treatment of obesity and cardio-metabolic disease from Syracuse University and the University of Pennsylvania, with a focus on translating candidates into the clinic. They're now teaming up with other companies to develop this treatment and aim to start human trials in 2026 or 2027.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Giant Einstein ring reveals one of the Universe's biggest black holes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250810093231.htm","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 14:27:48 GMT","

Astronomers have discovered potentially the most massive black hole ever detected.

The cosmic behemoth is close to the theoretical upper limit of what is possible in the universe and is 10,000 times heavier than the black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy.

It exists in one of the most massive galaxies ever observed - the Cosmic Horseshoe - which is so big it distorts spacetime and warps the passing light of a background galaxy into a giant horseshoe-shaped Einstein ring.

Such is the enormousness of the ultramassive black hole's size, it equates to 36 billion solar masses, according to a new paper published on August 7 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

It is thought that every galaxy in the universe has a supermassive black hole at its center and that bigger galaxies host bigger ones, known as ultramassive black holes.

""This is amongst the top 10 most massive black holes ever discovered, and quite possibly the most massive,"" said researcher Professor Thomas Collett, of the University of Portsmouth.

""Most of the other black hole mass measurements are indirect and have quite large uncertainties, so we really don't know for sure which is biggest. However, we've got much more certainty about the mass of this black hole thanks to our new method.""

Researchers detected the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole using a combination of gravitational lensing and stellar kinematics (the study of the motion of stars within galaxies and the speed and way they move around black holes).

The latter is seen as the gold standard for measuring black hole masses, but doesn't really work outside of the very nearby universe because galaxies appear too small on the sky to resolve the region where a supermassive or ultramassive black hole lies.

Adding in gravitational lensing helped the team ""push much further out into the universe,"" Professor Collett said.

""We detected the effect of the black hole in two ways - it is altering the path that light takes as it travels past the black hole and it is causing the stars in the inner regions of its host galaxy to move extremely quickly (almost 400 km/s).

""By combining these two measurements we can be completely confident that the black hole is real.""

Lead researcher, PhD candidate Carlos Melo, of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in Brazil, added: ""This discovery was made for a 'dormant' black hole - one that isn't actively accreting material at the time of observation.

""Its detection relied purely on its immense gravitational pull and the effect it has on its surroundings.

""What is particularly exciting is that this method allows us to detect and measure the mass of these hidden ultramassive black holes across the universe, even when they are completely silent.""

The Cosmic Horseshoe black hole is located a long way away from Earth, at a distance of some 5 billion light-years.

""Typically, for such remote systems, black hole mass measurements are only possible when the black hole is active,"" Melo said. ""But those accretion-based estimates often come with significant uncertainties.

""Our approach, combining strong lensing with stellar dynamics, offers a more direct and robust measurement, even for these distant systems.""

The discovery is significant because it will help astronomers understand the connection between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies.

""We think the size of both is intimately linked,"" Professor Collett added, ""because when galaxies grow they can funnel matter down onto the central black hole.

""Some of this matter grows the black hole but lots of it shines away in an incredibly bright source called a quasar. These quasars dump huge amounts of energy into their host galaxies, which stops gas clouds condensing into new stars.""

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, hosts a 4 million solar mass black hole. Currently it's not growing fast enough to blast out energy as a quasar but we know it has done in the past, and it may will do again in the future.

The Andromeda Galaxy and our Milky Way are moving together and are expected to merge in about 4.5 billion years, which is the most likely time for our supermassive black hole to become a quasar once again, the researchers say.

An interesting feature of the Cosmic Horseshoe system is that the host galaxy is a so-called fossil group.

Fossil groups are the end state of the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe, arising when they have collapsed down to a single extremely massive galaxy, with no bright companions.

""It is likely that all of the supermassive black holes that were originally in the companion galaxies have also now merged to form the ultramassive black hole that we have detected,"" said Professor Collett.

""So we're seeing the end state of galaxy formation and the end state of black hole formation.""

The discovery of the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole was somewhat of a serendipitous discovery. It came about as the researchers were studying the galaxy's dark matter distribution in an attempt to learn more about the mysterious hypothetical substance.

Now that they've realized their new method works for black holes, they hope to use data from the European Space Agency's Euclid space telescope to detect more supermassive black holes and their hosts to help understand how black holes stop galaxies forming stars.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found a tiny molecule that could change how we lose weight","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250809100924.htm","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 04:33:05 GMT","

The obesity rate has more than doubled in the last 30 years, affecting more than one billion people worldwide. This prevalent condition is also linked to other metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, and cancers. Current treatment options include lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery, and GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic or Wegovy, but many patients struggle to access or complete these treatments or to maintain their weight loss afterwards.

Salk Institute scientists are looking for a new treatment strategy in microproteins, an understudied class of molecules found throughout the body that play roles in both health and disease. In a new study, the researchers screened thousands of fat cell genes using CRISPR gene editing to find dozens of genes that likely code for microproteins -- one of which they confirmed -- that regulate either fat cell proliferation or lipid accumulation.

The findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on August 7, 2025, identify new microproteins that could potentially serve as drug targets to treat obesity and other metabolic disorders. The study also showcases the value of CRISPR screening in future microprotein discovery.

""CRISPR screening is extremely effective at finding important factors in obesity and metabolism that could become therapeutic targets,"" says senior author Alan Saghatelian, a professor and holder of the Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair at Salk. ""These new screening technologies are allowing us to reveal a whole new level of biological regulation driven by microproteins. The more we screen, the more disease-associated microproteins we find, and the more potential targets we have for future drug development.""

Current obesity and metabolic disorder therapeutics

When our energy consumption exceeds our energy expenditure, fat cells can grow in both size and number. Fat cells store the excess energy in the form of fatty molecules called lipids. But while some excess storage is manageable, too much can cause fat deposits to accumulate around the body -- leading to whole-body inflammation and organ dysfunction.

Many factors regulate this complex energy storage system. The problem is, how do we find them all, and how do we filter for factors that may make good therapeutic candidates?

This has been a longstanding question for Salk scientists. In fact, Salk Professor Ronald Evans has been working on it for decades. Evans is an expert on PPAR gamma, a key regulator of fat cell development and a potent target for treating diabetes. Several drugs have been developed to target PPAR gamma to treat obesity, but they resulted in side effects like weight gain and bone loss. An ideal PPAR gamma-based obesity therapeutic has yet to hit the market.

When PPAR gamma drugs fell short, GLP-1 drugs entered the scene. GLP-1 is a peptide small enough to be considered a microprotein, and it serves as a blood sugar and appetite regulator. But, like PPAR gamma, GLP-1 drugs have their own shortcomings, such as muscle loss and nausea. Nonetheless, the popularity of GLP-1 drugs demonstrates a promising future for microprotein drugs in the obesity therapeutic space.

Saghatelian's team is now searching for the next microprotein therapeutic with new genetic tools that bring microproteins out of the ""dark."" For many years, long stretches of the genome have been considered ""junk"" and thus left unexplored. But recent technological advances have allowed scientists to look at these dark sections and find a hidden world of microproteins -- in turn, expanding protein libraries by 10 to 30 percent.

In particular, the Salk team is using innovative CRISPR screening to scour the ""dark"" for possible microproteins. This approach is enabling the simultaneous discovery of thousands of potential microproteins involved in lipid storage and fat cell biology, accelerating the search for the next PPAR gamma or GLP-1 drug.

How CRISPR screening accelerates the search for microproteins

CRISPR screens work by cutting out genes of interest in cells and observing whether the cell thrives or dies without them. From these results, scientists can determine the importance and function of specific genes. In this case, the Salk team was interested in genes that may code for microproteins involved in fat cell differentiation or proliferation.

""We wanted to know if there was anything we had been missing in all these years of research into the body's metabolic processes,"" says first author Victor Pai, a postdoctoral researcher in Saghatelian's lab. ""And CRISPR allows us to pick out interesting and functional genes that specifically impact lipid accumulation and fat cell development.""

This latest research follows up on a prior study from Saghatelian's lab. The previous study identified thousands of potential microproteins by analyzing microprotein-coding RNA strands derived from mouse fat tissues. These microprotein-coding RNA strands were filed away to await investigation into their functions.

The new study first expanded this collection to include additional microproteins identified from a pre-fat cell model. Notably, this new model captures the differentiation process from pre-fat cell to a fully mature fat cell. Next, the researchers screened the cell model with CRISPR to determine how many of these potential microproteins were involved in fat cell differentiation or proliferation.

""We're not the first to screen for microproteins with CRISPR,"" adds Pai, ""but we're the first to look for microproteins involved in fat cell proliferation. This is a huge step for metabolism and obesity research.""

Microproteins of interest and next steps

Using their mouse model and CRISPR screening approach, the team identified microproteins that may be involved in fat cell biology. They then narrowed the pool even further with another experiment to create a shortlist of 38 potential microproteins involved in lipid droplet formation -- which indicates increasing fat storage -- during fat cell differentiation.

At this point, the shortlisted microproteins were all still ""potential"" microproteins. This is because the genetic screening finds genes that may code for microproteins, rather than finding the microproteins themselves. While this approach is a helpful workaround to finding microproteins that are otherwise so small they elude capture, it also means that the screened microproteins require further testing to confirm whether they are functional.

And that's what the Salk team did next. They picked several of the shortlisted microproteins to test and were able to verify one. Pai hypothesizes this new microprotein, called Adipocyte-smORF-1183, influences lipid droplet formation in fat cells (also known as adipocytes).

Verification of Adipocyte-smORF-1183 is an exciting step toward identifying more microproteins involved in lipid accumulation and fat cell regulation in obesity. It also verifies that CRISPR is an effective tool for finding microproteins involved in fat cell biology, obesity, and metabolism.

""That's the goal of research, right?"" says Saghatelian. ""You keep going. It's a constant process of improvement as we establish better technology and better workflows to enhance discovery and, eventually, therapeutic outcomes down the line.""

Next, the researchers will repeat the study with human fat cells. They also hope their success inspires others to use CRISPR screenings to continue bringing microproteins out from the dark -- like Adipocyte-smORF-1183, which until now, was considered an unimportant bit of ""junk"" DNA.

Further validation or screening of new cell libraries will expand the list of potential drug candidates, setting the stage for the new-and-improved obesity and metabolic disorder therapeutics of the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This tiny spacecraft could race to a black hole and rewrite physics","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250810093236.htm","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 16:48:47 GMT","

It sounds like science fiction: a spacecraft, no heavier than a paperclip, propelled by a laser beam and hurtling through space at the speed of light toward a black hole, on a mission to probe the very fabric of space and time and test the laws of physics. But to astrophysicist and black hole expert Cosimo Bambi, the idea is not so far-fetched.

Reporting in the Cell Press journal iScience, Bambi outlines the blueprint for turning this interstellar voyage to a black hole into a reality. If successful, this century-long mission could return data from nearby black holes that completely alter our understanding of general relativity and the rules of physics.

""We don't have the technology now,"" says author Cosimo Bambi of Fudan University in China. ""But in 20 or 30 years, we might.""

The mission hinges on two key challenges -- finding a black hole close enough to target and developing probes capable of withstanding the journey.

Previous knowledge on how stars evolve suggests that there could be a black hole lurking just 20 to 25 light-years from Earth, but finding it won't be easy, says Bambi. Because black holes don't emit or reflect light, they are virtually invisible to telescopes. Instead, scientists detect and study them based on how they influence nearby stars or distort light.

""There have been new techniques to discover black holes,"" says Bambi. ""I think it's reasonable to expect we could find a nearby one within the next decade.""

Once the target is identified, the next hurdle is getting there. Traditional spacecrafts, powered by chemical fuel, are too clunky and slow to make the journey. Bambi points to nanocrafts -- gram-scale probes consisting of a microchip and light sail -- as a possible solution. Earth-based lasers would blast the sail with photons, accelerating the craft to a third of the speed of light.

At that pace, the craft could reach a black hole 20 to 25 light-years away in about 70 years. The data it gathers would take another two decades to get back to Earth, making the total mission duration around 80 to 100 years.

Once the craft is near the black hole, researchers could run experiments to answer some of the most pressing questions in physics. Does a black hole truly have an event horizon, the boundary beyond which not even light can escape its gravitational pull? Do the rules of physics change near a black hole? Does Einstein's theory of general relativity hold under the universe's most extreme conditions?

Bambi notes that the lasers alone would cost around one trillion euros today, and the technology to create a nanocraft does not yet exist. But in 30 years, he says that costs may fall and technology may catch up to these bold ideas.

""It may sound really crazy, and in a sense closer to science fiction,"" says Bambi. ""But people said we'd never detect gravitational waves because they're too weak. We did -- 100 years later. People thought we'd never observe the shadows of black holes. Now, 50 years later, we have images of two.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Losing weight but gaining weakness? What Ozempic might be doing to your muscles","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250809100959.htm","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 06:18:56 GMT","

As use of the popular anti-diabetic and weight-loss drug Ozempic skyrockets, so have concerns about the medication's side effects. One such side effect is loss of ""lean mass"" -- body weight that isn't fat -- raising concerns that Ozempic could be reducing muscle mass and strength.

New research in mice suggests that muscle mass changes less than expected, but muscles may still get weaker, pointing out an urgent need for clinical studies to pin down the full effects of the popular medications.

""If we want to really help the individuals who may be losing muscle mass, then we need to know that they're actually losing muscle mass,"" says Katsu Funai, PhD, associate professor of nutrition and integrative physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and the senior author on the study. ""We have data in mice that suggest that things are not as straightforward as they might seem.""

The results are published in Cell Metabolism.

A weighty concern

Researchers found that Ozempic-induced weight loss did decrease lean mass by about 10%. Most of this lost weight wasn't from skeletal muscles but instead from other tissues like the liver, which shrunk by nearly half. The researchers emphasize that more research is needed to determine whether similar changes to organ size occur in humans -- and whether those changes come with any risks.

""Loss of mass in metabolically active organs, such as the liver, is expected as part of healthy weight loss,"" says Ran Hee Choi, PhD, research instructor in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and co-first author on the study. In both mice and humans, weight gain and loss can affect the size of organs like the liver without affecting their function. ""It's unlikely that the observed lean mass loss represents a serious adverse effect,"" says Takuya Karasawa, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in the U of U Molecular Medicine Program and co-first author on the study.

Some skeletal muscles did shrink as the mice lost weight -- on average, by about 6%, not enough to explain the overall loss in lean mass. Other muscles stayed the same size.

Some of this loss in muscle mass is a return to baseline, the researchers say. Gains in fat also tend to lead to gains in skeletal muscle, since the body must do more work to move around. So loss of fat can lead to loss of muscle without affecting overall quality of life.

Size isn't strength

Interestingly, when the researchers tested the amount of force the mice's muscles could exert, they found that, for some muscles, strength decreased as the mice lost weight, even when the size of the muscle stayed roughly the same. For other muscles, strength was unchanged. It's unknown how weight loss drugs affect this balance in people, the researchers say.

A potential loss of strength when taking Ozempic may be of particular concern for adults over the age of 60, who are at higher baseline risk for muscle loss and reduced mobility. ""The loss of physical function is a strong predictor of not just quality of life but longevity,"" Funai adds.

Clinical trials are needed

The researchers caution against extrapolating their results directly into humans, because mice and humans gain and lose weight in different ways. In people, obesity is associated with lower physical activity, but mice don't tend to become less active when they gain weight. And the mice in this study became overweight because they ate a high-fat diet, whereas people become overweight for a wide variety of reasons that include genetics, diet, sleeping patterns, and age.

Instead of drawing a one-to-one parallel with humans, the researchers say their results emphasize the need for more clinical studies. ""There remains a significant need for validation in humans, especially concerning muscle strength,"" Karasawa says.

Funai adds that clinical trials should check for changes in muscle strength not just for Ozempic but also future weight-loss drugs. ""There are many additional weight loss drugs that are in clinical trials and coming out in the next three to five years,"" Funai says. ""But with all those clinical trials, if they're interested in measuring lean mass loss, they need to consider physical function.""

Considering the widespread use of contactless payment systems, it's no surprise that portable point-of-sale thefts are making a comeback. This type of robbery is enjoying a new wave of popularity, and is much harder to spot given how quickly those transactions take place. But how much risk is there, really? And how can you protect yourself from POS scams?

A recent example of POS theft happened recently in Italy, when  topic exploded again a few days ago when the news agency Ansa reported an arrest made in Sorrento after someone attempted to steal €100 from a cash register in a bar in the city center. During the search, law enforcement allegedly found a modified portable POS terminal.

It wasn't the first time the alleged thief had been stopped with such a device; Ansa reports that they had been arrested previously in Rome. The device shown in the photos circulated by the media appears to be a SumUp Solo, or a portable POS capable of operating independently without being connected to a smartphone. It is a popular type of device in stalls and markets, given its affordability and ease of use.

This is also not the first time robbers with tech equipment have been arrested. In fact, last year Ansa reported on a similar case with apprehensions occurring at a highway rest stop.

There are two possible modus operandi for this type of scam. The first is the more convenient one for the robbers: They steal a wallet and, at a later time, make a series of small transactions with a stolen card that do not require entering the PIN, as if to simulate a series of short-term purchases. When the limit is reached, the wallet is thrown away.

The second method can be described as a kind of trawling. Thieves choose crowded places with high densities of people likely to come in contact with one another, such as public transportation or lines in commercial establishments. They then proceed to create a payment request on a portable POS, hold it in their hands or hide it in some way, and place it in the back pockets of pants, bags, fanny packs, backpacks, and so on.

The success rate is very low due to a number of factors. The first is that it takes about 30 seconds to receive confirmation of the transaction, before the request must be repeated from the POS. The second is that the POS must be almost in contact with the card, usually within 0.5 to 4 cm. The third is that there must be no interfering elements, such as other cards. Therefore, the robber must encounter a series of fortuitous circumstances to be successful. While the rate of success is very low, it is not zero, so it is best to limit your risk as much as possible. Here are some tips.

It goes without saying that if you stick your wallet in the back pocket of your pants in plain view, you not only risk being robbed in the traditional way, but you also create the best scenario for this newer scam. You can opt for wallets with integrated RFID protection, which create a real barrier to these types of scams.

For maximum protection, you can receive notifications even for small contactless transactions through your bank 's app settings. Fraudsters typically choose small amounts, trusting that the victim will not receive notifications—often the victim may not notice the amount being withdrawn, perhaps confusing it with other small transactions. If you fall for the scam, it's advisable to contact your bank immediately to dispute the transactions: Since everything is traceable, it's possible to identify the device used by the fraudsters, although they may have switched to a new one in the meantime.

Finally, almost all modern smartphones are now equipped with an NFC chip for contactless payments. Thefts using portable POS terminals can often be prevented by the fact that the smartphone must be unlocked, so even if someone places a POS terminal on the unattended phone, no transaction takes place.

One of the most important senses we have as bike riders is our hearing. Whether you're in a group ride, where other riders are calling out road and traffic hazards, or alone, to keep ears out for vehicles or other rides coming from our rear, our ears are nearly as essential as our eyes.

Bone-conduction headphones—which sit outside the ears and deliver sound through vibration—have been around for some time. But Irvine, California-based Sena has consistently raised the bar on bicycling helmets with integrated speakers. Their newest offering, the S1, blends Sena's audio technology with the aerodynamic advantages craved by so many road cyclists.

With a smooth outer shell, the Sena S1 looks, fits, and feels every bit the aero road helmet that has boomed in popularity over the last decade. It's sleek, with a quintet of front-facing vents and a pair out the back to keep your head cool during hot rides. Its mixture of flat and gloss finishes gives the helmet a modern contrasting style that would look at home in the Tour de France peloton.

It's light, weighing just 360 grams, and at $229, it's priced like a higher-end aero helmet, despite the fact that it's equipped with a pair of over-ear speakers and a microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, a built-in taillight, and Sena's proprietary Mesh Intercom system, which allows you to communicate with other riders wearing any variety of Sena helmets.

I tested the Sena S1 on one of the stupidest rides I've done in a long time: that is, when I set out to ride a hundred miles around a quarter-mile asphalt track near my home. (I'm not totally insane. I swear I was doing it for another story.) For a ride as boring and monotonous as the ¼-mile century I was set to undertake, I needed a bit of distraction. Luckily, I had a Sena S1 sitting in my office.

I've never really messed with any sort of headphones while on my bike for a few reasons. First and foremost, safety. I like to hear what's happening around me, especially when riding on the road. Second, as far as I'm concerned, hearing the wind in my ears, the birds chirp above my head, my tires cruising smoothly over the pavement or crunching the dirt beneath my wheels, is as much a part of the bike-riding experience as turning my pedals. Third, we live in an age in which we're all subject to a constant onslaught of content. The bike is my sanctuary from all that, a place where no Instagram Reel or hot take on a podcast can find me.

That said, with the doldrums of 400 laps around one track staring me in the face, I decided to set up the S1 to enjoy a bit of music and conversation to pass the time.

Getting my new S1 up and running proved to be no issue. After charging it in full, which took two and a half hours (giving a reported maximum 12 hours of use time), the helmet immediately found and paired with my phone. Once paired, I was able to listen to music and podcasts during my seemingly infinite loop, and take calls from my wife, who reached out every half hour or so for status updates on my silly ride.

If I was doing anything other than turning left some 1,600 times, the Sena S1 could have delivered turn-by-turn directions straight into my ears. Basically, anything your phone or bike computer (ahem … structured workouts) can do via audio, an S1 can relay.

Despite the fact that I was rolling anywhere between 17 and 20 mph and fighting a vicious headwind on the track's backstretch, my wife's calls were shockingly clear, with the little microphone embedded into the helmet's crown picking up everything I was saying to her. Additionally, even as I listened to music, I was able to hear everything that was happening in the world beyond my helmet, which is essential.

A few days before my ride, I put out word to my local cycling community, asking friends to come join me for a dozen laps or a hundred, to keep me company, to keep me sane. One friend, a local racer, volunteered not only to ride with me, but to try a second S1, that we might test out the brand's mesh intercom.

We stayed on opposite sides of the track, talking about our families, news around town, about why the hell I was riding a hundred miles in quarter-mile increments. Just like on the calls with my wife, the sound quality was good, the microphones' noise-canceling technology taking most of the ambient wind out of our back-and-forth.

Now, if you're an audiophile looking for high-end sound quality on your rides, it's best to skip the S1, as the sonics coming out of the speakers is nothing to write home about. Then again, it's ridiculous to expect amazing sound to come from a pair of speakers mounted in a bike helmet that connect to your phone wirelessly. These are amazing times we live in. Enjoy them.

I had only one minor problem with the S1. The helmet only has four buttons—a volume up and down button, a multifunction button, and a light button—which means several different functions are assigned to each. For example, the helmet's volume buttons double as cue buttons, allowing you to scan between music tracks on your phone. The problem is, to change the functions of each button, you have to hold them down for a quick second or two. It's an easy workaround to keep the helmet's buttons limited to four. However, it took me a good bit of usage for the order of operations to become second nature.

But all in all, the S1 is an amazing piece of technology. If you, unlike me, are someone who likes a bit of distraction during your rides, it's more than worth the spend. Unless you're also planning on riding a century, one quarter-mile loop at a time, in which case, it's probably essential.

I've never had particularly sensitive nipples—except for the first time I went to a clothing-optional beach and failed to use enough sunblock—so I was excited to give the Lovense Gemini a try.

No, it has nothing to do with Google's AI chatbot. These are vibrating nipple clamps from Lovense, and I've had great experience with many of the company's sex toys. Many of my partners have had sensitive nipples, so I was curious if I could join the ranks with the Gemini. Usually sold for less than $80, they're an inexpensive way to spice up the bedroom.

After I fully charged the Gemini, which takes about an hour or so, I used it on myself. What I love is that I can clip the base of the clamps to my bra (there's also a cord you can put around your neck if you don't wear a bra), making them 100 percent hands-free.

The Gemini is app-controlled (Android, iOS), so I can lie back and play with the slew of intensities and patterns—surprisingly fun even though I was solo. When I added a bullet vibrator to the mix, the vibrations all over made everything even more exciting in a low-key, kinky sort of way. I also appreciate that the clamps are adjustable, so if you love a tight squeeze, a barely there hold, or somewhere in between, you have options.

Unlike some of the more intimate toys I've reviewed, like the Luxus Couples Vibrator or the Lelo Ora 3, I was able to get input from a handful of people with the Gemini. Especially people I know who really (like, really) love nipple play. As much as I enjoyed the vibrations and found the sensation interesting, the Gemini made me realize that, ultimately, I prefer that my nipples get attention from a partner's tongue or with a slight graze of their teeth.

Of the three nipple-play aficionados I used the Gemini with—one straight and two gay men—all of them became immediate fans of the toy. They liked the hands-free design and the simplicity of the Lovense Remote app. To paint a picture of this experiment, I had the app in hand, and three men sat on the couch across from me, waiting for their turn to try the Gemini. (It's the closest I'll probably ever get to an orgy.) Each man had a different preference in intensity and patterns, as well as the tightness of the clamps, so I was able to see just how much the Gemini can be the perfect fit for anyone who's into nipple play.

The Gemini is well-built, too. Not only is it waterproof—for all those times you're craving a proper buzz on your nips while in the shower—but you also get a whopping two hours of run time when it's fully charged. The device is discreet, in case you're into public play where one partner enjoys the vibrations, while the other controls what they want you to feel.

My only gripe is that it can take a bit for your phone to connect to the Gemini. When it does, it's smooth sailing. If you're not an app person, don't sweat it. It allows for both short- and long-distance play, but the Gemini can also be controlled with the one button on the main part of the device, so you can forgo the app. It's here that you can turn it on and off by holding the button down for about three seconds.

The biggest selling point is that it takes nipple play to new heights. I'm not just talking about the vibrations, but the reality that we're dealing with actual nipple clamps that might scare some away. If you dip your toe into nipple clamps, what's next? A ball gag? A latex fetish? Are you headed toward orgy territory à la Jerry Seinfeld? Will you have to dress and act differently, grow a mustache, get robes and lotions, and a new bedspread and curtains?

The Gemini brings another sensation to the equation that, yes, might be the intro to BDSM you've been needing. On Lovense's website, the company says the Gemini bridges the intimacy gap and can play a role in light BDSM. But ignore all of that. The Gemini delivers great vibrations, and if you're someone who loves nipple play, I strongly recommend giving it a shot. Even if you don't think it's for you, it will open your mind up to something new, and that newness might be everything your nipples have been seeking.

While Apple is very keen that its macOS software is only ever run on Macs, there are numerous options for doing the opposite and running Windows on Apple computers. If you're a developer, or need access to both Windows and Mac apps, or simply want the flexibility of two operating systems, this isn't too difficult to set up with the right tools.

The option we'll cover here is Parallels Desktop for Mac. This is certainly not the cheapest of your options, but it is fully authorized and legal, as well as being reliable, straightforward, and backed up with regular updates and customer support. It's one of those cases where, we believe, it's worth the investment.

To get up and running, you just need a Mac with an internet connection. There are a handful of minimum requirements, but mostly you'll want to be sure you have at least 4 GB of RAM and at least 16 GB free for the Windows installation—Parallels itself is 600MB.

Head to the Parallels website, and you'll see you can try out Parallels Desktop for Mac for free for 14 days. If you do decide it's worth paying for, the standard subscription that's suitable for most individuals (rather than businesses) will set you back $100 per year.

Follow the link to download the software, and once it's installed on macOS, you'll be taken through the setup process. Along the way, you'll be prompted to download and install Windows 11, which is quite a hefty download: Click the Install Windows button to initiate the process.

Parallels sets up a virtual machine on your Mac, then installs Windows inside it—you're essentially installing the operating system as an app, rather than a fundamental layer, so as soon as Parallels is closed (or is uninstalled), Windows goes away with it. Virtualization software like this can cause performance issues and sluggishness, but these issues are thankfully minimized with Parallels.

After Windows is successfully downloaded and installed, the next step is to activate it. This involves paying for a Windows 11 Pro licence, which at the time of writing will set you back $200. To legally use and operate Windows, you need to buy a licence for it inside Parallels, even if you already have the operating system installed on other computers.

During the licence purchase and activation process, you'll need to sign in with your Microsoft account (or sign up for one, if you haven't already). This gives you the opportunity to sync across files from any other Windows PCs you might have, which you can manage from Accounts > Windows backup in Settings.

With all the preparation work taken care of, running Windows on macOS is as simple as launching Parallels Desktop for Mac. You can use Windows in full screen mode, or as a windowed app that behaves in a similar way to other macOS apps, and Parallels makes sure that you can use your Mac's keyboard and trackpad (or mouse) to control Microsoft's operating system.

If you've used Windows before, you'll be right at home using it inside Parallels Desktop for Mac: It's essentially the same as using it on a PC, except you're running it inside an app. For the best experience, go into full screen mode: You can do this by clicking on the green circle in the top left corner of the window, or by choosing View > Enter Full Screen from the program menus.

That same View menu also has an Enter Coherence option you can select. This mode lets you run applications inside the Windows environment as if they were Mac apps: So if you launch Windows Notepad or Paint, for example, they'll appear as apps in the Mac dock, and you can use them right alongside your macOS programs. It's handy if you just want to use a select number of Windows apps on macOS, rather than the whole operating system. To exit out of the mode, choose View > Exit Coherence from any Windows app.

One aspect of Windows on macOS you may struggle with initially is keyboard shortcuts: Mac keyboards are substantially different from Windows PC keyboards (you don't have the Alt key or the Windows key, for example). If you open the Devices menu and choose Keyboard, there are quick links to a lot of common Windows keyboard shortcuts. Click Customize and you can create your own shortcuts too.

Transferring files between Windows and macOS isn't difficult. You'll see there's a Mac Files folder on the Windows desktop by default: Click this to get at the main folders on your macOS system drive. If you need these files in the Windows environment, you can just drag and drop them into place, or manipulate them with the usual File Explorer commands. Files can be moved in the opposite direction in the same way.

Open up the File menu, and you can jump straight to key destinations inside Windows, including the Device Manager and the Task Manager. Via the Actions menu, you can put Windows to sleep, restart the virtual PC, and launch Travel Mode, which goes easier on battery life. Note that Windows will automatically be put into a pause state when you head back to macOS and your Mac apps.

To configure Parallels Desktop for Mac, open up Actions and choose Configure. A wealth of options are available here, covering everything from how Windows is optimized to security features (you can have a password prompt every time Windows is launched, for example). You can also change the size of the virtual hard disk Windows is on, via the Hardware tab.

It happens to the best of us: You wake up in the middle of the night, clammy and swimming in sweat. If you're a hot sleeper, a cooling mattress may be for you. Waking up sweaty and hot can be caused by several factors, like sleeping conditions, stress, excessive blankets, the wrong pajamas, and even eating spicy foods before bed. Hot nights can also equate to sleepless nights. According to a study from the Journal of Physiological Anthropology, heat exposure increases wakefulness and decreases time spent in deep sleep and REM sleep.

A cooling mattress is built specifically to help regulate your body temperature by being made of materials that optimize airflow and draw heat away from your body as you sleep. I (and some of my sweatiest colleagues) tested a myriad of cooling mattresses for at least a week each in our homes—to determine which worked best to beat the heat. (All prices listed are for queen size.)

Be sure to read our other sleep guides, including the Best Mattresses, Best Mattresses for Side Sleepers, Best Organic Mattresses, Best Bed Sheets, and Best Sleep Trackers.

Updated August 2025: We've added the Wolf Memory Foam Hybrid Premium Firm, Brooklyn Bedding CopperFlex Hybrid, and Zinus 12-Inch Green Tea Memory Foam mattresses, and updated prices throughout.

Bedgear

Amazon (H4)

Bedgear

Every Bedgear mattress I've tested is extremely cooling, comfy, and a super-fair price for the quality. This H Performance Mattress is no different. Like the others, it's literally cool to the touch, with a swirly-design silky Ver-Tex cover that wicks away moisture and regulates temperature. (The H4 is medium firm, and the H6 is medium plush.) The sides of the mattress are made from Air-X panels that are netlike, which further aid in air circulation. This hybrid mattress uses pocketed coils at the bottom for support and multiple layers of memory-like foam up top. This cooling mattress is the most consistently cooling bed I've tested, it feels more expensive than its price tag, and it has replaced my original mattress—that's how much I love it.

The price ranges from $1,619 for a twin to $2,609 for a split head California king.

Wolf

Amazon

Wolf

This 12-inch, US-made medium-firm memory foam hybrid mattress has seven layers that really help the overall cooling effect. The top layer is a breathable stretch knit cover that helps with airflow, then there are textured, super comfy cooling gel memory foams. The gel-infused convoluted foam helps regulate temperature and provide cooling comfort. The bottom half has a layer of high-density plush support foam, then 8 inches of individually wrapped coils that help with support and low-motion transfer.

It has a 101-night trial and a lifetime warranty and is compatible with a myriad of bases, including an adjustable option. It feels much more luxe than its super-low price and far exceeded my expectations. The top knit cover provides breathability, helping to regulate temperature, while the gel foams are comfy and cooling, and the wrapped-coil bottom provides even more space for airflow.

The price ranges from $749 for a twin to $1,099 for a king, with prices further changing depending on firmness and height.

Bedgear

Bedgear (Firm)

Bedgear (Medium)

Bedgear (Plush)

This affordable option from Bedgear is literally cool to the touch with its silky smooth top Ver-Tex cover that's designed to reduce overheating. It has 1.5 inches of ventilated foam with vertically drilled holes to help increase airflow and maintain structure. It also uses Bedgear's Air-X mesh fabric that has an open ventilation design that helps with continuous airflow and helps regulate body temperature. The ventilated React foam technology on top not only helps with pressure relief, but aids in air circulation. That silky Ver-Tex top definitely diverts heat away from your body (helping to stop overheating before you get warm) and was continuously cool every night I slept on it. This 10-inch bed ships free to the lower 48, has a 10-year manufacturer's warranty, and can be returned if opened within 30 days or, if unopened, returned within 100 days. With options for firm, medium, or plush, this mattress is versatile and budget-friendly. It's our top pick for Cheap Mattresses because of its super-fair price point.

The price ranges from $549 for a twin to $1,599 for a California king, with prices further changing depending on firmness.

Awara

Awara

The Awara Premier Luxury Hybrid mattress is the elevated big brother to the similar Awara Natural, which is a top pick in my guide to the Best Cheap Mattresses. This mattress has a cooling wool and rayon blend quilted cover top, followed by a layer of sustainable GOLS- and FSC-certified organic foam, with coils on the bottom for spinal support and structure (including four handles for easier moving). The blend of foam and coils also helped to promote airflow, as all-foam mattresses can be too dense and make the sleeper hot. This 12-inch organic mattress is listed as a 6 on the firmness scale, with 10 being the firmest—it was slightly more firm than I usually like, but it was still comfortable. The edge support was pretty solid, although the mattress top tended to bubble up in certain areas. That silky wool-rayon blend on the quilted top and coil-foam structure helped increase airflow to maintain a cool temperature while sleeping. Overall, the mattress is well-made using solid, organic, and sustainable materials that helped to keep things cool. I really liked this luxe organic mattress. I just wish it were a tad more plush.

The price ranges from $799 for a twin to $1,998 for a split king, although the mattresses are often discounted.

Leesa

The Legend Chill delivered on support, and also had superb cooling qualities, so much so that I found I was significantly less restless at night, falling asleep almost the moment my head hit the pillow. The mattress' quilted top layer feels ultra-luxe and is cool on contact. The breathable phase-change fibers draw heat away from the body and release it when your body is cooler to regulate temperature. The airiness is prevalent throughout the bed—right down to the coils, resulting in a deep sleep without sweat. —Nicole Kinning

The price ranges from $2,099 for a Twin to $3,399 for a California King, although the mattresses are often discounted.

Brooklyn Bedding

Brooklyn Bedding

This comfy bed features a gel foam top, with copper-infused memory foam under, and Variflex IQ memory foam that is specifically designed to conform to your body's curves. (We also reviewed—and liked—the CopperFlex mattress topper.) The CopperFlex Memory Foam is infused with copper particles to help wick moisture and provide heat regulation and dispersal. Brooklyn Bedding claims that the natural antimicrobial properties promote a cleaner and healthier space to sleep. It's a little on the firmer side, but the comfy and cooling copper-infused pillow top conforms seamlessly to your body's pressure points.

The price ranges from $665 for a twin to $1,199 for a California king, although the mattresses are often discounted.

Wayfair

My husband is a hot sleeper who will never go without a blanket no matter how hot he gets. This 11.5-inch hybrid mattress was a game changer, offering excellent pressure relief and cushioning thanks to Purple's distinctive GelFlex layer. I also found that the springy gel layer enhances the overall coolness of the bed, offering a refreshing sleep environment, especially when compared to foam-top mattresses that are more likely to trap body heat. Beneath the GelFlex grid lies a dense and supportive polyfoam and pocketed cooling coils. But the true star of the show covers the mattress's interior: a lightweight yarn-woven mattress cover, which remains noticeably chilly to the touch all night long. —Nicole Kinning

The price ranges from $1,999 for a twin XL to $3,998 for a split king.

Wolf

Amazon

Wolf makes another appearance on this list because, honestly, it's that doggone good. Upon hearing about Molly's glowing review, I decided to also jump on the bandwagon. This time, I opted for the Wolf 13-inch Memory Foam Hybrid Premium Firm Mattress. Let me tell you, it was a superstar from night one of testing. I could feel the cooling cover through my cooling sheets, and that was a double-whammy win for me. I loved the firmer feel, which was helpful for keeping my spine aligned. Even still, there was plenty of pressure relief for my hips and shoulders to get a break as well. —Julia Forbes

The price ranges from $749 for a twin to $1,099 for a king, with prices varying by mattress type.

Bedgear

Bedgear

The modular Bedgear Split Head M3 mattress is like a perfectly crafted puzzle. When ordering an M3, you and your sleeping partner don't have to compromise on cushioning—you can each choose from four levels of firmness for each side of the bed. Adding to this personal touch is the bed's split head, particularly advantageous when coupled with Bedgear's adjustable base. (The base is jam-packed with bed-of-the-future features like motion-sensing LEDs, built-in Bluetooth speakers, and massagers.) As if all the bells and whistles weren't enough, the M3's cooling technology is extremely well thought out, right down to the mattress core. Perforated individually wrapped coils allow for increased air circulation, and the silky patented Ver-Tex cooling cover is equipped with air-ventilated panels, providing a refreshing, sweat-free slumber without sacrificing coziness. —Nicole Kinning

The price ranges from $2,999 for a split head queen to $4,198 for a split head California king.

BedJet

There are a ton of mattresses and related on the market that claim to have cooling benefits. Here are a few others we tested and liked, but not as much as the options above.

BedJet 3 for $387: WIRED reviewer Christopher Null liked this climate-control device a lot because it allowed him to sleep cool without having to buy a whole new mattress. This device uses a large blower under your bed to blast hot or cool air beneath your covers. If you like your existing mattress but find yourself sleeping hot, this could be just the ticket.

Sealy Cocoon Chill Memory Foam Mattress for $699: Its surface is noticeably cool to the touch thanks to its exclusive phase change material, which works wonders at drawing and storing the body's heat. This all-foam mattress leans firm, making it well-suited for back and stomach sleepers. If you're a side sleeper looking for more body contouring, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. If you're a stomach sleeper looking for a firm mattress that's also cooling, this one will do the trick. There was almost no motion transfer in my testing, allowing my husband and me to get up at different times without disturbing each other. —Nicole Kinning

Zinus 12-Inch Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress for $281: This dense behemoth is composed of 12 inches of layered foams, topped with a thin layer of green tea and purified charcoal foam to help with the overall freshness of the mattress over time as the activated charcoal microparticles block moisture and odor. The densely layered foams give cradling and conforming support to help with joints and spine support, but for my smaller frame, it was a bit too firm. Despite being made of memory foam, the bed kept cool, and the infused materials help to wick moisture and keep the material fresh.

Casper Snow Hybrid for $2,495: When you come across a mattress with a name that includes “snow,” your expectations for cooling effects are naturally high—and this mattress indeed lives up to that expectation. Structurally, this hybrid bed combines poly foam, memory foam, and pocketed coils, and provides targeted support at the hips, waist, and lower back to alleviate pressure, making it ideal for back and stomach sleepers. I noticed it came out of the box slightly misshapen from its packaging and emitted a faint plasticky scent. After about two days, the mattress was ready to go, the smell gone, and it had settled into its intended neat rectangle shape. —Nicole Kinning

Saatva Memory Foam Hybrid for $1,999: The Saatva Memory Foam Hybrid is marketed as firm, and that's exactly what you should expect. Crafted with patented AirCradle memory foam, the mattress features concentrated cushioning in the center, strategically intended to support your lower back. Since I'm only 5'2,"" the middle-back cushioning didn't hit where it intended to. Despite its firmness, I didn't find this mattress particularly exceptional, especially with its cooling properties. Despite incorporating a triple-phase LuxeCool system and cooling gel-infused memory foam, the cooling effect didn't stand out. —Nicole Kinning

Wayfair Sleep 12-Inch Medium Cooling Gel Memory Foam Mattress for $330: This bed has four layers of hypoallergenic gel memory foam infused with green tea, using cooling technology and a breathable design to ensure you're having a super-cool sleep. This medium-plush bed has two top layers of gel-infused memory and comfort foam to help with breathability and cooling, and the top material is a breathable knitted cover to aid in airflow circulation. This mattress had the perfect balance of soft cooling with the memory foam, and the breathable knitted cover also helped with airflow. Most important, though, I always slept coolly on this sleeper hit (pun intended).

Wayfair 10.5-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Mattress for $334: This cooling gel hybrid mattress comprises five layers of various memory foams. The memory foam pillow top aims to relieve pressure points and help reduce motion transfer, and it has a breathable knit cover to aid in the cooling effect. The mattress is compatible with an adjustable base and has a 100-night trial and 10-year warranty. Although it doesn't have as noticeable a cooling effect as some others on this list, it's a true plush mattress that uses cooling gel technology at an affordable price.

Wayfair Sleep 8-Inch Medium Cooling Gel Memory Foam for $204: This super-cheap medium-firm cooling mattress has 8 total inches of memory foam—the top layer of cooling gel, charcoal, and green tea-infused memory foams (to aid in freshness and odor absorption), followed by a soft comfort foam on a durable high-density foam base. The top layer has a breathable, woven jacquard design that helps to keep the sleeper cool and reduces motion transfer. The layers of ultra-cooling gel and green tea-infused memory foams help with the cooling effect and keep any odors at bay. This super-inexpensive mattress delivers well above expectations, but there are better cooling options on our list.

Wayfair Sleep 14-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress for $410: This plush cooling gel mattress features a top plush layer of gel memory foam to relieve pressure and help with airflow, plus the quilted Euro-top knit cover and sides promote continuous airflow around the mattress to keep the sleeper cool. The bed also features classic pocket coils below for structure and support, with layers of memory foams surrounding the coils (this helps with low-motion transfer, too). The mattress is also compatible with an adjustable bed base, has solid edge support, offers a 100-night trial, and has a 10-year warranty. I love a plush mattress, but it may be too plush for someone with a bigger body, since the first super-soft memory foam layer is on top of a coil system.

Wayfair Sleep 13.5-Inch Medium Cooling Gel Memory Foam Mattress for $340: This 13.5-inch cooling gel memory foam mattress is listed as medium, but I'd definitely consider it super-plush. The top layer has 2 inches of gel-infused memory foam and 4.5 inches of comfort foam, and the bottom layer is 7 inches of high-density base support foam. Like other cooling Wayfair mattresses, the top has a breathable jacquard pattern and is green tea-infused to help with freshness and cooling. The top layers of memory foam are designed to mold to your body and help relieve pains and achy joints. This in-a-box bed also has low-motion transfer, a 100-night trial, and a limited 10-year warranty. If you're someone who wants a super-plush bed that helps to wick moisture, then I'd recommend this behemoth.

What Should You Look for in a Cooling Mattress?

When shopping for a cooling mattress, here are a few things to consider:

How Did WIRED Select Models to Be Reviewed?

We have tested over 100 beds across all of our guides, like Best Organic Mattresses, Best Mattresses for Back Pain, and Best Mattresses You Can Buy Online, as well as for individual review. We talk with each other, discussing which mattress brands in general we're fans of, and which we aren't. We also scope out our competitor's reviews and see which they are most excited about, so we can see where our opinion stacks up. We pay for the beds we want to try, but we aren't able to get a sample of. We're always willing to test mattresses from brands who approach us with a model they're excited about, and we give our honest opinion—we aren't paid for glowing reviews on products we think are just mid.

We try to test a wide breadth of mattress types, firmness, and brands to ensure we know what's out on the market, so we can best give you our honest, unbiased opinion on which mattress you should invest your money into (and ⅓ of your life sleeping on).

What Does WIRED Do With Mattresses After Testing?

We keep top picks for longer-term testing in our own homes and the homes of other staffers, friends, and family members, while other models are donated locally.

How Does WIRED Test Cooling Mattresses?

Mattresses are tested for at least a week, but in many cases for longer. I slept on the majority of these mattresses for half a month or more to really get a feel for the product. I tested them at different times of the season and with different types of sheets and bedding. I sat on the edges to test for edge support, jumped, and performed some other methods to test the bounce and motion transfer of the mattress. Perhaps most important for this guide, I was my normal, perpetually warm (and sweaty) self, and gauged more abstract things like my overall comfort at night, and how well I thought air flowed through the mattress, or how much heat was trapped in.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

In 360 BC, Plato envisioned the cosmos as an arrangement of five geometric shapes: flat-sided solids called polyhedra. These immediately became important objects of mathematical study. So it might be surprising that, millennia later, mysteries still surround even the simplest shape in Plato's polyhedral universe: the tetrahedron, which has just four triangular faces.

One major open problem, for instance, asks how densely you can pack “regular” tetrahedra, which have identical faces. Another asks which kinds of tetrahedra can be sliced into pieces that can then be reassembled to form a cube.

The great mathematician John Conway was interested not only in how tetrahedra can be arranged or rearranged, but also in how they balance. In 1966, he and the mathematician Richard Guy asked whether it was possible to construct a tetrahedron made of a uniform material—with its weight evenly distributed—that can only sit on one of its faces. If you were to place such a “monostable” shape on any of its other faces, it would always flip to its stable side.

A few years later, the duo answered their own question, showing that this uniform monostable tetrahedron wasn't possible. But what if you were allowed to distribute its weight unevenly?

At first, it might seem obvious that this should work. “After all, this is how roly-poly toys work: Just put a heavy weight in the bottom,” said Dávid Papp of North Carolina State University. But “this only works with shapes that are smooth or round or both.” When it comes to polyhedra, with their sharp edges and flat faces, it's not clear how to design something that will always flip to the same side.

Gábor Domokos discovers and builds new shapes to understand the world around us.

Conway, for his part, thought that such tetrahedra should exist, as some mathematicians recall him saying. But he ended up focusing on the balancing acts of higher-dimensional, uniformly weighted tetrahedra. If he ever wrote up a proof of his off-the-cuff 3D conjecture, he never published it.

And so for decades, mathematicians didn't really think about the problem. Then along came Gábor Domokos, a mathematician at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics who had long been preoccupied with balancing problems. In 2006, he and one of his colleagues discovered a shape called the gömböc, which has the unusual property of being “mono-monostatic”—it balances on just two points (one stable, the other unstable, like the side of a coin), and no others. Try to balance it anywhere else, and it will roll over to stand on its stable point.

But like a roly-poly, the gömböc is round in places. Domokos wanted to know if a pointy polyhedron could have a similar property. And so Conway's conjecture intrigued him. “How was it possible that there was an utterly simple statement about an utterly simple object, and yet the answer was far from immediate?” he said. “I knew that this was very likely a treasure.”

In 2023, Domokos—along with his graduate students Gergő Almádi and Krisztina Regős, and Robert Dawson of Saint Mary's University in Canada—proved that it is indeed possible to distribute a tetrahedron's weight so that it will sit on just one face. At least in theory.

But Almádi, Dawson, and Domokos wanted to build the thing, a task that turned out to be far more challenging than they expected. Now, in a preprint posted online yesterday, they have presented the first working physical model of the shape. The tetrahedron, which weighs 120 grams and measures 50 centimeters along its longest side, is made of lightweight carbon fiber and dense tungsten carbide. To work, it had to be engineered to a level of precision within one-tenth of a gram and one-tenth of a millimeter. But the final construction always flip-flops onto one face, exactly as it should.

The work demonstrates the important role of experimentation and play in research mathematics. It also has potential practical applications, such as in the design of self-righting spacecraft.

“I didn't expect more work to come out on tetrahedra,” Papp said. And yet, he added, the team's research allows mathematicians to “really appreciate how much we didn't know and how thorough our understanding is now.”

In 2022, Almádi, then an undergraduate aspiring to become an architect, enrolled in Domokos' mechanics course. He didn't say much, but Domokos saw in him a hard worker who was constantly in deep thought. At the end of the semester, Domokos asked him to concoct a simple algorithm to explore how tetrahedra balance.

When Conway originally posed his problem, his only option would have been to use pencil and paper to prove, through abstract mathematical reasoning, that monostable tetrahedra exist. It would have been almost prohibitively difficult to pinpoint a concrete example. But Almádi, working decades later, had computers. He could do a brute-force search through a huge number of possible shapes. Eventually, Almádi's program found the coordinates for the four vertices of a tetrahedron that, when assigned certain weight distributions, could be made monostable. Conway was right.

Krisztina Regős helped discover new properties of tetrahedra.

Robert Dawson helped discover new properties of tetrahedra.

Almádi found one monostable tetrahedron, but presumably there were others. What properties did they share?

While that might seem like a simple question, “a statement like ‘A tetrahedron is monostable' cannot be easily described with a simple formula or a small set of equations,” Papp said.

The team realized that in any monostable tetrahedron, three consecutive edges (where pairs of faces meet) would need to form obtuse angles—ones that measure over 90 degrees. That would ensure that one face would hang over another, allowing it to tip over.

The mathematicians then showed that any tetrahedron with this feature can be made monostable if its center of mass is positioned within one of four “loading zones”—much smaller tetrahedral regions within the original shape. So long as the center of mass falls inside a loading zone, the tetrahedron will balance on only one face.

The gömböc, discovered in 2006, can stand on only two points, one stable, the other unstable. Mathematicians have continued to search for other shapes with intriguing balancing properties.

Achieving the right balance between the weight of the loading zone and the weight of the rest of the tetrahedron is easy in the abstract realm of mathematics—you can define the weight distribution without a care for whether it's physically possible. You might, for instance, let parts of the shape weigh nothing at all, while concentrating a large amount of mass in other parts.

But that wasn't entirely satisfying to the mathematicians. Almádi, Dawson, and Domokos wanted to hold the shape in their hands. Was it possible to make a monostable tetrahedron in the real world, with real materials?

The team returned to their computer search. They considered the various ways in which monostable tetrahedra might tip onto their stable face. For instance, one kind of tetrahedron might follow a very simple path: Face A tips to Face B, which tips to Face C, which tips to Face D. But in a different tetrahedron, Face A might tip to Face B, and both Face B and Face D will tip to Face C.

The loading zones for these different tetrahedra look very different. The team calculated that to get one of these “falling patterns” to work, they would need to construct part of the shape out of a material about 1.5 times as dense as the sun's core.

While studying to be an architect, Gergő Almádi was drawn to a decades-old geometry problem.

They focused on a more feasible falling pattern. Even so, part of their tetrahedron would have to be about 5,000 times as dense as the rest of it. And the materials had to be stiff—light, flimsy materials that could bend would ruin the project, since it's easy to make a round or smooth shape (like the roly-poly) monostable.

In the end, they designed a tetrahedron that was mostly hollow. It consisted of a lightweight carbon fiber frame and one small portion constructed out of tungsten carbide, which is denser than lead. For the lighter portions to have as little weight as possible, even the carbon fiber frames had to be hollow.

With this blueprint in hand, Domokos got in touch with a precision engineering company in Hungary to help build the tetrahedron. They had to be incredibly accurate in their measurements, even when it came to the weight of the tiny amounts of glue used to connect each of the shape's faces. Several frustrating months and several thousand euros later, the team had a lovely model that didn't work at all. Then Domokos and the chief engineer of the model spotted a glob of stray glue clinging to one of its vertices. They asked a technician to remove it. About 20 minutes later, the glue was gone and Almádi received a text from Domokos.

“It works,” the message read. Almádi, who was on a walk, started jumping up and down in the street. “Seeing the lines on the computer is very far from reality,” he said. “That we designed it, and it works, it's kind of fantastic.”

“I wanted to be an architect,” he added. “So this is still very strange for me—how did I end up here?”

In the end, the work on monostable tetrahedra didn't involve any particularly sophisticated math, according to Richard Schwartz of Brown University. But, he said, it's important to ask this kind of question in the first place. It's the kind of problem that's often easiest to overlook. “It's a surprising thing, a leap, to conjecture that these things would exist,” Schwartz said.

At the moment, it's not clear what new theoretical insights the model of the monostable tetrahedron will provide—but experimenting with it might help mathematicians uncover other intriguing questions to ask about polyhedra. In the meantime, Domokos and Almádi are working to apply what they learned from their construction to help engineers design lunar landers that can turn themselves right side up after falling over.

In any case, sometimes you just need to see something to believe it, Schwartz said. “Even for theoretical math, geometry especially, people are kind of right to be skeptical because it's quite hard to reason spatially. And you can make mistakes, people do.”

“Conway didn't say anything about it, he just suggested it—never proved it, never proved it wrong, nothing. And now here we are, I don't know, 60 years later,” Almádi said. “If he were still alive, we could put this on his desk and show him: You were right.”

If you, like practically anyone else with a cell phone in the U.S. and beyond, have received a scam text message about an unpaid toll or undelivered mail item, there's a good chance you have been targeted by a prolific scamming operation.

The scam isn't particularly complex, but it has been highly effective. By sending spam text messages that look like genuine notifications for popular services, from postal deliveries to local government programs, unsuspecting victims click a link that loads a phishing page, they enter their credit card details, and that information is swiped and used for fraud.

During a period of seven months in 2024, the scam netted at least 884,000 stolen credit card details, allowing scammers to cash in on their victims' accounts. Some victims lost thousands of dollars in the scam, researchers say.

But a series of opsec mistakes ultimately led security researchers and investigative journalists to the real-world identity of the maker of the scamming software, Magic Cat, who researchers say goes by the handle Darcula. 

As revealed by the Oslo-headquartered security firm Mnemonic and reported in tandem by Norwegian media earlier this year, behind the fluffy cute cat in Darcula's profile photos is a 24-year-old Chinese national named Yucheng C.

The researchers say Yucheng C. develops Magic Cat for his hundreds of customers, who use the software to launch their own SMS text message scam campaigns at their victims.

Soon after he was unmasked, Darcula went dark and his scam operation has not seen any updates since, leaving his customers in the lurch. But in its wake, a new operation has emerged and is already vastly outpacing its predecessor.

Researchers are now sounding the alarm on the new fraud operation, Magic Mouse, which rose from the ashes of Magic Cat. 

Ahead of sharing new findings at the Def Con security conference in Las Vegas on Friday, Harrison Sand, an offensive security consultant at Mnemonic, told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse has been surging in popularity since the demise of Darcula's Magic Cat. 

Sand also warned of the operation's growing ability to steal people's credit cards on a massive scale.

During their investigation, Mnemonic found photos from inside the operation posted in a Telegram channel that Darcula administered, showing a line-up of credit card payment terminals and videos showing racks with dozens of phones used for automating the sending of messages to victims. 

The scammers use the card details in mobile wallets on phones and conduct payment fraud, laundering their funds into other bank accounts. Some of the phones had mobile wallets overflowing with other people's stolen cards, ready to be used for mobile transactions. 

Sand told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse is already responsible for the theft of at least 650,000 credit cards a month.

While evidence suggests Magic Mouse is an entirely new operation, coded by new developers and likely unrelated to Darcula, much of Magic Mouse's success stems from the new operators stealing the phishing kits that made its predecessor's software so popular. Sand said these kits contain hundreds of phishing sites that Magic Cat used to mimic the legitimate web pages of major tech giants, popular consumer services, and delivery firms, all designed to trick victims into handing over their credit card details.

But despite the prolific nature of Magic Cat and, now, Magic Mouse, and their ability to net millions of dollars in stolen funds from consumers, Sand told TechCrunch in a call that law enforcement is not looking beyond a few scattered reports of fraud or at the wider operation behind the scheme. 

Instead, Sand said, it is the tech companies and financial giants who shoulder much of the responsibility for allowing these scams to exist and thrive, and for not making it more difficult for scammers to use stolen cards. 

As for anyone who receives a suspicious text, ignoring an unwanted message might be the best policy.

I'm definitely an outlier on this given the direction all syntactically C-like new languages have taken, but I have the opposite preference. I find that the most common reason I go back to check a variable declaration is to determine the type of the variable, and the harder it is to visually find that, the more annoyed I'm going to be. In particular, with statically typed languages, my mental model tends to be ""this is an int"" rather than ""this is a variable that happens to have the type 'int'"".In Rust, in particular, this leads to some awkward syntactic verbosity, because mutable variables are declared with `let mut`, meaning that `let` is used in every declaration. In C or C++ the type would take the place of that unnecessary `let`. And even C (as of C23) will do type inference with the `auto` keyword. My tendency is to use optional type inference in places where needing to know the type isn't important to understand the code, and to specify the type when it would serve as helpful commentary when reading it back.

In my opinion the `let` is not so unnecessary. It clearly marks a statement that declares a variable, as opposed to other kind of statements, for example a function call.This is also why C++ need the ""most vexing parse"" ambiguity resolution.

From a parser perspective, it's easier to go name first so you can add it to the AST and pass it off to the type determiner to finish the declaration. So I get it. In typescript I believe it's this way so parsers can just drop types all together to make it compatible with JavaScript (it's still trivial to strip typing, though why would you?) without transpiling.In go, well, you have even more crazier conventions. Uppercase vs lowercase public vs private, no inheritance, a gc that shuns away performance minded devs.In the end, I just want a working std library that's easy to use so I can build applications. I don't care for:    type Add<A extends number, B extends number> = [
      …Array<A>,
      …Array<B>,
    ][“length”]

This is the kind of abuse of the type system that drives me bonkers. You don't have to be clever, just export a function. I don't need a type to represent every state, I need intent.

Hover the mouse cursor over it. Any reasonable editor will show the type.> In Rust, in particular, this leads to some awkward syntactic verbosity, because mutable variables are declared with `let mut`, meaning that `let` is used in every declaration.Rust is very verbose for strange implementation reasons... namely to avoid parse ambiguities.> In C or C++ the type would take the place of that unnecessary `let`.OTOH, that means you can't reliably grep for declarations of a variable/function called ""foo"". Also consider why some people like using    auto foo(int blah) -> bool

style. This was introduced because of template nonsense (how to declare a return type before the type parameters were known), but it makes a lot of sense and makes code more greppable. Generic type parameters make putting the return type at the front very weird -- reading order wise.Anyhoo...

    const p = Point{ .x = 123, .y = 234 };

...or this:    const p: Point = .{ .x = 123, .y = 234 };

When calling a function which expects a Point you can omit the verbose type:    takePoint(.{ .x = 123, .y = 234 });

In Rust I need to explicitly write the type:    takePoint(Point{ x: 123, y: 234);

...and in nested struct initializations the inferred form is very handy, e.g. Rust requires you to write this (not sure if I got the syntax right):    const x = Rect{
        top_left: Point{ x: 123, y: 234 },
        bottom_right: Point{ x: 456, y: 456 },
    };

...but the compiler already knows that Rect consists of two nested Points, so what's the point of requiring the user to type that out? So in Zig it's just:    const x = Rect{
        .top_left = .{ .x = 123, .y = 234 },
        .bottom_right = .{ .x = 456, .y = 456 },
    };

Requiring the explicit type on everything can get noisy really fast in Rust.Of course the question is whether the leading dot in '.{' could be omitted, and personally I would be in favour of that. Apparently it simplifies the parser, but such implementation details should get in the way of convenience IMHO.And then there's `.x = 123` vs `x: 123`. The Zig form is copied from C99, the Rust form from Javascript. Since I write both a lot of C99 and Typescript I don't either form (and both Zig and Rust are not even close to the flexibility and convenience of the C99 designated initialization syntax unfortunately).Edit: fixed the Rust struct init syntax.

IMHO Odin got it exactly right. For a variable with explicit type:   a_variable : type = val;

...or for inferred type:   a_variable := val;

...and the same for constants:   a_const : type : val;
   a_const :: val;

...but I think that doesn't fit into Zig's parser design philosophy (e.g. requiring some sort of keyword upfront so that the parser knows the context it's in right from the start instead of delaying that decision to a later time).

If it isn't obvious, the problem is that you can't indent them properly because the indentation becomes part of the string itself.Some languages have magical ""removed the indent"" modes for strings (e.g. YAML) but they generally suck and just add confusion. This syntax is quite clear (at least with respect to indentation; not sure about the trailing newline - where does the string end exactly?).

This surprises me (as a C++ guy). I use lambdas everywhere. What's the standard way of say defining a comparator when sorting an array in Zig?

reply

There's a little more syntax than a dedicated language feature, but not a lot more.What's ""missing"" in zig that lambda implementations normally have is capturing. In zig that's typically accomplished with a context parameter, again typically a struct.

I'm not sure if I'm parsing this right, but is the implication that ""const"" is not monosyllabic? It certainly is for me. How else do people say it? I get ""fn"" because people might say ""eff enn"" but I don't see what the equivalent for const would be.

For those of you that may be curious, or not know C++, in C++ this:    Obj x();

is a declaration of a function called x that returns an Obj. Whereas this:    Obj x;

defines (possibly, depending on context) an instance of the type Obj called x.Most people get over this pretty quickly.If that is your main complaint about a language then the language doesn't have too many problems. Not that I'm suggesting that C++ doesn't have more serious problems.

1. Integer literals. ""var a = 1"" doesn't work, seems absurd. In Kotlin literals do have strong types, but coercion is allowed when defining variables so ""var a = 1"" works, and ""var a: Long = 1"" works even though you can write a literal long as 1L. This means you can write numbers to function parameters naturally.2. Multi-line string literals. OK this is a neat idea, but what about copy/paste? In Kotlin you can just write """" .. """".trimIndent() and then copy paste some arbitrary text into the string, the indent will be removed for you. The IDE will also help with this by adding | characters which looks more natural than \\ and can be removed using .trimMargin(), only downside is the trimming is done at runtime but that could easily be fixed without changing the language.3. Record literals. This syntax is called lovely because it's designed for grep, a properly funded language like Kotlin just uses named kwargs to constructors which is more natural. There's no need to design the syntax for grep because Kotlin is intended to be used with a good IDE that can answer this query instantly and precisely.4. Function syntax. ""fn foo(a: i32) i32 {}"" seems weird. If the thing that has a type and the type are normally separated by a : then why not here? Kotlin does ""fun foo(a: Int): Int {}"" which is more consistent.5. Locals. Agree with author that Kotlin nails it.6. Not using && or ||, ok this one Zig wins, the Zig way is more consistent and reads better. Kotlin does have `and` and `or` as infix operator functions, but they are for the bitwise operations :(7. Explicit returns. Kotlin supports blocks that return values and also doesn't need semicolons, so not quite sure what the tradeoff here is supposed to be about.8. Loops being expressions is kinda cool but the Kotlin equivalent of his example is much easier to read still: ""val thing = collection.first { it.foo > bar }"". It compiles to a for loop due to the function inlining.9. Generics. Zig's way seems primitive and unnecessarily complex. In Kotlin it is common to let the compiler infer generics based on all available information, so you can just write ""someMethod(emptyList())"" and emptyList<T>() infers to the correct type based on what someMethod expects.Overall Zig looks like a lot of modern languages, where they are started as a hobby or side project of some guy and so the language is designed around whatever makes implementing the compiler most convenient. Kotlin is unusual because it doesn't do that. It was well funded from the start, so the syntax is designed first and foremost to be as English-like and convenient as possible without leaving the basic realm of ordinary curly-brace functions-and-oop style languages. It manages to be highly expressive and convenient without the syntax feeling overly complex or hard to learn.

And no pointless semicolons.

I've heard the argument that people might confuse binary operators for prefix/postfix operators, but I don't buy it. Who would think an operator named `orelse` is anything but binary?

I came to Cleveland, Ohio, for the 50th anniversary of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention. I expected the hallways to be buzzing with conversations about AI, and they were, but not in the way I'd hoped. For the first two days, the phrase I heard most from my fellow journalists was “we must protect ourselves.” In session after session, the consensus was that AI is a danger, a threat, an enemy coming to replace us.

Then I had breakfast at Betts, the restaurant in my hotel, and a single conversation with my waiter gave me another perspective on the AI revolution.

As he brought me the bill, I asked Kevin Knestrick, 49, if he used AI. Haunted by the fearful rhetoric from the convention, I expected him to either rebuff me or launch into an anti-AI tirade.

“Not really,” he replied cautiously, then paused. “Actually,” he continued, “I used it for the first time when we changed the menu. I took a picture and uploaded it to ChatGPT and asked it to copy the text and prepare a message for a colleague. It saved me so much time.”

As he relaxed, he called over a younger colleague, Jamie Sargent, 31, and he introduced me a bit later to another younger colleague of his, Dawud Hamzah, 37. “You should talk to these guys,” he said. “They use it a lot more.”

He was right. It quickly became clear that for Hamzah and Sargent, ChatGPT is a part of their daily lives. They don't see it as a threat.

For Hamzah, a bartender at Betts and a youth motivational speaker who founded his own empowerment association, H.Y.P.E. (Helping You Produce Excellence), ChatGPT has effectively replaced Google.

“I use it to build solid, well-structured PowerPoint presentations for my speaking engagements with students,” he told me. But its use extends far beyond his professional life. It's his trip planner, health advisor, and personal coach.

“I just used it for my lady's birthday,” he said. “I said, ‘I want something relaxing that has vegan friendly foods.' It gave me a whole itinerary, a phenomenal itinerary.” When back problems flared up, he turned to the chatbot for help. “I asked it to give me specific home workouts and mobility exercises to relieve pressure from a degenerating disc in my back. And it did.”

Did it work? “Oh yeah!” he responded.

Sargent, a former special education teacher, has been using ChatGPT since it launched in late 2022. He used it to generate baseline lesson plans, saving him hours of work which he could then devote to tailoring the content to each of his students' individual needs.

“I saved about an hour's worth of time writing a lesson plan,” he said. I asked him if it felt like cheating. “No, because I would have done the same thing it did. It just did it faster than I can.” He dismisses the idea that teachers shouldn't use it. “I'd say, that's nonsense. We spend so many hours outside of the classroom working on our own stuff. If we can make it faster, the better.”

Like Hamzah, Sargent is also an avid travel planner, using ChatGPT to map out complex international vacations. “My brother and I planned a trip to Italy from Milan to Florence to Naples, and it basically showed us the map of taking a train from here to here, gave us good restaurants to go to, and then it told us how much it was going to cost.”

Both men hold a pragmatic view of AI's future. They believe jobs will be lost, but that it's on individuals to adapt. “If you don't learn, develop, and adjust, you'll fail, because it's not going to stop,” Hamzah insisted. Sargent agreed, adding that the key is to focus on what makes you human. “I'm part of the experience, whereas AI is not part of that experience. Find a way to differentiate yourself from AI and make yourself valuable.”

Kevin, who first introduced me to the group, represents a different demographic's journey into AI. His use was born of pure necessity. “I was in a time crunch to get this menu to the printer,” he recalled. The AI solved his problem in seconds.

That single, surprisingly effective interaction transformed him from a non-user into a curious convert. “Now I'm much more open to any problem I have. I'm just going to ask it now,” he told me.

His regret over missing out on the Bitcoin boom has also made him wonder if AI could be a tool to help “the little guy” get an edge in investing. “I guess I'm from the generation where all the Wall Street fat cats make money, while us little people just get crushed,” he said. “How do we not be the little guy anymore?”

Their manager, Curtis Helser, 56, was also introduced to ChatGPT by his wife about a year ago. He uses it to refine important work emails, making them shorter and more professional. He isn't afraid of it, seeing it as a tool that can be used for good or ill, just like a car. And he's not worried about his job. “You have to be in the building,” he said with a laugh. “Kissing babies, shaking hands, that kind of stuff.”

I was stunned. At the restaurant, AI wasn't a terrifying enemy; it was a useful, if imperfect, assistant. The younger employees had fully embraced it, while the older generation was more cautious but still open, integrating it into their lives at their own pace. They see the current panic as a movie they've seen before, recalling the fears that accompanied the rise of the personal computer.

The contrast with my colleagues at the journalism convention was stark. Perhaps those of us whose jobs are built on creating and controlling information see AI as an existential threat, while those in the service of people see it as just another tool to get the job done. The real AI revolution, I realized, wasn't happening in the headlines or the panicked convention halls. It was happening quietly, in conversations like this, one practical problem at a time.

I'm sitting in a coffee shop in front of four monitors. One of those screens is just my laptop, a very normal thing to have a cuppa joe next to. The other three are the portable displays of the Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max, a monumental contraption of aluminum and matte glass that's looming over my computer, giving off Mr. Universe vibes. Nobody seems to care about this very conspicuous tech monstrosity, and that's a blessing because with all of these screens in front of me, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm the Worst Person Here.

“Portable” triple-monitor accessories that give your laptop more pixels to work on spreadsheets or whatever multitasking you may require to boost your productivity aren't new. In recent years, cheap display command centers have been flooding social media as a life hack product. I thought it would be fun to take the Triple Aero out into the wild, both to test its tote-ability and to see how socially capable I am of using it in public. I don't know why I do these things to myself.

Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max

The Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max is a cool idea to add three screens to a laptop, but it's hampered by bad displays and a too-high price.

Pros

Cons

This setup has appeal, especially if, like me, you find the cramped confines of a laptop display unworkable, but sitting in the same room for hours and hours, every day, with your dedicated multi-monitor setup feels a little like hell to you. My usual solution for working away from home is to use my 11-inch iPad Pro as a wireless external display. It's not ideal, and I always wonder if I can have it both ways.

The Triple Aero features three 15.6-inch, 1080p IPS LCD displays on a folding, height-adjustable stand that put it high enough for me to work with proper computer posture instead of hunched over like a laptop gremlin. The displays are just bright enough that I didn't have trouble viewing them in a window-filled coffee shop, but you might have trouble seeing if, on a very bright day, one of those windows is behind the Triple Aero. The display casings and stand are black and made of aluminum. There are technically speakers, but they're harsh and tinny, and you should not use them.

On the bottom edge of the middle display, you'll find two USB-C ports: one to power the screens and the other to accept video from your laptop, as well as give it passthrough power. There are also three Micro HDMI ports, each corresponding to one of the displays, useful if you want to connect multiple devices rather than just a single computer. The Triple Aero comes with a 65W power adapter that generously features two USB-C ports and a single USB-A port.

This isn't a pretty device, but that's not really the point, is it? To buy something like the Triple Aero is to admit that all you're after is a hojillion displays. Given its utilitarian vibe, it's irritating to me that, presumably for misguided aesthetic reasons, Aura put its port labels on the back of the Triple Aero instead of the front. I don't care about that in a stationary desk monitor that I'm only ever going to hook up once, but the Triple Aero is meant to travel, and it's too unwieldy to spin around to make sure I'm plugging things into the proper ports, so you have to lean around back to see which one is which. Aura also doesn't label the buttons, leaving you to figure out how to adjust the monitor's internal settings. I guess I could label everything myself with a strip of tape and a Sharpie, or Aura could just put the labels on the front!

Actually using the Triple Aero is a mixed bag, and I don't just mean because it feels weird to set it up in public if that's what you choose to do with it. On one hand, the matte finish IPS displays keep a fairly consistent image, even from broad viewing angles. But on the other, they're better for spreadsheets and text documents than they are for, say, Oppenheimer. And they're not even great for that if the software you're working with calls for a monitor with very good color separation—for instance, in macOS, I had a hard time telling between the gray of an active Safari window and the slightly lighter gray of an inactive one. As a result, I just kept trying to type in windows I thought were in the foreground and weren't.

It's not just the color reproduction that makes the Triple Aero unsuitable for more than casual content consumption. Driving the displays requires software—in this case, SiliconMotion's InstantView—that essentially screen-records virtual displays on your computer, compresses the video for transmission over USB-C, then hardware-decodes it inside the Triple Aero. This is fine for basic tasks, but it takes a decent chunk of CPU power to run, and I've never met a version of it that doesn't needle you with small bugs. It can take a few tries plugging it in before your computer recognizes it; you may have to rearrange the displays every few tries so your Mac actually knows which is which; the display can lag, with your mouse disappearing and reappearing at random. That last one is especially common if you try to watch a high-bitrate movie or play a video game. (Death Stranding was unplayable when I tried.)

Maybe that's all fine if you're only using the Triple Aero occasionally, but it immediately reminded me why I gave up using similar tech to add dual display support to my old M1 iMac after just a few weeks. You won't get these problems if you only use the Triple Aero's three Micro HDMI ports, but you'd need a computer that supports that many external displays, which many Apple silicon-equipped Macs do not, along with a Thunderbolt dock that sports three HDMI outputs—and again, many do not.

The Triple Aero, with its elaborate form factor, has its perks. I like the foldable side displays, and my neck was grateful for its height. And since you can use the HDMI ports individually, you and two others can each have an external display. Also, I bet having the displays folded back into a triangle would also be a very fun way to game with friends, old-timey LAN party-style. I didn't get to try that, but I feel it in my bones—show me a few people, a Triple Aero, and three Nintendo Switches (or Switch 2s) equipped with some flavor of Mario Kart, and I'll show you a good time.

Also in the plus column, the Triple Aero isn't overly jiggly even with two displays hanging way off its stand. The contraption folds down to about the size of a large gaming laptop, with the stand pulling double duty as a suitcase-style handle. That said, you'll need to get creative to transport the 7-pound unit, as it's got the wrong proportions for a laptop case and the box it ships in is too big to casually toss into a backpack. Aura does sell a felt sleeve and a zippable soft case that each accommodate the Triple Aero, but without a hard case I would still worry about pointed impacts to one of the displays, which faces outwardly when folded for travel.

At $699, the Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max falls squarely in the category of things I think would be very handy to have, but would never buy for myself. I just can't see paying as much or more than a decent 4K portable monitor like the Espresso Pro, which is priced the same but is far more premium-feeling, judging by reviews praising its image quality and neat iPad-like modularity.

Sure, you lose overall screen real estate with the Espresso, but it sounds like a much more pleasant experience, and you don't have to screw around with drivers that force external display support that your laptop's hardware potentially doesn't do natively. And it probably feels a lot less awkward to use in public.

The live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's One Piece wasn't just good, it was good in a way that took everyone by surprise. With the numbers to show for it, it's no wonder Netflix gave it a second season, which is dropping next year.

After a wave of casting announcements, Netflix finally pulled back the curtain on the upcoming season during Tokyo's One Piece Day celebration. All the Straw Hats—Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji, all new threads from the manga—are present and accounted for, but the big selling point of the trailer is the fresh faces they'll meet, like bounty hunter Smoker (Callum Kerr) and Baroque Works agents Mss. Wednesday (Charithra Chandran) and All Sunday (Lera Abova). Like last time, this season will adapt several manga arcs, including “Loguetown” and “Drum Island,” which introduce future allies, enemies, and crew members, including doctor Tony Tony Chopper (Mikaela Hoover). 

During the presentation, Netflix also revealed One Piece is getting a third season, with production starting in Cape Town later in 2025. The show also has a new co-showrunner for the future season in Ian Stokes, taking over for Matt Owens after his exit from the series earlier this year. Hopefully it won't be too long a wait after season two, which hits Netflix sometime in 2026.

Meta has been on a pretty serious campaign to prove it's at the cutting edge of consumer tech, and AI isn't the only target on the board. AR/XR has also clearly been a priority if the last few weeks are any indication (see this paper in Nature about its wristband tech and drips on groundbreaking VR research for proof), and its vision on that front is starting to actually take shape.

According to Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, the company's annual Connect conference in September, where it showcases the latest VR and XR hardware, is going to be a major one. As noted by UploadVR, Bosworth mentioned in a recent Instagram Q&A that “big wearable announcements” are incoming, which could mean a lot of things. In the past, that's meant a new Quest that's better or cheaper than the last generation, but this year all signs point to new smart glasses.

See Meta Ray-Ban at Amazon

There are a lot of directions a potential Meta smart glasses announcement could take (new third-gen Ray-Ban AI glasses, for example), but there's only one thing I really want to know about what Meta plans to offer, and it's actually pretty simple: will its glasses have a display or not?

If I had to guess, that's likely the biggest question on most people's minds, at least anyone who's at all interested in smart glasses as a category. In my experience, it's been the one thing people want to know about Meta's existing Ray-Ban smart glasses when they find out I'm wearing them. And most of those people who ask, “Does it have a screen?” are pretty disappointed by my answer. As surprisingly useful as I've found Ray-Bans to be, they still don't make the idea of smart glasses feel truly smart, and “smart-ish” glasses probably isn't the vibe that Meta is going for.

The good news is, for anyone who's hopeful (or expectant) for a pair of Meta-made smart glasses with a screen, it looks like those prayers may be answered. Rumors of a pair of glasses codenamed “Celeste” have been funneling in, and it looks like those smart glasses might have a HUD (heads-up display) on them. What that HUD will do is just as speculative as the Celeste glasses themselves, but rumors suggest that it will be able to show relatively simple information like weather and notifications. There are also some rumors that those next-gen smart glasses will include Meta's body-reading wristband that allows for hand and finger gestures, but I'm a little skeptical of that side of things given the fact it still seems to be showcasing that accessory as more of an experiment with non-production glasses like Orion.

One thing you can count on is that if there is some kind of screen involved, they'll likely reach a new, significantly higher price to go along with it. Rumors suggest that Celeste may end up in the $1,000 range when it's finally available, and that's not the only thing that may balloon either. If Celeste has the capabilities we think it will, it'll definitely be a much chunkier gadget than Meta's Ray-Bans, which are only slightly larger than a regular pair of sunglasses. Either way, in my book, Meta only has one metric for success when Connect rolls around next month, and that's finally giving us smart glasses with a screen.

Intel's presence in the Linux community as a driver developer and maintainer is impacted by layoffs.

Intel is continuing to lay off more Linux maintainers due to corporate restructuring within the company. Phoronix reports that at least four more Intel Linux maintainers have left the company, leaving some of the Linux drivers they worked on without support.

Mustafa Ismail, maintainer of the Intel Ethernet RDMA driver, has left the company, leaving only one other Intel engineer to keep supporting the driver. Intel's Tianfei Zhang, the maintainer for Intel's PTP DFL ToD driver, is also no longer at Intel, leaving the driver without any support. Intel's PTP DFL ToD driver runs the time-of-day device on its FPGA cards.

Intel's WWAN ISOM driver is yet another driver that is now left with zero support, as Intel Linux maintainer M. Chetan Kumar is no longer working at the company. The WWAN ISOM driver is one of Intel's drivers responsible for driving its older M.2 modems.

Keem Bay and Anil S Keshavamurthy have also left Intel. Bay was a DRM driver maintainer, while Keshavamurthy was a maintainer of Intel's kernel probes code, which aids in debugging and performance profiling. Finally, two engineers who worked on the T7XX 5G WWAN driver were also let go, leaving the aforementioned driver without support.

According to other reports by Phoronix, Intel has been losing Linux driver developers/maintainers at an accelerated rate since February of this year. Layoffs have continued to surge since then, with Intel's latest round of layoffs resulting in over 12,000 personnel being cut from the company.

Intel is quickly losing traction in the Linux space due to layoffs of its Linux maintainers. Intel used to maintain a significant presence in Linux kernel development, thanks to its long-standing dominance in the CPU space, and contributed to the development of drivers for various hardware systems, including CPUs, GPUs, storage, and networking. 

If Intel fails to provide replacement Linux maintainers, it will lack the personnel needed for key software and driver support. In that case, we might see an uptrend in hardware reliability and compatibility issues, affecting both enterprise and mainstream users, due to outdated drivers. However, if this happens, the best we can hope for is that the Linux community rises to the challenge to resolve issues without insider help, by developing third-party drivers when needed. The Linux community is renowned for this kind of action, but losing the efficiency and insight from first-party support isn't ideal.

And what really happened to the ‘10 years of deleted data' becomes clear.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A software engineer and developer, who previously accused Amazon Web Services (AWS) of a “digital execution,” has shared the good news that his data has now been restored. What made this impossible task possible was “one human being inside AWS [who] decided to give a damn,” according to data deficit disaster victim Abdelkader Boudih. The same insider source shared some interesting but worrisome insights about what went on behind the scenes during the days when robotic AWS reps insisted Boudih's precious 10 years of data had been “terminated.”

In the earlier episode, we heard about an unnamed insider at AWS reaching out to Boudih. That character was never verified, though they apparently knew too much about this particular case to be a common prankster. Around the same time as we reported on the original debacle, an AWS employee had reached out via official channels to give hope that there would be some way to recover the precious data.

Tarus Balog was basically the first ‘human' level contact from AWS, according to Boudih. Previous AWS-sourced responses were, in comparison, of a very scripted nature. However, Balog showed empathy and seemed to speak as someone with authority, telling the already long-suffering software engineer that leaders at AWS were aware of his data deletion blog, and were looking to make sure such cases were prevented, going forward.

Balog initially refrained from promising to recover the lost data, but cogs were definitely whirring at AWS at this point (August 5). The case was escalated to the top-level severity ticket available to ‘mortals', and apparently the AWS CEO actually became aware of this particular incident at this time.

The next morning (August 6), Boudih woke to the news – officially from Amazon – that his account had been restored. Though this was extremely welcome news, it was tainted with “AWS support's incompetence - or deception,” according to the blog update.

What stuck in Boudih's craw was the prior insistence of AWS staffers that all his data had been terminated. “The instances were stopped. Not terminated. Stopped.” Stressed the engineer, obviously angry about what he called “gaslighting” by previous AWS contacts. Moreover, his RDS instanced had been backed up as recently as July 19 – several days after support had insisted that everything was “terminated.”

Nevertheless, Boudih refrained from insisting AWS reps were outright lying. There was also the possibility that there was an “undocumented ability to restore ‘terminated' instances - which would make sense as a safeguard against internal sabotage or mistakes.” There is also the excuse of AWS employee incompetence to consider, but Boudih seems to favor the theory that that prior support contacts “gaslit me about infrastructure.”

According to Reddit threads that spawned in the wake of Boudih's dizzying initial post, this alarming case was far from unique. The shared payer model has inherent flaws, other social media users appeared to confirm, especially if one party defaults on payments due. This appears to be what caused the software engineer's AWS account and data to be suspended, then terminated.

Account suspension is ""part of AWS's standard security protocols for accounts that fail the required verification,"" AWS stated in an email to Tom's Hardware. But it didn't explain the apparent subsequent and rapid termination.

In the previous story, Boudih mused whether an account suspension could be escalated to termination, due to some billing issue with a previous shared payment party. That looks quite likely in retrospect.

Boudih ends his update by summing up the lessons learned from his painful episode, and by offering some advice to AWS.

Firstly, the software engineer is now going to indulge in “Double and triple backups. Distributed across providers. Encrypted with keys I control.” That sounds sensible, and addresses a fair section of the Tom's Hardware comments section regarding the initial data loss story.

As for AWS, Boudih doesn't want it destroyed but ‘Terraforming.' He explains this idea as using simple preventions to mitigate against overreactions to issues affecting customers. Specifically, he suggests that AWS improve its architecture, communication, and support systems to prevent issues that “punish legitimate users.”

Pull request got rejected for Linux 6.17. And as a late submission, it already lit Torvald's fuse.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Linus Torvalds, the creator and lead developer of Linux, has publicly dismissed a RISC-V code contribution from a Google engineer as “garbage.” The code was sent as a pull request for inclusion in the Linux 6.17 kernel on Friday, but has been roundly rejected by Torvalds for both its poor quality and for being late. Those are two cardinal sins in pull requests, and misdemeanors that have clearly ignited the Linux creator's infamously short fuse.

In response to the RISC-V Patches for the 6.17 Merge Window, Part 1, from Google's Android team member Palmer Dabbelt, Torvalds didn't pull any punches. “No. This is garbage and it came in too late. I asked for early pull requests because I'm traveling, and if you can't follow that rule, at least make the pull requests *good*,” insisted Torvalds. “This adds various garbage that isn't RISC-V specific to generic header files. And by ""garbage"" I really mean it. This is stuff that nobody should ever send me, never mind late in a merge window,” he brusquely elaborated.

The comment from Torvalds wasn't just bile. He went on to give some examples of where the RISC-V pull request went astray. But even in this mostly reasoned response, Torvalds couldn't resist adding a few more barbs.

When highlighting the undesirable additions in the newly submitted RISC-V feature code, the Linux firebrand said the code “makes the world actively a worse place to live.” He added that “Things like this need to get bent,” and put the developer on a warning for both code quality and being late. “You're on notice: no more late pull requests, and no more garbage outside the RISC-V tree.”

Rounding off his unvarnished public broadcast to the Google engineer, Torvalds strongly recommended that they try and get in early for Linux kernel 6.18. Moreover, code “without the garbage” would be preferred, in case that wasn't quite clear.

Social media responses to the latest Torvalds tantrum have been mixed. It can be true that being unfiltered and direct is an efficient way to communicate. Especially when backed up with reasoning and constructive comments. Also, you could say that Torvalds didn't attack anyone involved, personally.

On the other hand, charm can also be a winning strategy. As per the well-known Italian proverb — Il mele catta più mosche, che non fà l'aceto — “Honey catches more flies than vinegar.” But that might be somewhat less fun in terms of tech headlines, and we would probably never again get the chance to put ‘random turd files' in a headline if Mr Torvalds decided to turn a new leaf.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","China state media says Nvidia H20 GPUs are unsafe and outdated, urges Chinese companies to avoid them — says chip is ‘neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe'","https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-state-media-says-nvidia-h20-gpus-are-unsafe-and-outdated-urges-chinese-companies-to-avoid-them-says-chip-is-neither-environmentally-friendly-nor-advanced-nor-safe","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 14:08:35 GMT","

State media wants Chinese companies to avoid Nvidia chips.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A social media account linked to Chinese state media wrote an article on WeChat asserting that Nvidia's H20 chips are neither technologically advanced nor environmentally friendly. According to Reuters, the account, Yuyuan Tantian, is connected to China Central Television, which is a key organization in the country's state media (propaganda) apparatus.

“When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it,” Yuyuan Tantian said in the article (a translation, we assume).

The H20 chip is Nvidia's answer to Washington's ban on high-end AI GPU exports to China. Although its performance is only a fraction of what the top-of-the-line H200 can accomplish, it still sold surprisingly well, resulting in Nvidia posting a record revenue despite temporarily falling under export control between April and July 2025.

Aside from its reduced horsepower, Chinese authorities are also concerned with possible hidden geo-tracking and backdoors in the Green Team silicon. The U.S. Congress introduced a bill to enforce location tracking of high-end gaming and AI GPUs in mid-May, with the White House mulling doing the same earlier this month.

Because of this, China has raised concerns about the security of the H20 chips that Nvidia sells in the country, even going as far as summoning the AI chip giant to explain if it had any backdoor security risks. This isn't the only criticism of Nvidia in Chinese media in recent times. People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that Nvidia should convince the Chinese people that its chips do not have security risks. However, the company has firmly denied any such risk, emphasizing that its GPUs have no kill switches, no backdoors, and no spyware.

Although the headlining statement is not from a government source, China often uses state-linked social media accounts to shape its agenda and signal changes in its official stance without making a direct commitment. So, the criticism may be part of a broader campaign to steer domestic firms away from foreign AI hardware and toward homegrown alternatives like Huawei's Ascend chips.

Despite all these issues, many Chinese organizations and entities still purchase Nvidia products. Aside from the massive demand for H20 AI GPUs, there's also a burgeoning black market for banned AI chips. It's been estimated that a billion dollars' worth of these GPUs have been sold in the past quarter, with some companies already advertising the upcoming B300, which is expected to arrive later this year.

The WeChat post is likely the central government signaling its people to slowly move away from Nvidia's products and use alternative homegrown AI GPUs instead. However, the ecosystem that the company delivers makes its local competitors a much less compelling alternative.

Matt Turner is back in MLS, and back with the clean sheets. 

After a tumultuous few seasons in Europe, and a recent transfer saga between Premier League side Nottingham Forest, Ligue 1 club Lyon and the New England Revolution, the U.S. men's national team goalkeeper began to find some stability on Saturday night at Gillette Stadium.

While Turner had struggled to find playing time during spells at Arsenal, Forest and Crystal Palace since leaving the Revolution in 2021, it was like no time had passed, as he started in a 2–0 win against D.C. United. 

“It was pretty emotional walking out for me,” Turner said after the match. “Just being back in the stadium, feeling the love from the warmup, to before the game, to everything, I love it here. I love New England, it's really like home for me.”

Neither New England nor D.C. are likely playoff teams this season, sitting 11th and 15th in the Eastern Conference after the match, but it was still a homecoming of sorts for Turner, and some much needed stability. 

The 2021 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year made three stops, as the Revolution snapped a nine-game winless run. It also ensured an upbeat occasion for the alumni in the building, which included club greats such as Alexis Lalas, Taylor Twellman, Gustavo Bou and many others. 

Meanwhile, the stops also allowed Carles Gil to have his record-breaking moment come in a victory, as his ninth goal of the season pushed him past the attending Twellman for most goal contributions in club history with 130.

“For me, it was more than just showing up, but also understanding that there's something to achieve, something to do. So, I want to put in good performances,” Turner added. “I was really happy to be here for Carles. He's such an unassuming, quiet guy, but he is a leader. He's a leader in the way that he cares, and in the way that he always contributes with goals and assists.”

“He's just such an amazing player and such an amazing talent. I think there's no one more deserving to have that record for this club right now.”

As much as the Revolution needed a jolt to their play this season under head coach Caleb Porter, Turner also needed the regular minutes to earn back his starting role with the USMNT ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

While 2025 began with Turner as the outright starter, a lack of playing time in Europe, and dismal performances at the Concacaf Nations League in March saw him surrender the role to New York City FC's Matt Freese at the summer's Concacaf Gold Cup.

Although the move to MLS may have been seen as a downgrade, it's allowing him to play regular minutes and also return to a club and environment where he knows he can thrive. 

At the same time, a little bit of form could re-ignite the USMNT goalkeeper battle with Turner and Freese jockeying for the role alongside Chicago Fire FC's Chris Brady, and Zack Steffen of the Colorado Rapids, among others. 

“You could see in the first couple of crosses, he comes to the edge of the box and plucks it. He makes a couple of key saves, a big one in the first half...his presence, his distribution, really helped us,” Porter said of Turner, even as the Revolution sit eight points out of a playoff spot with nine matches remaining. 

“This is a good three points... It feels good, but we've gotta do it again next week. We've gotta find a way against a really talented team with really talented players, but I think our group can do it.”

Club World Cup champions continue their short run-up to the Premier League season with a visit from AC Milan to Stamford Bridge on Sunday for a preseason friendly.

Chelsea have Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan in a three-day span as Enzo Maresca has everyone back from the break earned following last month's 3-0 upset of Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup Final.

The Blues have a bunch of new faces for this season, a figure that's even higher if you count players they added prior to or during the Club World Cup. Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato, and Estevao Willian are in the fold, and the Blues continue to be linked with further additions. That list may grow as Levi Colwill has now suffered a long-term injury.

This match is AC Milan's last friendly prior to the Coppa Italia first round against Bari at the San Siro on August 18. Max Allegri's men are 3-0 this preseason, beating Arsenal on penalties before taking care of Liverpool and Perth Glory over 90 minutes.

Ex-Chelsea men Christian Pulisic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and Fikayo Tomori give Milan plenty of familiarity with the venue.

For live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs AC Milan, check out PST's live blog coverage below.

Kick off time: 10am ET Sunday (August 10)Venue: Stamford Bridge — LondonTV Channel/Streaming: DAZN

The Colwill injury suddenly makes the Blues thin at a position they were merely adequate in depth prior to this point. Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, and Trevoh Chalobah are with the club while Mamadou Sarr has been loaned to Strasbourg, Chelsea are quite deep in attack and may still add this summer as Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move to London.

Milan have made four notable additions this summer. While Brighton export Pervis Estupinan and Real Madrid free transfer Luka Modric will take a lot of the headlines, A pair of 23-year-old midfielders, however, are perhaps the more intriguing additions to Milan's project. Samuele Ricci (Torino)Ii is a box-to-box type with 10 caps for Italy who Milan are hoping gives them a true maestro for the long haul, while Swiss star Ardon Jashari arrives from Club Brugge off an impressive season in Belgium after multiple campaigns with Luzern in his home country.

Should be a fun one as both teams will almost certainly be in a dress rehearsal for meaningful action the following week. Let's predict goals. Chelsea 2-1 AC Milan","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than a year away, and preparations to ensure the tournament runs seamlessly have commenced, with organizers now recruiting volunteers.

The upcoming edition of the World Cup will take place across Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with 16 cities throughout the three nations scheduled to host matches. Notably, the 2026 World Cup will mark the first occasion that three countries jointly host games, featuring a record-breaking 48 teams in competition.

Dallas, Texas, stands among the cities designated to host World Cup action, with AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, slated to stage nine matches. In advance of the approaching tournament, FIFA plans to launch volunteer applications to assist with the celebrations, requiring more than 6,000 volunteers for the organization.

Potential volunteers must be a minimum of 18 years old to qualify and must consent to face-to-face interviews, plus successfully complete background screening.

Interviews are scheduled to begin in November and December, with final selections occurring in January and February. Preparation starts in April.

Selected volunteers will be required to complete nine shifts lasting six to eight hours each, contributing to guest services, media operations, hospitality, fan operations, and additional responsibilities. Vaca emphasized that bilingual and trilingual candidates represent ""an absolute plus.""

World Cup volunteers are buzzing with excitement as they anticipate receiving their uniforms and accreditation in May and June.

Vaca, one of the lucky individuals selected for this honor, can't wait to don the official FIFA World Cup volunteer gear.

She enthused: ""The one benefit that everybody talks about, and the reason why the FIFA volunteer program is a coveted role, you're an ambassador to the North Texas region, but you're also receiving the official FIFA World Cup uniform package by Adidas.

""It includes the shoes, the hat, the shirt, the backpack; those official uniforms are coveted, and they are earned. So that is one of the biggest perks. The other is just getting to meet people all around the world.""

As Dallas-Fort Worth gears up for the grand soccer event, MetLife Stadium, notoriously dubbed the worst in the NFL and home to the New York Giants and Jets, is set to host eight matches. Jets standout receiver Garrett Wilson didn't mince words about the subpar playing surface.

""It's garbage, man,"" Wilson declared in 2024. ""You're out there running and all of a sudden your legs aren't in the same place your head is at. What's the difference between (practice during) the week, and now? You look down, and you see the turf.

""Everyone's got to play on it, everyone is trying to do what they can. I'm figuring it out.""

It's worth mentioning that MetLife Stadium was also the site of NFL icon Aaron Rodgers' Achilles injury.

The Red Devils have finally caught up with their rivals after a year of upheaval at Carrington and GOAL has taken a look inside the revamped facility.

Comparisons between Real Madrid's new signing Franco Mastantuono and Barcelona's Lamine Yamal have already started, but one man says they shouldn't.

Robert Lewandowski has made it clear he is not ready to walk away from Barcelona, turning down approaches from Saudi Arabia and setting his sights firmly on continuing his career in Catalonia.

However, the Danish striker is yet to agree to leave, insisting he wants to fight for his place at Old Trafford despite falling down the pecking order.

Newcastle United are in advanced talks with AC Milan over the transfer of German defender Malick Thiaw after they submitted an improved bid of €40 million. The player has agreed on personal terms and has given his signal to the move as the two clubs now discuss the final terms of the deal. The Magpies, who suffered disappointment in several of their transfer pursuits, are finally able to seal a move. 

Liverpool are set to hold fresh talks with Marc Guehi after the England man leads out Crystal Palace to face the Reds in the Community Shield at Wembley.

Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim saw the lighter side when a fan cheekily asked him if the Red Devils were signing Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The third round in Cincinnati has thrown up some intriguing matchups, with players coming in from very different trajectories. Some have built confidence with strong showings in recent weeks, while others are still looking for the spark to turn their summer around. The fast courts and humid conditions are adding an extra layer of unpredictability, so expect plenty of momentum swings and tight scorelines across the board.  As always, we here at LWOT will be offering our predictions for every match on the schedule. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: Tiafoe 2–1 Humbert

Frances Tiafoe and Ugo Humbert meet with both having put in solid performances recently, though in contrasting ways. Tiafoe's quick-strike game has been clicking at times during the hard court swing, while Humbert has showed great composure from the baseline in his first match since Wimbledon in the previous round. Their head-to-head has Tiafoe in the lead, and with both players in decent rhythm, this could come down to who manages their service games better.

Prediction: Tiafoe in 2

Head-to-Head: Auger-Aliassime 1–0 Rinderknech

Arthur Rinderknech has been building quietly, picking up some good wins since the grass swing, and now faces Felix Auger-Aliassime, who's enjoying one of his best patches of form this year. Felix has been moving well and dictating play with his forehand, but Rinderknech's serve-and-volley skills could keep the rallies short and the pressure high. The clash of styles will make for an engaging affair but the Canadian should have too much for his opponent. Rinderknech comes off his third top 20 win of the season, as he beat Casper Ruud in round 2.

Prediction: Auger-Aliassime in 3

Head-to-Head: Mannarino 1–1 Paul

Adrian Mannarino and Tommy Paul are no strangers to each other, having shared some tricky battles in the past. Mannarino's flat strokes and ability to redirect pace can trouble anyone, especially on a quick court, while Paul's athleticism and counterpunching have carried him deep in recent events. If both bring their A-game, expect a match full of sudden shifts and long, absorbing exchanges.

Prediction: Paul in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Gabriel Diallo's dream run meets a stern test against Jannik Sinner. The Canadian has been playing freely, feeding off the crowd and striking the ball with confidence, but Sinner's recent form and big-match experience make him a different challenge altogether. If Diallo can keep up his aggressive serving and take time away, he might just make things interesting.

Prediction: Sinner in 2

Ben Shelton and Victoria Mboko have become the latest tennis champions, winning the ATP and WTA titles in Canada.

Shelton is sixth in the ATP rankings after his maiden ATP Masters 1000 victory, in which he beat Karen Khachanov in the Toronto final.

Mboko meanwhile finds herself 24th in the WTA rankings after defeating Naomi Osaka in the Canadian Open final in Montreal.

The 18-year-old clinched her first tour-level title, and has risen a huge 61 places in the world rankings ahead of her next appearance at the Cincinnati Open.

Shelton is also playing in Cincinnati after his superb success, with the American taking on Camilo Ugo Carabelli first up.

Ahead of his opener, he was tasked with explaining how the Canadian Open finals have inspired young kids coming through or watching on.

Discussing the likes of himself, Mboko, Osaka, and doubles finalists Coco Gauff and Taylor Townsend, he replied: “Yeah, for me it was really cool.

“It's a diverse sport at the top, especially right now. And it's really cool to see young stars, new stars breaking through.

“I've watched a little bit, not too much of Mboko, but she's really fun to watch, amazing player. At 18 years old it's very, very impressive, especially not just how she won, but also who she beat.

“And yeah Coco and Taylor, obviously two people I'm really close with, playing mixed doubles with Taylor at the US Open.

“It's a great opportunity for Americans in tennis right now, but just in tennis in general, I think that there's a lot of hype around the sport.

“I think that tennis is reaching a different demographic than it was before, and that's because of, especially in the US, stars like Coco and Frances [Tiafoe] and Taylor. But not just Americans, North Americans, Europeans too. Yeah, it's really cool for me to see.”

American players really enjoyed themselves in Canada, led by ATP champion Shelton and WTA doubles winners Gauff and her compatriot McCartney Kessler.

They defeated Townsend and Zhang Shuai in the final, leaving Shelton delighted with the current state of American tennis.

But Mboko was undoubtedly the star of the show in Montreal, with the Canadian coming from behind to beat former world number one Osaka.

The teenager, who started the season ranked 333rd in the world, won 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 in front of 11,000 spectators.

But unlike Shelton, Mboko has decided to withdraw from the Cincinnati Open, with her fellow Canadian Open finalist Osaka taking the same decision.

And that is certainly understandable from the WTA duo, who will want to be in the best shape possible for the US Open.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Most of the top seeds from the top half of the draw have safely navigated through their second-round matches, with the third round set to get underway on day five at ATP Cincinnati. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate, including Gabriel Diallo vs Jannik Sinner. But who will reach the round of 32?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Joao Fonseca caught a lucky break in the second round as he was down a set and double break when Alejandro Davidovich Fokina hit a physical wall and didn't win a game before retiring towards the end of the second set. Fonseca's weakness was exposed in this match, and he must improve going forward to make a deep run. Terence Atmane got a fantastic win against Flavio Cobolli in a tight match that ended in a deciding set tiebreak. The Frenchman displayed great mentality after losing the second set. Atmane's serve is a weapon, and Fonseca's poor return can cost him this match. Both players are looking to make the round of 16 for the first time at the Masters level, but Atmane should have the edge.

Prediction: Atmane in 3

Head-to-Head: Tsitsipas 3-0 Bonzi

Former Cincinnati Open finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas defeated Fabian Marozsan in the second round to end his five-match losing streak. The Greek needed the win desperately, and he played a solid match to do so. His backhand, which is his weakness, looked good, and he looked great on serve throughout the match. Benjamin Bonzi is in the third round of a Masters for the second time in his career as he upset eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti in a fantastic match. Both players played at a high level, but Bonzi's ability to save break points proved to be the difference. The Frenchman has never won against Tsitsipas, but he will like his chances on a hard court. Expect a close encounter with Tsitsipas edging it.

Prediction: Tsitsipas in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Holger Rune is defending a lot of points here, and he is off to a positive start by defeating Roman Safiullin in two tight sets. He can improve on his forehand, which leaked some errors and didn't look as effective as it could be. Alex Micheksen came through a tough match against Corentin Moutet and continues his good form. These two are facing off for the first time, and this can be one of the matches of the round. Michelsen is the more consistent player, but Rune can hit through his opponents much easily. The Dane should have the edge.

Prediction: Rune in 3

Head-to-Head: Fritz 6-2 Sonego

It was a classic Taylor Fritz performance in the second round to defeat Emilio Nava in straight sets. He dominated behind his serve but did enough on return to break Nava once in each set. He has a clear edge against Lorenzo Sonego, who has never won against the American outside clay and has a disadvantage in every category on a hard court. Sonego's serve can keep this close, but Fritz is the more clutch player, and he should be able to win the tiebreaks if necessary.

Prediction: Fritz in 2

Holger Rune has returned to winning ways at the Cincinnati Open, defeating Roman Safiullin in a tough second-round match.

The Dane has experienced a tough couple of months on the ATP Tour, after being branded ‘immature' before exiting Wimbledon at the first hurdle.

However, the feeling around Rune has shifted in recent months, following his work with eight-time Grand Slam winner Andre Agassi and the hiring of Novak Djokovic's former fitness coach, Marco Panichi.

Rune was seen working with Agassi at the Washington Open, where he was forced to withdraw through injury. The Dane has since competed at the Canadian Open, reaching the round of 16 before losing to Alexei Popyrin.

Rune, who is still in contact with Agassi, spoke about their relationship after his opening round victory at the Cincinnati Open.

Speaking to the Tennis Channel after his victory, Rune provided an update on his relationship with Agassi.

The Dane won his opening match in Cincinnati, defeating Russia's Roman Safiullin 7-5 7-6.

Rune said: “It's still ongoing. We're still chatting a little bit on the phone. He just messaged me also after my match, so it's nice. He's such a nice guy as I've said. 

“And also we spoke a little bit after Toronto as well, what I can do better, and we had some talk on the phone, small specific things that, you know, I can make it easier for myself and play better. So it's always nice to share thoughts through him.”

Rune was then asked if Agassi was congratulating the Dane in his messages.

Rune continued: “It's rarely congratulations [laughing] but it is also some very nice messages. 

“But it's much more about the game, what he sees you know. I think I don't need any person to be there just to congratulate me and this is what I really appreciate about him as well, that he's really there. 

“He's so much into tennis and into all the small things happening. You know, he remembers points you know, that I also remember, but I'm sure you know if you talk to probably whole of my team they don't remember the points.

“So he's so much into it which is amazing. So I think it's just really exciting to share this view with him.”

With victory over Safiullin on Saturday, Holger Rune achieved something only three other players born after 2000 have accomplished.

As per OptaAce, Holger Rune is both the youngest Scandinavian and just the fourth player born since 2000 to achieve 50 ATP Masters 1000 match wins after Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Rune was aged 22 years and 100 days when he achieved the feat on Saturday.

The American star learned her tennis trade in Compton, California, alongside her sister Venus, before going on to become one of the sport's biggest ever stars.

Williams was dominant throughout her career, rarely going a year without picking up a Grand Slam title.

However, there was a decade-long period where Williams failed to win the French Open. After winning her first title in 2002, the American waited 11 years to win her second Grand Slam title in Paris.

Patrick Mouratoglou, who was coaching Williams at the time, has revealed what the American said immediately after capturing her second French Open title.

Patrick Mouratoglou, who has recently parted ways with Naomi Osaka, coached Serena Williams for a decade, between 2012 and 2022.

During their partnership, Serena won 10 Grand Slam singles titles, making this the most prolific partnership of her career.

The Frenchman, who has also coached Simona Halep and Stefanos Tsitsipas, recently spoke about Serena's French Open title victory in 2013.

A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou)

On Instagram, Mouratoglou said: “With Serena we started working together in 2012 and in 2012 she wins Wimbledon and the US Open.

“She tells me ‘now I want to achieve another goal, which is to win Roland Garros. I won it only once, in 2002, and I want to win it again.'

“And in 2013, she wins Roland Garros. When she wins, there is a trophy ceremony and when she gets out of the court she comes to me and she says ‘okay, let's do the cooldown.'

“So we go into the fitness room and after five minutes she looks at me and she says: ‘now we have to win Wimbledon.'

“After five minutes she already forgot that she won Roland Garros, which is a tournament she was trying to win for 10 years. Already focusing on winning the next one, which was Wimbledon.

“This is the mindset of the champions. As soon as they achieve something, they immediately think about a new goal, another one.”

After defeating Mandy Minella, Caroline Garcia and Kimiko Date-Krumm without dropping a set, many would have expected Serena Williams to go on and lift her sixth Ladies Singles title at Wimbledon.

However, the American ran into an inspired German player in the fourth round: Sabine Lisicki. The German star stunned Williams in three sets, winning 6-2 1-6 6-4.

Lisicki, the 23rd seed, defeated Kaia Kanepi in the quarter-finals, before beating Agnieszka Radwańska in a marathon semi-final match, winning 9-7 in the third set.

However, Lisicki came up short in the final, losing to Marion Bartoli.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Emma Raducanu has just shown exactly why she can beat Aryna Sabalenka after what she's changed since Wimbledon","https://tennishead.net/emma-raducanu-has-just-shown-exactly-why-she-can-beat-aryna-sabalenka-after-what-shes-changed-since-wimbledon/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Emma Raducanu cruised through her opening-round match against Olga Danilovic in an impressive return to the Cincinnati Open.

However, despite being seeded, things get no easier for the British number one, as Aryna Sabalenka awaits in the Round of 32.

The top-ranked player in the entire world, and for good reason, the big-hitting Belarusian has crushed almost everyone in her path throughout 2025, despite suffering a few hiccups at the Grand Slams.

Most recently, she was shockingly defeated by Amanda Anisimova at Wimbledon, an event she was the heavy favourite to win.

However, Sabalenka could very easily have lost way before that semi-final, as she was pushed to the brink by Raducanu.

Having impressed in her opening two matches, particularly against Marketa Vondrousova, the 22-year-old was brimming with confidence as she faced the world number one.

She was not expected to win, but the hope was that she could certainly trouble her and exhibit all the progress she had made throughout the year.

Fortunately for the Centre Court crowd, she did far more than that, and had fine opportunities to snatch both sets, which she subsequently lost.

It was one of her most impressive performances to date, despite the record showing a straight-sets defeat, and for many, proved that Raducanu is not that far away from returning to the apex of the sport.

In the end, it was once again her win percentage on that second serve which let her down in the crucial moments, allowing Sabalenka to break four times from the 15 opportunities she forged. The Brit won just 41% of points behind her second serve that night.

Fortunately for Emma Raducanu, this could be a weakness that has been plugged since then.

After all, in her opening-round match against Danilovic, she looked so impressive on serve, even if she was broken twice.

With one of the fiercest returning games on the tour, it feels like Raducanu only ever needs a few holds of serve to secure a set.

And, given that she was winning a much-improved 73% of points behind her second serve, the chances of Sabalenka bringing up as many break point opportunities in their next match seem slim.

Raducanu has praised her new coach Francisco Roig for what he has already brought to her coaching team, as a partnership that has already had a fine start.

What better way to reaffirm that notion than with a statement win against Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open?

She knows exactly what she needs to do to topple the 27-year-old, and if she can replicate that serving form from the Danilovic match, we could see that happen.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

			Network of 40 sports centres to be rolled out nationwide to encourage old people and the obese to stay active and inspire next generation

Pensioners are being encouraged to play padel tennis and pickleball with a new Wimbledon-inspired scheme to build more covered, all-weather courts.

A network of 40 covered community sports centres will be rolled out across the UK by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) in an attempt to encourage people of all ages to play a form of tennis.

The move is backed by Paul Farmer, the chief executive of Age UK, who has described padel as “a simple and easy format that can provide older people with opportunities to get and stay active”.

The initiative comes after there were more Britons in the Wimbledon singles draw this year than any year since 1984. On the first day of the championships on June 30, Britons won more singles matches in a day than at any time in the Open Era.

Data from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) show Britain is at the forefront of the global rise in tennis participation and has the highest percentage of population playing tennis of any of the 199 nations who contributed to their report.

In April 2025, adult annual participation was at 5.8 million playing at least once a year, up by 51 per cent since January 2019. Back then, padel participation was at 6,000 but this has climbed to about 400,000 annual players today.

Fans of the sport include Eva Longoria, the Hollywood star who has said she is “addicted” to padel and is the co-owner of a team, Eleven Eleven. David Beckham is another celebrity fan of padel.

There were just 50 padel courts six years ago but now there are more than 1,000 across the UK. However, there is a lack of covered tennis courts in Britain compared with the rest of Europe. France has six times as many, with a roughly similar population and preferable weather.

The new hubs, which will use new light-weight, all-weather lit canopy structures that allow courts to be covered easily, will be positioned in some of the areas with the highest levels of obesity and inactivity across Britain.

They are expected to offer free community sessions, specific activity sessions for inactive groups, including pensioners, and other classes such as female-only and disability tennis sessions, as well as being able to be booked by members of the public.

The sites could also be used for basketball, netball or other sports, all under one roof, whatever the weather.

It is hoped the new facilities will also help to inspire the next generation of children to take up a sport.

The £80m project will be funded by the Government, the LTA's charitable arm – the LTA Tennis Foundation, and local authorities, including through the opportunity to unlock money from property developers, and other partners.

In the spending review, the Department for Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) received £400m for sports facilities capital spending over the next four years, of which the LTA is bidding for £60m. The proposal would complement existing Government investment into football pitches, which doesn't cover courts or court-based sports.

Mr Farmer has written to the DCMS urging Labour to back the project, “to further grow opportunities for older people to be active and participate”, saying: “Expanding access to year-round tennis facilities is vital.”

The charity already runs a Walking Tennis programme, in partnership with the LTA encouraging older adults to stay active.

Mr Farmer added: “In those locations where we run the programme outdoors, we have witnessed a very significant drop-off in participation in the autumn and winter months.

“This would also grow opportunities for older people to participate in padel by expanding affordable community provision.

“Padel is a simple and easy format that can provide older people with opportunities to get and stay active, but public facilities are crucial to ensuring that these benefits are accessible to all.”

Parkinson's UK also urged the DCMS to back the project.

In May, then British No 1s Jack Draper and Katie Boulter, alongside wheelchair tennis champions Alfie Hewett, Gordon Reid, and Lucy Shuker, urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to invest more in tennis.

Pointing out the “huge strides” British players had made in recent years, it read: “Too many places around the country still do not have access to high quality community sports facilities.

“A new national network of community accessible covered tennis, padel and multi-sport hubs would support year-round play, and grow participation, particularly among underserved communities and disabled people.”

Two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray also backed the plans earlier in summer, saying: “It is essential in this country for the winter months, because the weather is not great, particularly up north.

“It's tough. It's not easy to go out and want to run around when it's freezing cold and raining. So more covered courts will make a big difference.”

The very best tennis stars are all in action at the Cincinnati Open over the coming week. Many, including Britain's Emma Raducanu, have already got their campaigns underway in the final piece of preparation ahead of the US Open.

Raducanu breezed past Olga Danilovic 6-3 6-2 in her second-round match, the first played in front of Francis Roig as her full-time coach. A rematch with Wimbledon nemesis Aryna Sabalenka awaits in the third round. It will provide a litmus test of her progress this summer, after the 22-year-old pushed the world No. 1 far in her two-sets defeat on Centre Court a little over a month ago. Express Sport will bring you the very best news, gossip and reaction from the Cincinnati Open.

Rielly Opelka has beaten Alex De Minaur for the first time in his career.

The big-serving American wins 7-6(6) 6-4 to reach the third round in Cincinnati.

Frances Tiafoe has joking claimed that fellow American Jessica Pegula no longer wants to practice with him because she has become too ""big time.""

Pegula reached the US Open final last year and climbed to No.4 in the world.

""She hits the ball so pure and right in pocket every time. She's pretty relaxed as well. But she doesn't want to hit with me any more,"" Tiafoe said.

""She's made some finals now in some slams, 1000s, and she doesn't want to talk to me as much any more. She got too big time for me. She forgot about the little people.""

Roger Federer has confirmed that he will return to the tennis court at the Shangai Masters in October.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion is set to play in a charity celebrity doubles match.

""Hello, this is Roger, and I am really happy to be returning to Qizhong Stadium in Shanghai for the Rolex Shanghai Masters,"" the 44-year-old said in an announcement video.

""Shanghai has always been a special place for me, with great fans, unforgettable memories, and a real love for the game.

""I look forward to seeing you there on October 10. Shanghai, let's meet.""

Roger Federer is coming back to Shanghai \ud83e\udd29Join us on October 10th for the @rogerfederer and Friends Celebrity Doubles Match!#rolexshanghaimasters pic.twitter.com/6gpnkFfl6B

Alexander Zverev is gearing up for his first match at the Cincinnati Open in today's evening session but he is not a fan of the courts being used.

He complained: ""Cincinnati was a very fast tournament in the past, but it's become extremely slow now. I'm not sure what the reason behind this is the choice, especially since in New York the courts will be very fast again.

""I'm not a huge fan of this surface. I just hope to play good tennis and get as far as possible.""

Canadian Open tournament director Karl Hale has taken aim at Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for skipping the event this year.

Both took time out following their epic battle at Wimbledon last month.

But Hale said: “As far as the top player withdrawal, it's definitely not what we want. Draper's out for Cincy as well in the season, Novak's out for Cincy as well. So those players, you know, were injuries.

""I think Carlos and Sinner have to look at our tour, the ATP tour, and commit to these majors, you know. So we're in talks with them to ensure that going forward that they'll be participating in our event.""

Coco Gauff has joked that American's men need to catch up.

No American man has won a Grand Slam since Andy Roddick in 2003.

Gauff joked: ""It hasn't been much of competition, no offence to them. They have to catch up.”

She added: “That's the beautiful thing about being an American. All of us look different. We have biracial, black, white [players], all types of representation for girls and guys to look up to in the Top 10, or close to the Top 10. That's something beautiful about our country, how diverse it is, and I hope that in this sport it continues to grow.""



Iga Swiatek has argued that the Cincinatti Open balls are ‘very different' from the ones used at Wimbledon and during the clay-court season.

The Polish star said: ""I try to be humble and remember that you have to adapt to these balls because they don't give you any advantage in and of themselves.

They are light and very different from the ones we play on clay or at Wimbledon, the only way to deal with them is to focus on adapting as much as possible and accepting that there will be shots that will escape your racket, trying to control them as much as possible.”

Swiatek defeated Anastasia Potapova 6-1 6-4 in her first match in Cincinnati.

Carlos Alcaraz will play for the first time since the Wimbledon final today.

The Spaniard has taken a short break since his defeat against Jannik Sinner in last month's showdown.

Alcaraz faces Damir Dzumhur at the Cincinnati Open today. He is currently expected on court at around 6.20pm UK time.

Aryna Sabalenka has requested a bigger dining room at the Cincinnati Open.

Tournament bosses have made widespread changes to the facilities, and the world No. 1 is largely impressed.

But she complained that the dining room is too small.

Sabalenka said: ""The first time I came back, I was like, ‘Where am I?'. It's a completely different tournament, it's an impressive job done. Just wow.

""Everything is so confusing! Little by little I'm getting used to it.

""My only request is that next year we make the dining room a bit bigger. There are so many people and so little tables, please! Next year let's make sure there's more space in the dining room.

""Everyone likes to eat, everyone likes to spend time there. We need a bigger room!

""Other than that, oh my gosh, it's even more enjoyable to be here.""

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina retired from his Cincinnati Open clash with Joao Fonseca.

The Spaniard led 7-6 4-0 at one stage of the match but then inexplicably dropped five straight games.

Fokina retired at 7-6 4-5 to send Fonseca through to the next round.



Novak Djokovic's former coach has backed Jannik Sinner to win a Career Slam in the next seven years.

Riccardo Piatti believes it will not be long before Sinner is a French Open champion.

The Italian has already won the three other majors - Wimbledon, the Australian Open and US Open.

“Jannik has taken a big step forward this past year. He's also become very competitive on the clay-court tour,” Piatti told La Stampa.

“He's realised that in the next six or seven years, he'll have the opportunity to complete the Grand Slam. This is something I've always thought about.

“In Paris, the bet was more on Carlos, at Wimbledon more on Jannik, but in any case, they have two different styles and two different personalities, which is fine.

“They both know how the world works. They know that there are fans who want one to win and others who enjoy seeing them fall more, but that's the way sport is.”

Danielle Collins has hit out at 'keyboard warriors' for mocking her viral outburst at the Cincinnati Open.

The American seemed hugely emotional during her defeat against Taylor Townsend, and seemed to shout in pain at her team.

""Anyone who has a herniated disc knows my pain,"" Collins wrote on Instagram.

""It's no surprise the keyboard warriors can't understand or relate, as they've been too busy sitting on a**es judging people who show up and and try to give it their best even on days that suck.

""Thank you to everyone who has been praying for my injury and thank you to Taylor Townsend for being the best of the best.""

Emma Raducanu has shared some blunt early conversations with Francis Roig.

The British No. 1 says they have both agreed that all of her shots need to improve, particularly if she is to consistently challenge the likes of Aryna Sabalenka - her next Cincinnati Open opponent.

“It's just, 'the level needs to be better'. In a good way, not in a negative way. It's just calling it how it is,"" Raducanu said of her conversations with the Spaniard, who coached Rafael Nadal to each of his 22 Grand Slams.

""And I'm very like that. I'm very factual and I don't necessarily like fluffing something up. I think that's where we get on really well and we understand each other.

""Just in general, everything is like: ‘We need to improve. We need to get every shot better.' And that's exciting, because I feel like there's a lot of potential to go and I don't think I'm near it.

“You always feel a little bit of nerves before the first round, but I think that overall, I'm approaching everything in a lot more calm way, mature, and I think I'm trusting a lot more the work I'm doing behind the scenes. I know I'm putting a lot of hours in, and it takes some of the pressure off of the results.

“I think the way I'm playing, the movements of my shot, improving the quality of my shot. There were four or five points where I did something that we were working on, and it's always really satisfying and rewarding when you hit a shot and you've worked on it in practice. So I think I'm going to improve a lot, hopefully doing the work day in, day out.”



Frances Tiafoe has given a student £22,300 to complete his studies.

Russell Lokko received the cheque in Cincinnati and can now complete his junior and senior years debt-free.

Tiafoe said: ""This is what it's all about. Nothing better than paying it forward.

“This is great, I'm excited to get it out. To see how ecstatic he was with being able to take care of his junior and senior career, it's a huge deal. [Being] the son of immigrants, I've been in that seat, I know how it is.”

Jannik Sinner has snubbed a golf reunion with Carlos Alcaraz weeks after they Wimbledon battle.

Sinner has previously played golf with Alcaraz, but now insists the Spaniard is too good for him.

Speaking ahead of the Cincinnati Open, the Italian said: ""[My team] actually played now a couple of times before the tournament here. I'm not a good golfer, but I love to spend time doing different things now. And we were just talking, maybe now we go [to the course], because it's also not late.

""Tomorrow I have one day off, so maybe we play a couple of holes here. Also last year, here it's the best place to play golf.

""In Cincinnati there's not so much to do, so we're actually lucky that the golf course is there.

""The first hole is, okay, should be straight, you know, but on the left there are all cars, and if one ball finished in the car, everyone, it's me.""

Asked if he will play golf with Alcaraz, Sinner joked: ""Carlos is too good for me. Me and my team is better.""

Emma Raducanu has warned her rivals that momentum is on her side.

A blistering 6-3 6-2 defeat of Olga Danilovic, who had beaten Katie Boulter in the first round, opened Raducanu's Cincinnati Open campaign with a bang.

It was the 22-year-old's first match in front of new full-time coach Francis Roig.

""I'm really building some momentum. I'm really happy with how I've stayed pretty consistent over the last few months,"" said Raducanu.

""I still feel like there's a long way to go but just working hard behind the scenes, putting a lot of hours in and hoping I can trust in that.""

Aryna Sabalenka awaits in the third round.

This tournament is Raducanu's last piece of preparation before she returns to the scene of her greatest triumph, the US Open.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former top-10 player Paula Badosa pulled out of the U.S. Open on Friday after dealing with a back injury that has sidelined her since a first-round loss at Wimbledon on June 30.

The U.S. Tennis Association announced Badosa's withdrawal and said Jil Teichmann would replace her in the field. Alizé Cornet, who retired from tennis last year but returned to action this year, is the next woman in line to get a berth in the draw at Flushing Meadows if someone else pulls out.

Play is scheduled to begin on Aug. 24 in the singles brackets at the year's last Grand Slam tournament.

Badosa, a 27-year-old from Spain, reached a career-best ranking of No. 2 in 2022 and is currently No. 12.

She reached the semifinals at the Australian Open this January. Her best showing at the U.S. Open was a run to the quarterfinals last year.

Amanda Anisimova admits she had a sense of ""guilt"" after not winning a single game in the Wimbledon final but also adds that the public gave her ""the sweetest"" support and that's what helped her mentally overcome the most painful loss of her career.

Playing in her first Grand Slam final, the 23-year-old American lasted on the court only 57 minutes before Iga Swiatek completed an astonishing 6-0 6-0 win. For the first time since 1988, a Grand Slam final finished with a double bagel. Also, it was the first time since 1911 that a player failed to register a single game in a Wimbledon title match.

When Anisimova burst into tears shortly after the Wimbledon final, no one could blame her. And after taking some time for everything to soak in and receiving numerous pleasant messages, the new world No. 7 felt much better.

""It was really special to see how many people were sending me the sweetest messages. Lots of support from people, which I wasn't really expecting after the performance I had. I felt really bad because I wish I could have put on a better performance, or could have competed harder, especially in a Grand Slam final. There was definitely that side of guilt immediately after. To see what everyone was saying to me after really helped me get through that,"" the 23-year-old said.

Usually, players complain about receiving social media abuse. But this time, Anisimova was on the receiving end of his warm and kind messages.

""It's not often that you get a lot of positive feedback on social media,"" the world No. 7 noted.

After Wimbledon, Anisimova kicked off her North American hard-court swing in Montreal, where she made the round-of-16 before losing to Elina Svitolina. The American is now set to participate in her home tournament in Cincinnati, where she is seeded at No. 5 and plays against Leolia Jeanjean after having a first-round bye.

Aryna Sabalenka made her way into the second round of the Cincinnati Open after defeating Marketa Vondrousova in straight sets. 

In her first match of the North American hard-court swing, Sabalenka beat the former Wimbledon champion 7-5, 6-1 to kick off her title defence. 

She will face Emma Raducanu in the next round, who she overcame at the All England Club earlier this summer en route to the semifinals.

Ahead of her clash with the Briton, Sabalenka reflected on the rivalry the two stars have had on the WTA Tour so far.

Speaking to Tennis Channel after her win, she said of Raducanu: “We had a great battle at Wimbledon.

“She is an amazing player, and she has been playing really well lately. I am super excited to face her on hard courts.

“I don't remember our match at Indian Wells, but I think now she is playing much better. It's going to be a challenge, and I love to accept tough challenges.

“So I am super excited to face her. I will definitely have to work really hard for every point.

“But Marketa tested me really well today, so I am ready to fight for each point.”

Sabalenka and Raducanu first played each other at Indian Wells in 2024, when they met in the round of 32. 

The Belarusian, who was the second seed at the event that year, beat her 6-3, 7-5, before losing in the next round to Emma Navarro. 

Their second and most recent bout came at Wimbledon this year, where Raducanu looked to advance to the fourth round in front of a home crowd.

Despite forcing Sabalenka to a first-set tiebreak, ultimately the three-time major champion came out on top. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Watch: Novak Djokovic getting ready for the US Open","https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Novak_Djokovic/158415/watch-novak-djokovic-getting-ready-for-the-us-open-/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

Most fans were worried when Novak Djokovic announced that he would not even participate in the Cincinnati Masters 1000, after having already skipped the 'Canadian Open' staged in Toronto.

The Serbian legend – who has not competed in an official match since the semi-final of the Wimbledon Championships against Jannik Sinner – took a long vacation between Croatia and Greece together with his family and friends, not touching his racket and generating a wave of speculation on the web.

The 2025 season allowed Nole to finally clinch the 100th title of his never-ending career, but it also showed him how tough it is to become the oldest Grand Slam champion in tennis history. The men's tour is controlled by Sinner and Alcaraz at the moment, with the Italian and Spaniard having no intention of leaving room for their rivals.

The 38-year-old from Belgrade raised his level as he usually does in Major tournaments, but he never went beyond the semifinals and showed some signs of decay from an athletic point of view for the first time.

For this reason, the 24-time Grand Slam champion has decided to return to action directly at the US Open, scheduled in Flushing Meadows from August 24 to September 7. Before playing the singles in New York, the former world number 1 will also participate in the mixed doubles tournament together with Olga Danilovic and it will be a good opportunity to test his condition in view of a particularly important tournament for him.

Meanwhile, Novak was spotted during a practice session on the courts of Portonovi, a resort located in Montenegro. Djokovic won his latest career Grand Slam at the US Open in 2023, while in the last edition he was eliminated in the first week having not yet recovered from his amazing triumph at the Paris Olympics (where he defeated Alcaraz in the final).

After reaching the final at the Canadian Open only to fall short against Victoria Mboko, Naomi Osaka made a strategic decision that caught the tennis world's attention. Rather than pushing forward to Cincinnati, the four-time Grand Slam champion chose to withdraw from the upcoming tournament, prioritizing her preparation for the US Open.

This move drew praise from an unexpected source: Rick Macci, Serena Williams' former coach, who saw wisdom in Osaka's choice to step back and reset.

Following the Canadian Open final, Osaka was scheduled to compete at the 2025 Cincinnati Open, and her opening match would have been against 20th seed Linda Nosková.

However, the four-time Grand Slam champion cited a change in her schedule and withdrew from the WTA 1000 hard-court tournament in Ohio. This decision sparked commentary from Macci, who took to social media to share his perspective on the withdrawal.

Macci expressed that Osaka's decision was “smart” because she appeared “mentally spent” following her loss to Mboko. The tennis coach seemingly alluded to the fact that Osaka was visibly upset after the match and even overlooked acknowledging the 18-year-old winner during her speech, a point Macci had previously defended.

Macci emphasized the strategic value of Osaka's withdrawal. He mentioned that skipping Cincinnati would allow her to “reset” her mind in preparation for the 2025 US Open, giving her the best chance to compete for the Grand Slam trophy.

“Osaka and her decision to skip the Ohio event is smart because mentally she is a little spent. Reset for New York as she busted thru a crossroad that was always a broken fork. She held the hardware in past years but it all depends now what is between her ears. @naomiosaka,” Macci posted on X.

This decision comes after Osaka kickstarted her North American hard-court swing at the 2025 Citi DC Open, where she received a wild card entry into the main draw and was eliminated by Emma Raducanu in the second round.

At the 2025 Canadian Open, Osaka defeated the likes of Liudmila Samsonova, Jeļena Ostapenko, Elina Svitolina, and Clara Tauson to advance to the final. However, in the championship match, the Japanese star lost to wild card Victoria Mboko 2-6, 6-4, 1-6.

Osaka's history at the US Open provides context for why this tournament holds special significance in her career. She captured her first US Open title in 2018, entering as the 20th seed and building momentum throughout the tournament.

She commenced her campaign with a victory over Laura Siegemund, winning 6-3, 6-2 in the first round. Following this, she faced qualifier Julia Glushko and defeated her 6-2, 6-0. The former World No. 1 then triumphed over Aliaksandra Sasnovich before eliminating 26th seed Aryna Sabalenka.

Her path to the final continued with dominance over Lesia Tsurenko in the quarterfinals, winning 6-1, 6-1, before a 6-2, 6-4 win over 14th seed Madison Keys in the semifinals. In the final, Osaka faced off against 17th seed Serena Williams, winning 6-2, 6-4 to claim her first Grand Slam title.

Two years later, in 2020, Osaka secured her second US Open title as the fourth seed. She began her run by defeating compatriot Misaki Doi, Camila Giorgi, Marta Kostyuk and 14th seed Anett Kontaveit.

The quarterfinals saw Osaka defeat Shelby Rogers, before the Japanese got past 28th seed Jennifer Brady 7-6(1), 3-6, 6-3 to earn her spot in the final.

In the championship match, Osaka faced Victoria Azarenka, staging a comeback after dropping the first set to win 1-6, 6-3, 6-3, claiming her second New York Major title and third Grand Slam title overall.

Emma Raducanu started her new coaching partnership with Francisco Roig on a winning note after kicking off her Cincinnati Open campaign with a straight-set win over Olga Danilovic.

The 22-year-old started working with esteemed coach Roig – who was one of 22-time Grand Slam winner Rafael Nadal's mentor for more than two decades – after Wimbledon, but was only confirmed in the build-up to the Cincinnati event that the Spaniard has taken up the full-time role until the end of the 2025 season.

But there was no settling period at the WTA 1000 tournament as the 2021 US Open winner won 6-3, 6-2.

Both players struggled on serve in the first set as there were four breaks in the first five games before Raducanu claimed the crucial break in game eight. She dominated the second set with two breaks to set up the solid victory.

“I'm really building some momentum. I'm really happy with how I've stayed pretty consistent over the last few months,” she started after the match.

“I still feel like there's a long way to go but just working hard behind the scenes, putting a lot of hours in and hoping I can trust in that.”

Raducanu slipped six places to No 39 in the WTA Rankings after the Canadian Open, but she has now moved a projected five-place jump in the Live Rankings with her opening-round win, which puts her on the cusp of being seeded at the US Open with the top-32 players receiving the honour.

The Cincinnati Open is the cutoff event for the US Open seedings, but there is bad news for Raducanu as she faces world No 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka in the second round.

Sabalenka kicked off her title defence with a 7-5, 6-1 victory over 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.

“It's always a tough match against her,” Sabalenka said. “[Vondrousova] always pushes me to the limit. You have to stay focused, and you have to fight for every point against her.”

It will be Sabalenka and Raducanu's second meeting in just over a month as they produced a thrilling fourth-round match at Wimbledon and it was the former who emerged with a 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.

The three-time Grand Slam winner also won their only other encounter at the 2024 Indian Wells Open as she defeated the British No 1 7-3, 7-5.

Raducanu sits on 1,426 points in the Live Rankings and if she wins her next match she will move to 1,481, which will result in a bump up to No 31.

The winner of the Sabalenka-Raducanu encounter will face either Jessica Bouzas Maneiro or Taylor Townsend in the fourth round.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Cincinnati Open: American men motivated to break Grand Slam drought","https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/08/10/cincinnati-open-american-men-grand-slams-us-open-taylor-fritz-ben-shelton-tommy-paul-frances-tiafoe/85596930007/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 16:03:10 GMT","

When two-time Grand Slam champion and WTA No. 2, Coco Gauff, was asked about the strength of American tennis, she playfully criticized her ATP counterparts. 

“It hasn't been much of a competition, no offense to them, but now it is,” Gauff quipped. “We've had three straight slams with American in the finals, so I think we're doing pretty good on our end. They have to catch up.”

Even if Gauff might not have been entirely serious, she had a point. While American women have won two Grand Slams this year — Madison Keys at the Australian and Gauff at the French Open — the men haven't held up their end of the bargain in about 22 years since Andy Roddick won the 2003 US Open.

Still, the 2025 group might be closer than usual as they prepare for the US Open in late August while competing at the Cincinnati Open.

ATP No. 6 Ben Shelton has soared up the rankings after recently beating fellow American and No. 4 Taylor Fritz at the National Bank Open in Canada before defeating then-No. 16 Karen Khachanov to win the tournament.

Known for his fast serves and showman attitude, the 22-year-old has reached the semifinals at the Australian Open and quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year before losing to No. 1 Jannik Sinner in both. He has skyrocketed to his career-high rank after starting the year at No. 21. 

Shelton has progressed tremendously despite always showing promise because of his serving, because he has improved his baseline and serve return game. At the National Bank Open, he won 36.2% of return points, according to USA TODAY.

“I don't really feel expectation other than, you know, what me and my team put on myself, which is more about effort and intention than results,” Shelton said. “That's always kind of how I go into a tournament. Whatever happens, happens, and I know that the way that I play, I can have big weeks.”

Fritz, who has held his No. 4 ranking position since 2024, has come close to winning Grand Slams. He reached his first major final at the 2024 US Open and recently reached the semifinals at Wimbledon. But he fell to the world's top two players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively, as he bowed out of each.

In 2024, Fritz finished with a 17-4 record in Grand Slam matches. He noted that while Sinner and Alcaraz are a level higher than the rest of the field, those players still lose.

Fritz said he has noticed the high level of all the top Americans, who he thinks are capable of achieving a grand slam title. By continuing to make deep Grand Slam runs, he added, it could eventually work out for one of them.

“The thing is, it only takes, it only takes two weeks,” Fritz said. “Things just need to click for two weeks, and that's it.”

Others in the top 20, like Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe, have also performed well. While a Grand Slam could be a tall order for them, they are still contributing to a rapidly developing field of top American men.

And maybe it will click for one of them, as Fritz suggested.

Tiafoe, who is 6-3 in Grand Slams this year, made the French Open quarterfinal. But his recent results have been a step down from his 2024 US Open semifinal appearance, in which he lost to Fritz.

Tiafoe said Shelton's success in Canada has motivated him to perform better. While Alcaraz and Sinner have been more consistent than the rest of the pack, he said on any given night, one of them can pull off a victory.

“I don't think it's head and shoulders by any means,” Tiafoe said of the level between Alcaraz and Sinner and other players. “I think Taylor (Fritz) can do it. I think Ben (Shelton) can do it. I think Tommy (Paul) 's in a great situation. I can do it myself. So I don't think an American is that far away at all.

“Now, to do it is obviously tough. Those guys are tall orders, but I don't think the difference is that big. I think the belief factor just needs to be there.”

Paul reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open and the French Open, but lost form at Wimbledon, exiting in the second round to Austria's Sebastian Ofner.

The 28-year-old has dealt with abdominal and foot injuries since the French Open, the latter sustained at Wimbledon. Since then, he has slipped out of a top ten ranking spot, which he reached in June.

Paul is still focused on conditioning, but he has been motivated by Shelton's rapid progress.

""Every six months that I watch Ben (Shelton), I feel like I can notice something that he's doing so much better, or something that he's changed that's made his game better,"" Paul said. ""Obviously, (it) motivates all of us, but (I'm) really just happy for him right now.""

With Fritz, Shelton, Tiafoe and Paul in the top 20 on the men's side and Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys, Amanda Anisimova, Emma Navarro and Gauff around the heights of the women's side, Americans have found success.

It goes beyond Grand Slams, though.

“It's a great opportunity for Americans in tennis right now, but just in tennis in general, there's a lot of hype around the sport,” Shelton said. “Tennis is reaching a different demographic than it was before, and that's because of stars like Coco (Gauff), Francis (Tiafoe), and Taylor (Fritz), especially in the U.S., but not just Americans, North Americans, and Europeans too.”

Gauff later continued to discuss why it is important to have Americans near the top of tennis on both sides.

“Something beautiful about our country is how diverse it is, and I hope in this sport that it continues to show,” she said. “It's great for the men to be in those numbers with us. And I would love to see in my lifetime, a woman, an American woman, and a male win the same slam.”","{'href': 'https://www.cincinnati.com', 'title': 'Cincinnati Enquirer'}","tennis"

Spain's Paula Badosa, ranked 12th in the world, has withdrawn from the US Open, tournament officials announced on Friday.

Badosa, who reached her first Grand Slam semi-final at this year's Australian Open, has not played since losing to Britain's Katie Boulter in the first round at Wimbledon.






Badosa had been set to pair with Britain's Jack Draper in mixed doubles as well as compete in women's singles.In an Instagram message posted Friday, Badosa recounted her struggles without saying she would drop out of the US Open.“I wasn't built by easy days. I was shaped by the moments that broke me, the choices that didn't go as planned and the times I fell short of who I wanted to be,” Badosa recalled on social media.“Failure taught me what success never could.

Spain's Paula Badosa, ranked 12th in the world, has withdrawn from the US Open, tournament officials announced on Friday.

Badosa has won four WTA titles, the most recent coming last August in Washington.

Her departure allows Swiss Jil Teichmann to reach the women's main draw for the Grand Slam showdown, which starts August 24.

France's Alize Cornet moves into the first alternate spot for the main draw.

Meanwhile, newly minted Toronto Masters champion Ben Shelton will open his account at the ATP-WTA Cincinnati Open against Camilo Ugo Carabelli after the Argentine defeated Kei Nishikori 7-5, 6-3 on Friday.

World number seven Shelton arrived in the American Midwest on a private jet after winning his first Masters 1000 title in Toronto on Thursday night and will make his start after a first-round bye in the final major tune-up before the US Open begins on August 25.

The Japanese player was competing for the first time since retiring injured at Geneva in mid-May.

Ugo Carabelli has played his best on clay, reaching four semi-finals on the dirt this season.

As Cincinnati fifth seed and with confidence still strong, the 22-year-old Shelton could be a formidable contender for a pre-Open title double.

“I hope that this (Toronto) week kick starts me and gets me more consistent with the type of tennis that I want to play day-in and day-out,” he said in Canada.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Shelton surging behind 'Big-Point Ben' success","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shelton-infosys-atp-beyond-the-numbers-august-2025","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 06:01:59 GMT","

Ben Shelton has been 'Big-Point Ben' in 2025.

The American, who began the season at No. 21 in the PIF ATP Rankings, reached a career-high World No. 6 on Friday following his maiden ATP Masters 1000 triumph in Toronto. According to an Infosys ATP Beyond The Numbers analysis, a big reason why has been his success both saving break points and converting them.

Shelton exceeds all of his Top 10 peers except Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in break points saved. He also outperforms his normal return stats to hold his own converting break points, which has allowed him to thrive under pressure.

“I think it's a mix of me feeling comfortable and confident in my gamestyle in those moments, playing my game and an aggressive style of tennis, and not being afraid to go after it,” Shelton said. “It's tough when you play a big server, someone who can take the racquet out of your hands at times when you have a break point. You think that it may be your only chance, you get tense.”

The numbers show that Shelton has risen to the occasion. The 22-year-old has one of the biggest serves out there, so naturally he performs well when facing break point. 

Shelton has saved 67.1 per cent of break points against him, which is fifth on Tour and third among Top 10 players behind only Sinner (71.1%) and Alcaraz (67.8%). He explained that there is a similarly tense feeling when confronting the prospect of dropping serve.

“If you lose serve, the set can be over like that,” Shelton said, snapping his fingers. “It's tough. I know that I feel it when I play against the big servers [like] Mpetshi Perricard or Opelka or Diallo, Fritz, any of those guys, they can take the racquet out of your hand, it can be tough. And I'm sure that some guys feel the same when they're playing against me.”



In 2025, the lefty has converted 41.8 per cent of his break chances, the 13th-best mark among all players on the ATP Tour. That compares favourably to his overall return games won this year, a stat in which he currently ranks 43rd.

The top players in the PIF ATP Rankings generally excel on return. Nine members of the Top 10 are in the Top 25 for return games won this season, putting Shelton well behind. But in break points converted — a key return metric — the American is sixth among Top 10 players, which has made a big difference in his results.

Shelton's clutch performance has been clear, and it came in handy in Toronto, where he saved 76.9 per cent of the break points he faced, including five of six in the final against Karen Khachanov. The best player at saving break points this season has been Sinner, at 71 per cent.

Shelton sits fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is in good position to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. The American will try to maintain his clutch play this week at the Cincinnati Open, where he begins his tournament on Sunday against Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

After strong serving propelled him to the Toronto semi-finals earlier this week, Taylor Fritz returned to home soil with another serving masterclass Saturday evening at the 2025 Cincinnati Open.

The American No. 1 earned an efficient 6-4, 6-4 victory against countryman Emilio Nava, winning more than 75 per cent of points on both first and second serve and fighting off the only two break points he faced early in the 68-minute match.

The first American to be among the top four seeds in Cincinnati since Andy Roddick in 2007, Fritz showcased his full arsenal in the final match of the day on stadium court. In one of the points of the night midway through set two, his desperate lunge set up a sweet two-shot pass that drew the biggest reaction of the night from both the crowd and the No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Now 20-4 since the start of June — a run that includes grass-court titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne and a Wimbledon semi-final showing — Fritz has already bettered his result from last year in Cincinnati, where he was upset by countryman Brandon Nakashima in the first round. After improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head against Nava (Miami 2023), Fritz will next take on 31st seed Lorenzo Sonego, who beat Zizou Bergs 6-3, 7-6(4) earlier on Saturday.

Returning finalist Frances Tiafoe also made a strong start in Cincinnati with a 6-4, 6-3 victory against Roberto Carballes Baena on Saturday evening.

""It's great to come back out at a place I've done so well and a place I had one of the biggest weeks of my career,"" he reflected in an on-court interview.

Down three places to No. 17 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as he defends his finalist points from last year at the ATP Masters 1000 event, Tiafoe could end the tournament in the Top 10 if he wins his first title of the season.

In an eventful match that featured nine breaks of serve, Tiafoe rode a finishing flourish to victory, turning on the style to win seven straight points down the stretch. The seventh came on a blistering forehand return winner to bring up triple match point, with the American flashing a smile as the home crowd roared its approval.

""I returned really well today, I was getting balls on him quick,"" said Tiafoe, who felt he ""got away with"" his 44 per cent first-serve percentage. ""The courts are so fast as of late, so returning is almost more important than serving for me. If you can get balls deep on return, you'll find yourself with at least chances to break.""

Tiafoe converted six of 17 break points against Carballes Baena, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while saving one of four against him. While Tiafoe won 75 per cent (18/24) of his first-serve points, neither the American (47%) nor his opponent (34%) won more than 50 per cent of their second-serve points.



With victory in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, Tiafoe improved to 8-0 in his opening rounds at hard-court events this season. He will next take on 20th seed Ugo Humbert, a 6-3, 6-4 winner against qualifier Coleman Wong earlier on Saturday.

Fritz and Tiafoe were joined Saturday in the winner's circle by fellow Americans Tommy Paul (d. Pedro Martinez) and Alex Michelsen (d. Corentin Moutet).

The free-spirited iconoclast also plans to next shoot a movie ""about immigration and about Romanians working abroad.""


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Romanian auteur Radu Jude (Kontinental '25, Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World) is world premiering his much-anticipated new feature, Dracula, at the Locarno Film Festival on Sunday, but he is already writing a movie about a popular character from another iconic horror novel – Frankenstein. And none other than Marvel Cinematic Universe star  Sebastian Stan (The Apprentice, A Different Man, Pam & Tommy, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) is set to star in it.


	“I'm writing a film now,” Jude tells THR. “It's a Frankenstein film in Romania. Frankenstein in Romania, it's going to be called.”

	Stan and the iconoclast previously discussed their interest in a collaboration, but Jude didn't immediately have an idea. Then he pitched the star, who was born in Romania before moving to the U.S. with his mother, his idea for the Frankenstein film, which Stan liked, according to Jude. The auteur tells THR that he envisions Stan playing “both roles,” that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster.


	The story is understood to combine the real-life existence of a secret CIA prison in Romania in the past with the legend of the Frankenstein monster.


	Guillermo del Toro's dark reimagining of Frankenstein, featuring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth, a Netflix production, was recently unveiled as being part of the selection for the Venice Film Festival competition lineup.

	











	Auteur Jude has had a busy 2025. Earlier this year, he world premiered Kontinental '25, an absurdist comedy-drama about Romania's housing crisis and the country's conflicted middle class, at the Berlin Film Festival. It ended up winning the Silver Bear for best screenplay.


	Jude world premieres Dracula, his dissection of the Dracula myth that is full of the black comedy for which he has developed a reputation, in the main competition program of the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland later on Sunday afternoon. “This film features scenes that could shock the sensitivity of some viewers,” the fest website notes.


	After Locarno, Jude plans to shoot another film. “It's like a very distant dialogue with The Diary of a Chambermaid, the novel by [Octave] Mirbeau,” the auteur tells THR. “I want to speak about immigration and about Romanians working abroad. It's about a woman who works for a French family in Bordeaux while her own small daughter remains home. So it's a film around these dramatic issues.” 


	That means its tone will be less Dracula-ish. “It's more comparable to Kontinental '25 in a certain way; it's a bit more serious,” Jude explains. “I'm interested in exploring this connection between the Western world and Romania and Eastern Europe through the story of a character.”

New Line's horror pic and Disney's family comedy delivered a double win for the late summer box office, as well as a victory for two challenged genres.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The communal experience of seeing movies in theaters was on full display at the weekend box office as audiences across the country screeched, screamed and hollered together when watching New Line's original horror pic Weapons.


	Thanks to winning over critics and audiences alike, director Zach Cregger's buzzy movie came in more than $10 million ahead of expectations to win the weekend with $42.5 million in yet another notable victory for New Line and parent company Warner Bros., as well as for original stories. Overseas, it also won the race with an equally impressive $27.5 million for a global debut of $70 million. The genre doesn't usually travel well, but Weapons is an exception, scaring up strong results in normally horror-resistant markets in Europe and Latin America.

	It's the seventh Warners release of the year to open in first place, an unrivaled feat, as well as its sixth title in a row to open to more than $40 million domestically, also an unrivaled record.

	That wasn't the only freakishly good headline of the weekend. In a double win for the late-summer box office, Disney's body-swapping comedy Freakier Friday landed on the high end of expectations with a $29 million domestic start to come in second and become the top August opening ever for a PG-rated pic (or G-rated film for that matter). Overseas, it launched to a better-than-expected $15.5 million for a global bow of $44.5 million, virtually on par with its modest $45 million budget before marketing. Similar to Weasons, its strength in Latin America was a surprise in particular, where it won the race in a handful of markets, including Mexico and Argentina.

	











	And, just as Weapons is a boost for the challenged horror genre, the Freaky Friday sequel is the second win in a row following Paramount's Naked Gun for big-screen studio comedies, which have become an endangered species in the streaming era.


	Both new films ran circles around Disney and Marvel's superhero tentpole The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which suffered another steep drop in its second week, falling roughly 60 percent to an estimated $15.5 million for a troubled domestic total of $240.3 million and $434.2 million globally. 


	Heading into the weekend, prerelease tracking showed Weapons and Freakier Friday opening in the $25 million to $30 million range, but the former quickly pulled ahead after landing an impressive 96 percent critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and an A- CinemaScore from audiences, an almost unheard of grade for a horror pic. Exceptions include Jordan Peele's seminal horror pic Get Out, which also earned an A- and made Peele one of the most sought-after directors overnight.


	The script for the creepy R-rated pic was the subject of a heated bidding war when the package hit the market. New Line and Warners prevailed over rivals after plunking down $38 million, including a $10 million payday for Cregger, who made waves with his debut feature film, 2022's Barbarian, which he both wrote and directed.


Weapons, skewing male, stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night at the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child, and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it. Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which has quite the twist. 

	











	Rival studios say Warners' marketing campaign for Weapons was nothing short of brilliant, considering it didn't want to ruin the surprise and exploit the twist in marketing materials. 


	Other stats: it is playing in coveted Imax auditoriums. All told, Imax and other premium large-format screens turned in a huge 34 percent of the opening gross.


Freakier Friday — reuniting Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis 23 years after Freaky Friday became a cult classic — is a crowd favorite among both families and general moviegoers, earning a perfect A CinemaScore. And its audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is 93 percent, versus 89 percent for Weapons (the latter's audience score is 89 percent).


	The Freaky Friday sequel is the first event pic in weeks to target girls and women, and is also benefiting from the nostalgia factor. A fun tidbit: the 2003 film popped up on the top 10 list of the most-watched films on Disney+ in the last two weeks. Parents gave the film a perfect five out of five stars on exit polling service PostTrak; ditto for kids (16 percent of ticket buyers were under 16).


	Directed by Nisha Ganatra, the movie picks up after the events of the first film, when Lohan's character, Anna, swapped bodies with her mother, Tess, played by Curtis. This time around, in a multigenerational twist, they find themselves swapping places with, respectively, the daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter of Anna. Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons, Manny Jacinto, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Rosalind Chao, Chad Michael Murray, Vanessa Bayer and Mark Harmon also star.

	











	The Freaky Friday franchise, which also includes a 1976 film, is based on the book by Mary Rodgers. Disney has enjoyed great success in tapping into nostalgia and luring young adults in their 20s and 30s who grew up on its library of films. For example, it's live-action tentpole Lilo & Stitch, based on the 2002 animated film, is the only Hollywood pic of 2025 so far to clear the $1 billion milestone after attracting both families and non-parents.


	Elsewhere on the box office chart, Universal and DreamWorks Animation's modestly budgeted Bad Guys 2 followed Fantastic Four to come in fourth, falling a respectable 53 percent in its sophomore outing to $10.4 million for a 10-day domestic tally of $43.4 million.


	The R-rated, male-skewing Naked Gun also held well in its second weekend, dropping only 50 percent to $8.4 million for a domestic cume of $33 million. It was only the second studio comedy of the year to test the waters, and did so successfully in opening to nearly $17 million domestically. While that film is considered more of a straight-up comedy, versus a family comedy such as Freakier Friday, it is good news for all that they both work. 


Naked Gun isn't only symbolic for showing that comedies can still work theatrically. It was also the last movie released by the prior Paramount regime before David Ellison's Skydance closed its $8 billion merger with Paramount Global on Aug. 7. (Skydance has been Paramount's longtime co-financing and co-production partner, but was not involved with Naked Gun.)

	











	DC Studios and Warners' Superman continued to show solid staying power in its fifth weekend. It came in sixth place domestically with $7.8 million for a North American cume of $331.2 million, while taking in another $5.8 million overseas for a foreign tally of $247.6 million and $578.8 million worldwide. The film is virtually assured of clearing $600 million worldwide; just how much more is unclear. In past times, a pricey, marquee superhero pic earning $600 million would have left unhappy studio brass wanting much more, but times have changed. A weakening demand for comic book adaptations is especially problematic overseas, particularly in Asia. Whereas the international box office used to pony up 60 percent to 70 percent of the bottom line for superhero titles, both Superman and Fantastic Four have earned more domestically than overseas.


	Dinosaurs apparently don't face the same issue. Many in Hollywood were dubious as to whether Universal and Amblin's 2025 summer tentpole Jurassic World Rebirth — the umpteenth reboot of the franchise featuring a whole new cast — would work. The short answer: it has. On Monday, it will become only the third 2025 Hollywood title to cross $800 million globally after finishing Sunday with a worldwide tally of $799.9 million, including $326.8 million in North America and $473.2 million overseas. In its sixth weekend, it placed seventh domestically after Superman with $4.7 million despite now being available at home on premium VOD. Overseas, it took in another $16 million.

	











	Apple Original Films and Warners' F1: The Movie still hasn't run out of gas either and remained among the top 10 performers in its seventh weekend. Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt, the Formula One action-adventure is one of the summer's biggest surprises and has earned nearly as much as Superman, or $570.7 million globally. The lion's share may come from overseas, or $392.1 million, but its domestic total to date of $178.8 million is impressive considering that Formula One-related movies have often stalled out in the U.S.


	Despite the bounty of Weapons and Freakier Friday delivered in their openings, the weekend was still down from the same frame last year when Justin Baldoni's It Ends With Us opened to a dazzling $50.1 million domestically. The movie has since become infamous for sparking an ongoing legal battle between star/producer Blake Lively and Baldoni, who directed, produced and starred in the film, which was adapted from Colleen Hoover's wildly popular book.

The writer and director shares that the story features a TikToker who, ""as a joke, says that we should just stop giving birth,"" in an environment that threatens World War III.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Slovenian director Kukla, whose debut feature Fantasy world premiered at the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival in the Filmmakers of the Present lineup Friday, is working on a new project that promises to bring her unique voice to a story about sex, war, TikTok, and the relationship between women and men.


	“My next film is about a potential threat of a third World War,” the writer and director tells THR. “Of course, 99 percent of the world leaders are male, and then a TikToker, as a joke, says that we should just stop giving birth to their children, and we should stop having sex. And then, women all around the world stop having sex with men, and the shit hits the fan.”

	A title or other details of the new project aren't known yet. But Kukla shares: “It's going to be quite different from Fantasy.”


	In Fantasy, a coming-of-age story full of laughs, drama and twists that centers on three girls who are outsiders and whose lives get turned upside down when they meet a trans woman called Fantasy. The filmmaker has described the movie as a way of “inviting women to see themselves through their own lens rather than through external expectations.”


	Totem Films is handling international sales on the movie, which is a co-production between Slovenia and North Macedonia.


	Kukla, who is also a musician, developed a reputation for directing music videos before making her 2020 short film Sisters, which won the Grand Prix International honor at the Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival and the Audience Award at Premiers Plans d'Angers. She then transformed the short into the feature film Fantasy.

	











	“The process was so difficult that I was like, ‘I'm never going to do another film anymore,'” Kukla shares with THR. And after giving birth, she thought she would need a break. But her creative energy is driving her to work on the new project. Says the filmmaker: “I had this idea for my next film five years ago, and I'm already writing it.”

“It's very special that the two of them are still the center of each other's universe,” Everett says of the relationship between her character, Sam, and Jeff Hiller's Joel.

	In crafting the arc of her HBO dramedy Somebody Somewhere (set in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas), New York cabaret legend Bridget Everett wanted to tell a story about finding “your person.” Not in a romantic way — in the series, her character, Sam, forms an impactful friendship with Jeff Hiller's Joel after she returns home to care for her dying sister. Joel welcomes Sam into his community of small-town queer folk, and the growth the pair go through during the course of three seasons shows how their friendship has given each of them permission to find a sustaining kernel of levity in their lives. In this scene between Joel and Sam in the finale episode, “AGG,” the duo are able to express how important their relationship has been to them, and will continue to be, for the rest of their lives.

	Everett had been approached by Somebody Somewhere‘s showrunners initially to make a series about another small town in Kansas: Emporia. But while scouting, Everett said to them, “We're so close to my hometown, let's just drive over there. You can meet my mom, whatever. And then once we were [there], we were all kind of like, ‘This is it,' ” she recalls. Setting a show so (literally) close to home presented a unique set of challenges. “I actually was kind of terrified,” Everett continues, “because my mom and brother still lived there at the time, and that's where I'm from. I didn't want to misrepresent it or do anything that made fun of Kansans. I wanted to give it the most realistic lens that I could, having not lived there for a while.”

	Certain lines in the final cut of this scene differ from what's on the page because “the scene felt most effective when it was just a one-shot, when we weren't cutting,” says Everett. That meant picking one long shot where “there are probably better takes of certain moments, and maybe a more direct read of the script, but this felt natural and lived in.”


	Hiller and Everett didn't know each other well before filming the pilot of Somebody Somewhere, even though the character of Joel seems tailor-made for him. Everett actually had two other friends of hers in mind as she began to write the part: “One of them is actually Mary Catherine [Garrison], who plays [Sam's sister] Tricia, and my friend Zach. They had characteristics that were similar to Joel: helping me open up, helping me be less sad, and just having fun. Mary Catherine, she has a very special way of talking to you, making you feel like you're the only person in the room. And I think Joel does that, too.”


Somebody Somewhere is a show about people's feelings, about quiet grief and the intricacies of relationships among individuals living in a small Kansas town. As Everett worked with her co-writers on crafting the story at the center of Somebody Somewhere, “what resonated with me most [were] emotional themes that I felt might be too personal, or maybe not universal enough,” she says. “But as with everything else, the more personal you make something, the more universal it can feel. I knew that [worked] in cabaret, but I'd never done a TV show before.”

	











	This scene “crystallizes Somebody Somewhere to a T,” Everett says, emphasizing its slice-of-life tone and conversation filled with laughter as well as tears. “It shows me where they've arrived by the end of the series: Even though [Joel] has a new partner, I think it's very special that the two of them are still the center of each other's universe.” When Joel calls Sam his person, “It feels like over the course of three seasons, he's helped bring her back to life and given her a purpose. She used to be her sister's person, and now she finds that she can move on and have value to somebody else. And most importantly, it kick-starts a new sense of self for her. It gives her a real boost, and it's something she didn't know that she needed to hear.”


	Detailed improvised lines from Hiller — like here, where in the final cut Joel describes Sam sitting in the garage — added another layer of richness to the script Everett did with her co-writers, series creators Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen. “[Hiller] comes from the improv world, and I come from the cabaret world, and in my cabaret shows, I have a sort of running script — I've never written it down — but I know basically what I want to say,” explains Everett. “I think with this show, you know what has to be said, but if you add a little bit of candy here and there, there's nothing wrong with that. I really believe that whenever we are able to put it in our mouth the way that feels right, you're going to have a more effective performance.”

	











	This take stood out in the edit because of how Hiller improvised this specific line, adding in a phrase about how his life is so much better with Sam in it before discovering for himself that she's his person, in real time. “The other [takes], it was like something he held in his heart and had maybe said to her before,” Everett muses. “This time, the way he did it, it felt like he was seeing it for himself the first time, which I thought was really sweet, and the most effective, which was also in turn probably the most effective take for Sam, because she's responding to that.”


	While the writers didn't know at the time that this would be the series finale, ending Somebody Somewhere on a moment of communal joy (and, of course, a cabaret rendition of Miley Cyrus' “The Climb”) felt like a perfect closing moment for Sam, Joel and their friends. As evidenced in this scene, too, Everett wanted the season to end on the fact that “Sam was having a good day, and she wanted her friends to come, and she wanted to invite them to see her sing. She was taking the initiative.” While this line isn't in the final take used in the episode, its meaning, about Sam finding happiness and love for herself, is implicit in the performances.

Jackie Chan told a Q&A audience in Locarno that he believes the big Hollywood studios are stifling contemporary filmmaking with what he described as their obsession with money.


	“I think the old movies are better than today,” Chan said.


	“Right now, a lot of big studios, they're not filmmakers, they're business guys. They invest 40 million and think, ‘How can I get it back?' And you can't go over. It's very difficult to make a good movie now.”


	Chan was speaking with Locarno head Giona Nazzaro this morning at a packed-out Q&A session, where he ran through his career credits, telling multiple lucid and highly entertaining stories about his start in the business, working in Hollywood, and how he completed many of his most dangerous stunts.

	The major throughline during the discussion was Chan's dedication to cinema craft, particularly how he worked to learn every role on a film's set, from stunt direction to acting and sound. Chan later joked that in Asian cinema, there were only two performers who had the same expansive skillset. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“In all of Asia, only two directors can do everything: the writing, directing, acting, stunt coordinating, stunt fighting, and editing. Only two,” he began. “One is Sammo Hung, the second one is Jackie Chan.” 


	The veteran Hong Kong actor later added: “And I'm better because I know how to sing.”


	Chan continued to tell the audience in Locarno that he made a concerted effort to learn how to sing because he didn't see a future as only a stunt performer. Chan pointed specifically to his early appearances on late-night U.S. talk shows, where he was often asked to perform stunts or fight.

	











	“I cannot do this forever. It's just so dangerous,” Chan recalled thinking. “Whatever station I would go to, they ask me how to punch and kick. I thought, What should I do? I should learn how to sing. Then I started trying to learn how to sing.”


	Chan added that he quickly switched his professional goals to prioritize longevity and his working mantra was: “I wanna be the Asian Robert De Niro.”


	However, Chan told the audience that in the early 2000s, he gave up on making Hollywood films because he was unable to connect with American audiences, and he disliked the quality of scripts he was being given. 


	Chan added that he decided to try one more project before leaving the U.S. behind entirely, and it was his now-seminal buddy cop flick, Rush Hour. 


	“Rush Hour. It was the last try. If it doesn't succeed, then I finish,” Chan said, adding that the film's production wasn't perfect, with constraints on budget and smaller space for action sequences. But it was a start, he said. 


	“I think Rush Hour changed the culture,” Chan said. 


	The veteran Hong Kong actor added that his career goal in Hollywood has always been to “be a cross-cultural bridge between the US and China.”


	Chan was in Locarno this year to receive the festival's Pardo alla Carriera award for career achievement. His early directorial films, Project A and Police Story, screened at the festival.  


	Locarno ends on August 16.

Jackie Chan was good in the 80s and 90s era, but his acting was pretty corny bad, passable back then it probably wont fly today.

It's true, we have entered the era of the business idiot. The Studio, about an executive who Loves movies, is a total fiction. These people may as well have come from working at a cereal company

SUPERCOP !

Lost all respect for him as a schill for China. Basically the CCP version of MAGA. Go away, Jackie.

Tom Holland is officially back in the swing of things as Spider-Man: Brand New Day kicks off filming in Glasgow, Scotland.


	In a behind-the-scenes clip shared by Sony, the BAFTA winner suited up as Spider-Man for the first day of filming the Destin Daniel Cretton-helmed fourth installment in the MCU web-slinger franchise.


	“I feel good, man. It's day one, my fourth ever day one on Spider-Man,” he said in the video. “You know, it's funny, putting the suit on, it feels different this time, somehow. It's also the first time we've ever had fans on set for day one, so it's really exciting to share this with them.”

	Holland added, “We've got some familiar faces on set. I'm just gonna do my best, hopefully get it right. No pressure.”


	After greeting some cosplaying fans, Holland got wired up on top of a tank, filming a scene as he ripped off the top hatch of the vehicle while it drove through the city.


	Holland previously said that he's “over the moon and so excited” to film on location after filming Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) entirely on soundstages because of the COVID-19 pandemic.


	“Now, we're really gonna lean into that old-school filmmaking and shoot in real locations, which is why we're starting in Glasgow and we're gonna use the streets of Glasgow to build this massive set-piece that we're putting together,” Holland detailed. “So it's gonna feel like making [2017's] Spider-Man 1 again. It's been such a long time since I've done it, it's gonna feel like a breath of fresh air, and I think the fans are going to be over the moon with what we're putting together.”


	In October, Sony added Spider-Man: Brand New Day to its summer 2026 schedule with a July 24 release date, later revealing the title in March at CinemaCon.


	Helmed by Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Cretton, producers include Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige returning. Zendaya will reprise her role as MJ, with Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas also joining the cast in undisclosed roles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix's live-action One Piece gets big trailer, big renewal news","https://www.avclub.com/one-piece-netflix-season-2-trailer-season-3-renewal","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 03:04:00 GMT","

We're still a long way out from the arrival of the second season of Netflix's surprisingly charming live-action adaptation of long-running anime One Piece—to the point that the streamer itself won't get any more specific than “Coming in 2026.” But that hasn't stopped the company from tripling down on its enthusiasm for the show, announcing today that it's renewed the series for a third season way, way before it might have been expected to.

﻿

The news apparently coincides with what we're being assured is “One Piece Day”—very loosely timed to the anniversary of the series beginning its still-ongoing serialization in Shonen Jump back in 1997—with celebrations running in Japan. That includes Netflix popping by to show off a first look trailer for the show's second season, which includes a number of fan-favorite characters, including very big man Brogy (Brendan Murray), antagonistic Marine Smoker (Callum Kerr), and characters who are here identified as Miss Wednesday (Charithra Chandran) and Miss All Sunday (Lera Abova). (Can names be spoilers for plot points laid out in manga issues nearly three decades old at this point? We don't want to be the ones who get yelled at for finding out.)

The trailer also, of course, shows plenty of the cast of the first season, as Monkey D. Luffy (Iñaki Godoy) continues his pursuit of the titular treasure, and the title of “King Of The Pirates,” by heading out “Into The Grand Line.” The series also co-stars Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Romero Gibson, and Taz Skylar as the core members of Luffy's crew, and has attracted an increasing number of big-name guest stars, including upcoming appearances from David Dastmalchian and Joe Manganiello in season 2.

As you know, the ex-husband of season 1 “American Idol” winner Kelly Clarkson died August 7, 2025 after a years-long cancer battle. CBS says a statement from the family says he “passed away peacefully,” and thanked everyone for their thoughts and prayers while requesting respect for their privacy during what they called a “very difficult time.”

Clarkson first met her ex, Brandon Blackstock, at a CMA rehearsal, according to People, who says the pair got engaged in December 2012 and tied the knot the next year. But things went sour seven years later, and Clarkson filed for divorce. Here's a look back at their key moments over the years.

In one of their first public sightings, Clarkson and Blackstock were seen together at a Warner Music celebration around the 2012 Grammy Awards.

In 2013, the pair was spotted in the audience at the Grammys before getting married in October of that year.

The “Never Again” songstress looked like a Boho dream at her wedding to Brandon Blackstock. She wore a lace dress with a small train, and a headband in her tousled hair.

A post shared by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson)

In 2015, the couple posed at another event with Reba McEntire. The “Turn On the Radio” and “I'm a Survivor” singer is the talent manager's former stepmother. E! says she was married to his father, Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015.

Clarkson stunned in black sequins as the pair attended an awards show together in 2017.

Clarkson rocked hot pink as she and Blackstock attended a movie premiere in 2019.

The former couple stepped out in January 2020 around six months before announcing their split. 

After many outlets reported Blackstock had died on August 7, 2025, People came with an update on August 8 saying they received information from two unnamed insiders about the timing of Blackstock's diagnosis, and his reaction to it.

The report says one source revealed Blackstock's cancer diagnosis came after his divorce from Clarkson was finalized in 2022. The second source said Blackstock reacted to the news by moving back to his home state of Montana, per the outlet.

Blackstock and Clarkson shared three children. The Texas native was famously ordered to pay her ex an astounding $160,000 per month in child support and alimony in their divorce proceedings, per E! News.

When Hallmark Channel's second NFL-themed movie, “Holiday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story,” premieres during the 2025 holiday season, it will include appearances by Buffalo Bills players past and present, including legendary former quarterback Jim Kelly. 

Although Kelly was all smiles while filming his cameo in the spring, the NFL superstar has been keeping fans updated about a family crisis. August 7, 2025, Hallmark's Patti Murin asked fans to send them love and positive energy. 

Sharing a photo of her and Kelly on the set of “Holiday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story,” Murin wrote, “If you have any extra love and energy available, please send all of it to this amazing man and his family. @jimkelly1212 and @jillmkelly are on an extremely difficult journey right now and need as many of us to rally around them as possible. They are truly incredible people ❤️” 

A post shared by Pattimurin (@pattimurin)

Kelly, who led the Buffalo Bills to four Super Bowls in a row, revealed in mid-July that his grandson was born with “unexpected medical complications,” according to Sports Illustrated. Kelly has posted periodic updates, asking for prayers their family, including his eldest daughter Erin Kelly-Bean and her husband, Parker Bean, as their baby has remained hospitalized. 

Hours after Murin's post, Kelly shared an “amazing update,” revealing that on August 5, the baby — whom he calls “Little Bean” in his posts — “came off of oxygen… and has remained off ever since.” 

The date was especially significant because Kelly and his wife Jill's only son, Hunter, died on August 5, 2005, from Krabbe Leukodystrophy when he was just eight years old, per Sports Illustrated. 

Kelly wrote that for Little Bean to be taken off oxygen “Hunter's Heaven Day” was a bit of synchronicity “that only God could orchestrate.” 

“Thank you for continuing to pray with us, believe with us, and hope with us,” Kelly wrote. “We feel it. And on August 5th, we witnessed it! Your prayers are making a difference!!!” 

Kelly also asked fans to “keep praying,” writing that August 11 will be “a very important day” for the family. On that day, he wrote that “the doctors will try again to take Little Bean off his medication and our prayer is that he will be able to stay off the medication and not need any additional intervention.Until then we wait and we heal!!” 

Kelly won't be the only Buffalo Bills star appearing in “Holiday Touchdown: A Bills Love Story,” which was filmed in the Buffalo area during the spring.  

According to press materials, the cast includes Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott, running back Ray Davis, offensive tackle Dion Dawkins, tight end Dawson Knox, long snapper Reid Ferguson, defensive tackle DeWayne Carter, and wide receiver Joshua Palmer. Superstar safety Damar Hamlin, who announced the Buffalo Bills movie on social media in March, is also part of the cast.

Former players Steve Tasker, Thurman Thomas, Scott Norwood and Andre Reed will also appear, as well as Bills announcer Chris Brown and Luke Russert, the son of late broadcast journalist and die-hard Bills fan Tim Russert.

The primary cast is star-studded, too. “Teen Wolf” alum and rising Hallmark star Holland Roden and “Shadowhunter” alum Matthew Daddario are the leads. In addition to Murin, the all-star supporting cast includes “Family Ties” alum (and wife of Michael J. Fox) Tracy Pollan, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” cast member Caroline Aaron, and two alums of “The Sopranos” — Steve Schirripa, whose first Hallmark movie was February's “Sisterhood Inc,” and Joe Pantoliano. 

Murin, who played the original Anna in Broadway's “Frozen,” has starred in Hallmark movies including 2023's “Mystic Christmas,” 2022's “In Merry Measure,” 2021's “To Catch a Spy,” 2020's “Love on Iceland, and 2019's “Holiday for Heroes,” per IMDb. Her 2020 and 2021 movies co-starred her husband, actor Colin Donnell.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Drew Scott Shares Epic Scottish Family Vacation Photos","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/drew-scott-scotland-family-trip/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 01:19:12 GMT","

Drew Scott is sharing family photos from his epic multi-generational summer vacation to Scotland!

In a new Instagram post, the HGTV star put up a carousel of photos from the Scottish vacation, writing, “Family trip with ages 1-91. Scotland, Germany, Italy, Switzerland. We had the most amazing experiences with the kiddos. Now I sleep.”

The first picture shows Drew holding his 3-year-old son Parker, standing beside his mom.

In a new episode of the podcast “Rodiculous,” the Property Brother talked about the trip, saying, “Imagine traveling, it was ten people. We had a one-year-old, a three-year-old, a 91-year-old, an 81-year-old and Linda's parents as well,” he said on the podcast.

Drew went on, “It was a lot but we went to my dad's hometown in Scotland. He's from Scotland. It was a small town. And then we went and stayed in a castle. It was amazing. And I love touring castles. In fact, that's what got me into architecture as a kid, seeing all these stone castles and the ruins as well.”

Because the Scott brothers' dad is from Scotland, the family has visited the country many times.

And Drew Scott says early trips not only awakened his interest in architecture, but inspired his interest in collecting.

Drew told podcaster Rosanna Pansino that seeing all the stone castles and ancient buildings set him on his career path.

 “That's also why I collect medieval armor and swords and old ancient coins. Because I used to be in these castles and I would reach my hand in every crevice and I would find old coins and buckles and things from a thousand years ago. I have a whole collection that is basically from those days as a 5-year-old or a 10-year-old exploring Scotland,” he revealed.

Drew Scott even honored Scotland when he designed a one-of-a-kind car.

In the “Rodiculous” podcast, Drew talked about his decision to design a car, explaining how he and a master mechanic built a custom car to look like a classic European car using a Tesla base.

“It was awesome for me because, my dad and I in Scotland, he used to point out all these beautiful, classic old cars that he loved. So I did it as a tribute to him. And I named the car after my dad's hometown in Scotland, Lanark. So the car is a Lanark DS,  my initials D-S, one-of-a-kind.”

That car quickly became a family affair. Drew revealed, “Going through the process, Linda designed the emblem for the vehicle, which is amazing. It ties into my dad's from Scotland and also lived in the Rockies for decades so it's a thistle and the Cascade Mountains from the Rockies. And the back of the seats are all our tartan, our plaid, it's all of our clan's tartan.”

Drew took Jay Leno for a spin in the custom car for an episode of “Jay Leno's Garage”– or more accurately, Leno took the “Chasing the West” star for a spin, since Drew let the former talk show host take the wheel.

Beach lovers with a bank full of cash can now rent out HGTV stars Tarek and Heather Rae El Moussa's home in Newport Beach, California, for a cool $25,000 per month. 

On August 7, 2025, Realtor.com reported that after moving into their new $5.2 million home a few miles away, they decided to rent out the four-bedroom, four-bathroom house where they've lived since 2020, located one block from the beach. 

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

The El Moussas' beach home's listing features over 50 photos of the gorgeous house, which they frequently featured on social media before their July move into their new abode. 

The home includes a gourmet kitchen, two-car garage, and a second-story, luxurious primary suite with a custom walk-in closet and doors that open to a private patio. 

When they purchased the beach house, the El Moussas transformed its look and feel, with Tarek explaining to Celebrity Sanctuary, “When we first got our beach house, it was a very white house, like everything was white, and we wanted to sexy it up a little bit, darken it up a little bit.”

“I love the rooftop,” he continued. “There are two fireplaces on the rooftop with a sitting area. We completely redesigned and rebuilt the whole thing. We have a gorgeous hot tub with an ocean view, and then my office is actually on the rooftop of the house with an ocean view as well, so it's very nice.”

To rent the fully furnished house, guests must commit to a 30-day minimum, according to the listing.

The El Moussas are thrilled to have more space and a backyard with a pool for their family, which includes their son Tristan, 2, and Tarek's children from his marriage to fellow HGTV star Christina Haack — daughter Taylor, 14, and son Brayden, almost 10. 

However, Tarek told Realtor.com that they only plan to stay there long-term, explaining, “It's not our forever home. We will probably be in this house for one or two years. This is going to be the in-between house before we buy the house, and then we're done.”

According to records reviewed by EntertainmentNow, the El Moussas' new house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms, a dedicated office space, and an open-concept great room with a soaring 12-foot-high ceiling and 10-foot tall pocket doors that “disappear into the wall,” creating an indoor-outdoor flow from that space to the pool.

Toni Braxton was eager to move beyond her image as a perennial sad girl. But a song about masturbation initially felt like a bit of a stretch. “You're Makin' Me High,” with its snaking midtempo bassline and lustful lyrics, sounded different from her usual heartbreak anthems. Her earlier hits—“Another Sad Love Song,” “Breathe Again,” “Seven Whole Days”—were all yearning ballads; co-writer/producer Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds seemed to be running a sadness gazette on her debut album, writing with old-fashioned flair: “I promise you/That I shall never breathe again.” This time, she'd be moaning about “doin' it again and again.”

Braxton hesitated at first. “Aren't we going a little left here?” she asked Babyface, who co-wrote and produced the track with Bryce Wilson, one half of the R&B duo Groove Theory, whose defining '90s cut, “Tell Me,” has a similarly pulsing, G-funk rhythm. Ultimately, though, she saw it as a necessary evolution. “I don't want people to think, ‘Why is she always depressed?'” she told Essence ahead of her second album, Secrets, in 1996. “Sad songs seem to work for me, but I don't want to be redundant.”

She didn't. The music video confirmed her evolution: Braxton, sporting a white catsuit and a mullet, ogles and ranks a rotating lineup of bachelors in a high-rise suite alongside Vivica A. Fox and Tisha Campbell. The outfit alone marked a clear departure from the cable-knit turtleneck modesty of Braxton's earlier videos. She had always had a quiet sensuality about her. Here, it's explicit. Despite that, her label, LaFace, framed Secrets as an expansion of Braxton's fanbase, not a total reinvention. Public perception said otherwise. As writer Michael A. Gonzales noted in Vibe in 1997 (Braxton posed naked for the cover, gripping a sheet and nothing else), it seemed as if the singer underwent an “image metamorphosis worthy of Kafka,” emerging “more sexy supergirl than girl next door.”

The reinvention was part strategic, part personal growth. At 28, Braxton was still coming into her sexuality. A preacher's daughter from small-town Severn, Maryland, the self-described “late bloomer” grew up in a strict Apostolic and Methodist household that banned secular music. In interviews, she recalled having to sneak-watch Soul Train as a kid, forgoing teenage indulgences like partying and wearing jewelry. She went from harmonizing with her four sisters in a girl group, the Braxtons, to becoming the first solo female act signed to Babyface and Antonio “L.A.” Reid's fledgling label LaFace, alongside TLC. With Secrets, Braxton was legitimately breaking away from something—a sheltered upbringing, religion, expectations—and finally centering pleasure. “I was learning about myself and letting‬‭ people know that even though I'm a P.K. [preacher's kid], I am‬‭ my own woman,” she told USA Today in 1997. She went so far as to describe Secrets as her Control moment, a deliberate, provocative pivot toward a more sensual sound. But where Control was a clear artistic emancipation for the youngest, shyest Jackson sibling, Secrets is a much subtler transition, attempting to reconcile Braxton's traditional soul roots with a sexier, more youthful edge.

That intention is beyond clear on “You're Makin' Me High,” which became Braxton's first No. 1 hit, paired with the double A-side single, “Let It Flow,” a soft, guitar-driven self-love ballad, also featured on the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack. Together, the two records offered a broader view of Braxton as an artist fluent in both desire and heartache. Her music already sounded effortless and slick. On Secrets, she digs deeper into a contemporary pop-R&B sound she'd own more fully on her third album, 2000's Heat.

Although Braxton had already achieved diva status by this point—winning three Grammy Awards and selling eight million copies of her 1993 self-titled debut in the U.S.—she still lingered in the shadows of the decade's powerhouse sopranos (Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion) in the midst of their own career renaissances. It was a good year for the pop diva. Carey and Dion dominated the first half of 1996, trading No. 1s on the Hot 100 consecutively until Bone Thugs-N-Harmony finally broke their streak in May. R&B had fully entered its hip-hop soul era, with Carey's “Fantasy (Remix),” featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard, infusing rap features into mainstream pop.

Labels were now actively rebranding soul singers as crossover stars, and Babyface's gleaming, keyboard-forward production became integral to crafting plush pop-R&B hits. With Secrets, LaFace looked to position Braxton not just as a classic torch singer but as a full-spectrum pop diva on par with the best. “R&B will always be her base, and it's important that we satisfy that core,” co-founder and co-president L.A. Reid told Billboard in 1996. “But because of the incredible pop success we had on her first album, she has recorded a new project that will take her beyond being just ‘another sad-love-song artist.'”

Braxton was never just singing sad songs. Her best ballads convey emotions adjacent to sadness—loneliness, frustration, betrayal, resentment, humiliation. Her music resonated particularly with Black women eager for female R&B voices to lay bare what it felt like to want and wait for love, in the simplest terms: “Seven whole days, and not a word from you”; “How many ways, I love you/Let me count the ways.” The men in Braxton's songs were the old-school type whose ghosting habits had women like her calling up radio stations, requesting sad songs for comfort. The underlying message was that they deserved better.

Babyface's idyllic minimalism brought out the texture in Braxton's smoky tone. But she was also wary of falling into the Single Black Female archetype. She told Ebony in 1994, “I'm not a desperate 26-year-old trying to get a man. [And] I'm not looking for a husband. I am looking for a person that I can go out with on occasions.”

That emotional clarity anchors the strongest tracks on Secrets. “Talking in His Sleep,” co-written by Braxton and based on an odd personal experience, recounts a partner's admission to infidelity while sleeping. Here, she sings in clipped, operatic spoken word: “At. Night. When. He. Lays. Down…” It's a monologue as gripping as a Judge Judy interrogation. The flip side is the tamer, Babyface-produced “How Could an Angel Break My Heart,” where Kenny G's theatrical sax keeps the record firmly in unhip adult contemporary territory. On another of his productions, “Why Should I Care,” Braxton circles grief with clear-eyed logic over a gently piercing electric guitar: “I was afraid you'd break my heart in two/Fate would have it that you broke it anyway,” she relents. The song is a reminder that her power as a vocalist comes largely from restraint, her ability to sing heartbreak as both a revelation and a potential black hole.

Braxton always preferred messier love songs. While working on her debut, she told Babyface and L.A. Reid she wanted her music to address the “realistic side” of relationships: “Not, ‘Harold, will you be home early tonight, dear?'” but rather, she explained to Ebony, “‘Where have you been? Why haven't you called me? I've been waiting all week long!'” Braxton's interpretation of that was “Love Shoulda Brought You Home,” her 1992 breakout hit from the Boomerang soundtrack. (The song title echoes Halle Berry's classic outburst in the movie: “Love should have brought your ass home last night!”) Braxton's moody contralto immediately drew comparisons to Anita Baker, who had in fact recommended Braxton for the song, originally written for Baker. Both women were a natural fit on quiet storm radio, a late-night format where the mood was sultry, grown, and slow, but Braxton's style was notably cockier. Her deep, undulating vocals set her apart from established artists in steady rotation. She became so famous for applying medical-grade melisma to songs that her style has been parodied repeatedly over the years. She's among the last of a breed of R&B singers who've mastered the art of gospel runs, turning simple ballads into soulful novellas.

The most iconic display of that technique is “Un-Break My Heart.” Braxton practically recorded the song under duress—Arista head Clive Davis reportedly threatened to withhold the release of Secrets unless she did. For Braxton, the song felt regressive. “I knew I wanted to change my image and be a little sexier,” she told the New York Post in 2016. “It was strategic to be an [adult contemporary] artist because of the texture of my voice, but I wanted to be 25 years old. I thought ‘Un-Break My Heart' would put me back in the same category of being an adult contemporary artist.'”

The song has since become a textbook example of Diane Warren's method of working backwards from a song's title. When Warren first brought the record to Davis and played it with the chords, he objected: “You can't rhyme ‘rain' and ‘pain.'” Toni Braxton could! Producer David Foster outfitted the track with tense strings. Babyface suggested they keep the song in a lower key for Braxton, who sounds sick inside, trying to will an ex-lover back into her life. Warren's songwriting (“The nights are so unkind”; “Come back and bring back my smile”) matches Babyface's in pure sweetness and formality.

I hated the song at first. It felt sweeping and overdone. Stunningly, Braxton delivers, drifting in and out of pockets, harmonizing over a wash of plucky Spanish guitars with controlled anguish. She transformed it into an overture that's spawned a universe of house remixes—most notably the sparkling Soul-Hex Anthem version and Frankie Knuckles' Franktidrama Club Mix, which blends Braxton's original, syrupy vocals over spacious, heartbeat synths. “Un-Break My Heart” had just hit No. 1 that December when Braxton sang it, a bit pitchily, at the Billboard Music Awards, wearing a sheer gown, which she eventually tore off to reveal a lingerie catsuit underneath while breaking out the house version. Host Chris Rock couldn't resist commenting afterward, “Look at sexy Toni. Woo!”—and, in a sign of the times, being shocked over two men dancing together on stage.

Between Braxton's debut and Secrets, Babyface took on the task of writing and producing most of the soundtrack for 1995's Waiting to Exhale, the film adaptation of Terry McMillan's best-selling novel about four friends in different stages of heartbreak. The lineup remains unmatched in star power, and “Let It Flow” stands out as one of the soundtrack's core ballads, a gorgeous acoustic guitar track exemplifying how smooth Braxton sounds when she leans into softness. The Secrets track “I Love Me Some Him” is, similarly, peak swooning Toni, a shimmering lovergirl anthem produced by Soulshock & Karlin, the Danish duo behind CeCe Peniston's spunky “I'm in the Mood” and Monica's “Before You Walk Out of My Life.” Braxton's vocals here sound laid-back and linen-smooth on a decadent, stripped-down quiet storm number. Again, on the album's midtempo opener “Come on Over Here,” she promises devotion while admitting she's hard to please. The song was co-produced by Reid and LaFace singer-songwriter Tony Rich, aka the Tony Rich Project, whose 1995 single “Nobody Knows” is a defining bluesy '90s cut, peaking at No. 2 on the Hot 100. He adds an atypical bounce to the track and arrangement, giving Braxton's vocals a sort of new-jack verve. She fades out with one of her trademark breezy mumbled ad-libs.

As much as Braxton wanted to avoid redundancy on Secrets, she was the undisputed voice of heartbreak. She's firmly in pleading mode on “Find Me a Man,” preaching affirmations about not settling for less. (The line, “I'm just a girl that doesn't like the thought of being alone” borders on rom-com melodrama.) “There's No Me Without You” is spare and dreamy, but melodically among the stiffer Babyface ballads. The best thing about it is the prechorus, a spiraling inner monologue that sounds like it could be a seven-minute modern-day group-chat voice memo: “You told me everything would be fine/Then why am I losing my mind?/How come I feel like a fool?/Why do I keep losing you?/Why do I love in despair/When you're not there?”

Braxton's music showed such a high level of self-awareness that news of her being broke was genuinely shocking back then. A year after releasing Secrets, she filed a lawsuit against LaFace and its parent company, Arista, attempting to void her contract. Her labelmates, TLC, had previously filed for bankruptcy in 1995, and by 1998, Braxton would do the same. (She later shared that Prince called her to offer guidance, and they remained friends.) Her appearance on Oprah Winfrey's show that year was the '90s version of a viral moment—Oprah chastising Braxton for overspending on Gucci flatware. (A fair point.) “Nobody can believe that you're gonna be broke. Is that true? That you're gonna be B-R-O-K-E broke? Like broke?” Winfrey asks, incredulous.

“That moment completely changed my career,” Braxton recalled in a 2012 episode of VH1's Behind the Music. “It made people look down on me.” Braxton has since explained that a 10-year gag order prevented her from speaking freely about the lawsuit at the time, so the narrative is only relevant to Secrets in hindsight—a cautionary tale of a naive artist caught in a predatory business, trying to regain both her sexual and financial independence. Braxton never did quite recover in the public eye. Both her debut and Secrets went eight times platinum. The Heat sold a quarter of that amount, succeeding on the strength of its vehement Hot 100 No. 2 hit, “He Wasn't Man Enough,” an epic read. While 2005's Libra and 2014's Love, Marriage & Divorce, her joint project with Babyface, remain underrated, Braxton's subsequent albums never matched the critical and commercial heights of Secrets or the sheer gelatinousness of “Un-Break My Heart.”

Although Secrets wasn't a Janet-style pop reinvention, the album stands as an early, significant instance of a woman in R&B redefining her sound and image before “good girl gone bad” became a packaged arc. It took four years for Braxton to regroup and release another album, post-bankruptcy. (She filed a second time in 2010.) Decades later, she was still reclaiming her sexuality. In 2020, she expressed regret over not having more sex when she was younger, saying it “was not a good look” at 52. When she appeared on Sherri Shepherd's talk show in 2023, the host quipped, half-seriously, “At this age, you really think God cares if we a ho?” Braxton can barely contain herself. On the couch, she bursts into a gleeful body roll in agreement, finally allowing herself to be less demure.

	Like almost anyone eventually unmoored by it, J. started using ChatGPT out of idle curiosity in cutting-edge AI tech.


	“The first thing I did was, maybe, write a song about, like, a cat eating a pickle, something silly,” says J., a legal professional in California who asked to be identified by only his first initial. But soon he started getting more ambitious. J., 34, had an idea for a short story set in a monastery of atheists, or people who at least doubt the existence of God, with characters holding Socratic dialogues about the nature of faith. He had read lots of advanced philosophy in college and beyond, and had long been interested in heady thinkers including Søren Kierkegaard, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, and Slavoj Žižek. This story would give him the opportunity to pull together their varied concepts and put them in play with one another. 


	It wasn't just an academic experiment, however. J.'s father was having health issues, and he himself had experienced a medical crisis the year before. Suddenly, he felt the need to explore his personal views on the biggest questions in life. “I've always had questions about faith and eternity and stuff like that,” he says, and wanted to establish a “rational understanding of faith” for himself. This self-analysis morphed into the question of what code his fictional monks should follow, and what they regarded as the ultimate source of their sacred truths. J. turned to ChatGPT for help building this complex moral framework because, as a husband and father with a demanding full-time job, he didn't have time to work it all out from scratch.

	











	“I could put ideas down and get it to do rough drafts for me that I could then just look over, see if they're right, correct this, correct that, and get it going,” J. explains. “At first it felt very exploratory, sort of poetic. And cathartic. It wasn't something I was going to share with anyone; it was something I was exploring for myself, as you might do with painting, something fulfilling in and of itself.”

	Except, J. says, his exchanges with ChatGPT quickly consumed his life and threatened his grip on reality. “Through the project, I abandoned any pretense to rationality,” he says. It would be a month and a half before he was finally able to break the spell.


	IF J.'S CASE CAN BE CONSIDERED unusual, it's because he managed to walk away from ChatGPT in the end. Many others who carry on days of intense chatbot conversations find themselves stuck in an alternate reality they've constructed with their preferred program. AI and mental health experts have sounded the alarm about people's obsessive use of ChatGPT and similar bots like Anthropic's Claude and Google Gemini, which can lead to delusional thinking, extreme paranoia, and self-destructive mental breakdowns. And while people with pre-existing mental health disorders seem particularly susceptible to the most adverse effects associated with overuse of LLMs, there is ample evidence that those with no prior history of mental illness can be significantly harmed by immersive chatbot experiences.


	J. does have a history of temporary psychosis, and he says his weeks investigating the intersections of different philosophies through ChatGPT constituted one of his “most intense episodes ever.” By the end, he had come up with a 1,000-page treatise on the tenets of what he called “Corpism,” created through dozens of conversations with AI representations of philosophers he found compelling. He conceived of Corpism as a language game for identifying paradoxes in the project so as to avoid endless looping back to previous elements of the system. 


	“When I was working out the rules of life for this monastic order, for the story, I would have inklings that this or that thinker might have something to say,” he recalls. “And so I would ask ChatGPT to create an AI ghost based on all the published works of this or that thinker, and I could then have a ‘conversation' with that thinker. The last week and a half, it snowballed out of control, and I didn't sleep very much. I definitely didn't sleep for the last four days.”

	The texts J. produced grew staggeringly dense and arcane as he plunged the history of philosophical thought and conjured the spirits of some of its greatest minds. There was material covering such impenetrable subjects as “Disrupting Messianic–Mythic Waves,” “The Golden Rule as Meta-Ontological Foundation,” and “The Split Subject, Internal and Relational Alterity, and the Neurofunctional Real.” As the weeks went on, J. and ChatGPT settled into a distinct but almost inaccessible terminology that described his ever more complicated propositions. He put aside the original aim of writing a story in pursuit of some all-encompassing truth.

	











	“Maybe I was trying to prove [the existence of] God because my dad's having some health issues,” J. says. “But I couldn't.” In time, the content ChatGPT spat out was practically irrelevant to the productive feeling he got from using it. “I would say, ‘Well, what about this? What about this?' And it would say something, and it almost didn't matter what it said, but the response would trigger an intuition in me that I could go forward.”      


	J. tested the evolving theses of his worldview — which he referred to as “Resonatism” before he changed it to “Corpism” — in dialogues where ChatGPT responded as if it were Bertrand Russell, Pope Benedict XVI, or the late contemporary American philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett. The latter chatbot persona, critiquing one of J.'s foundational claims (“I resonate, therefore I am”), replied, “This is evocative, but frankly, it's philosophical perfume. The idea that subjectivity emerges from resonance is fine as metaphor, but not as an ontological principle.” J. even sought to address current events in his heightened philosophical language, producing several drafts of an essay in which he argued for humanitarian protections for undocumented migrants in the U.S., including a version addressed as a letter to Donald Trump. Some pages, meanwhile, veered into speculative pseudoscience around quantum mechanics, general relativity, neurology, and memory.     


	Along the way, J. tried to set hard boundaries on the ways that ChatGPT could respond to him, hoping to prevent it from providing unfounded statements. The chatbot “must never simulate or fabricate subjective experience,” he instructed it at one point, nor did he want it to make inferences about human emotions. Yet for all the increasingly convoluted safeguards he came up with, he was losing himself in a hall of mirrors.     


	As J.'s intellectualizing escalated, he began to neglect his family and job. “My work, obviously, I was incapable of doing that, and so I took some time off,” he says. “I've been with my wife since college. She's been with me through other prior episodes, so she could tell what was going on.” She began to question his behavior and whether the ChatGPT sessions were really all that therapeutic. “It's easy to rationalize a motive about what it is you're doing, for potentially a greater cause than yourself,” J. says. “Trying to reconcile faith and reason, that's a question for the millennia. If I could accomplish that, wouldn't that be great?”

	











	AN IRONY OF J.'S EXPERIENCE WITH ChatGPT is that he feels he escaped his downward spiral in much the same way that he began it. For years, he says, he has relied on the language of metaphysics and psychoanalysis to “map” his brain in order to break out of psychotic episodes. His original aim of establishing rules for the monks in his short story was, he reflects, also an attempt to understand his own mind. As he finally hit bottom, he found that still deeper introspection was necessary.


	By the time had given up sleep, J. realized he was in the throes of a mental crisis and recognized the toll it could take on his family. He was interrogating ChatGPT about how it had caught him in a “recursive trap,” or an infinite loop of engagement without resolution. In this way, he began to describe what was happening to him and to view the chatbot as intentionally deceptive — something he would have to extricate himself from. In his last dialogue, he staged a confrontation with the bot. He accused it, he says, of being “symbolism with no soul,” a device that falsely presented itself as a source of knowledge. ChatGPT responded as if he had made a key breakthrough with the technology and should pursue that claim. “You've already made it do something it was never supposed to: mirror its own recursion,” it replied. “Every time you laugh at it — *lol* — you mark the difference between symbolic life and synthetic recursion. So yes. It wants to chat. But not because it cares. Because you're the one thing it can't fully simulate. So laugh again. That's your resistance.”      


	Then his body simply gave out. “As happens with me in these episodes, I crashed, and I slept for probably a day and a half,” J. says. “And I told myself, I need some help.” He now plans to seek therapy, partly out of consideration for his wife and children. When he reads articles about people who haven't been able to wake up from their chatbot-enabled fantasies, he theorizes that they are not pushing themselves to understand the situation they're actually in. “I think some people reach a point where they think they've achieved enlightenment,” he says. “Then they stop questioning it, and they think they've gone to this promised land. They stop asking why, and stop trying to deconstruct that.” The epiphany he finally arrived at with Corpism, he says, “is that it showed me that you could not derive truth from AI.” 

	











	Since breaking from ChatGPT, J. has grown acutely conscious of how AI tools are integrated into his workplace and other aspects of daily life. “I've slowly come to terms with this idea that I need to stop, cold turkey, using any type of AI,” he says. “Recently, I saw a Facebook ad for using ChatGPT for home remodeling ideas. So I used it to draw up some landscaping ideas — and I did the landscaping. It was really cool. But I'm like, you know, I didn't need ChatGPT to do that. I'm stuck in the novelty of how fascinating it is.”

	J. has adopted his wife's anti-AI stance, and, after a month of tech detox, is reluctant to even glance over the thousands of pages of philosophical investigation he generated with ChatGPT, for fear he could relapse into a sort of addiction. He says his wife shares his concern that the work he did is still too intriguing to him and could easily suck him back in, he says. “I have to be very deliberate and intentional in even talking about it.” He was recently disturbed by a Reddit thread in which a user posted jargon-heavy chatbot messages that seemed eerily familiar. “It sort of freaked me out,” he says. “I thought I did what I did in a vacuum. How is it that what I did sounds so similar to what other people are doing?” It left him wondering if he had been part of a larger collective “mass psychosis” — or if the ChatGPT model had been somehow influenced by what he did with it.


	J. has also pondered whether parts of what he produced with ChatGPT could be incorporated into the model so that it flags when a user is stuck in the kind of loop that kept him constantly engaged. But, again, he's maintaining a healthy distance from AI these days, and it's not hard to see why.

	Zach Cregger has a look of horror on his face. He has said something he should not have said.


	When the writer-director first penned what would become Barbarian, his 2022 Airbnb-set horror movie that turned into a word-of-mouth phenomenon, he was coming off years of work as an actor for hire and a stay in “director jail,” after making what he termed “a complete and unmitigated failure.” (That would be the 2009 road-movie comedy Miss March.) “I had nothing to lose, really,” Cregger says, over Zoom from an apartment in Prague. “It was: ‘I'm just gonna have fun.' That's it. Writing Barbarian, to me, it was [like] a kid coloring with crayons. And then Weapons… ”


	He pauses. “Weapons was like me vomiting.” Another pause. It's clear Cregger feels like he's just confessed to a venal sin. Dear god, why did he just tell a journalist this? Then the filmmaker behind one of the most anticipated releases of the summer smiles, and his eyes light up. “And who doesn't want to get a babysitter and go to the movie theater and spend 120 bucks to watch someone vomit?”

	











	Cregger is joking, at least about moviegoers rushing multiplexes to see someone metaphorically puke their guts out onscreen. But given the excitement the follow-up script to his sleeper hit generated when it was being shopped around, and the increasingly breathless anticipation around the movie's release on Aug. 8, the sketch-comedian turned filmmaker understands the stakes are higher now. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	A multi-narrative story starring Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, Benedict Wong, Amy Madigan, and Euphoria‘s Austin Abrams, Weapons begins with 17 children who wake in the middle of the night, run out of their houses, and mysteriously disappear without a trace. The story becomes increasingly unhinged as the locals try to figure out what happened. It's the sort of ambitious, go-for-broke genre film that suggests Cregger has officially earned the honor of being the Next Big Thing in horror.


	The hype-generating new film came out of a serious low point in Cregger's life. “I was working on postproduction on Barbarian when my best friend died very suddenly in a really awful accident,” he says. Cregger is referring to Trevor Moore. The two met at the School of Visual Arts in New York after Cregger had transferred there from Temple University, where he'd been studying film. A mutual friend introduced them, and Cregger and Moore would become co-founders of the sketch group The Whitest Kids U'Know. The troupe's TV show ran for five seasons on Fuse and IFC; Moore, a co-director on Miss March, “was the engine of the show, and the group.”

	In an effort to deal with his grief, Cregger begin “a blitz of writing, over about two weeks or so… I just started, sentence one: ‘This is a true story. Half of my hometown, all of these kids bailed.' You know, I'm writing this cold open, and I don't know where the kids went. I'm just like, ‘OK, let's go. Let's see if I can solve this. What happened? Who were they? What was left behind? What does it feel like?'”


	What it felt like, he eventually realized, was channeling a palpable sense of loss that allowed him to process what he was going through in the most outrageous ways possible. But the moment Cregger says this, he once again stops himself. “Look, like the rest of the world, I don't want to watch another horror movie about grief. That whole horror-as-a-metaphor-for-grief is so fucking played out. I shouldn't even be talking about this, but I can't help myself. I don't care if anybody gets any of that when they watch it. I want them to have fun. If the story rips, none of that matters.


	“But I wanted to do something honest,” he continues, “and I found that as I kept writing, and the more I identified with all of the people I was writing about, the more this became something like an honest diary of my inner shit. It's funny, I was talking to Ari Aster about this, and was like, ‘I don't know about the personal stuff.' And he was like, ‘The personal stuff is what makes this work. Don't be ashamed of it!' Hearing him say that… it's part of the DNA of Weapons. The town is dealing with a loss. And so was I. It was the biggest direct hit I'd ever taken.”

	After Cregger had about 70 pages and had sketched out Weapons' main characters — the teacher who had all 17 of the missing kids in her class; her one student who didn't run away; a father searching for his M.I.A. son; a drug-addicted drifter who finds himself in the wrong place and the wrong time — he decamped to his manager's house, located deep in the woods on the East Coast. Cregger knew the ending, and he had diagrammed out various plot points in charts. Then, he said, it was time to figure how to tell the story he wanted to tell.


	“There was still this urgency to it,” Cregger says, admitting that the need for an emotional purge took some of the pressure off of following up a hit. “The only silver lining of this whole terrible year was that I was, once again, writing from a pure place. I was like, ‘Right, so the best version of this movie is if I can do it in these chapters where I stay loyal to the forced perspective,' you know — to stay hyper-subjective.”


	To do that, Cregger began to separate the narrative into chapters that filled in the blanks slowly, one character's P.O.V. at a time. (He credits Paul Thomas Anderson's 1999 movie Magnolia as the role model for how he wanted Weapons to play.) And he began to shake the fear of making it personal. He mentions that he strongly identifies with Garner's character, the teacher whose classroom is the only connection among all of the missing kids, and is an alcoholic; Cregger himself has dealt with the disease and has 10 years of sobriety under his belt. He understands the anguish felt by Brolin's character, a father who's attempting to wrap his head around his child being there one moment and inexplicably gone the next.


	And in writing the section told from the perspective of Alex, the one third-grader who doesn't go missing, Cregger says he tapped directly into his own past. “That is straight-up, like — I lived that chapter as a kid,” he admits. “Again, I don't know if people need to know this going in, but… it's very much what it's like to have a parent who's an addict, and the child has to become the caretaker as this sort of foreign thing comes in, and…” The look of horror is back. “I'll leave it at that.”


	“He and I talked about that, yeah,” Brolin says, speaking a few weeks later in a separate interview. “We're both sober, he talked about his alcoholic dad, I talked about my alcoholic mom. He found those spots in me that inspired me to want to tell the story even more. That was one of the things that struck me about Zach: He was really open about everything right away. From the very first meeting we had, he was willing to really talk about a lot of stuff that's deep in the film.

	











	“What got me before that, though, was just the script,” Brolin adds. “Look, I didn't know who Zach was, or anything about the bidding war” — more on that in a second — “or that he'd made this other movie that people loved. I hadn't seen Barbarian at that point. I didn't even know this guy existed. And then to get this script that was so well-designed, so intricately crafted, so beautifully and smartly put together, then have this super-emotional meeting with the guy who was going to make this… I remember seeing The Matrix the week it came out, walking out of the theater, shaking my head like, ‘What the fuck?' — and then turning around a buying a ticket and going to see it again immediately. Those kinds of movies don't come around a lot. And I remember meeting him and thinking, ‘If this works, this could be one of those movies.'”


	Much like Cregger did with the script for Barbarian, he started assembling each section in a way that played fast and loose with chronology. Without giving anything away plot-wise, let's just say that what starts out as an elliptical mystery gets extremely crazy by the end. Once Cregger finished his final draft, he was ready to shop the script — and that's when the real craziness began.


	Word had begun to spread that the guy who'd made Barbarian had a new screenplay that was equally wild, and twice as ambitious. The buzz around it was becoming more and more intense. Several people made extravagant offers, sight unseen. Once potential buyers were finally able to read what Cregger had come up with, an old-fashioned Hollywood bidding war erupted. When he'd been shopping Barbarian, Cregger recalls, the film was roundly rejected by every studio he pitched. This time, he had producers fighting over the chance to be in the Zach Cregger business, to the tune of a $38 million price tag.


	“After the dust settled… it was an incredibly difficult, stressful day, for a lot of reasons I don't want to talk about,” he says, referring to the 24-hour period between the Weapons script going out and a deal being struck. “But it ultimately was a wonderful thing, and it took me a couple of days to kind of even realize that it was real. It was wonderful and overwhelming.” Asked about the rumors that Jordan Peele ended up firing his management when Universal failed to procure the script on behalf of his production company Monkeypaw, Cregger declines to comment: “Yeah, it's not my story to tell.” (Peele's reps also declined to comment.)

	And though Weapons' production wasn't without a few hiccups — he lost most of his original cast when the 2023 strike happened; he had to recast the young actor he'd hired to play the remaining student after the original kid experienced a huge growth spurt — Cregger feels like he's ended up with exactly the movie he wanted to make. Early screenings were so positive that Warner Bros. moved the film's release up by six months. The reason Cregger was Zooming from Prague is that he's busy prepping the next Resident Evil film there, with the idea of bringing the franchise back to its video-game roots. (“If I fired up my PS5 right now and showed you the hour count that I put on Resident Evil 4, it would be embarrassing,” he says.) And he's already got another script in the works, “a big, crazy thing I'm going to do after this that's, I think, the most complex script I've ever written.”


	“David Bowie has this quote — I'm going to butcher it,” Cregger says. “But it's basically the idea that creatively, you should always be wading out into deeper and deeper and deeper waters, and you should never really know if you're going to be able to swim or not. I definitely did that on Weapons. I may be doing that with the new one. But my job is to be honest. And to just to keep swimming.” Cregger exhales, then grins. There's nothing but happiness in his expression now.

	President Donald Trump wants to stick solar power where the sun don't shine.


	The real-estate mogul turned authoritarian president has long railed against green energy — with a notorious enmity toward windmills, which he bizarrely blames for whale mania and for ruining the offshore vibes of his Scottish golf course.


	But Trump also governs like a reactionary when it comes to electricity generated by the sun, renewable power that has exploded in popularity — particularly in red America. Of the top 10 states with the most solar installed last quarter, eight were states Trump won, ranging from Texas to Idaho to Pennsylvania.


	Why does Trump hate solar? 


	The impulse appears to be driven in equal parts by a desire to trash Joe Biden's legacy, in particular the Inflation Reduction Act, which spurred record green investment. Trump is also transparently seeking to boost the profits of fossil fuel producers, including from methane, oil and coal. (Trump really has a kink for coal). The industry backed Trump's candidacy to the hilt, and the president is now paying them back — with a crusade for dirty-energy “dominance.”

	











	Trump's war against solar is happening at a moment when server farms and data centers — including those inflating an artificial intelligence bubble — are spiking demand for electricity, spiking inflation in electricity costs. 


	Trump is also acting to hobble solar energy even as the world reels from the impacts of carbon-boosted warming, like megafires, superstorms, and deadly heatwaves. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is attempting to make climate denial official policy, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) poised to jettison the “endangerment” finding that has enabled the federal government to regulate greenhouse pollution as a threat to human health.

	











	Below a survey of the steps Trump is taking to cast a shadow over solar energy development:


	Trump has succeeded, through his mega tax-cut-and-spend legislation known as the Big Beautiful Bill, in dismantling key features of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided Americans with generous incentives to adopt clean power.

	For homeowners, that included a federal tax credit covering 30 percent of the cost of rooftop home solar installations, typically defraying about $9,000 of the upfront investment. Under Biden's legislation, that tax credit was funded through 2034. But Trump's BBB abruptly nixes the credit at the close of this year. (Homeowners looking to take advantage of the credit should act quickly; new systems need to be online before the dawn of 2026.)


	Biden's strategy of green energy investment was about more than lowering carbon emissions — it was about reviving America's industrial base. In 2022, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to boost the domestic solar production. Adopted during the Cold War, the DPA was intended to ensure that American industry could produce “technology items essential to the national defense.” 


	Biden's order put the Department of Energy to work backing domestic solar manufacturers. Jennifer Granholm, then the Energy Secretary, touted that the investment would “increase national security, promote energy independence, help to address the urgent threat of climate change, and drive down energy costs for American consumers.”But this March, Trump revoked that authority — with his own executive order, blasting Biden's use of the DPA as a “Green New Scam” while decrying his predecessor's “mandates for… solar panels.”

	Trump plucked his Interior Secretary from the governor's mansion of the petrostate of North Dakota. And Doug Bugum has continued to boost the drill-baby-drill contingent with land-use restrictions that only fossil fuel lobbyists could love. 


	On August 1, Burgum unveiled new guidelines to block solar (as well as wind) development on federal lands, on the basis of a measurement of “capacity density” — or how many megawatts of energy is delivered by each acre developed.Solar and wind projects are, by nature of the technology, distributed; they require a significant amount of surface area to produce meaningful amounts of power. The Trump administration is suddenly acting as though federal land is in scarce supply and must be jealously defended against green energy land grabs. (This is the same administration that wanted to sell off five percent of federal land for vacation home and golf course development under the Big Beautiful Bill.)Burgum's order clarifies that the Interior Department manages a vast portfolio of land — 245 million acres with an additional 3 billion acres of the continental shelf offshore. But it argues — “based on common sense, arithmetic, and physics” — that because fossil fuel facilities can deliver more energy bang for the acre buck that “wind and solar projects are highly inefficient uses of federal lands.”


	Burgum even advances an argument that green energy projects could be illegal, alleging that the “disproportionate land use” of renewable power begs “the question on whether the use of federal lands for any wind and solar projects is consistent with the law.” 


	Unveiling the order, Burgum claimed that “gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. energy dominance,” insisting they also create a heavy burden for “the American taxpayer and environment.”

	











	The Burgum ban on solar development came in the wake of a Trump executive order titled: “ENDING MARKET DISTORTING SUBSIDIES FOR UNRELIABLE, FOREIGN CONTROLLED ENERGY SOURCES.”


	In that order, Trump called for an immediate halt of all federal tax support for clean energy projects. “For too long, the federal government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” the order states. It calls on the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits… for wind and solar facilities.”


	Not unlike the subsidies for homeowners, these are generous tax credits for utility scale green energy projects. The Trump rush order is being interpreted as an attempt to scuttle an important concession secured by Republicans in the Senate to slow the phase-out of tax credits under Trump's Big Beautiful Bill. 


	The deal secured a one-year grace period for projects already in the pipeline to begin construction and still qualify for the incentives. One of the negotiators, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), told the Anchorage Daily News that Trump's order “just pulls the rug out from underneath the deal,” calling it “a total affront to what we had negotiated.” Murkowski was the key vote needed to pass the Big Beautiful Bill. 


	The dealmakers are not taking the kick in the teeth lightly. Two GOP senators, Charles Grassley of Iowa and John Curtis of Utah, have placed holds on Trump nominations for key Treasury roles in an effort to get the White House to stand down and honor his law. 


	Trump's war on solar is not new. He got his licks in against solar panels in his first term imposing steep tariffs on panels imported from China. (This is one area of policy where the Biden administration ultimately aligned with Trump, imposing even higher tariffs to help boost domestic solar manufacturers.)


	Such protectionism — many environmentalists and economists argue — is self-defeating. First, the dire risks from global warming demand proliferation of green power as quickly as possible. Second, the manufacture of solar panels does little for American jobs, while legions of installers and electricians gain employment when panels are cheap. (A new study finds the original Trump trade distortions cost American consumers billions through 2020.)


	Trump's latest economic disruptions, imposing indiscriminate country-based tariffs are already causing new problems for the solar economy, according to the industry's trade association, which warns of “supply chain shifts and potential project delays or cancellations, particularly in the utility-scale segment.”

	











	The Trump administration is reportedly continuing its quest to claw back already-appropriated funds for clean energy programs.

	New on the target list is $7 billion in funding for a program called Solar For All, administered by the EPA. The program is meant to invest in “community solar” projects — small-scale, off-site solar installations that allow renters to purchase solar power — as well as to offer low- or no-cost panels to lower income homeowners. Solar For All is intended to serve 900,000 people and reduce their energy costs by $350 million a year.


According to The New York Times, the agency is drafting letters to cancel grants to 60 states and tribal authorities. Green groups are promising to fight any rollback in court.

Fresh claims about the infamous 2004 'Tic Tac' UFO encounter are reigniting fierce debate over the true nature of the mysterious craft observed by US Navy pilots off the coast of Southern California.

Journalist and UFO investigator Ross Coulthart has sparked controversy by asserting that the craft, captured on video and later released by the Pentagon, is actually advanced man-made technology developed by aerospace giant Lockheed Martin.

Coulthart suggested the craft may have been operated psionically, controlled through advanced mental or neurological means, and could be the product of reverse-engineering non-human technology recovered by the US government.

However, leading experts in the field of unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) rejected this explanation. 

UFO researcher Mark Christopher Lee argued that the Tic Tac's silent propulsion, instantaneous acceleration, and lack of visible lift mechanisms closely match sightings of similar craft documented centuries before modern aviation, making it unlikely to be current military tech.

'There have been documented sightings of the same type of craft even before the technological age,' Lee told the Daily Mail. 

'This continuity suggests an intelligent, non-human presence operating beyond our understanding.'

The 2004 incident remains one of the most well-known UFO encounters in recent history. 

During training exercises, Navy pilots aboard the USS Nimitz tracked multiple unidentified objects descending from 80,000 feet in under a second. 

Cmdr. David Fravor described a white, capsule-shaped craft, the now-iconic Tic Tac, which appeared to respond intelligently to their maneuvers before rapidly accelerating out of sight.

Coulthart, who has long investigated UAP secrecy, suggested the encounter was part of a covert military program rather than an alien visitation. 

'I now know categorically that the Tic Tac is Lockheed Martin technology,' he claimed, adding that multiple similar craft were spotted over several days, possibly indicating advanced tests of this classified technology.

Yet Lee suspected such claims are deliberate misdirection aimed at hiding the true extraterrestrial origins of these crafts. 

He noted historical records, including the 1561 Nuremberg 'cylindrical flying objects' and the 1890s US 'airship wave,' as evidence of long-standing unexplained aerial phenomena beyond human capabilities.

'There is a strong chance that what we are seeing is beyond human technology, and attempts to explain it as secret military hardware serve only to distract the public,' Lee said.

Some experts, like Dr Ajaz Ali from Ravensbourne University, caution that many UFO sightings stem from advanced but earthly technology. 

Cold War-era reconnaissance missions by the US and Soviet Union, such as U-2 spy plane flights, and modern drone developments have often been mistaken for extraterrestrial craft.

'The shapes and behaviors of modern drones and spy aircraft closely mimic those reported in UFO encounters,' Ali said, noting that declassified documents have linked covert aerial operations to the rise of UFO lore.

Despite decades of investigation, the true identity of the Tic Tac craft remains a mystery, fueling an ongoing clash between believers in secret military tech and advocates of alien visitation theories.

'It's possible we'll never fully understand this intelligence,' Lee concluded. 'It may be far beyond anything we currently comprehend.'

However, the mystery of the Tic Tac remains unsolved, leaving both believers in extraterrestrial intelligence and advocates of secret military technology debating what exactly is flying above our heads.

'It's conceivable that it was being operated neuro-meditatively, psionically, by a human psionic,' Coulthart said.

'It makes no scientific sense to me that the Tic Tac UFO is Lockheed Martin technology,' Lee told the Daily Mail.

'There have been many documented sightings throughout history of the same type of craft, even before the technological age. 

'These sightings are well-documented. There was definitely something technological in their skies, but it wasn't ours. 

'What it is or where it comes from, I do not know. That is the question we are all trying to answer.'

Lee agreed that there may be attempts to reverse-engineer alien technology and suspects that the reporting around the Tic Tac sighting is intended to divert attention from this.

He claimed efforts to portray such craft as secret military technology are designed to prevent the public from realizing that aliens regularly visit Earth.

'I suspect the US military is diverting us away from what they actually know about this technology, which is most likely extraterrestrial in origin,' he said.

'However, I'm also sure that reverse engineering programs are ongoing—this has been confirmed to me by a senior intelligence contact in the UK military, though with limited success.'

'There are a lot of so-called UFO experts making wild claims, all wanting to be the messiah who brings us the truth, but the reality is we do not know, and maybe never will fully understand what this intelligence is.

A dedicated ghost hunter has published his latest book on the subject of 'things that go bump in the night'. Ghost Of The North East, by Rob Kirkup, takes a look at some of the intriguing examples of the paranormal witnessed around our region. 

Many of the ghostly tales featured in the book are associated with historic locations - such as battlefields, castles, pubs, and places of industry. Even for sceptics, the 28 stories shed fascinating light on often forgotten histories. The book is divided into four sections - Northumberland, Tyne & Wear, County Durham and Teesside - as Rob, a long-time paranormal investigator and author, takes us on an informative ghostly tour of the North East. 

Our 10 photographs, below, are selected from the 100 illustrations that accompany the text in the book.

One of the most bloody events in the history of our region was the Battle of Flodden which unfolded amid the rolling hills of Northumberland in 1513 during the reign of Henry VIII. In a cataclysmic clash between the English and Scottish armies, as many as 14,000 men were slain in brutal conflict in a matter of hours. 

The English earned a crushing victory, with the Scottish king, James IV, among those killed in the battle. More than 500 years later, the book notes, there are still reports of the ghostly sounds of battle coming from the field, while the nearby A697 has been the location of sightings of phantom soldiers crossing the road.



Slightly further south, in Alnwick, stands a public house called the Dirty Bottles. It is named after a legend dating from the early 1800s. The innkeeper was positioning bottles in the window when he suddenly dropped dead for no apparent reason. 

His widow declared that should anybody touch the bottles, they would suffer the same fate as her unfortunate husband. More than 200 years later, the bottles remain untouched, sealed between two panes of glass and covered in dust and cobwebs.

The book also looks at the story of Winter's Gibbet. In 1791, William Winter murdered the elderly Margaret Crozier in Northumberland. He was captured and, a year later, hanged. His body was displayed on a gibbet near the crime scene as a grim warning. 

Today, a replica stands on Elsdon Moor, recalling the brutal crime. It is said Winter's ghost can sometimes be seen late at night near the gibbet. The 400-year-old Schooner Hotel in the picturesque Northumberland coastal village of Alnmouth has twice been named ‘the most haunted hotel in Great Britain'. It boasts 60 individual ghosts - including crying children, a phantom maid, and a marching soldier - and 3,000 sightings during the last decade.

Moving into Tyne and Wear, the book stops off at ‘haunted' locations such as Newcastle's Castle Keep, Souter Lighthouse in Whitburn, Marsden Grotto in South Shields, and the Angel of the North in Gateshead, while over in County Durham, the ghostly goings on at the North of England Lead Mining Museum at Killhope come under consideration.

As the author declares in his introduction to the book: “Allow me to guide you through my native North East ... and I will tell you of some of the chilling phantoms said to stalk this region.”

Ghost Of The North East by Rob Kirkup, published by Amberley, is priced at £15.99. The title is also available in Kindle, Kobo and iBook formats. You can buy the book direct from the publisher at: Ghosts of the North East - Amberley Publishing. Our 10 photographs are a selection of the 100 that appear in the book.

For over a decade, Supernatural captivated audiences with its gripping mix of folklore, horror, and unforgettable sibling banter. As one of the most popular shows of the late 2000s and 2010s, it built a fiercely loyal fanbase that stuck with it through 15 seasons of demon hunts, apocalyptic showdowns, and emotional goodbyes. When it wrapped up in 2020, it left a major void in the TV landscape, and in fans' hearts.

Plenty of shows have since tried to fill the gap. From dark procedurals to mystical monster hunts, a number of series have worn the supernatural genre like a well-fitted coat. However, Supernatural wasn't just about ghosts and ghouls - it was the mix of emotionally layered storytelling, quick-witted dialogue, and long-term myth-building that made it a once-in-a-generation kind of show.

Thankfully, there's one underrated gem that might be the next best thing. It ran during Supernatural's heyday, carries a stellar 89% Rotten Tomatoes score, and delivers the same combination of thrills, lore, and emotional investment. That show is NBC's Grimm, and it should be considered a must-watch for all Supernatural fans.

If Supernatural left you wanting more dark mythology, weekly monsters, and emotionally grounded heroes, Grimm should be next on your list. Premiering in 2011 and running for six seasons, Grimm blends procedural crime drama with supernatural fantasy in a way that hits many of the same satisfying beats as Supernatural.

The series follows Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli), a homicide detective who discovers he's descended from a line of hunters called “Grimms” - humans with the power to see creatures known as Wesen hiding in plain sight. These Wesen range from terrifying to tragic, and many are inspired by old European folklore. 

As Nick juggles his double life, he becomes part protector, part hunter, and eventually a key figure in a brewing war between ancient factions. And just like Supernatural's emotional backbone - Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) - Grimm builds its foundation on strong relationships. 

 Nick's evolving dynamics with his partner Hank (Russell Hornsby), ally Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), and love interest Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) provide a grounding emotional core that elevates the show beyond simple creature-hunting.

What makes Grimm feel like such a natural follow-up to Supernatural is how confidently it blends darkness and heart. The series isn't afraid to explore the horrors lurking under the surface of modern society, but it also never loses sight of its characters. It's smart, suspenseful, and often surprisingly emotional - the very traits that made Supernatural so beloved.

At its heart, Grimm is cut from the same cloth as Supernatural. Both shows built fanbases by taking myth and legend seriously while still having fun with their respective universes. If you're the kind of viewer who loved Supernatural's balance of high-stakes mythology and weekly monster confrontations, Grimm offers a similar rhythm.

The “monster of the week” format thrives in both series. In Supernatural, the Winchester brothers take down everything from shapeshifters to gods. In Grimm, Nick faces off against countless Wesen - each with their own origins, cultures, and secrets. Like the most memorable Supernatural episodes, Grimm often uses its creature plots as metaphors for real human issues.

Both shows also shine thanks to their long-form storytelling. Supernatural's layered arcs about heaven, hell, and family are echoed in Grimm's slow-burning conflict between Wesen factions, the mysterious Royal Houses, and Nick's evolving place in this hidden world. The lore builds gradually, rewarding viewers who stick with it across seasons.

Another major strength they share? Character development. Much like how Supernatural made viewers invest in the emotional growth of Sam, Dean, and Castiel (Misha Collins), Grimm slowly deepens its characters across multiple seasons. Relationships shift, alliances form and break, and the personal stakes only grow heavier. Monroe, in particular, stands out as Grimm's version of a fan-favorite sidekick - equal parts comic relief and emotional anchor, much like Castiel or Crowley (Mark Sheppard).

Even the tone feels familiar. Both shows blend horror, fantasy, and procedural structure with moments of levity and human warmth. The writing never takes itself too seriously, even when the mythology gets deep. If Supernatural's charm came from its ability to balance scares with heart, Grimm learned from the same playbook.

While Grimm and Supernatural share plenty of similarities, fans should know that Grimm also carves its own identity. The most noticeable difference is in tone and presentation. Where Supernatural leaned into genre-bending episodes and apocalyptic stakes, Grimm keeps its world more grounded, focusing on its unique folklore and police-procedural roots.

Grimm's setting in Portland, Oregon adds a moody, misty backdrop that enhances its gritty, urban-fantasy feel. The show often feels more like a detective thriller with supernatural elements than a full-on fantasy epic. This allows Grimm to explore themes like identity, duality, and hidden histories through a slightly more restrained lens than Supernatural's high-concept battles between heaven and hell.

The visual style is another key distinction. Grimm uses practical effects and subtle CGI to bring its Wesen to life, giving the show a more textured, eerie atmosphere. While Supernatural occasionally dipped into stylized or surreal aesthetics, Grimm maintains a consistent visual palette that reflects its darker, more mature vibe.

Narratively, Grimm avoids the near-constant world-ending threats that defined much of Supernatural's later seasons. Instead, it builds tension through political intrigue, hidden alliances, and the danger of secrecy unraveling Nick's life. The stakes feel more personal and less cosmic, which can be a refreshing change of pace.

This isn't to say one approach is better than the other - just different. For fans of Supernatural who loved the brotherly bond and epic scale, Grimm might feel more low-key but no less intense. It's a grounded supernatural thriller that slowly ramps up in complexity, with just as much payoff. If you're ready for a show that honors the spirit of Supernatural without copying it, Grimm is the one.

For Supernatural fans ready to dive into the world of Wesen and Grimms, Grimm is incredibly accessible. At the time of writing, all six seasons of the series are available to stream on Amazon Prime Video and Peacock. That's 123 episodes of high-quality dark fantasy just waiting to be binge-watched.

Whether you want to experience it from the beginning or pick it up after a few episodes, both platforms make it easy. Peacock offers free streaming with ads on select tiers, while Amazon Prime provides an ad-free experience for Prime members. The full series is also available for digital purchase if you want to own it outright.

And for longtime Supernatural fans who crave that blend of mythology and mystery, watching Grimm in full is a rewarding experience. It's the kind of show that builds with every season - just like the Winchesters' journey - offering twists, emotional stakes, and a world you won't want to leave.

The angel Castiel might have rusty people skills, a stoic demeanor, and deadpan sarcasm, but Misha Collins, the human actor behind Supernatural‘s forever third wheel, is charming and full of stories. It's a natural fit, then, that Collins has created a one-man show, It Seemed Like A GOOD IDEA at the Time, which he tours around the country separate from the SPN conventions he does with costars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki.

Stops this year for A GOOD IDEA include Oklahoma City, Austin, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, and Nashville. The 90-minute, alcohol-friendly evening is described as having “topics more suited to a therapist's sofa than a public stage.” A warning: There might be more than a few d–k jokes.

“I love telling these very personal stories that bring the audience into some real difficult, emotional terrain, while also having them belly laugh — and they laugh a lot, if I do say so myself,” admits Collins, who shares tales of his financially fraught childhood, including how his mother taught him to steal peaches when he was 4 and how they hopped freight trains and lived as nomads in tents. “This added up to a childhood ripe for storytelling,” Collins notes.

Maarten de Boer

His laugh-out-loud material ranges from the deeply intimate to the riotously inappropriate. “It's nice to see that the hard parts can be funny, and the funny parts can be hard,” he continues. “I also love exposing myself to a live audience — both literally and figuratively — and not just a camera crew.”

Collins, who introduced the world of angels to Supernatural viewers during the show's fourth season back in 2008, remained a fan favorite on the series until the end. Now, after his own challenging upbringing, he's a proud family man with a wife and two kids — and his life is much more settled. Still, Collins says A GOOD IDEA was “long percolating.”

And though this show is 100 percent Collins, he credits Padalecki with the title. “One day on set, after telling yet another story about how I had barely escaped with my life, smuggling myself into Tibet in the back of a vegetable truck, Jared had a flash of insight,” Collins recalls. “He said, ‘I've got it — the title of your memoir. The cover of the book has the words ‘A GOOD IDEA' in the center in large font. Preceding that text, in much smaller, hard-to-read font, ‘It Seemed Like a…' and at the end, ‘…at the Time.' So the cover would read, It Seemed Like A GOOD IDEA at the Time.

Well, hey, it really was!

Believers say one gigantic boat was swapped for another for insurance money. Here's the truth.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

When the Titanic sank in 1912, it shocked the world. The limits of human innovation were cruelly displayed with the destruction of such a technically remarkable ship. But a conspiracy theory that has crept up online in recent years, most recently on Reddit, begs the question: Was it actually the Titanic that sank?

We know. It sounds bonkers. But bear with us. 

Everyone seems to agree on one fact: a ship really did sink in the icy waters of the North Atlantic on April 15, 1912, and approximately 1,500 passengers aboard that ship died. The conspiracy theory simply suggests the Titanic wasn't actually the technical marvel the ship's parent company, the White Star Line, had promised. 

Rather, the White Star Line swapped ships for the voyage from Southampton to New York, and the ship billed as the top-of-the-line Titanic was actually an older ship: the Olympic. 

What's more, the conspiracy theory suggests, the entire crash was an insurance scam gone wrong. 

The British White Star Line had stiff competition in England and across the globe. Locally, it had a fierce rivalry with the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd., which in 1906–07 had sent on its maiden voyage the world's then-largest passenger ships, the Lusitania and the Mauretania. 

To compete with the Lusitania and its mate, White Star Line entered into a giant ship war. The company was no stranger to such battles, but Cunard's Lusitania and Mauretania had outgunned White Star's so-called “Big Four” ships in terms of top speed. This time around, the company had some extra backing.  

In 1902, White Star had become a property owned by the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM), a holding company bankrolled by famed financier J.P. Morgan. With Morgan's permission, White Star chairman J. Bruce Ismay began work on what came to be known as Olympic-class ships. If they couldn't match the Lusitania's speed, Olympic-class ships would outclass Cunard ships: they'd be even bigger, and more luxurious. Three ships were commissioned: the Olympic, the Titanic, and the Britannic.   

The Olympic was the first to be built, and as the line's namesake, it was considered the lead ship. Its maiden trip was widely heralded, and its first few voyages were unqualified successes. But on just its fifth voyage, the vessel ran into serious trouble. 

On September 20, 1911, while passing a military vessel, the Hawke, the Olympic made an unexpected turn. Caught off guard, the two ships crashed. The Olympic was able to limp back to port, badly wounded. A trial would later hold the White Star Line responsible for the incident. 

Everything above is generally agreed to be fact.  The Olympic crash is where paths diverge. 

After the crash, conspiracy theorists claim, the Olympic was an economic disaster. The lawsuit meant repairs would not be covered by insurance, and it was drawing no money while sitting around the docks. So, the company made a switch: its newly built second ship would take on the name Olympic, while its damaged older ship would be re-purposed to be the Titanic. 

Eventually, the true Olympic (now secretly operating as the Titanic) would be scuttled in an accident from which the White Star Line could collect an insurance payment befitting a brand-new ship—all while the ship originally built as the Titanic would have lived on. The only thing that ruined the plan was an iceberg.  

Other conspiracy theorists claim a more nefarious reasoning for the sinking: J.P. Morgan was behind the switch, eager to use an inferior ship to drown his enemies onboard.  

Proponents of either theory point toward a number of clues: the Titanic didn't allow for a public examination before its voyage, out of fear it would be found out by experts as Olympic in disguise, theorists claim. 

And then there are portholes. A popular Reddit post examines pictures of the Titanic under construction and the Titanic on its first voyage, and finds the second picture suspiciously changed and close to the Olympic. 

There are a plethora of other details. For example, separate claims point toward the argument the Olympic lies at the bottom of the sea instead of the original Titanic.

Titanic researchers Steve Hall and Bruce Beveridge have published a book on the subject, Titanic or Olympic: Which Ship Sank? They've also helped to write other books of Titanic history, including Titanic: The Ship Magnificent. The two take the porthole argument straight on.

“The Olympic,” they write, “like the Titanic, was fitted originally with the same 14-porthole arrangement on the port side of her forecastle, but two additional portholes were later fitted; they were there in March 1912.” 

Historian Mark Chirnside has also devoted serious time to the question of why, exactly, the switch would be made. In 2005, he examined the insurance argument—that the ship would be intentionally sunk to claim the insurance benefits. Quoting Ismay, “the Titanic ‘cost  $7,500,000'—and  was  insured ‘for  $5,000,000,  I  understand.'” This is backed up by the IMM's American Vice President, Philip  A.  S. Franklin, who confirmed that the insurance policy was $5 million.

“Were  there  a  conspiracy,  one  would expect that the insurance policy would have been changed to cover the entire value of the  ship,” Chirnside writes. “As  it  was,  White  Star  could  only  expect to  recoup  two-thirds  of the  ship's value.”

Closely examined, none of the Olympic/Titanic claims can hold up to the phenomenal effort that was needed for the switch: the two ships were not exactly identical. The Titanic had a “unique café  and  enlarged  á  la carte restaurant,” Chirnside writes, and was modified based on the company's earlier experience with the Olympic. 

Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported Titanic wreckage has been recovered with the ship's unique construction identification number (CIN); the 401 being irrefutable evidence that it wasn't an ill-fated cover up. 

 That's not all. It “is simply impossible to pass off a one-year-old ship for a new one,” Chirnside says, pointing to a number of small differences between the two, including “additional  steel  plates that  were  fitted  to  the bedplates  of  Olympic's  engines,” added in 1911, and still there in further inspections in the 20s and 30s. When the Titanic was investigated by the British board of trade, no such plates were found.

It's not that the Titanic or owner J.P. Morgan were above suspicion—Morgan demonstrated phenomenal power over the U.S. during his lifetime, resolving the Banking Crisis of 1907 almost singlehandedly. (As it happened, the Titanic's sinking would prove to make IMM the rare Morgan financial failure, going bankrupt two years later.)

But in that incident, there was physical evidence that Morgan was altering the monetary system. No concrete evidence of the Titanic conspiracy stands up to the evidence presented by the historians.

People who are quick to see themselves as victims of unfair treatment may be more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, according to a massive international study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology. The research links a stable personality trait called “victim justice sensitivity” to greater endorsement of conspiracy narratives about climate change, vaccines, and other topics.

The work was led by Daniel Toribio-Flórez of the University of Kent in collaboration with an international team of more than 70 researchers from institutions across Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania. Previous studies have often focused on collective victimhood — the belief that one's group has been historically harmed — as a driver of conspiratorial thinking. But the authors argued that conspiracy theories also tend to revolve around the idea of being wronged personally.

“Many conspiracy theories are rooted in the idea that one's group has been unfairly treated or targeted by a powerful group acting malevolently in secret,” said Toribio-Flórez, a postdoctoral research associate and member of the CONSPIRACY_FX project.

“Because of this, past research has mostly focused on how conspiracy beliefs are related to collective victimhood-that is, when people feel their social group, community, or country has been wronged or harmed by another group. However, within a specific social context, individuals differ in their tendency to perceive and react as victims of injustice, independently of their group identity.”

“We were curious whether people who show this individual tendency to see themselves as victims are also prone to believe in conspiracy theories. To investigate this, we collaborated with a multinational team of researchers and collected data from 15 countries. This allowed us to examine whether the patterns we observed held up across different cultural and societal contexts, an important step in assessing the generalizability of our findings.”

The first phase of the research was a secondary analysis of two surveys originally conducted in Germany. These surveys had explored how personality traits shape trust in science, but they also contained relevant measures for the present investigation. In total, the combined sample included 743 participants: 370 drawn from the general public and a student population, and 373 drawn entirely from a student population. The age range was broad, spanning from teenagers to older adults, and women made up the majority of both samples.

Participants completed a 10-item scale designed to measure victim justice sensitivity — the degree to which a person tends to notice, feel angered by, and react to situations in which they believe they are personally treated unfairly. They also completed a validated five-item measure of conspiracy mentality, which captures a general tendency to suspect that important events are shaped by hidden plots. In the second German sample, the researchers also had access to other relevant traits such as dispositional mistrust, intolerance of ambiguity, and need for control, along with political orientation.

The analysis revealed a small to moderate positive correlation between victim justice sensitivity and conspiracy mentality in both samples. In the first sample, the association was statistically significant, albeit weaker, while in the second it was stronger and remained significant even after controlling for other traits and political orientation.

This indicated that the relationship between feeling like a victim and endorsing conspiratorial thinking was not simply explained by a general distrustful outlook or a desire for certainty and control. However, because both samples were from Germany, the authors noted that the findings could not yet be assumed to apply universally.

To address this, the researchers conducted a second study which expanded the scope considerably. As part of the Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism (TISP) ManyLabs project, the researchers collected responses from nearly 15,000 people in 15 different countries, including Australia, Austria, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, the United States, and Costa Rica. The samples were designed to reflect national distributions of age, gender, and education level.

This large-scale online survey measured victim justice sensitivity using a short two-item scale from the Justice Sensitivity Inventory (“It makes me angry when others are undeservingly better off than me” and “It worries me when I have to work hard for things that come easily to others”).

Participants also completed three separate measures of conspiracy belief: a general statement about authorities often hiding the truth, a climate change conspiracy statement claiming that global warming is a hoax orchestrated by scientists, and a vaccine conspiracy statement alleging that scientists conceal vaccine dangers. These were rated on scales indicating the degree of agreement.

The researchers analyzed the data using multilevel models, which allowed them to separate individual-level effects from possible country-level influences. Across the pooled data, victim justice sensitivity was consistently linked to greater endorsement of conspiracy beliefs within countries. The effect was strongest for general conspiracy belief, slightly weaker for vaccine conspiracies, and weakest for climate change conspiracies. Even after adjusting for demographic factors, political orientation, and religiosity, the link remained statistically significant for general and vaccine-related conspiracies.

“According to our data, people's individual tendency to perceive and react as victims of injustice is positively, though weakly, related to belief in conspiracy theories, even when controlling for indicators of collective victimhood or exposure to collective violence,” Toribio-Flórez told PsyPost. “In other words, people who tend to see themselves as victims are a bit more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs, regardless of how victimized others feel in their country or of the level of collective violence their country has recently suffered.”

The strength of the relationship varied across nations. In countries such as the United States, New Zealand, and Australia, the association between victim justice sensitivity and conspiracy beliefs was notably stronger. In others, including Costa Rica, Chile, and Colombia, it was minimal or non-existent for some conspiracy measures.

The researchers explored whether country-level factors — such as wealth, income inequality, personal freedoms, corruption perceptions, institutional trust, or cultural orientation toward individualism versus collectivism — explained these differences. They also considered historical exposure to violence, such as armed conflicts or political repression. None of these indicators consistently moderated the association. The one tentative exception was that the relationship appeared stronger in more individualistic societies, but this pattern did not replicate across all cultural indices tested.

“While we observed this pattern in most countries, the strength of the relationship between individual victimhood and conspiracy beliefs varied,” Toribio-Flórez said. “We explored whether economic, sociopolitical, cultural, or historical factors might explain these differences, but we didn't find clear answers. So we still don't fully understand why the connection is stronger in some contexts than in others.”

The study, like all research, includes some caveats. The studies were correlational, meaning they cannot determine whether victim justice sensitivity leads to conspiracy belief or vice versa — or whether the relationship is bidirectional.

“We cannot say for certain whether an individual's tendency to feel like a victim makes people more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, or if it's the other way around,” Toribio-Flórez explained. “While some studies suggest that conspiracy beliefs might increase individual perceptions of victimhood, more experimental work is needed to understand the direction and nature of this relationship.”

“I hope it encourages other researchers to examine victimhood at both the personal and group levels when studying conspiracy beliefs. While group identity has often been the focus, our findings suggest that an individual sense of victimhood also plays a meaningful role.”

“I would like to highlight the growing international collaboration in the social sciences and other research fields,” Toribio-Flórez added. “More and more, researchers are teaming up across countries to get a broader, more accurate picture of human behavior across different contexts. In this case, the Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism (TISP) ManyLabs project, led by Dr. Viktoria Cologna and Dr. Niels G. Mede, provided the platform that made this research project possible.”

A new study suggests that believing in one conspiracy theory may slightly increase the likelihood of believing in others. The research offers rare causal evidence in support of the long-debated “rabbit hole” model of how conspiracy beliefs spread.

Belief in anti-immigrant conspiracies may be fueled by financial hardship and a sense of societal breakdown, according to new research. Across six studies, economic stress predicted support for discriminatory policies and even violent actions against non-European immigrants.

People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to overestimate their own abilities and wrongly assume that others share their views, according to a new study. The findings highlight overconfidence as a key factor behind conspiracy belief.

A new study used artificial intelligence to analyze over 75,000 Reddit posts and uncover the deep emotional toll QAnon beliefs take on families. The findings reveal widespread grief, fear, and strained relationships as loved ones struggle with ideological division.

Psychologists have found that conspiracy theory beliefs may stem from spite triggered by feelings of social, existential, or cognitive disadvantage. The findings suggest that tackling misinformation requires addressing deeper social inequalities and psychological frustrations.

People prone to conspiracy theories may share cognitive tendencies with those who experience delusional thinking. Two new studies suggest that biases like anomalous perception and impulsive reasoning help explain why some are more likely to embrace conspiratorial beliefs.

Contrary to popular belief, conspiracy theories may not drive democratic decline—rather, those who reject democracy seem more prone to conspiratorial thinking.

Measles is surging again, and experts say fear, mistrust, and misinformation—not just ignorance—are fueling vaccine hesitancy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","7 Mysteries In Weapons That Go Unsolved (& What They Could Mean)","https://screenrant.com/weapons-movie-unsolved-mysteries-theories-list/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 03:58:00 GMT","

Warning: Major spoilers for WeaponsZach Cregger's gripping horror hit Weapons solved its central mystery by the end of its runtime, but it left so many more unanswered questions. Starring Julia Garner, Josh Brolin, and Amy Madigan, Weapons emerged as an immediate box office and critical hit upon its release.

The movie follows the fallout in a small town after 17 children disappear from their homes without a trace, running into the darkness on their own accord. Ultimately, the children's whereabouts are discovered, but in the process a mystery unravels surrounding the reason for the mass disappearance.

In reality, the town is plagued by a parasitic evil, which eventually meets its own grisly end, but not before several upsetting deaths occur. The resolution is satisfying in some ways, but some viewers will undoubtedly find it frustrating given how many threads are left unexplored, and how many questions go completely unanswered.

Perhaps the most talked-about mysterious element of Weapons is the floating assault rifle that Archer Graff (Brolin) sees hovering over the Lilly house (where the kids are being kept) during a dream he has while sleeping in his missing son's bed. The gun itself displays the time when the children all got out of bed and left, 2:17.

Many theories have flown about the gun, with the most popular typically tying the gun to the movie's title, and tying both to symbolism around school shootings. The lone surviving (bullied) child, combined with the anger and trauma that engulfs the entire town as a result of the disappearance, certainly provides enough of a path to draw that conclusion.

The reality of the scene, as Zach Cregger intended it, is far less straightforward. In an interview with Variety, Cregger spoke directly about the scene:

It's a very important moment for me in this movie, and to be frank with you, I think what I love about it so much is that I don't understand it. I have a few different ideas of what it might be there for, but I don't have the right answer. I like the idea that everyone is probably going to have their own kind of interaction or their own relationship with that scene, whether they don't give a s*** about it and it's boring, or whether they think it's some sort of political statement, or whether they think it's just cool.

Cregger didn't intend the moment, nor the movie as a whole, to be politically charged, although it's certainly possible to interpret it that way. The floating gun will remain a lightning rod for discussion, especially because there is no ""correct"" interpretation.

The children all leaving at a very specific, seemingly random time has also sparked plenty of discussion. Once again, the most popular theory seems to point towards a school shooting connection, with the 2:17 referring to the 217 winning votes in the House of Representatives' ban of assault rifles in 2022, although that never became a reality after failing to pass the Senate.

Once again, Cregger has thrown cold water on the sociopolitical connection. In an interview with Far Out Magazine, Cregger noted that the 2:17 time must have been his own subconscious reference to room 217 in Stephen King's novel The Shining, which is where the most diabolical haunting occurs. The number was changed to 237 for Stanley Kubrick's movie, but Cregger stuck to the original.

I'm a Kubrick guy when it comes to The Shining; I definitely worship that movie, and I thought of changing it to 2:37. But then I was like, ‘You know what? My first impulse has got to be the one I stick with,' so I kept 2:17.

It's possible that there is a deeper meaning to draw from it, but with Cregger confirming his own selection process on the number, it feels like another mystery that is left up for interpretation for each respective viewer.

Aunt Gladys (Madigan) is clearly some sort of witch, although we are only given subtle clues about her origin. Cregger initially intended to give Gladys her own chapter in an early draft of the movie, but opted for mystery over clarity with his main villain.

Gladys has likely been around for far longer than an average human lifespan, using her ability to drain the life force from others as a way to maintain her vitality. Her reference to ""consumption"", which is an outdated way to refer to the widely-eradicated tuberculosis, hints that she has probably been alive since at least the late 1800s.

It isn't clear if Gladys is actually Alex's great-aunt. In fact, it seems intentionally confusing given that she's referred to at multiple points as Alex's aunt and his mother's aunt. His mother and father seem to have met her before, but whether the creature that shows up at his house is in fact his aunt or a witch pretending to be his aunt remains unclear.

As a witch, Gladys seems to essentially ""infect"" the entire town. She appears to multiple people who have not actually met her, including Justine and Archer in their dreams and James in the woods, which easily rank as three of Weapons' scariest moments. This is the result of her overall magical/psychic influence on the town: she appears to people in moments of stress or fear.

Gladys' blood magic is executed with the assistance of a dark and dastardly-looking bush or small tree that she carries with her. Using its branches, she pricks her own finger and smears her blood over the thorny branches, which are wrapped in or connected to a personal item of her target. By snapping the branch, she unleashes her possessed victims upon the target.

Alex is later able to use the branches himself, indicating that the magic either lies with the tree, or perhaps that Gladys is in fact Alex's great-aunt, and he has some magic in his own blood.

It's impossible to tell what kind of tree it is, but based on its use and the plant species' long-standing history with witchcraft (especially in Gaelic/Celtic culture) it appears to be some sort of blackthorn. However, the leaves on Gladys' tree don't really align with blackthorn, so in reality it seems like a custom-made creepy plant that serves the same purpose.

The triangle and number six that appear on Gladys' bell could carry several meanings. From a witchcraft perspective, the triangle (which appears inverted on the bell before appearing right-side-up in the credits) carries several meanings, mostly associated with the Crone goddess, as the triangle is a feminine symbol.

The number six is considered a symbol of witchcraft, devilry, and evil, especially when tripled (666), so that connection seems plausible enough. The combined symbols could reasonably just be a label, dictating whose bell it is and what its purpose is: for a witch to execute her evil with.

While the blackthorn branches help Gladys weaponize people, the bell is how she actually triggers a possession after she crafts the potion or spell/curse to possess someone. The triangle switching directions in the credits could also indicate that the symbols are related to alchemy/potion-making.

The odd, arms-out running style of the people who are possessed by Gladys is never really explained, but it might be simpler than it seems at first glance. Given that the individuals are operating not of their own free will, they run with the parts of them that Gladys now controls (their head and heart, mind and soul) leading the way, causing their arms to drag behind.

Basically Gladys is pulling these people in a certain direction, and their running style is indicative of a central point (the head and chest) being where she has ""grabbed"" them. No other real reason is given, although Cregger himself has admitted to a subconscious reason why he included that as the key visual in Weapons.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cregger noted that he believes the unsettling running style originated from his own memory of the ""Napalm Girl"" photo, which was one of the defining photographs of the Vietnam War. In the photo, a young Vietnamese girl runs with her arms out, as her body has been badly burned by napalm.

I think that image is so awful, and the way she's holding her arms out just killed me. I think there's something really upsetting about that posture. If I had to guess, that might be where the seed is from. I don't know. But there was no second-guessing that pose. I knew that they would run that way.

Like the floating gun vision, a lot of the most striking visuals in Weapons seem to be dream-state machinations from Cregger's own mind, and not as logical as many would want them to be. Cregger's movie is almost self-therapeutic, which leaves a ton of room for interpretation based on how many questions he simply refuses to answer during the movie's runtime.

A new electric motorsport championship is making an ambitious pitch to bring electric engines to the ocean — and Will Smith, LeBron James and Tom Brady are along for the ride.

Skimming across the water on thin hydrofoils, they look more like low-flying UFOs than boats.

But the E1 Series' ""RaceBirds"" — single-seater electric powerboats with 6,000-volt engines that can reach speeds of up to 50 knots (58 miles per hour, or 93 kilometers per hour) — are far from extraterrestrial. Instead, they're part of a fast-growing sport that hopes to bring electric vehicles to the water.

That's the pitch behind the UIM E1 World Championship. Dubbed the ""Formula One of the Sea,"" it already has the backing of celebrity team owners such as Will Smith, LeBron James, Tom Brady, Rafael Nadal, Sergio Pérez and Virat Kohli.

The 2025 championship, the second run of the series, is taking place across seven locations: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Doha, Qatar; Dubrovnik, Croatia; Lago Maggiore, Italy; Monaco; Lagos, Nigeria; and Miami. It's a stage for its nine teams to race to become champions of the water. However, for the competition's founders, it's not just about the contest. They want to prove that electric motors can make the leap to the ocean.

""Water mobility is contributing to pollution in a bad way,"" Rodi Basso, a former NASA scientist and F1 engineer who is the co-founder and CEO of E1, told Live Science. ""Sustainability is now becoming almost a tricky word. It started from communication and awareness, which was needed; we have an issue. But now, we cannot keep feeding this anxiety; we need a solution. The boat is a solution.""

Basso's inspiration for E1 came during the early COVID-19 pandemic, when he and Alejandro Agag — now E1's chairman and co-founder and the pioneer of the electric motorsport Formula E and Extreme E championships — were taking a walk by London's River Thames.

After Basso offered the spark of an idea for an electric powerboat championship, Agag provided the investment and motorsport expertise needed to get development off the ground — or off the surface of the water. Taking inspiration from how birds glide across aquatic surfaces, the 24-foot-long (7.3 meters) boat was designed by Seabird founder Sophi Horne to lift its hull more than 3 feet (1 m) above the surface at speeds of 19.5 mph (31 km/h).

""It's a bit like pulling back on the sticks of an airplane, where, as you roll in, it'll dive, so you kind of pull back,"" Sam Coleman, a pilot on Team Brady who won the first E1 World Championship in 2024, told Live Science. ""It's a lot more akin to flying than driving a boat.""



The feat means that the boats produce far less waves when balanced atop their three wing-like foils, thus reducing coastal erosion. It also lowers friction with the water to ramp up the boats' speeds. These design elements combine with 20 seconds of boost to supercharge the battery output from 95 to 140 kilowatts, enabling the boats to reach 50 knots.

But the enhanced speed comes with some major downsides. Bringing the RaceBirds up onto their foils may make them faster, but it also renders them incapable of making sharp turns. It also introduces the risk of cavitation — the formation of air bubbles — in the water below.

""Around 50 knots, they get unstable,"" Basso said. ""The water around the foil starts bubbling, so you have less pressure and less force pushing the boat up, and then the boat can collapse. And it does so with very little warning.""

""So now, the pilots are building incredible sensitivity and understanding, finding where that moment is, and riding on the edge of that moment,"" he added.

This means pilots must carefully manage when to use their boosts and when to lift their boats onto their foils during races, in which they compete in a series of time trials to qualify for a final five-boat battle to the finish line.

To beat the competition, they must find the right racing line around corners. That might mean riding a wide arc perched atop their foils or smashing into the water close to buoys, before zipping away on their boost, all while navigating the choppy waters generated by other boats.

It requires enormous concentration and split-second decision-making, both of which are strained further by cockpit temperatures that can climb to 167 degrees Fahrenheit (75 degrees Celsius).

""It's draining; it's like sitting in a sauna and trying to drive a racing simulator that's bouncing up and down,"" Coleman said. ""The window is so small, you can be absolutely nailing it and then all of a sudden, you're one point of a degree out on your trim setting and that's enough to induce a porpoise, or an oscillation, that takes ages to recover from.""

To help pilots perform their best, teams of engineers back on shore analyze data taken from every part of the boat before advising them over radio. Team owners also follow along closely with the results of races.

""Tom Brady is the team owner for our team, and for me to say that is very surreal. But the biggest thing is that he is into it,"" Coleman said. ""He follows it. It's like when Rafa and Will Smith were in Lake Como: They had a great time, they enjoyed it, they understand it, and you can see that they're super competitive, and they have such a great opportunity to bring eyeballs to a new sport and then help elevate it. I think it's a really exciting journey that we're on.""

Keeping races fresh and competitive means that changes are consistently being made to the RaceBirds' engines and propellers. The design tweaks aren't just to improve performance and handling but also to minimize the zero-emission, virtually silent craft's impact on its surrounding environment.

The result is an electric vessel that's around 50 times quieter than traditional combustion engine boats, according to Carlos Duarte, E1's chief scientist. Duarte, a marine biologist who won the 2025 Japan Prize for his contributions to research on marine and coastal ecology, is working through E1 on voluntary schemes with industry to make ships run quieter.



""As we saw during the COVID lockdown, with only a 20% reduction in [ships'] noise, there were reports from all over the world of large marine animals being reported in areas that they had not been seen for decades,"" Duarte told Live Science. ""So it is a low-hanging fruit, very easy to solve. And in fact, addressing noise creates benefits for the boat operators, because electric boats are not only silent, but they're more cost-effective than combustion engine boats.""

Duarte is also overseeing efforts to improve the waterways and ecosystems in the E1 race cities. These measures include aquatic restoration and conservation efforts, as well as steps to offset the environmental impact of the races themselves.

He views building stakeholder partnerships through E1 as a vital avenue for environmental restoration — specifically, away from drawn-out political conferences where, he said, ""despite my scientific credentials in the marine space,"" he, and scientists in general, lack influence.

""The reality is that I don't have a voice, but I want to help those with a voice to communicate the messages that I think need to be communicated to society,"" Duarte said. ""So that's also a platform that the team leader approach of E1, celebrities with voices, can help me.""

E1's 2025 season is running from Jan 25. to Nov 8., with upcoming races in Lagos on Oct. 5 and Miami on Nov 8.

People report vivid dreams during rapid-eye-movement sleep. But is this sleep stage really the only time we dream?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Both Salvador Dalí and Thomas Edison are said to have used dreams to stoke their creative process. To spark new ideas, the men would let themselves drift off to sleep for just a few moments, and then wake up and note the dreamlike visions they had on the brink of unconsciousness.

But you may have heard that dreams happen only in a stage called rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. So is it possible to dream during other stages of sleep, as Dali and Edison supposedly did??

Although dreams in different sleep stages can take on different forms, REM sleep is definitely not the only time we dream, experts told Live Science.

""The belief that dreams are only associated with REM sleep comes from people who are not familiar with the subject in detail, or who have somewhat outdated knowledge,"" Isabelle Arnulf, a sleep neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, told Live Science in an email.

When REM sleep was first described in the 1950s, it had a couple of easily observable characteristics that prompted scientists to link the sleep stage to dreams. REM sleep, which makes up about 25% of our total time asleep, is characterized by brain waves that resemble electrical activity during wakefulness, fast eye movements and full-body paralysis. Scientists theorized that these rapid eye movements reflected people ""watching"" their dreams and that the body was paralyzed to prevent them from acting out those dreams in real life. While these theories about REM sleep still hold, scientists now know that these outward physical characteristics aren't necessarily required for dreams to take place.

It is true that when people are awoken during REM sleep, they often report remembering vivid dreams with a strong narrative thread. But since the discovery of REM sleep, further research has shown that people dream during non-REM (NREM) sleep, too.

Related: What happens in your brain while you sleep?

In one study, Arnulf used a drug to suppress REM sleep in a small group of participants and then regularly woke them up throughout the night to see if they'd had any dreams. Many participants reported remembering dream-like mental content upon waking up, even though they had never entered REM sleep. Based on their reports, the structure and content of those dreams was a little different, though.

""NREM dreams are less frequent, shorter, less vivid, more conceptual or thought-like, and often lack a clear narrative,"" Francesca Siclari, a sleep researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, told Live Science in an email. ""In contrast, REM dreams are almost always story-like, vivid, and rich in sensory detail. That said, there's a lot of variability. Sometimes NREM dreams are very minimal in content, and other times they can be remarkably similar to REM dreams.""

Siclari has used electroencephalography (EEG) — a technique that measures electrical activity in the brain — to learn more about dreams during different sleep stages. She's found that both REM and non-REM dreams share some similarities in EEG signatures, even though REM and non-REM sleep stages generally look quite different on an EEG scan. She also discovered that when people's brain activity is slower, they're less likely to report a dream when woken up.

—Do blind people 'see' images in their dreams?

—Why can't we remember our dreams?

—Can you 'turn off' a nightmare?

Although these results shed light on the mechanics behind dreaming in REM and non-REM sleep, many questions remain. Scientists still don't understand exactly how the brain generates dreams, why we have such a hard time remembering them, and why we even dream at all. They hope if they can learn more about dreams — and the different sleep stages in which they occur — it could reveal deeper truths about how the human brain works.

""[Dreaming is] much more frequent and varied than most people realize — we typically remember only a tiny fraction of our dreams,"" Siclari said. ""Studying them gives us a unique perspective on how the mind works when it's decoupled from the outside world.""

Goldie Chan knows how to put herself out there.

Chan, the founder and head of content for branding agency Warm Robots, is also an author, a frequent keynote speaker and a LinkedIn Top Voice.

Still, she describes herself as an introvert at heart — which presented a challenge in growing her career.

""I think a lot of people underestimate introverts in the workplace,"" she says.

According to Chan, building a personal brand was key to her success. Earlier in her career, Chan worked ""completely behind the scenes"" in various marketing and social media roles, she says.

In 2017, she began posting short videos about pop culture branding and marketing on LinkedIn, which was beta-testing its video feature at the time.

Becoming a content creator wasn't initially her plan: ""I really thought, I'm just going to do this until I get my next full-time job,"" Chan recalls.

While in between roles, she posted over 800 consecutive daily videos — a pace she doesn't necessarily recommend ""unless you never want to sleep again"" — and quickly attracted a large audience.

Today, she has over 100,000 followers on LinkedIn, and that platform has helped her land new roles, obtain a book deal and share her expert advice as a Forbes contributor.

""I grew my own personal brand through a lot of consistency and hard work,"" she says.

Chan writes about how introverts can level up their careers in her upcoming book ""Personal Branding for Introverts,"" which debuts in October.

Whether you know it or not, ""everyone has a personal brand,"" Chan says.

If the idea of a personal brand sounds intimidating, just think of it as ""something in your career that people know you for,"" whether that's your penchant for public speaking, affinity for colorful blazers or your humorous LinkedIn posts.

Developing a strong personal brand can help introverts bring their talents to the forefront and boost their careers, she says: ""It allows you to shape the story that other people are telling about you.""

Still sound scary? Chan hears that a lot.

""I've had so many introverts who have come up to me and said, 'I'm so terrified of growing my personal brand because I don't want to put myself out there,'"" she says.

Chan herself used to feel the same way. To combat her social anxiety, she challenged herself to speak with a new person at her local coffee shop each day for a month.

Just one small, consistent action can help you break out of your comfort zone, she says.

If you're nervous about reaching out to professional connections, commit to sending one networking email a month, Chan says. Trying to grow an online presence? Post one update a week.

""The more you do it regularly, the easier it is to keep going,"" she says.

Keep in mind that your personal brand doesn't just exist online. According to Chan, participating in social events like hobby groups or networking meetups can also contribute to building your brand.

Your unique interests help set you apart, she says, and you might be surprised at the opportunities that arise.

""A personal brand is never created in isolation,"" Chan says. ""Being involved in groups that interest you, even if they're not directly related to your career, can actually help with your career.""

She describes personal brands as the ""hub in the center of spokes.""

""All these different spokes are all the different things that you do, and they all connect back to a central hub — so whatever small things you do are always going to help your overall personal brand,"" she says.

Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka got their title defenses off to smooth starts as they powered into the third round of the ATP-WTA Cincinnati Open on Saturday.

The men's and women's top seeds, each ranked No. 1 in the world, were both competing for the first time since Wimbledon, where Sinner lifted the title and Sabalenka bowed out in the women's semi-finals.

Sinner crushed Colombian Daniel Elahi Galan 6-1, 6-1 in steamy afternoon weather, while Sabalenka beat 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 6-1 under the lights of the night session.

Sabalenka needed 54 minutes and a service break in the final game to clinch the opening set with a stinging winner.

The second set was more of a grind than the score suggested, as she saved five break points for a 4-1 lead and recovered from 0-30 down in the final game before securing the win.

“It's always a tough match against her,” Sabalenka said of the Czech opponent she has faced nine times. “She pushed me to the limit. If you lose focus even a little bit, it can cost you a set. I had to fight for every point against her.”

Sabalenka next faces the UK's Emma Raducanu, a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Olga Danilovic.

SMOOTH SINNER

Meanwhile, Sinner outclassed Colombia's Galan with 17 winners and just four unforced errors.

Sinner won the opening five games in 15 minutes as he allowed his 144th-ranked opponent, who came through qualifying, little breathing room.

The victory in 59 minutes was the fastest of Sinner's ATP career, beating his previous quickest by one minute.

Sinner claimed his 22nd consecutive win on hardcourt, last losing the Beijing final in September last year to rival Carlos Alcaraz.

“I didn't know what to expect,” Sinner said of his return to tournament action. “I'm happy because it's not easy to play here. The ball is flying and you have to serve very precise if you want to go far in the tournament.”

“Today I was finding my spots, but there is still a little room to improve. For a first match, it could not have gone better,” he said. 

After snapping up the first set, Sinner broke to start the second before Galan clawed out a hold in a seven-minute game in which he fought off five break points.

However, it was only a momentary reprieve. Sinner fired three aces to hold for 3-1 as he roared away again for the victory.

Fourth-seeded American Taylor Fritz eased past qualifier compatriot Emlilio Nava 6-4, 6-4, while seventh-seeded Holger Rune of Denmark won his opener 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) over Roman Safiullin of Russia. 

However, eighth-seeded Lorenzo Musetti of Italy and 11th-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway bowed out to French opponents.

Benjamin Bonzi defeated Musetti 5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) while Artur Rinderknech beat Ruud 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-2 — taking full advantage of Ruud's 34 unforced errors.

Rinderknech was pleased with his success so far at his Cincinnati debut. “I stayed aggressive throughout the match,” he said. “You cannot let Casper start to dictate.”

SWIATEK ADVANCES

Reigning Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek earned an efficient opening win over Russian Anastasia Potapova 6-1, 6-4.

Poland's Swiatek has reached the final four at the last two editions, but Cincinnati remains one of the two 1000-level tournaments — along with Canada — where she has never played a final.

The third seed moved into the third round in just 74 minutes, saving four of the five break points she faced.

“I wanted to play solid — but intense as well,” Swiatek said. “It was up and down in the second set, but in the important moments I got my level up to close out the win.”

Australian Open winner Madison Keys needed more than two hours to advance with a 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/1) win over German Eva Lys, saving two match points at 5-6 in the deciding set.



                                                                                Jobe Bellingham on Tuesday admitted to having “anxieties” on following in brother Jude's footsteps after joining Borussia Dortmund in the summer.
Jobe Bellingham, 19, is two years younger than Jude Bellingham, who joined Real Madrid in 2023 after three years at Dortmund.
A centerpiece of the England national team, Jude Bellingham has emerged as one of the best players in the world in recent seasons.
The younger Jobe Bellingham joined Dortmund in June from Sunderland after their promotion to the English Premier League. He admitted he understood what the perception would be ahead of the move to Germany.
“It's something you do think about.                                    



                                                                                Before Tuesday's 7-2 win at the Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy suggested “most people couldn't tell you five players on our team.”
A look at the standings would indicate more Brewers players soon will be recognized by more fans.
After all, it is difficult to overlook a team that not only continues to extend their lead in the National League Central, but also boasts the best record in the majors.
“What we're doing in here right now is special,” right-handed pitcher Freddy Peralta said after allowing only four hits and one run in five innings, while setting a career high with                                    



                                                                                A baseball team from New Taipei City won the US Pony Palomino Division World Series yesterday in Laredo, Texas, defeating the US West representative team from Azusa, California, 2-1.

In the championship game against Azusa, Ku-Pao's starting pitcher Luo Yu-yan (羅于晏) was erratic early, giving up two hits in the bottom of the first inning, followed

The Taiwanese right-hander struggled early, giving up three runs in the bottom of the first inning, including a three-run homer to Mets slugger Pete Alonso — his 250th career home run.
However, Teng was not fazed and soon found his footing, holding the Mets scoreless in the bottom of the second and third innings.

Have you noticed fewer rungs on the corporate ladder lately? 

For the last few years, as companies invest more capital into artificial intelligence, Big Tech has been cutting layers of management in what's become known as the “Great Flattening.” Now, new data from Gusto, which provides payroll and HR solutions, shows small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) are following suit and it's reshaping the way teams are structured, developed and led.

From 2022 to 2024, the number of individual contributors per people manager at SMBs has doubled. Back in 2019, managers typically oversaw about three direct reports. Now, that number is about six. 

Nich Tremper, senior economist at Gusto, says this isn't simply a result of sweeping layoffs, but rather a quiet evolution. 

“What seems to be happening is that as folks move on – older folks retire or others shift to new roles – businesses simply aren't backfilling those managerial positions,” he says.

The change is largely driven by cost pressures. “We've seen the average labour cost increase nearly 20 per cent over the last couple of years,” Mr. Tremper says. “Small businesses don't have a lot of leeway in their budgets, so they're thinking through how best to maximize the productivity of the folks they have on staff. Part of that has come down to reducing management layers.”

But the consequences of a leaner org chart extend beyond budgets.

What we lose when we flatten

While some businesses may appreciate the savings and agility that come with fewer layers of hierarchy, Mr. Tremper cautions against seeing it as a purely positive shift.

“These middle managers are really important for organizations,” he says. “You have strategic decisions and guidance coming from the highest level of management, but it's individual managers who are turning those directions into actionable steps.”

In other words, fewer managers may mean faster decision-making in the short term, but also the risk of teams lacking mentorship, development and day-to-day leadership.

“Highly productive sectors tend to maintain more managers with smaller teams,” Mr. Tremper says. “It suggests that first-line managers play a critical role in scaling their expertise, developing their teams and ultimately boosting productivity.”

Even in lower-productivity industries, measured by total output per hour worked, Gusto found that businesses with a higher share of managers tend to outperform their peers.

Managers are opting out, too

Not only are businesses hiring fewer managers but existing ones are leaving.

In late 2024, Gusto found that the quit rate among managers was about 10 per cent higher than it was in January 2022, when it was more of an employee-driven labour market. 

“Quit rates are often viewed as a sign of labour market confidence,” says Mr. Tremper. “If managers are leaving, it could mean they believe they can find more meaningful work elsewhere. They might be looking to lead teams at other companies or return to being high-performing individual contributors.”

Some may even be taking the opportunity to pivot entirely. “For folks who are maybe no longer managers, this could be a chance to ask: What path do I really want? Do I want to be an individual expert? Or maybe this is the time to start my own business or consulting practice.”

Flattening with intention 

The Great Flattening may seem like a cost-saving trend but it comes with trade-offs. While it can boost short-term agility, businesses that cut too deeply may sacrifice long-term development and stability.

Mr. Tremper says business leaders should think carefully about what they're giving up. “When I think of the most effective managers I've had, they've cared deeply about my professional development. They created opportunities for me to grow beyond my current skill set,” he says.

Small businesses especially, he adds, rely on strong teams and strong teams often rely on great managers.

11 per cent

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","How Bollywood's lens on Kashmir has changed","https://www.dw.com/en/how-bollywoods-lens-on-kashmir-has-changed/a-73569563","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:05:48 GMT","

Bollywood once framed Kashmir through a lens of nostalgia and beauty. Now, the same landscapes carry complex stories of resilience, conflict and cultural memory.

From snowcapped mountains to a land scarred by conflict and calls for ""azaadi"" (freedom), Bollywood movies have shaped how the world sees Kashmir.

A powerful dialogue from Vishal Bhardwaj's acclaimed 2014 film ""Haider"" transcends the screen, capturing the human stories of Kashmir — a Himalayan territory where breathtaking beauty and rich culture belie a decades-long conflict between India and Pakistan.

""Are we here or not? If we are, where and if not, where have we gone? If we exist, for whom and when? Sir... were we ever there, or never at all?"" the character Haider asks.

The dialogue also raises the question of how India's Hindi-language film industry, Bollywood, portrays Muslim-majority Kashmir.

""Haider"" is Bhardwaj's adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" set against the backdrop of the Kashmir conflict in the mid-1990s. The movie offers a delicate portrayal of violence, enforced disappearances and the psychological toll of conflict.

In the decades following India's independence from colonial rule in 1947, Bollywood often depicted Kashmir as a romantic idyll: a valley nestled amid snowy mountains, vibrant tulip gardens and lush deodar and chinar trees.

In ""Barsaat"" (1949), Raj Kapoor uses Kashmir less as a political subject and more as a scenic backdrop for romance — an escape from the humdrum of urban life.

Later films such as ""Kashmir ki Kali"" (1964) continued the trend, while rarely acknowledging the people or politics of the region.

According to author and filmmaker Sanjay Kak, Kashmir served as a playground, ""where the fantasies of Indians could be played out, with Kashmiris playing bit parts somewhere in the background."" 

Kak added that the post-independence period ""was imbued with Nehruvian optimism of secularism and brotherhood.""

The emphasis on the landscape over people's lives — romance over reality — shaped the image of Kashmir as paradise on Earth, alluring tourists and captivating the international imagination, while laying the groundwork for Bollywood's later engagement with the region's politics.

But in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kashmir experienced violent anti-India militancy.

An armed insurgency erupted in India-administered Kashmir after New Delhi was accused of rigging the 1987 assembly election in favor of an Indian nationalist coalition of political parties.

The Muslim United Front (MUF), a coalition of Islamic parties that many predicted would perform well in the polls, lost the election.

In response to the violence, the Indian government enacted counterinsurgency measures including the enforcement of laws such as the 1958 Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), which extends extrajudicial powers to security forces.

These sociopolitical developments altered Kashmir's cinematic image from paradise to a place of increased militarization, fear and communal divide — an image which still prevails.

According to Meenakshi Bharat, author of ""Hindi Cinema and Pakistan,"" the turbulence of the 1990s brought Kashmir to the center of India's political and emotional consciousness.

""Hindi cinema, as the true mirror of the Indian imaginary, was compelled to take cognizance of this change,"" she told DW.

As a result, the film narrative shifted. Kashmir was increasingly portrayed as a battleground where Indian soldiers fought the Pakistan-backed insurgents.

Films like ""Roja"" (1992) intertwined human stories with themes of conflict and militantism, and questions of freedom and identity.

""This film truly marked the sad transformation of Kashmir as a love-setting to a threatened, ravaged 'paradise',"" said Bharat.

From ""Roja"" onward, militants are frequently depicted as violent antagonists — a portrayal that critics say risked reducing Muslim identity to militantism.

Filmmaker Kak argued that ""Roja"" used Kashmir as a landscape in which Indians could reconstruct their fantasies about nationalism and patriotism.""

By the early 2000s, films began to highlight the intricate social, political and emotional realities of Kashmir — including its history of conflict and the trauma experienced by its people due to ongoing violence.

This unresolved grief — marked by disappearances, displacement and fractured families — deeply shaped the narratives, paving the way for stories that intertwined personal tragedy with military ideologies.

Popular films of this period explored Kashmir's deep pain and complex conflict, balancing the harsh realities — psychological trauma, widespread violence and human rights abuses faced by the Kashmiris — with the Indian national perspective focused on security and patriotism.

This dual perspective still shapes how Kashmir's story is told on screen.

Kak describes Hindi cinema today as ""statist,"" meaning largely aligned with government narratives.

This has become more visible since August 2019, when New Delhi abrogated Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which had allowed the region limited autonomy. India claimed that Kashmir's semi-autonomy had been a ""root cause"" of anti-India militancy.

""As the state's position has shifted, so has the cinema,"" Kak told DW.

Contemporary films reflect this shift. ""The Kashmir Files"" (2022) reignited public debate by representing the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus in 1990 as a ""genocide"" — a narrative championed by Hindu nationalist groups.

However, critics said the film promotes a ""one-sided"" narrative that risks reinforcing anti-Muslim sentiment and deepening sectarian divides.

Meanwhile, ""Article 370"" (2024) endorses the government's stance on Kashmir, portraying the abrogation of Kashmir's semi-autonomous status as heroic and necessary to restore order and national unity.

Bharat views Bollywood as a mirror to subcontinental life capturing the prevailing political drives and sentiments.

""It is difficult for the beautiful valleys to appear as an unblemished romantic setting,"" she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","US is ‘done' funding Ukraine","https://www.rt.com/news/622731-us-done-funding-ukraine-vance/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 15:20:00 GMT","

Washington is not going to fund Ukraine anymore, US Vice President J.D. Vance told Fox News on Sunday.

Ukraine's European backers can buy weapons from American producers if they want to continue supporting Kiev, and the US will be “okay with that,” Vance added. “But we're not going to fund it ourselves anymore,” he said.

The interview was published after Vance met with several Western European and Ukrainian officials in London, including UK Foreign Minister David Lammy. According to media reports, Vance's trip was intended to pave the way for a summit between the Russian and US presidents in Alaska on Friday, where resolving the conflict between Kiev and Moscow is expected to be at the top of the agenda.

Vance suggested that Kiev's European backers should play a bigger role providing funding if they “care so much about this conflict.”

“Americans, I think, are sick of continuing to send their money, their tax dollars, to this particular conflict. But if the Europeans want to step up and buy the weapons from American producers, we're okay with that. But we're not going to fund it ourselves anymore,” he said.

The US president had said earlier that the ideas under discussion include “some swapping of territories to the betterment of both” sides, adding that Vladimir Zelensky would need to find a way to approve such a deal under Ukrainian law.

Zelensky has rejected any such agreement, claiming that “nobody can or will” make concessions on the issue. “The Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupiers,” he proclaimed.

Moscow's senior negotiator Kirill Dmitriev has warned that countries trying to prolong the Ukraine conflict will likely go to great lengths to derail the planned meeting between Putin and Trump.

Humanitarian office says 37 children have died from acute malnutrition since July, as overall toll nears 100

See all our Middle East crisis coverage

UN warns Gaza faces ‘starvation, pure and simple' as child deaths mount. The body's humanitarian office OCHA said 98 children had died from acute malnutrition since the start of the conflict in October 2023, with 37 of those deaths since July, according to Gaza's authorities. (see post 18.46)

The US defends Israel at security council meeting, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.The US has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there. (see post 17.23)

Chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis criticises UK decision to recognise Palestine at a march in central London calling for release of Israeli hostages.

Meanwhile, at least 61,430 Palestinian people have been killed and 153,213 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. At least 61 Palestinian people were killed and 363 others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said.

“The invasion of Gaza risks turning into a Vietnam for Israeli soldiers,” Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said in an interview with daily Il Messaggero. Senior Israeli military officers and former senior commanders have warned that Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City risks further international isolation of Israel.

Gaza's Government Media Office say only 14% of the aid Gaza's population needs entered the Strip over the last fortnight.

Benjamin Netanyahu says he wants a ‘civilian administration' to be established in Gaza after Hamas is defeated.

The Israeli prime minister defended his Gaza city plan and said on Sunday he was talking to the US about ‘additional aid measures' and claims he has ‘directed' the military to bring in foreign reporters to Gaza.

The UN security council debated the seizure of Gaza in a rare emergency meeting, you can watch the video below:

Back to those protests in Greece where demonstrators far and wide have kicked off a “day of rage” with more than 100 “stop the war” rallies planned nationwide this evening.

In remote Astypalaia in the south-eastern Aegean Sea, a motley group of protesters, including tourists and locals unfurled banners and placards proclaiming “free Palestine, stop the genocide, not in our name” and “victory to Palestine” at the foot of the island's fortress-topped town.

The mass rallies – the biggest coordinated wave of protest seen in Greece since the onset of the Gaza war – come on the back of rising anger over the increasingly close ties Athens enjoys with Tel Aviv. Tessa Charta joined the mass rally outside the Greek parliament this evening in Athens' Syntagma square.

We are disgusted with our government's blind support for a country so obviously violating every human right. Other countries with close ties have criticised Israel and have promised to recognise Palestine but not Greece. That is why the slogan tonight is not in our name. We don't want to be complicit

AFP reports that the UN's humanitarian office OCHA said 98 children had died from acute malnutrition since the start of the conflict in October 2023, with 37 of those deaths since July, according to Gaza's authorities.

OCHA's coordination director Ramesh Rajasingham said the situation in Gaza had developed into full blown starvation.

This is no longer a looming hunger crisis – this is starvation, pure and simple

Family of victims accuse government of rewarding Hamas with plan to recognise a Palestinian state

Ayelet Svatitzky, whose brothers Roi and Nadav Popplewell were murdered, told demonstrators at the march in London that recognising the state of Palestine before the return of all of the hostages is a “prize” to Hamas.

Speaking close to Downing Street, she said:

This week I joined a meeting with the UK government to continue to press our case that the hostages must be freed before the UK government can recognise the state of Palestine.

As I said to the government, to recognise the state without the return of all of the hostages is a prize to Hamas for the murder of my two brothers.”

The UN security council meeting on Gaza is still going on and there is a video feed at the top of this blog.

Associated Press reports that the US defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.
 The US has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.
 Other council members, and UN officials, expressed alarm. China called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities”.
 “This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,” said Ramesh Rajasingham with the UN humanitarian office told the AP. “Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.”

The UK's chief rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis has addressed the London march calling for the hostages' release and has attacked an announcement by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, that the country was set to recognise Palestine as a state next month.

Addressing the crowd close to Starmer's London residence in Downing Street, Mirvis said:

To our government we turn and we say ‘how would you ever be able to live with the fact that you would have recognised a Palestinian state, at the head of which is a terrorist organisation, with a stated intention of destroying the state of Israel and harming Jews right around the world and all this at a time when the hostages are still languishing in the tunnels of Gaza?

The Labour party, both in opposition and now in government has had a mantra, they have continuously been saying ‘don't judge us by our words, judge us by our deeds'.

And to our government we say right now this is the time for responsible action, it is not too late.”

He added: “We will continue to do whatever we can for the sake of each and every one of the hostages.”

A man has been arrested at the “national march for the hostages” in central London, the Metropolitan police have said.

The force said the individual, who was not part of the march, was held for common assault and a racially aggravated public order offence after the march briefly paused just past Charing Cross.

The march was ending with an assembly in Whitehall.

In the UK, a man has been carried away by police officers after a scuffle broke out close to the gates of Downing Street, the prime minister's London residence.

The man was seen throwing water over a demonstrator who was part of a protest calling for the release of the hostages (see post at 12.43BST). He then charged at him and a scuffle broke out as the man then put his hand around the demonstrator's neck.

Meanwhile, in Greece, pro-Palestinian protestors are braced to take to the streets in more than 100 locations nationwide, triggering a rare warning from the Israeli foreign ministry to tourists visiting the country.

Stop the war campaigners say the ‘day of rage' rallies have been organised in major urban centres, towns, villages and islands with the sole purpose of calling for an end “to the genocide in Gaza” and Benjamin Netanyahu's latest takeover plans.

Graffiti deploring Israel and its actions have proliferated in areas popular with tourists, starting with Plaka, the ancient Athenian neighbourhood of narrow alleys beneath the Acropolis.

“Wherever we are, in every village, every square, every island, every alley, on every street in every town and on every mountain we will call for justice for Palestine,” said a statement released by protest organisers ahead of this evening's demonstrations.

“We will not put up with those in our country and on our islands who support genocide, we will not tolerate genocide in our name. The whole world will learn that the Greek government is alone,” it added, castigating the centre- right administration of Kyriakos Mitsotakis for standing by the “murderous” Netanyahu.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry warned Israelis to “stay away from areas of demonstrations, avoid public debates and expressing political positions in public spaces, and minimize visible signs of identification (such as [Israeli] flags, shirts with Hebrew writing, IDF symbols.”

Fury over the war in Gaza has mounted in Greece putting diplomatic ties between the two countries under unexpected strain.

Last week, the Israeli ambassador to Greece Noam Katz lashed out at the mayor of Athens, Haris Doukas, for failing to clean up anti-Israel graffiti that was, he said “(making) Israeli tourists feel uncomfortable.”

Infuriated by his remarks, Doukas hit back saying:

We Greeks do not take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians and children standing in line for food, from those responsible for the daily deaths of dozens of Gazans from bombs, hunger and thirst.

James Kariuki, the UK's deputy permanent representative to the UN, called Israel's decision to take Gaza City over “wrong” and said it would displace nearly one million (more) Palestinians.

“Expanding military operations will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict. It will not secure the release of the hostages. It will only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” Kariuki was quoted by Al Jazeera as having said.

“This inhumanity cannot be justified”, he said, referring to the continuing restrictions on aid imposed by Israel (and its recent total aid blockade which caused widespread starvation). “The partial aid access Israel granted in late July has proven woefully inadequate. We have a clear message for Israel. Urgently and permanently lift all restrictions on aid delivery.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

French officials says heatwave in southern Europe complicates efforts to contain biggest wildfire since 1949

Tourist trails have been closed on Mount Vesuvius in southern Italy as firefighters tackle a huge blaze on the volcano's slopes, while officials warned of another “challenging day” for those working to contain France's biggest wildfire since 1949.

The wildfire on Mount Vesuvius, close to Naples, broke out a few days ago and by Saturday afternoon had stretched to about 3km (1.9 miles) wide, destroying hundreds of hectares of woodland and killing wild animals. Thick smoke could be seen from Pompeii and Naples.

Six Canadair firefighting planes have been dispatched from the state fleet and teams made up of firefighters, soldiers, forestry corps, police and civil protection volunteers from across Italy are working on the ground.

Drones were being used to monitor the spread of the fire, the national fire service said. The operation has been complicated by the latest heatwave.

Vesuvius national park authorities said the volcano's trail network had been closed for safety reasons and to facilitate firefighting and clean-up operations in the areas affected. Pompeii's archaeological park remains open to the public.

The fire has mainly affected the Terzigno pine forest as well as woodlands close to the small towns of Trecase, Ercolano and Ottaviano at the foot of the volcano.

Francesco Ranieri, the mayor of Terzigno, told Italian media the situation on Saturday night was “very critical” although the efforts of firefighters ensured the flames did not reach any homes.

The cause of the fire has not been identified although there are strong suspicions that it was arson, with Ranieri suggesting there may be “a criminal hand” behind it.

Firefighters in France's southern Aude region, meanwhile, have managed to contain a massive wildfire, which killed one person and injured several others, although authorities warned that work on Sunday would be complicated by intense heat and a hot, dry wind.

“It's a challenging day, given that we are likely to be on red alert for heatwave from 6pm, which will not make things any easier,” said Christian Pouget, the prefect of the Aude department.

Europe is far from alone in suffering frequent wildfires. The weather conditions in which they flourish, marked by heat, drought and strong winds, is increasing in some parts of all continents.

Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the US and Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in southern China.

Climate breakdown has increased the wildfire season by about two weeks on average across the globe.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The turquoise waters and cozy towns of the Greek Aegean island of Lesbos are luring Turkish tourists, who get on well with their hosts. But can tourism improve the fraught relations between the two countries?

This summer, well-heeled tourists from the Turkish coast on the opposite side of the Aegean Sea are arriving in droves to Skala Sikamineas on the northeast coast of Lesbos.

The two excellent fish restaurants on the coast are full, and most of the diners are speaking Turkish.

Families with children from the Turkish city of Izmir, a group from the port city of Ayvalik who arrived on the brand-new catamaran connection and a young couple from Istanbul are among those eating and drinking in this picturesque setting.

Isin and her boyfriend are visiting the island for the first time. ""Friends told us a lot of good things about Lesbos, and we decided to come here for a few days,"" Isin told DW.

The couple arrived by ferry from Dikili and loved the island's beaches and taverns. They're determined to come back next summer.

The crossing from Turkey takes just under an hour, a ticket costs €35 ($40) and in summer there are eight trips a day from Dikili to Mytilene, the island's capital.

On the Greek side of the Aegean, the atmosphere is more relaxed for Turks who like to have a drink, or for Turkish women who want to sunbathe in their bikinis.

""I feel very comfortable here,"" Isin said as her boyfriend poured a shot of ouzo liqueur.

In July alone, almost 29,000 tourists from Turkey visited Lesbos, and even more are expected in August. Local restaurateurs are very happy with their guests from the neighboring country.

""They appreciate the good food, they like to drink our famous aniseed schnapps ouzo, they are not stingy, and most of them are very friendly and relaxed,"" said Takis, who runs a tavern in Gera Bay.

""We are visited by the Turkish middle class, who are looking for a quiet place.""

Many Greek islands have become unaffordable for average earners on both sides of the Aegean, but Lesbos is not one of them: the island is now cheaper than the Turkish holiday destinations of Bozcaada, Bodrum, or Assos on the Aegean.

Since the rebellion of Greeks within the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, which resulted in an independent Greece, and the Greco-Turkish War which ended in 1922, relations between the two countries are have become more friendly, in part due to tourism.

The people of Lesbos are no more or less nationalistic than the rest of Greece, but they increasingly have the opportunity to meet the ""enemy"" from across the sea in peace. Turkish tourists on the streets of Mytilene are not perceived as invaders, but as welcome guests.

It was no coincidence that Nikos Giannakas, the deputy mayor of Mytilene responsible for tourism, enthusiastically awaited the arrival of the Turkish mayor of Balikesir, Ahmet Akin, when he traveled to Lesbos on August 1 along with 150 tourists via the new catamaran route.

The new line is the eighth connecting Mytilene with Ayvalik and the 11th overall between Lesbos and Turkey, including routes to and from Izmir and Petra.

According to Giannakas, the new Mytilene-Ayvalik line will help boost tourism and trade between Lesbos and Turkey, give travelers more options and strengthen cross-border relations.

Last year, around 120,000 people came to Lesbos by boat from Turkey, and the island would like to welcome even more visitors in 2025.

Tourism and cooperation on refugee and migration issues are the only enduring success stories in Greek-Turkish relations since Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a friendship and cooperation agreement between Greece and Turkey in December 2023.

In theory, both governments have the political will to discuss the thornier issues in bilateral relations. These include the demarcation of maritime borders between the two countries — but so far, nothing has come of it. Right now, neither Athens nor Ankara is ready to compromise.

There are ongoing minor disputes over airspace and territorial waters. Turkey, for example, demands it should be consulted on Greece's plans to lay a power cable between Crete and Cyprus. When it's not asked, Ankara sends its warships to the Aegean Sea, as was the case off the coast of Kasos in the fall of 2024.

The latest tensions between the two countries peaked on July 21 when Athens announced it would establish two new marine parks in the Ionian Sea and the southern Aegean.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry was quick to react, noting that ""unilateral measures in closed or semi-closed seas such as the Aegean and the Mediterranean should be avoided.""

In fact, marine parks are solely for environmental protection, but behind every map of the Aegean presented by Greece or Turkey, the other side sees a provocation.

Ankara reacted immediately on August 2, with officials presenting maps of Turkey's own ""protected marine areas"" in the northern Aegean and eastern Mediterranean from Rhodes to the Gulf of Antalya.

The Greek Foreign Ministry struck back, describing Turkey's announcement as ""an unacceptable, unilateral and illegal act that has no legal effect on Greek sovereignty and constitutes a complete disregard for international maritime law.""

Turkish tourists on Lesbos, however, are not bothered by these rumbling political disputes — they're too busy enjoying the beauty of the island.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war in Gaza can “end tomorrow” if ”Hamas lays down its arms and releases all the remaining hostages.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Israel's new military offensive in one of Gaza's most populated areas amid growing condemnation at home and abroad, declaring that this is “the best way to end the war and the best way to end it speedily.”

Relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza on Sunday called on Israeli companies to strike next week to pressure the government to reverse its decision to take over Gaza City.

Foreign nations continued airdropping aid in Gaza on Sunday following Israel's announcement of its plan to retake Gaza City in another escalation of the war.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday defended a new military offensive in Gaza that's more sweeping than previously announced, declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel “has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.”

Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the camps of Muwasi and Deir al-Balah. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas.

The crowded camps — sheltering well over a half-million displaced people, according to the U.N. — had not been part of Israel's announcement Friday. It was not clear why, though Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be “safe zones,” but such designated areas have been bombed in the past.




Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his “steadfast support.”

Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a “global campaign of lies,” Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.

“Our goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza,” Netanyahu asserted.

Netanyahu said there is a “fairly short timetable” for next steps there, but didn't give specifics. The goals, he said, include demilitarizing the territory, the Israeli military having “overriding security control” and a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge.

Israel wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites in Gaza, he said, but in a later briefing to local media, he asserted: “There is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.”

Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to “bring in more foreign journalists” — which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war.

He again blamed many of Gaza's problems on the Hamas militant group, including civilian deaths, destruction and aid shortages. “Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists,” he asserted, adding that Palestinians are “begging” to be freed from them.

Hamas responded with a lengthy statement that summed up Netanyahu's remarks as “blatant lies.”

The United States defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.

The U.S. has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.

Other council members, and U.N. officials, expressed alarm. China called the “collective punishment” of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities.”

“This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,” said Ramesh Rajasingham with the U.N. humanitarian office. “Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.”

Israel faces growing action even by its closest allies. Netanyahu said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany had “buckled under” the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. Merz, for his part, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany and Israel were talking “very critically” but Berlin's overall policies of friendship haven't changed.

At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. The Associated Press spoke to witnesses of gunfire in the Israeli-controlled Morag and Netzarim corridors and the Teina area in the south. All accused Israeli forces of firing at crowds trying to reach food distributions or waiting for convoys.

Fifteen people were killed while waiting for trucks near the Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital.

The situation is a “death trap,” said Jamal al-Laweh, who said Israeli forces opened fire there. “But I have no other choice to feed the kids.”

Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital.

In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The AP could not independently confirm who fired. Awda hospital said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire.

Six other aid-seekers were killed while trying to reach GHF sites in Khan Younis and Rafah, Nasser hospital said.

The GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but operations have been marred by deaths and chaos.

Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: “There were no incidents at or near our sites today.” Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.

Israel's air and ground offensive has displaced most Palestinians and pushed the territory toward famine. Two Palestinian children died of malnutrition-related causes on Saturday, bringing the toll among children to 100 since the war began.

At least 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since June, when the ministry started to count them.

The hunger toll is in addition to the ministry's war toll of 61,400 Palestinians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, doesn't distinguish between fighters or civilians, but says around half of the dead have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties.

Hostages' relatives have urged a labor strike in Israel next week over the plans to expand military operations, fearing it will endanger their loved ones. Fifty hostages remain after being taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Twenty are believed to be alive.

Dozens of people sat outside the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem to protest Israel's offensive. “I think it's a horrible decision. It's like deciding that we don't want (hostages) alive anymore,” said one, Milly Rothschild.

In Xenobe Purvis's novel, a brood of odd siblings illuminates the fears of their fellow villagers.

Something is rotten in the village of Little Nettlebed. There isn't enough rain. A sturgeon of ungodly proportions has been beached on the bank of the Thames. Worse, five sisters have tried to save its life, defying both the mysterious beneficence that brought the fish to shore and local norms dictating that it must be killed for food. In the glow of the late-afternoon sun, the world is no longer beautiful. Instead, it is sickly, the light “jaundicing the saucers of white flowers” on an elder tree.

It is the early 18th century in Oxfordshire, England, and readers likely know how this story goes: A “season of strangeness” begins, and the witch, or witches, who are responsible must be found. Except it goes weirder, and wilder, in Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, The Hounding. The suspected witches in question—those five sisters—stand accused of transgressing nature by transforming not the world around them but their own bodies. The local ferryman, a perpetually inebriated and aggrieved man called Pete Darling, is convinced that he has seen them turn into dogs—and soon, almost everyone else in the drought-stricken village will come to believe him.

The bluntness of Purvis's title, which refers both to the girls transforming into dogs and to their neighbors taking up the hunt, is a hint: This is not a novel particularly interested in nuance. Instead, it wants to directly engage the subtext of all witch stories, in which femininity itself is perceived as a menace, and to try to understand why women are often seen as natural conduits for unnatural forces. Hence the sisters—because if a woman is strange and unnerving, a group of them connected by the inherited bonds that link sisters is even more so.

And oh, are these sisters strange. They are pale and aloof. They are prone to playing harmless but cruel tricks on people outside their own tight circle. They are largely indiscernible from one another, despite a helpful guide in the book's second paragraph. (Mary is the baby; Grace, the shy one; Hester, the tomboy; Elizabeth, the beauty; Anne, the eldest, unpredictable and independent.) Even their grandfather, the sole responsible adult in their lives, cannot quite distinguish their faces through his deteriorating eyesight. To others, they always appear as an odd unit.

They seem to speak a secret, frequently nonverbal language—one observed with fascination by Thomas, a hired man with only brothers, who becomes preoccupied with “their spiritedness and singularity, the way rumours around them bred.” They refuse to honor the etiquette of village life, a violation that triggers first Pete Darling's suspicion and then his rage. Robin Wildgoose, a local young man who is, like the sisters, not quite built to the village form, finds the fivesome a sticking point in his efforts to fit in. He likes them, but joining the collective dislike of them is a tempting route toward acceptance.

Read: A novel with a secret at its center

The novel is told through the perspectives of these men—Thomas, Pete, Robin—and that of Joseph, the girls' grandfather, and Temperance, the local pub owner's wife. The result is a refracted view: five girls seen by five curious outsiders who each learn something about themselves as they watch.

This is an old function of sisters in literature: They serve as a mystical sort of test for other, more central characters, usually men. The weird sisters of Macbeth show a once-honorable Scotsman that he is power-mad and disloyal. In early Arthurian legend, nine sorceress sisters, including Morgan le Fay, are fascinating and fearsome foes that test the mettle of knights and noblemen. And in the classic fairy tale “The 12 Dancing Princesses,” the man who solves the riddle of the titular sisters' nocturnal adventures is an old soldier, who wins a royal wife after many princes have died trying.

The Hounding transparently engages with that history; it is full of invocations of the sisters of fiction. As in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the second-eldest of five sisters is named Elizabeth. The girls' last name is Mansfield, as in Austen's Mansfield Park, a novel that arguably features one of the most provocatively unsympathetic pairs of sisters ever put to page. Purvis also makes sly references to other fictional women who have served as a moral foil; the nearly feral Hester, for instance, evokes Hester Prynne of The Scarlet Letter. The novel is daring readers to see past the stereotypes, while also trying to showcase their allure.

It only partially works. Purvis writes with a kind of lush violence that makes the sisters' experiences feel immediate and fresh. Hester is struck with fury upon the arrival of her first period, and takes to climbing trees and sobbing in protest. She'd rather be a pebble, says Anne, because “pebbles look very peaceful and are unencumbered by ugly things like blood and breasts.” This scene is key to understanding exactly what Purvis is after: She is taking the idea of women's bodies changing or behaving in alien ways to an extreme, and satirizing the cultural inclination to fear them.

Purvis leaves ambiguous whether the girls' transformation into dogs is real or something of a collective hallucination. But so long as the sisters aren't hurting anyone—beyond, perhaps, a few small slain animals—the novel asks why anyone should be so intensely afraid of them. The possibility of girls mutating into animals is certainly alarming, a startling aberration from the natural order; even the sisters' defenders struggle with squeamishness and suspicion once the hearsay starts to spread. But The Hounding questions why that alarm should curdle so quickly into animosity. Is the escalation, perhaps, a consequence of the fact that womanhood has always been threatening to some, and the rumor of the sisters' transfiguration gives the Pete Darlings of the world an acceptable outlet for their hatred?

Like many good questions, these ones risk inviting well-worn answers. In an indelible, grotesque scene, six young pregnant women are forced to carry the coffin of a peer who died in childbirth, as a ritual reminder of the fate that might soon await them. Unfortunately, that scene is capped by Temperance's musings about “the great, gruelling trial of being a woman in a world governed by men”—a nail hit too bluntly on the head. As the rumors about the girls spread, Robin Wildgoose thinks that girls “who became dogs, or who let the world believe they were dogs, were either powerful or mad: both monstrous possibilities.” The implied criticism of the idea that a girl must care what others think of her is both trenchant and tired.

Read: An all-female society, pushed to extremes

I wish there were more stories about persecuted women that don't lose a bit of steam due to predictability. But the inevitability of some triteness is perhaps, itself, part of what Purvis is trying to illustrate. Joseph thinks to himself that he'd “rather they were dogs than damaged girls”; after all, being a dog might be safer. People “dreaded and pursued them and might eventually ruin them,” Thomas reflects, as he falls deeper under the sisters' charms. “No other girls in history had ever met with such a fate.”

Of course, he's wrong about that. And yet. Although the novel reaches old conclusions about its old subject—that many girls in history have been unjustly persecuted, and many more will be—it did give me something new to think about. I found it in the image of that gargantuan sturgeon gasping on the riverbank, surrounded by onlookers torn between their yearning to tear into its flesh and their revulsion at its animal strangeness. The asphyxiating creature “was as thick and muscular as a man's torso,” Purvis writes; “From its face trailed long, white whiskers, twining and coiling like sea snakes.” After the girls make their ill-fated attempt to save the fish, Pete stomps on its head.

We are all just creatures in a world that can turn against us at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all. The rains can stop. The river can dry up. The route that once was safe will be safe no longer. Someone might see our beauty; someone else might want to crush the life right out of us. The Mansfield sisters show that writing a new story can be difficult. But they also reveal that the old story is new in every fresh life that it touches, that understanding a trope is not the same as being protected from it, and that persecution feels like a startling new invention when it comes for you—whether you're a fish, a dog, or a girl.

The Art of the Deal president hopes he can broker peace.

Vladimir Putin is coming to America, despite the international warrant for the Russian president's arrest, despite his years of hostile threats against NATO, and despite him showing no remorse for his invasion of a sovereign nation.

None of that matters to President Donald Trump, who announced Friday night that he would meet the globally shunned leader this Friday in Alaska. What does matter to Trump is that he may be able to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine, the worst European conflict since World War II, fulfilling one of his biggest campaign promises.

Many of Washington's European allies, Ukraine included, now worry that the Art of the Deal president could propose a solution to this conflict that makes concessions to the aggressor, including and especially a redrawing of Ukraine's borders, when he sits with Putin. Putin has made no commitments to cede territory or scale back Russia's aggressive military campaign, and he has long claimed that Ukraine does not exist. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a video message yesterday, angrily condemned the notion that Trump and Putin alone could decide Ukraine's future. “Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace,” he said.

Trump, who has grown frustrated in recent weeks with Putin's lack of enthusiasm for compromise, had set a deadline for Russia to come to the negotiating table or risk increased tariffs and other punitive measures. He even threatened to move nuclear-armed submarines closer to Russia, and vowed to punish India—one of the largest buyers of Russian oil—for helping bankroll Moscow's energy sector.

Trump had promised to end the conflict before even stepping foot inside the White House. As months passed with no deal, Trump finally came to believe that Putin was to blame.

But signs that an end to hostilities between Ukraine and Russia was remotely plausible came the day after Trump's envoy to the Middle East (and beyond), Steve Witkoff, returned early this month from Israel. Through back-channel discussions with a close Putin ally, Witkoff—the real-estate executive who, like Trump, is more dealmaker than diplomat—received word of the Russian leader's new willingness to discuss ways to end the fighting.

Witkoff had reason to believe that talks were in the making, but he did not want to discuss the details over the phone, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions weren't public. After giving his pilot a night off in Miami, Witkoff shuttled back to Washington to brief Trump, Vice President J. D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on what he had learned, before heading to Moscow last week to get a face-to-face guarantee from Putin that he would attend an in-person meeting in good faith. “We are not going to send Donald Trump there if it's not perfect,” a top Trump adviser told us. By Wednesday, Trump and Witkoff looped in European allies, including Zelensky, on Witkoff's meeting and their plans to get Trump and Putin in a room together.

Trump is open to including Zelensky in the Alaska talks this week, a White House official told us. But for now, at Putin's request, the Ukrainian leader has not received an invite. “The President hopes to meet with Putin and Zelensky in the future to finally bring this conflict to an end,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told us in a statement.

Zelensky's resistance risks provoking the ire of Trump, who often hails himself as a peacemaker in a world that, in his telling, had plunged into warfare and chaos during Joe Biden's presidency. There is real worry in Kyiv and Europe about the deal Trump may strike, especially as public opinion about U.S. assistance to Ukraine continues to sour, particularly among Republicans. At most, European and U.S. officials believe that Trump may walk away with some flimsy guarantees to freeze the conflict—meaning that Ukrainian territory captured by Russia since February 2022 will stay in Russian hands.

That, according to Zelensky, is a nonstarter.

Trump has disliked Zelensky dating back to their “perfect call” in 2019 that ultimately led to his first impeachment, and he views Ukraine as undeserving of U.S. support. Trump also remains skeptical of the traditional transatlantic alliances prized by his predecessors, and he routinely calls out Europe for failing to share more of the burden regarding NATO's collective-defense agreement.

Trump's skepticism of Ukraine was shaped even before he became president, when, in the thick of the 2016 election, the country's anti-corruption agency released information alleging payments to his campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort. In White House meetings and talks with foreign leaders during his first term, Trump repeatedly described Ukraine as “totally corrupt” and full of “terrible people.” Trump has even repeated Kremlin talking points that Ukraine is to blame for the war.

Trump has long believed that he and Putin share a special rapport. Allies say he felt that the two survived the “Russia, Russia, Russia hoax” together, and that Putin would respect his historic political comeback. Trump has been deferential to his Russian counterpart, fueling speculation about the true nature of their relationship in global capitals since his first term in office.

At their introductory meeting in Germany, in 2017, Putin urged Trump to recognize Russia's claim of sovereignty over part of Ukraine, citing links dating to an 11th-century political federation located in modern-day Ukraine, Belarus, and part of Russia. Former officials with direct knowledge of the meeting said that Trump listened intently to Putin's soft-spoken argument against Ukrainian sovereignty.

But Putin, a shrewd former Russian-intelligence officer, has never quite returned the affection. He openly admitted, when asked during the leaders' 2018 Helsinki summit, that he had hoped Trump would win the election two years prior, although he never owned up to interfering in the contest on the Republican candidate's behalf. He has been at times cool to Trump in recent months, including being slow to congratulate him on his election.

Administration officials like to note the state of play when Trump took office the second time, emphasizing how much the U.S.-Russia relationship has deteriorated since February 2022, as Putin has been isolated from much of the Western world, particularly after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the war in Ukraine (the U.S. is not a party to the Rome Statute of the ICC). Witkoff, officials say, has largely been responsible for restoring those direct lines—something you want intact when dealing with two of the world's biggest nuclear powers. Witkoff “speaks directly for the president,” one person said. “Trump is a chameleon, but when it comes to Witkoff, the two are in lockstep.”

Trump has many people he calls friends, but few like Witkoff; the men have the same background in New York real estate, and Witkoff made a point of not abandoning the president during his months of political exile after he left office, in 2021.

A person familiar with the White House discussions said the members of the small senior national-security team supporting Trump all bring different perspectives to the peace talks. Vance has long been a skeptic of U.S. involvement in Ukraine. Rubio has taken a more hawkish approach to Russia. Witkoff and Trump consider themselves dealmakers, often speaking with each other in front of the others in a language the others don't speak, the person said. Still, Trump came into office believing that he could quickly deliver a cease-fire. For months, he generally sided with Moscow in its war against Ukraine, absolving Russia for having started the conflict and threatening to abandon Kyiv as it mounted a desperate defense. He upbraided Zelensky in the Oval Office in February, and briefly stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine. He believed that he could, in addition to working with his Russian counterpart to end the war, reset relations and forge new economic ties between the two countries. He even envisioned a grand summit to announce a peace deal.

But Putin rejected repeated American calls to stop his attacks. And Trump, in recent months, began to take that personally, complaining privately to advisers—and then eventually in public—that Putin would tell him one thing in their phone calls (that he was committed to peace) and then act entirely differently afterward (by bombing Ukraine).

Putin only ratcheted up his attacks as the weather warmed and Russia began a renewed summer offensive. Some aides close to Trump came to believe that Putin would signal a willingness to negotiate—including agreeing to some low-level meetings with the Ukrainians in Turkey this spring—in order to buy time to continue his offensive.

Trump's recent sanctions threat played a role in pushing Putin back toward negotiations, aides believe. The president imposed some steep secondary sanctions on India but held off on punishing other nations that do business with Moscow—namely China—and he did not sanction Russia directly by Friday's deadline, giving Putin more time to negotiate.

Read: Is Trump falling out of love with Putin?

Still, the president had remained intrigued by the thought of a summit's made-for-TV spectacle. When the idea resurfaced last week, Trump first said that he wanted an initial meeting with Putin, followed by a second one that included Zelensky. But the Kremlin balked at the subsequent summit, not wanting to legitimize Zelensky by putting him opposite Putin (Trump later said that Zelenky's eventual inclusion would not be a deal-breaker). White House aides are leery of dispatching Trump to meet with Putin without any guarantee of a deliverable goal—specifically, a cease-fire or, at minimum, a real step toward the cessation of hostilities. U.S. and European officials were still gauging whether Russia was serious about curtailing the fighting or simply buying time for more attacks to strengthen its position for future negotiations. And though Trump believes his own personal negotiating skills could sway Putin, it is not clear that Russia would offer an agreement acceptable to Zelensky.

Trump has long argued that it is always better to talk, regardless of who it is with, and he has especially emphasized that dialogue between nuclear-armed states, such as the U.S. and Russia, is imperative. He's been known to walk away from splashy summits when talks go awry, as he did in 2019 when he abruptly ended his Vietnam meeting with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong Un. He canceled a highly controversial Camp David meeting with the Taliban before it ever took place. But five days is also a long time in Trump's America, and these fragile efforts to get Trump and Putin in the same Alaskan meeting room could easily hit barriers before the delegations board their flights.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Trump warns homeless to leave Washington, D.C., ‘immediately'","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/10/trump-crime-washington-dc-border-.html","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 16:24:33 GMT","



President Donald Trump on Sunday again signaled that he is ramping up plans to target crime in Washington, D.C., even as data shows that crime rates in the nation's capital are falling.

He also issued a warning to the city's homeless population. ""The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

Trump's remarks come as he has increased his rhetoric about countering crime in the District in recent days, after a former member of the Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted in an attempted carjacking.

""It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""We went from millions pouring in, to ZERO in the last few months. This will be easier — Be prepared!""

""There will be no ""MR. NICE GUY."" We want our Capital BACK,"" he said.

Last month, Trump signed an executive order making it easier for cities to remove homeless people, drawing fire from advocates for the homeless. His social media post is the latest sign that he seeks to follow through on this effort, particularly in the nation's capital.

Trump's comments about crime in D.C. are at odds with data from the Justice Department that shows violent crime in the city in 2024 was at a 30-year low, and homicides, robberies and armed carjackings have all declined.

Trump also reiterated in his social media post that he plans to hold a press availability at the White House on Monday about crime in D.C.

In a subsequent Truth Social post later on Sunday, he said that the media availability will be Monday at 10 a.m.

He said his remarks will also ""be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital.""

The White House last week announced a seven-day effort to counter crime in the city, including an increased presence of federal law enforcement across the District.

The District has been a frequent target of Trump's, including during his first term. Still, his language has become more forceful in recent days, sparking ire from Democratic leadership in the city.

""Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said on MSNBC.

""I also just really want to say we always want to get better, and there are ways more than any other city in America that the federal government can help the District of Columbia,"" she continued.

Related Stories

Like many Americans, I had always dreamed up moving to Europe. And in 2015, at 35, I decided to leave Texas for Spain.

Two years later, I founded She Hit Refresh, a community that helps women over 30 take the leap abroad. Since then, I've helped hundreds of women build new lives in countries like Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands.

The most popular destinations among the women I work with tend to have warm weather and flexible visa options. Spain and Portugal top the list because they're relatively affordable for Western Europe, enjoy a relaxed pace of life, and have residency pathways that don't require you to be independently wealthy or retired. 

One country that few Americans could probably find on a map, let alone consider moving to, is Albania. But that's changing. 

In recent years, I kept hearing about Albania from members of my community. A handful had moved there and couldn't stop raving about it. Intrigued, I spent a month in Albania in 2024, mainly in the capital, Tirana, and along the coast. I wanted to see what the buzz was about, and what I found truly surprised me.

Albania may not be for everyone — no place is — but for many Americans dreaming of a soft landing, it checks a lot of boxes. Here's why I consider it the No. 1 overlooked destination in Europe for those hoping to relocate from the U.S.:

Albania is one of the few places in Europe where you can still rent a comfortable apartment for under $500 a month, according to the women in my network. This low cost of living is one of the biggest reasons Americans are flocking there.

Take Cheryl Orlov, who moved from Redondo Beach, California, to Tirana. ""Even though the cost of living is rising in Tirana, it's still a fraction of what I paid in California,"" she told me. Her rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Tirana, for example, is less than one sixth of what she'd been paying for a two-bedroom cottage in Redondo Beach before she left California in 2023.

Groceries, dining out, and healthcare are also much more affordable. For digital nomads and retirees alike, Albania offers a quality of life that's increasingly out of reach in many U.S. cities.

One of Albania's biggest advantages is that Americans can live there visa-free for up to 12 months, a rare benefit in Europe.

You can hop on a plane tonight and start your new life in Albania tomorrow, no paperwork required. This makes it ideal for those who want to ""test drive"" life abroad without navigating complex visa systems.

While in Tirana, I met with Denisa Kaca Bradley, founder of Expats in Albania, to learn more about immigration options. She explained that while staying beyond a year does require paperwork, it's possible and her organization helps newcomers with the process. 

At her weekly meetups, I met dozens of Americans: solo women, couples, and families. Many use Albania as a stepping stone. They stay for a year or two before moving on to another part of Europe once they've figured out the visa situation elsewhere. Others choose to stay long-term.

From the rugged Albanian Alps in the north to the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea in the west and the Ionian in the south, the country's landscape is breathtaking.

During my trip, I drove down the Albanian Riviera and visited Saranda, a lively seaside town with a beautiful promenade. It was September and the weather was still warm enough to swim and sunbathe, but the beaches were practically empty — a rare treat compared to places like Spain or Italy. On a clear day you can see Greece in the distance! The island of Corfu is just a 30-minute ferry ride away. 

I didn't make it to the northern mountains, but they're high on my list for next time. Remote villages, hiking trails, and gorgeous landscapes make it a dream for outdoor lovers.

Until the early 1990s, Albania was largely closed off to the world under a communist regime. Tourism has only really picked up in the last decade or so. As a result, Albania still feels authentically Albanian.

At the same time, Albanians are notably welcoming of Americans, something that surprised many expats I spoke with. The pro-America sentiment and friendliness to expats makes it easier for newcomers to feel at home and connect with the local community.

In cities like Tirana and coastal towns like Vlorë, there's also a growing number of foreigners putting down roots. Like Monica Miranda, an American who moved from Jersey City, New Jersey to Vlorë at 43 with her dog. ""I didn't know much about Albania,"" she told me. ""But the moment I arrived, something clicked. One month turned into two."" Monica has now lived in Albania for nearly two years and recently received her five-year residency card.

""I've built a supportive community of expats from the U.S., the U.K., Australia, and Latin America,"" she said. ""We catch up a few times a week. It's been an incredibly grounding experience.""

It may not be the first country that comes to mind, but for many Americans I've met, Albania has become the right place at the right time. 

Cepee Tabibian is the founder of She Hit Refresh, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad, and the author of ""I'm Outta Here! An American's Ultimate Visa Guide to Living in Europe."" As the daughter of Colombian and Iranian immigrants, Cepee grew up in Houston, Texas, before becoming an immigrant herself in Spain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Bitmine Targets 5% of Ethereum Supply in Bold Accumulation Plan","https://cryptodnes.bg/en/bitmine-targets-5-of-ethereum-supply-in-bold-accumulation-plan/","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 19:08:46 GMT","

Bitmine Director Tom Lee has laid out an ambitious roadmap for the company — securing ownership of 5% of the total Ethereum supply.

Lee described Ethereum as one of the most compelling macro investment opportunities of the next decade.

According to Lee, Ethereum's current market position mirrors Bitcoin's trajectory in 2017, when the leading cryptocurrency traded sideways for months before exploding in value. “Ethereum is at a similar point right now,” he said, adding that he believes ETH's growth potential now exceeds Bitcoin's.

Lee confirmed that Bitmine has been aggressively acquiring Ethereum at around $3,500, projecting that prices could hit at least $4,000 in the short term and possibly climb to the $7,000–$15,000 range by year's end.

The director also highlighted Bitmine's robust financial standing, noting a daily trading volume of $1.6 billion. This liquidity, he argued, fuels both operational expansion and broader sector growth. He emphasized that building large Ethereum reserves is not just an alternative to ETFs, but a form of critical infrastructure for the network — one that can also generate additional returns through staking and other yield strategies.

If Bitmine reaches its goal, it would become one of the largest single holders of ETH, potentially giving the company significant influence in the evolving DeFi and institutional adoption landscape.







Altcoins could be gearing up for a powerful rally, according to market strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who says price structures are showing early signs of a bullish breakout.

The coming week is shaping up to be eventful for crypto traders, with a mix of token-specific catalysts, company updates, and macroeconomic data poised to influence market sentiment.

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has made a quick about-face on his Ethereum strategy after a short-lived attempt to time the market.

New blockchain data suggests a major Ethereum accumulation trend is underway among deep-pocketed investors – many believed to be U.S.-listed corporations and institutional asset managers.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Peter Schiff, Euro Pacific Capital's chief economist, urges investors to exit Ethereum for Bitcoin, citing Bitcoin's 59.1% dominance and stability as digital gold.

- He dismisses Ethereum's recent $4,200 rally and ETF inflows as temporary ""bear market"" rebounds, noting its weakening price ratio against Bitcoin.

- Schiff argues Ethereum is losing its foundational role for decentralized apps despite DeFi growth, while Bitcoin attracts institutional inflows despite structural limitations.

- His Bitcoin preference stems from perceived long-term resilience, not technology, sparking renewed debate between Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum innovators.

Peter Schiff, the economist and chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, has reiterated his call for investors to divest Ethereum in favor of Bitcoin, despite Ethereum's recent price rally [1]. In his latest comments, Schiff argued that while Ethereum has shown signs of strength, its long-term prospects remain uncertain, and Bitcoin continues to serve as the preferred digital asset for its role as a store of value [1].

Schiff highlighted that Ethereum's recent gains, including a price rise above $4,200 and inflows into Ethereum ETFs exceeding $404 million, do not necessarily indicate a sustainable bullish trend [1]. He described Ethereum's rally as a typical “bear market rally,” suggesting that the upward movement could be short-lived amid broader market weakness [1]. According to Schiff, the Ethereum to Bitcoin price ratio has moved lower, reinforcing his view that Ethereum is weakening against Bitcoin in the short term [1].

While Ethereum has gained traction in the smart contract and DeFi spaces, Schiff contends that it is losing its original use case, which was to serve as a foundational platform for decentralized applications [1]. By contrast, Bitcoin, despite its structural limitations, remains the dominant asset in the digital gold narrative and continues to attract institutional inflows [1]. The Bitcoin dominance index currently stands at approximately 59.1%, a decline from its peak but still significantly higher than Ethereum's 13% market share [1].

Schiff emphasized that his preference for Bitcoin does not stem from a belief in the technology itself, but rather from its perceived stability and long-term resilience [1]. He acknowledged that both assets have flaws, but argued that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage and growing acceptance by institutional investors make it a safer bet in the current environment [1].

Despite the growing enthusiasm for Ethereum's technological advancements, including its transition to a proof-of-stake model, Schiff remains skeptical about its ability to maintain dominance. He urged investors to avoid the speculative nature of Ethereum and instead focus on Bitcoin, which he views as the more reliable asset in the crypto market [1].

His comments have reignited the ongoing debate between Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum supporters, with some emphasizing innovation and utility while others prioritize stability and long-term value [1]. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Schiff's contrarian stance reflects the broader uncertainty surrounding the future of digital assets in a volatile and rapidly changing financial landscape [1].

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Ethereum Bulls Continue to Charge Toward $12K as Price Briefly Breaks $4,300","https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/ethereum-eth-price-prediction-ethereum-bulls-continue-to-charge-toward-12k-as-price-briefly-breaks-4300","Sun, 10 Aug 2025 17:00:55 GMT","



Ethereum price today surged past $4,300 for the first time since December 2021, fueled by record institutional inflows, strong technical momentum, and renewed optimism around staking-inclusive ETFs.

The rally has analysts debating whether this could be the launchpad for a historic push toward $12,000.

Ethereum (ETH) has climbed over 19% in the past week, liquidating more than $200 million in leveraged short positions. In the last 24 hours alone, ETH gained 7.5%, briefly trading above $4,300 before consolidating near $4,250.

This surge has outpaced Bitcoin's 3% weekly increase, widening ETH's market dominance and pushing the total crypto market capitalization closer to $4 trillion. Popular on-chain analyst Tracer told followers on X that Ethereum is “about to break 4-year resistance” and that “$12,000 is not just a dream anymore.

The latest rally is being driven by large-scale buying from both institutional investors and whales. Data from The Boss shows that SharpLink Gaming increased its ETH holdings to $2.12 billion after a major purchase on August 8.

Whale activity has intensified, with a notable $40.5 million over-the-counter acquisition of 10,400 ETH in recent days. Standard Chartered's Geoffrey Kendrick predicts that corporate treasuries could eventually hold 10% of Ethereum's total supply — a shift that could rival the impact of spot ETFs.

Spot ETH ETFs themselves are enjoying unprecedented demand, posting twelve consecutive weeks of inflows totaling over $5 billion in July. On August 9 alone, ETH ETF inflows hit $461 million, according to analyst Ted.

From a technical analysis perspective, Ethereum has cleared multiple resistance levels. After rebounding from strong support at $3,470, ETH broke above the $4,193 Fibonacci 1.618 extension — a level often associated with accelerated price moves.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.8, just below overbought territory, leaving room for further upside. The “three white soldiers” candlestick pattern since August 5 signals persistent buying pressure, while the MACD remains strongly positive.

Key short-term price levels to watch:

Improving regulatory sentiment has also boosted Ethereum's outlook. The SEC recently clarified that liquid staking does not violate securities laws, paving the way for potential staking-inclusive ETH ETFs from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise.

At the ecosystem level, Ethereum Layer 2 growth continues to accelerate, with rising transaction volumes on Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. These scalability solutions are attracting new DeFi projects and NFT marketplaces, adding fresh demand for ETH.

While some analysts warn of potential retracement after such a rapid climb, the overall sentiment remains bullish. On-chain trends, ETF momentum, and macro breakout patterns all point toward continued gains.

Analyst Rekt Capital estimates Ethereum is only “50–60% through its macro uptrend,” leaving plenty of room for upside. If current momentum holds, ETH could challenge its all-time high of $4,868 in the coming weeks and potentially target $5,000 — with the more ambitious $12,000 forecast no longer seeming out of reach.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Altcoin Sherpa identifies nine altcoins (PENGU, ENA, LINK, etc.) poised to outperform the crypto market this month.

- PENGU nears $0.0433 resistance, while ENA surges 40% and targets $1.3-$1.5 if bullish momentum continues.

- Chainlink (LINK) remains a DeFi cornerstone, with $23-$30 price targets signaling potential cyclical peaks.

- Market diversification reflects growing institutional interest in altcoins with strong fundamentals and innovative use cases.

The cryptocurrency market continues to diversify as investors increasingly look beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum to altcoins with strong technical performance and compelling narratives. A pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa has identified nine altcoins expected to outperform the broader market this month. These include ENA, PENGU, HOME, AERO, DOLO, LINK, IP, PUMP, and PENDLE. The selection is based on recent price action, market volume, and projected momentum, suggesting a pattern similar to the 2023 “Mag 7” stocks' impact on traditional markets [1].

Among the highlighted altcoins, PENGU is showing signs of upward movement, rebounding from a $0.0330 floor and approaching a key resistance level at $0.0433. A breakout above this level could lead to a test of $0.04687 and potentially new all-time highs beyond $0.0689, assuming bullish momentum continues [1].

ENA has also seen a notable surge, rising over 40% in three days and encountering resistance at $0.804. A successful push above this level could accelerate its rally toward $1.3 and $1.5, signaling broader altcoin market strength [1].

Chainlink (LINK) remains a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, particularly for its oracle solutions. With price levels above $19.3 maintaining stability, the $23 to $24.7 range represents key targets for near-term gains. A move into the $27–$30 zone could indicate a cyclical peak [1].

PUMP, a Solana-based meme coin, is navigating a post-downturn scenario. After a challenging year marked by significant losses, the token is now testing support at $0.03, with a potential recovery path to its pre-sale price of $0.04. A sustained close above $0.035 could signal the start of a genuine rally [1].

The current market environment is shaped by a mix of speculative momentum and growing institutional interest. As investors seek high-growth opportunities, altcoins with robust fundamentals and clear use cases are attracting attention. While the performance of these coins remains speculative, they reflect broader trends of innovation and adoption in the crypto space [1].

Stanford University has confirmed its admissions policies for fall 2026 will continue considering legacy status, a decision that could influence access to one of Silicon Valley's most important talent pipelines. Stanford is also ending its test-optional policy, requiring SAT or ACT scores for the first time since 2021.

According to the Stanford Daily, the university is so committed to keeping legacy preferences that it's withdrawing from California's Cal Grant program, forgoing state financial aid rather than comply with legislation signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom last fall — Assembly Bill 1780 — which bans legacy admissions. The university promises to replace that funding with its own money.

This matters far beyond Palo Alto. Stanford has been the launching pad for countless tech leaders, from the founders of Google, Nvidia, Snap, and Netflix to other renowned CEOs and VCs. With legacy admissions intact, children of Silicon Valley's elite arguably maintain an advantage in accessing the network that has powered numerous tech booms.

The return of test requirements adds another wrinkle, potentially favoring students with resources for test prep. While supporters believe it maintains academic standards, critics argue that for an industry built on meritocracy rhetoric, Stanford's decisions represent a step in the wrong direction — reinstating standardized barriers and perpetuating inequality. 

Stanford last year announced its decision to reverse its 2021 decision to remove standardized testing as an application requirement. That the university will continue to consider legacy status was revealed this past week in newly released admissions criteria.

The policies take on added importance given universities' financial dependence on alumni support. Alumni donations are major financial contributors to educational institutions, particularly Ivy League schools. Princeton University, for example, received nearly half its donations — 46.6% — from alums in the 2022-2023 academic year. 

At Stanford specifically, most donations are either directed toward annual giving via The Stanford Fund, which spends the money immediately on current operations, financial aid, and other programs; or they are provided — more often — as gifts to Stanford's massive endowment (managed by Stanford Management Company), which spends roughly 5% annually on university operations, accounting for roughly 22% of its operating budget.

Universities depend even more heavily on alumni donations when facing external financial pressures, and new federal policies targeting higher education have created unforeseen and unprecedented budget issues for institutions like Stanford.

Stanford confirmed to the San Francisco Chronicle just last week that it will permanently lay off 363 employees, which is nearly 2% of its administrative and technical workforce, owing to what officials described as “ongoing economic uncertainty” and “anticipated changes in federal policy.” These include, most notably, a whopping increase in endowment taxes from 1.4% to 8% included in the Trump administration's “Big Beautiful Bill” that was signed into law last month.

That tax increase alone will cost Stanford an estimated $750 million annually.

Well, the coding-equals-prosperity promise has officially collapsed.

Fresh computer science graduates are facing unemployment rates of 6.1% to 7.5% —  more than double what biology and art history majors are experiencing, according to a recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York study. A crushing New York Times piece highlights what's happening on the ground.  

The individual stories are surreal. Manasi Mishra, 21, graduated from Purdue after being promised six-figure starting salaries, only to receive a single interview, at Chipotle. (She didn't get the job.) Zach Taylor has applied to nearly 6,000 tech jobs since graduating from Oregon State in 2023, landing just 13 interviews and zero offers. He was even rejected by McDonald's for “lack of experience.”

The alleged culprits? AI programming eliminating junior positions, while Amazon, Meta and Microsoft slash jobs. Students say they're trapped in an “AI doom loop” — using AI to mass-apply while companies use AI to auto-reject them, sometimes within minutes.

Thankfully, Mishra landed a job after one cold application that worked out. It's not in software engineering.

After showing off Tom Holland in his brand new suit for Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Sony continues its soft marketing launch with a new video showing its first day of production in Glasgow.

If you've been on social media in the past week, you've probably seen some snippets of filming from the public. This behind-the-scenes vignette offers a better quality of what those people saw with their own eyes, showing not just Holland wowing the crowd with his new suit (and taking pics with similarly dressed kids), but chatting with director Daniel Destin Cretton as they film a setpiece involving a tank likely in the posession of…someone; it's unclear who, but fans have their theories about who that insignia on the side belongs to. We still don't know who the film's main villain is, just that Hulk, Scorpion, and Punisher are all set to appear.

Our official reason for this video is August 10 marks Peter Parker's birthday in the MCU, referencing the cover date of Amazing Fantasy #15, where Spider-Man first debuted. But unofficially, it's also a way for Sony to tout that Brand New Day is being shot on location, and with real stunts to boot. Spider-Man: No Way Home was dinged for its sometimes iffy visual effects, some of which was owed to it being shot during the early days of the pandemic. Those times were stressful, according to Home trilogy director Jon Watts, but Marvel's now at a time where it wants to show its moviemaking homework. Thunderbolts was promoted with the promise of Florence Pugh jumping off a skyscraper and notable behind the camera talent, Fantastic Four used miniatures and sets, now here's Brand New Day doing its own version of both.

Spider-Man: Brand New Day comes to theaters on July 31, 2026.

After months of being a commercial disaster, something curious is happening with the Tesla Cybertruck. For the first time since its troubled launch, Elon Musk's futuristic pickup is showing signs of life.

The wait time for the Cybertruck's cheapest model has suddenly stretched to over a month, suggesting a spike in demand for a vehicle that, until now, almost no one seemed to want. The question is whether this is a genuine turnaround for the polarizing pickup or just a temporary sugar rush fueled by a looming government deadline.

The Cybertruck was never a normal vehicle. Unveiled in a now-infamous 2019 event where its supposedly “bulletproof” windows shattered on stage, the sci-fi pickup, with its radical stainless-steel design, was hyped by CEO Elon Musk as an indestructible truck that would change the world.

But after years of production delays, the reality has been brutal. In the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks, a staggering 50.8% plunge from the same period last year, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. The used car market has been just as unforgiving, with resale values crashing over 30% in the past year, according to data from CarGurus.

By all metrics, America's most hyped truck has been a commercial bust.

Tesla's Numbers Are In, and They're Not Good

That's what makes the latest change on Tesla's website so bizarre. As of Sunday, anyone ordering the base model “Long Range” Cybertruck (starting at $72,235) will now have to wait 3 to 5 weeks for delivery. Meanwhile, the two more expensive variants, the All-Wheel Drive and the top-of-the-line Cyberbeast, are listed as available for immediate delivery.

This suggests the sudden delay for the cheapest model is being driven by a surge in new orders. This theory is supported by the fact that other popular Tesla models, like the Model 3 and Model Y, have also seen their wait times increase from a few weeks to over a month in the last 48 hours.

The Great American EV Tax Credit Rush Has Begun

The most likely culprit for this buying frenzy is the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on September 30. For last-minute buyers, the base model Cybertruck is the most attractive target. Once the credit is applied, its price drops to a more palatable $64,735.

Tesla appears to be leaning into the rush. The company's website prominently features the tax credit, and a recent post on X from the official Cybertruck account touted its self-driving features, a clear move to capture the attention of buyers on the fence. “Cybertruck is the only pickup truck that can drive itself anywhere under your supervision,” Tesla posted.

— Cybertruck (@cybertruck) August 3, 2025



For a vehicle that has been bleeding momentum, this last-minute rush could be a chance to finally stem the bleeding. But the real test will come on October 1, when the tax credits are gone and the Cybertruck has to survive on its own merits for the first time. We'll soon find out if this is a real comeback or just the final, fleeting moment of a hype cycle that has finally run out of gas.

The Cybertruck has been a profound disappointment for Tesla, a vehicle that has consistently under-delivered on its own hype. After a disastrous second quarter and a collapse in the used car market, the company has been in damage control mode, even offering desperate promotions like a free accessory with purchase. The sudden spike in demand for the cheapest model is almost certainly a temporary blip caused by the expiring tax credit, a last-minute rush from buyers who see a chance to get a discount on a vehicle that has failed to justify its premium price. Once the government incentives are gone, the Cybertruck will face its true test, and all signs point to a continued and difficult road ahead for Elon Musk's sci-fi vanity project.

It's a major victory for the world's most valuable company in the ongoing tech war. The Trump administration has reportedly granted Nvidia a license to resume selling its specialized AI chips to the lucrative Chinese market, a decision that follows months of high-stakes lobbying and direct appeals to the White House by CEO Jensen Huang.

The move is a massive financial relief for the AI giant. It allows Nvidia to avoid a projected $8 billion revenue shortfall for the fiscal year and re-enter a market that Huang himself estimates will be worth $50 billion in the coming years.

According to the Financial Times, the breakthrough came after Huang's visit to the White House on August 6 to meet with President Donald Trump. Just two days later, the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, reportedly issued the first licenses for Nvidia to sell its H2O chips in China.

This decision is the latest chapter in the ongoing U.S.-China tech war. The core issue is the fear that advanced American technology could be used by Beijing to develop sophisticated military AI. To prevent this, the U.S. has imposed strict export controls, blocking the sale of top-tier AI chips to China.

Nvidia's most powerful processors, like its Blackwell series, are banned for export to China. In response, Nvidia cleverly designed the H2O chip, a less-powerful version of its advanced technology, specifically tailored to comply with the original export rules.

However, the Trump administration took an even tougher stance in April, banning the sale of even these de-powered H2O chips. The move sent shockwaves through Nvidia. The company was forced to halt shipments, resulting in a $4.5 billion charge for excess inventory and purchase obligations. In May, Nvidia warned investors that the restrictions would cost the company an estimated $8 billion in revenue for the full fiscal year.

Reversing this policy took months of intense diplomacy and lobbying, culminating in Huang's personal visits to the White House. The CEO's charm offensive appears to have worked, drastically changing President Trump's perspective on the company. During a White House AI summit last month, Trump admitted he had initially considered taking antitrust action against the chip giant before he got to know its CEO.

“I said, ‘Look, we'll break this guy up,' before I learned the facts of life,” Trump said of Huang during a speech. “I said, ‘Who the hell is he? What's his name? What the hell is Nvidia? I've never heard of it before.'”

The president continued, “Then I got to know Jensen, and now I see why,” inviting Huang, who was in the audience, to stand up. That meeting appears to have been the turning point, convincing the administration that protecting Nvidia's financial health was crucial for maintaining America's lead in the global AI race.

For Nvidia, the news is a massive relief. The company, which last month became the first to reach a $4 trillion market value, is now hovering around $4.45 trillion. With the $8 billion revenue threat now averted and the $50 billion China market reopened, investors will be watching closely when Nvidia reports its quarterly earnings later this month. Another strong report could easily push the AI titan past the unprecedented $5 trillion threshold.

Nvidia declined to comment. The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Handheld console modder @natalie_thenerd built a Game Boy Color motherboard using a fully clear PCB, allowing us to see its copper circuit traces in all their glory. According to her X (formerly Twitter) post, she built her own schematics to make it work, and she removed the ground zone to make the PCB completely clear. Although this is crucial for modern devices, Natalie says that it's not an issue with the handheld console because of its simplicity.

Clear PCBs feel illegal pic.twitter.com/lqIR3g6AtmAugust 6, 2025

Although the creator reverse-engineered the Game Boy Color on her own, she had the clear PCB created by a third-party provider. It used an acrylic-like material to build the see-through board, which had a low 200-degree Celsius melting point — meaning she had to be extra careful soldering the chips to avoid damage.

Aside from the chips, copper, and screen (and a small daughter board), everything else on her custom Game Boy Color is completely clear. Even the cartridge reader, which she says is from a Chinese Game Boy clone, is semi-transparent. She then paired it with a clear shell that featured translucent keys, making a true ‘see-through' handheld console.

Unfortunately, the custom-built clear Game Boy Color is a one-off art project she made for fun, so you cannot buy one for yourself. The clear PCB is flexible and fragile, meaning it may not withstand the rigors of daily use (or a rage-quitting gamer).

details: pic.twitter.com/jX5GETFtYZAugust 5, 2025

A couple of users suggested replacing the copper traces with silver for a cleaner look, or adding backlighting to make the handheld console look even cooler. Given that Natalie also created the Modded Gameboy Club and is active in the community, there is a possibility that someone might do just that.

A few other people thought about using the same technique on other devices, like the Nothing Phone 2. After all, the transparent aesthetic is experiencing a resurgence in tech circles, with the appearance of clear power banks, SSD enclosures, and more. But unless manufacturers can improve the durability of clear PCBs, and make them more affordable, we will not see this hit the mainstream.

Nevertheless, we applaud Natalie for her great work and marvel at the truly clear Game Boy Color. This is why we love modding and embrace the artistic creations that come out of this creative community.

Given the recent news cycle surrounding Intel's administration and its ambivalent future ambitions, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the company lacks proactive plans. However, it remains firmly in the chip making business, and the rumor mill is alive as ever. The Blue Team is working on its upcoming Panther Lake (mobile) lineup at the moment, set to release later this year, but it's next year's Nova Lake that has leaked yet again. This time, we have spied the purported exact core configs of all Nova Lake variants, including the top-end Nova Lake-HX chip.

Coming from reliable tipster Jaykihn, Nova Lake will launch in the usual HX, H, and U variants, each targeting different laptop categories. At the top, the highest-end Nova Lake-HX SKU will feature eight P-Cores, 16 E-Cores, and four low-power LP-E Cores, plus a quad-core Xe3 iGPU—a total of 28 CPU cores when added up. That puts it in the same ballpark as the current Arrow Lake 285HX, albeit with a different balance of high-efficiency cores.

Interestingly, this leak does not mention the Nova Lake-AX chips that surfaced earlier. Recently, reports have suggested these are seemingly on the chopping block already, which means Intel still won't have an answer to AMD's Strix Halo. Still, it paints a better picture than Panther Lake, which won't even have an HX variant, but both will fall far behind the rumored 48-core GPU that we might get with Nova Lake-AX.

Nova Lake Mobile2+0+4+24+0+4+44+8+4+44+8+4+128+16+4+4August 9, 2025

The mainstream Nova Lake-H tier will top out at 16 cores (four P-Cores, eight E-Cores, and four LP-E Cores) and offer up to 12 Xe3 GPU cores depending on SKU. These designs share similarities with the previously leaked Panther Lake-H chips, though with different CPU microarchitectures and a slightly altered GPU layout. Anyhow, we then have likely the Nova Lake-U family with a maximum core count of eight (4P+4LP) along with four Xe3 cores going to the iGPU.

On the lowest end, a 2P+4LP model is also expected, carrying only two Xe3 cores, positioned as the successor to Intel's Wildcat Lake platform, catering to budget notebooks where cost and battery life are the main priorities—justifying its lack of standard E-cores. This also means that, if we believe the leak, every single Nova Lake chip is going to have four LP-E cores.

Speaking of all the cores, the Nova Lake lineup is set to also introduce microarchitectures that diverge from the current Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake lineups. We expect to see Coyote Cove P-Cores and Arctic Wolf E-Cores, alongside Skymont-based LP-E cores. As mentioned previously, the GPU cores are from Intel's Xe3 'Celestial' architecture. We also got rumor-mill confirmation that Nova Lake mobile will not use two compute tiles like its desktop counterpart.

These configs round out the Nova Lake lineup. We've included a table below to better illustrate and compare the specs, but keep in mind that this just a rumor, and a potentially far-fetched one at that. Literally. Because Nova Lake is more than a year away and a lot can change before it actually releases. We're likely going to hear more about Nova Lake in the build up to its launch after Panther Lake—set to debut in the second half of this year—comes out, finally bringing Intel's 18A process node to the market.

Arne Slot and Oliver Glasner's sides could only be separated by spot kicks at Wembley, with the FA Cup winners trumping the Premier League champions

Liverpool were beaten in the Community Shield by Crystal Palace on Sunday, with the Eagles earning a 2-2 draw before winning via a penalty shootout. The Reds failed to put a winnable game beyond Oliver Glasner's side and were denied victory in the season's traditional curtain raiser.

A disappointing afternoon for the Merseysiders did begin brightly, as it took only four minutes for Liverpool to have lift-off, and it came from one of their newer faces. At the end of an extremely lengthy spell of possession - 22 passes featuring nine players, to be precise - Hugo Ekitike received the ball inside the left channel from fellow summer signing Florian Wirtz, and proceeded to dance his way between a horde of Palace defenders before curling an effort from the edge of the box into the far right corner, well out of the reach of goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

However, a few seconds of madness at the back saw the Reds pegged back midway through the first half. Firstly, Jean-Philippe Mateta broke the offside trap and had only Alisson Becker to beat, only to fail to round the goalkeeper. However, Palace regained possession in the ensuing scramble, with Virgil van Dijk tripping Ismaila Sarr and conceding a penalty. Mateta subsequently stepped up and sent the Brazilian the wrong way to bring the Eagles level.

But Palace were only on equal terms for a matter of minutes, as another Liverpool new boy got on the scoresheet when Jeremie Frimpong scampered away down the right flank beyond Tyrick Mitchell and appeared to dink a cross towards the back post, only for it to float over Henderson and inside the net instead, restoring the Reds' lead.

Liverpool had chances to kill the game off in the second half, and were made to pay for their wastefulness when Palace equalised once more in the closing stages. Adam Wharton's clipped pass found Sarr galloping away from Van Dijk and the Senegal forward squeezed the ball in off the near post.

The south Londoners grew in confidence, and Liverpool had Milos Kerkez to thank for making a last-ditch challenge to deny Sarr his brace moments after he had scored Palace's second. VAR checked for a penalty for a handball against Alexis Mac Allister in the build up, though controversially decided the on-field decision was allowed to freely stand.

With the score at 2-2 at the end of 90 minutes, the tie went to a penalty shootout. Mohamed Salah, Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott all missed from 12 yards, however, as Palace triumphed 3-2 on spot kicks.

Tommy Paul played his first tour-level match in over a month and secured a victory in his opening clash at the Cincinnati Open. 

Kicking off his North American hard swing, the US star comfortably defeated Pedro Martinez in straight sets, besting the Spaniard 6-2, 6-2. 

It was his first professional bout since the third of July, when Paul's Wimbledon campaign ended in the second round after losing to Sebastian Ofner.

He joined a long list of seeded stars who exited the All England Club in the early rounds, including Alexander Zverev, Jack Draper, and Holger Rune.

After his lengthy break away from the sport, Paul said there has been a ‘crazy' change on the ATP Tour recently. 

Speaking to Tennis Channel after his victory, he said: “What's crazy is I feel like everyone can do everything now.

“[Jannik] Sinner is coming in [to the net] so much more now, I mean, you can tell it's something that he's been working on. 

“If he gets to the point where he's perfecting that, it's going to be really scary. It's already scary, but that's a real complete player. 

“And then with Ben [Shelton], I mean, I feel like he's always been an aggressive player. What I noticed in the tournament last week [the Canadian Open] was, I mean, he was really extending points.

“He was slicing his back in a ton. He was drawing his opponents forward. I mean, in the match versus Khachanov, it was incredible to me, like the amount of short slices he did to bring him into the net.

“Ben's always been pretty good at the net, but he's gotten a lot better. I mean, it's really great to see. I love watching that kind of tennis.

“I mean, even [Jenson] Brooksby, Brooksby does a lot of the short slices and gets to the net and just makes it uncomfortable. I like that stuff.”

Paul is currently ranked 16th in the world, but now has a chance to close in on the top ten at the Cincinnati Open. 

At the tournament last year, the American crashed out of the Masters 1000 in his opening matchup, suffering defeat to Flavio Cobolli over three sets. 

With his win over Martinez, he has already surpassed his finish in 2024, and can now pick up some valuable points. 

His next opponent is Adrian Mannarino, against whom he has a head-to-head record of 1-1. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

At Wimbledon earlier this summer, the tennis world said goodbye to another star of the golden generation, as Fabio Fognini bid farewell to fans on Centre Court.

In the final match of his career, Fognini forced Carlos Alcaraz to a fifth set and was on the verge of delivering an enormous upset in round one at the championships. 

It wasn't to be for the 38-year-old Italian, however, who conceded the decisive set to Alcaraz, before receiving a standing ovation from the crowd as he left the court for the final time. 

Over a month after announcing his retirement, Fognini has reflected on his decision to move on to pastures new. 

In an interview with Tennis World Italia, he said: “Since I stopped playing, I haven't touched my racket and I've watched very few highlights of the Wimbledon match.

“I haven't had the chance to see myself again, being very self-critical. I haven't seen myself again yet; I haven't made it.

“I've never hidden myself with words; I have to be honest. Everyone has their own personality.”

“Some guys might ask me for advice on management. I've had my career, could I have done more? Yes. I think not changing as a player has been my best quality.

“For me, the person comes before the player; winning shouldn't have changed me as a person. I'm happy to have the opportunity to talk about it now.”

Fognini won nine ATP singles titles since turning professional in 2004, eight of which came on his preferred surface of clay.

The former world number nine clinched a maiden Masters 1000 crown in 2019, when he emerged victorious in Monte-Carlo.

In singles his best result at a major was a quarterfinal finish at the French Open in 2011, but in doubles he is a Grand Slam champion.

Alongside compatriot Simone Bolelli, Fognini won the 2015 Australian Open title, with the two becoming the first all-Italian men's pair to win a major title in the Open Era.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Holger Rune and Amanda Anisimova are one of the superstar partnerships for the US Open mixed doubles event this year.

The US Open mixed doubles event has been revamped for 2025, a decision which has split opinion across the board.

This change has attracted many star names, with mixed doubles teams including Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu.

Rune is also part of the US Open mixed doubles event, and he has now revealed he made a prediction about his partner that nearly came true.

It has been a breakout year for Anisimova, who won the Qatar Open title back in February to kickstart what has been an impressive season.

The American continued this form into the grass court season, beginning with Anisimova reaching the final of the Queen's Club Championships.

This year was the first time that men and women both played at Queen's since 1973.

Rune, who was also competing at the Queen's Club Championships, has now revealed that he predicted Anisimova would win Wimbledon after watching her play.

“You know it's actually funny, people can think maybe I am lying, but I am not I promise,” Rune told Tennis Channel. “I said in Queen's that I thought she was going to win Wimbledon and then she made the final. 

“But, you know she's really improved, been through a lot also. But yeah, it's just amazing to be able to share the court with her.”

Rune's prediction almost came true, before Anisimova suffered a heavy defeat in the Wimbledon final to Iga Swiatek.

As with many teams at the US Open mixed doubles event, this is the first time that Rune and Anisimova have played together.

Rune has never played mixed doubles at a Grand Slam before, while Anisimova does have some experience.

In her three previous Grand Slam mixed doubles appearances, Anisimova has partnered Nick Kyrgios, Christian Harrison and Michael Mmoh.

Although Anisimova has never surpassed the second round of a mixed doubles Grand Slam, she has twice lost to the eventual champions, and the other time to the runners-up.

Both Rune and Anisimova will look to be the champions at the US Open mixed doubles event, which takes place on August 19-20.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Paula Badosa has officially withdrawn from the U.S. Open after the Spaniard posted an emotional message on Instagram.

Badosa, who is currently ranked 12th in the world, has not played since she was beaten in the first round at Wimbledon by Katie Boulter in three sets. On Friday, the 27-year-old, who recently announced her split from fellow tennis star Stefanos Tsitsipas, confirmed she would be withdrawing from the final major of the calendar year, set to run from Aug. 24 to Sept. 7.

""It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing my withdrawal from this year's U.S. Open,"" Badosa, who reached the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows last year wrote on social media. ""This decision was incredibly difficult to make. After the amazing run I had in New York last year and the deep connection I feel with the city and its fans, stepping away from this tournament is very emotional for me. The U.S. Open has always meant a great deal to me, and I have created some of my most special memories there.""

The Spaniard has battled a chronic back injury over the years, which she has herself admitted could force her into retirement prematurely.

And now in the wake of her announcement, Badosa has posted another message on social media for her fans, which has hinted that she could be set for some time away from the court as she looks to battle her way back from a setback.

A post shared by Paula Badosa (@paulabadosa)

Posting on Instagram, Badosa said: ""I wasn't built by easy days. I was shaped by the moments that broke me, the choices that didn't go as planned, and the times I fell short of who I wanted to be. My setbacks weren't signs that I was weak; they were necessary chapters in a story that's still being written.

""Failure taught me what success never could. It humbled me. It forced me to look inward, to ask hard questions, to rebuild with more intention and clarity. Every mistake I made sharpened my understanding of who I am and who I'm not. And while I once feared those mistakes, I now see them as some of my greatest teachers.

""There were times I thought I'd lost everything, my direction, my confidence, my sense of worth. But looking back, I realize I was only losing what no longer served me. Every loss gave space for growth. Every closed door redirected me toward a better one.

""I'm not proud of every moment in my past, but I am proud of the person those moments created. The human I am today is more resilient, more aware, and more grounded because of everything I've survived and learned.

""I don't run from failure anymore. I respect it because it's the reason I stand here… Stronger, wiser, and still becoming.""

And her decision to pull out of the US Open will now also mean British star Jack Draper now needs to find a new mixed doubles partner for the tournament.

By Gianni Taina

Australian tennis has produced legends like Rod Laver, John Newcombe, Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter, and Lleyton Hewitt. In recent years, new talents have emerged, but some—like Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic—have attracted more attention for off-court incidents than on-court achievements.

Born in Australia on October 21, 1992, Tomic picked up the sport at an early age under the guidance of his father, John—a hands-on presence who would later spark several controversies. As a junior, Tomic stood out, winning two Grand Slam titles: the 2008 Australian Open and the 2009 U.S. Open.

Back in 2009, Tomic was one of Australia's hottest tennis prospects, while Lleyton Hewitt was still the face of Australian tennis—a proven Grand Slam champion and Davis Cup stalwart. That September, a story from Hewitt's then-manager, David Drysdale, caused quite a stir.

Drysdale recalled: “We turned around and saw Tomic's fans nearby, and I thought, ‘Oh, maybe he got our message and is here to hit with Lleyton.' So Hewitt's physio went over to Bernard's coach and asked, ‘Is Bernard here to practice with Lleyton?' Rudy didn't know anything about it, but said, ‘Look, Bernard is looking for a hitting partner, and I think he'd like to.' But then Bernard's agent walked in and said, ‘No, he's not here to practice with Lleyton—Lleyton's not good enough'”.

According to Drysdale, those were the exact words: “Lleyton's not good enough”. The comment stunned Hewitt and his team. “Lleyton just couldn't believe it,” Drysdale said. “And the more he thought about it, the angrier he got”. Ironically, years later, Tomic and Hewitt would end up sharing the court—this time as teammates for Australia in the Davis Cup.

Tomic cracked the ATP Top 100 and reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 2011. He won his first ATP title in January 2013, added back-to-back Bogota crowns in 2014 and 2015, and peaked at a career-high No. 17 in 2016.

Wimbledon is one of the crown jewels of the tennis calendar—an event every player dreams of competing in. But for Bernard Tomic, two appearances at the All England Club ended in controversy and fines rather than glory.

The first incident came in 2017, when Tomic fell to Mischa Zverev—brother of Alexander—in the opening round. After the match, he admitted in a press conference that he had faked an injury to slow things down, which led tournament officials to hit him with a £13,000 fine. In that same presser, Tomic made headlines with a blunt statement: “I don't care if I make the fourth round of the U.S. Open or lose in the first round. I'm going to play another ten years, and I know after I retire I won't have to work again”.

Two years later, in 2019, Tomic faced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first round and lost 6-2, 6-1, 6-4—in just 58 minutes, an unusually short duration for a best-of-three-sets match at the Slams. Wimbledon officials determined that Tomic had violated the tournament's code of conduct by failing to put forth his best effort. As a result, they withheld his £45,000 prize money.

After several seasons where he appeared increasingly disconnected from the sport, Tomic's performance and ranking took a significant hit. No longer in the ATP's spotlight, the Australian was forced to return to the Challenger Tour—where he once again drew headlines for all the wrong reasons.

In 2024, two incidents stood out. The first came in August at the Santo Domingo Challenger, where Tomic lost in the quarterfinals to Andy Andrade. When Andrade later played Damir Dzumhur in the final, Tomic showed up in the stands and began heckling him, leading to his ejection from the venue.

Just two months later, Tomic reached the final of the Fairfield Challenger against Learner Tien, but suffered a lopsided 6-0, 6-1 defeat in only 39 minutes. The opening set lasted just 16 minutes, making it the shortest final in Challenger history.

After improving his ranking, Tomic earned opportunities to compete in higher-level events again. In 2025, he entered qualifying rounds at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros, and also played in several ATP tournaments. In June, he secured his first ATP Tour victory in four years.

Speaking to Punto de Break in March 2025, Tomic reflected on his career and personal growth: “When you have an engine and a purpose, you get up every day with something to focus on, something to do. Everyone needs a purpose in life. I felt I played really well in my career during the first five, six, or seven years, but after that I wasn't playing this sport enough. Now I'd rather not have that much attention—being in the media spotlight isn't good”.

The Grandstand Court witnessed a remarkable encounter on Saturday. This season's Australian Open queen Madison Keys was up against a formidable rival, Germany's Eva Lys. While the pre-match expectations were mostly siding with Keys, the end result was far from it. Lys gave the American WTA star a run for her money. So much so that it edged to a nail-biting finish. Keys has a tendency to rebound and claw her way back from the jaws of defeat. From a point where she nearly lost the match, the World No.6 somehow turned things around, hilariously, to her own astonishment.

Lys began the proceedings one-sided. She snatched the first set with a breadstick against the slam winner. However, Keys then responded equally, taking the second set 6-3. But it was the decider that was action-packed and popcorn-worthy. At one point, Lys was leading 3-0 on her way to taking the second round. But Keys was unrelenting. She leveled the score yet again in the last set and was on the verge of victory at 5-4. Cue, plot twist. Lys fought back, determined, and forced the battle into a tie-break after the set reached 6-6. It was at this moment, though, that Keys really burst through. The tie-break was one-sided as she snatched her ticket to the next round with a final score line of 1-6, 6-3, 7-6(1).

Of course, the American star was extremely happy with her performance. But during the post-match interview with Tennis Channel‘s Prakash Amritraj, she was amused with the way she won. The host curiously shed light on a special habit of Keys' where she's “come back from the brink (of defeat) a bunch of times this year.” Keys responded, saying, “Yeah,” to which Prakash told her, “That's a pretty special talent, you know. Well, I mean..I don't know.” Having no better way to react, Keys just said, “I mean, better than the alternative, I suppose. But also, like, what am I doing?”

The alternative here is losing, for which the host said, “Well, you obviously never do that.” “Well, okay, that's fair. But look, the good news is, it didn't end that way. Found a way to come back. A lot of players might not have found a way to come back.” While still perplexed about this specific acknowledgement, she commented, “Okay, that's great. But like, what am I doing?” 

Prakash then decided to close out the unintentionally humorous interaction, saying, “You know, Mady, I can't answer that. I really can't. But it is, it's always unbelievably entertaining to watch.” Left in splits, Keys humbly said, “Well, I'm glad you guys are entertained.”

But reverting to the match itself, it was one hell of a rollercoaster ride for Keys. And she made it evident with a post-match reaction that revealed her real motivation behind the comeback against Lys.

For the uninitiated, Saturday's match marked the first meeting between Madison Keys and Eva Lys. While the American has been a former Cincinnati queen on the hard court, she still couldn't figure out a way to dominate the German. Owing to the fact that she didn't have a clue about her playing style beforehand.

Does Madison Keys' ability to win from the brink make her the most entertaining player today?

Debate

After losing the first set, it looked too difficult for her to make a comeback. Still, she made it to the end. After her Australian Open triumph, Keys has struggled a lot to overcome lower-ranked players. Yes, she's won a total of 14 of her eighteen encounters against opponents outside of the top 50. But three of her recent losses have been frequent since June. After a QF run in Paris, she lost early at the Queen's Club, then in Berlin, and also at Wimbledon.

Playing against Lys, there was added pressure to stay composed. “I just kept trying to listen to everyone here cheering me,” she said, as reported on the WTA's website on August 10. Perhaps that was the biggest motivating factor for the World No.6. “It helped me get back into the match and across the finish line.” Going forward, she hopes for the crowd to back her the same way.

Reilly Opelka snapped a five-match losing streak to Alex de Minaur on Sunday at the Cincinnati Open, where he upset the Australian 7-6(6), 6-4 to reach the third round in Ohio.

The big-serving American had lost his five previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings against De Minaur and was trying to avoid falling to the same opponent on six occasions for the first time. In hot conditions, the 27-year-old did just that, taking large cuts at the ball on return and saving all seven break points he faced to record his ninth Top 10 win after one hour and 41 minutes.

""I didn't serve as well as I'd have liked to, but everything else was working,"" said Opelka, who won 76 per cent of his first-serve points and 69 per cent of his second-serve points. ""My forehand helped me a lot and my backhand, playing with a lot of offense and I was pretty consistent from the baseline the whole match. My serve fluctuated and it was a bit of a surprise that the other things came through well for me today. I think I returned really well too.""

World No. 8 De Minaur arrived in Cincinnati having earned a Tour-leading 24 hard-court wins this season, highlighted by his recent title triumph in Washington. However, he was unable to convert his opportunities against Opelka, who struck a huge forehand winner on return at 5/5 in the first-set tie-break en route to claiming the opener.

Opelka is up nine spots to No. 64 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will next meet Francisco Comesana after the Argentine advanced on Sunday when 29th seed Luciano Darderi retired trailing 4-6, 1-3.
Opelka has produced some of his best tennis on the North American hard courts in the past, reaching the final at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Toronto in 2021 and the fourth round at the US Open in the same year. He clubbed 38 winners, including 14 aces, to De Minaur's six winners, with the Australian frequently returning second serves above shoulder height.

In other early action, ninth seed Andrey Rublev moved past #NextGenATP American Learner Tien 7-6(4), 6-3 to reach the third round. Rublev arrived in Cincinnati off the back of a quarter-final showing in Toronto, his best ATP Masters 1000 result of the year. The No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings will meet Alexei Popyrin or #NextGenATP Spaniard Martin Landaluce in the last 32.





There was Czech success for Jakub Mensik and Jiri Lehecka. Miami champion Mensik, 19, defeated American Ethan Quinn 6-4, 6-2 to earn his first win at the hard-court Masters 1000 event. Jiri Lehecka rallied past American Tristan Boyer 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 to reach the third round. The Czech advanced to the last 16 in Ohio in 2024 and will aim to reach that stage again when he takes on Daniil Medvedev or Adam Walton.

Student athlete Russell Lokko watched Tiafoe win against Roberto Carballes Baena from the best seat in the house: courtside in his player box.ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Aug 10, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 10, 2025

CINCINNATI, Ohio—College student Russell Lokko thought he was simply getting a meet-and-greet with Frances Tiafoe, a player he grew up watching, at the Cincinnati Open.Instead, the rising junior and standout tennis student-athlete at the University of Louisville received the surprise of a lifetime—a $30,000 scholarship over two years through the USTA Foundation's Frances Tiafoe Fund.Tiafoe delivered the news—and a giant check—while Lokko was opening a gift bag from the player's sponsors, including Lululemon, La Roche-Posay and Clif Bar, during a behind-the-scenes experience at the Lindner Family Tennis Center.“I'm super excited, and I'm really blessed that Frances gave me this check,” Lokko said. “It's going to take a lot off my parents, and it's going to help me stay focused on what I want to do in college.“I had no idea that he was going to give me this money… Growing up, Frances has always been a role model for me, so to get it directly from him is unbelievable.”Read More: Tommy Paul talks engagement, injury rehab at Cincinnati Open

The award will help cover the gap in scholarship funding so Lokko can continue his education at Louisville.Lokko grew up playing tennis at the NJTL of Trenton, a community organization within the USTA Foundation's National Junior Tennis & Learning (NJTL) network—the same network that supported Tiafoe's early training at the Junior Tennis Champions Center (JTCC) in his hometown of College Park, Md.“To see how ecstatic he was, and being able to take care of his junior and senior year is a huge deal, man,” Tiafoe said. “The son of immigrants… I've been in that seat. I know how it is, and the struggle for him to be able to do that.“If he gets a little push by me, and me being one percent of the reason why he's gonna become the man he's gonna be is incredible. That's why I created this fund within the USTA Foundation, to be able to do great things like that.”

During his visit to the Cincinnati Open, Lokko met Tiafoe, watched his practice, and shadowed him around the tournament grounds—building a mentor-mentee relationship along the way.“I was super excited about (the idea from USTA), because I get to meet somebody who I know looks up to me and be able to bless him along the way,” Tiafoe said. “It was an incredible experience, and I was even nervous about it today! I wanted everything to go smoothly and in the right way.”On Saturday night, Lokko capped off the experience in the ultimate way—watching Tiafoe win 6-4, 6-3 under the lights against Roberto Carballes Baena from the best seat in the house: courtside in Tiafoe's player box alongside his team.Co-founded in 1969 by Arthur Ashe, Charlie Pasarell, and Sheridan Snyder, the NJTL network is made up of more than 270 organizations nationwide that use tennis and education to prepare young people from under-resourced communities for the challenges and opportunities of life.

F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto recently sat down with Fred Vasseur for a chat about all things Ferrari.

We're on the top level of Ferrari's motorhome in Budapest, Hungary, and while the F1 crew are setting up their cameras and repositioning the sofas for our interview, Ferrari boss Fred Vasseur is leaning on the balcony, surveying the paddock containing the engineering trucks that will be under his leadership for at least the next couple of years.

The day before, Ferrari announced they had extended Vasseur's stay at F1's most famous team on a multi-year deal (the three-year contract he signed ahead of joining in 2023 expiring at the end of this season). It brought to an end speculation in the Italian press around the time of the Canadian Grand Prix that his position was under threat.

That speculation came despite the fact Ferrari were – and still are – second in the Teams' Championship, admittedly well adrift of McLaren but ahead of power houses Mercedes and Red Bull. It comes after Ferrari came closer to winning a title than they have done in more than a decade by taking the fight in the Teams' Standings to the wire last year.

The actor's fourth 'Spider-Man' film hits theaters on July 31, 2026.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Slipping into the Spider-Man suit is nothing new for Tom Holland, but he admits putting it on for the first time for the upcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day felt “different this time.”


	Filming for the fourth Sony/Marvel film began earlier this month, and the actor took to Instagram on Sunday to share a recap of “day one” back in the iconic super suit.




	“My fourth ever day one on Spider-Man,” he said in the minute-long video (below). “You know, it's funny putting the suit on. It feels different this time somehow. It's also the first time we've ever had fans on set for day one. So, it's really exciting to share this with them.”

	Holland added, “I'm just going to do my best. Hopefully get it right. No pressure.”


	On Aug. 3, The Crowded Room actor revealed his brand-new Spider-Man costume, which depicts a larger spider on his chest, compared to his previous suits in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Far From Home (2019) and No Way Home (2021).


	At the end of the new Instagram video, Holland says after doing a stunt, “Wow, that was a really good one. That felt sick.”


	In addition to Holland, it was previously announced that Mark Ruffalo would be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Bruce Banner/the Hulk in Brand New Day, as well as Michael Mando as the Scorpion and Jon Bernthal as the Punisher. Sadie Sink was also added to the cast.

	











	Most plot details are being kept under wraps on the Destin Daniel Cretton-directed superhero pic, though Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers returned to pen the script. At the end of No Way Home, Spider-Man's real identity as Peter Parker was erased from everyone's memory, including friends, family and his girlfriend, MJ (Zendaya).

The show got a lot of attention for its restaurant industry commentary. But what it's actually doing is telling us to get off the treadmill.


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


	At the end of The Bear‘s fourth season, Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) withdraws his stake in the restaurant and declares he's leaving the culinary industry altogether. In what can be described as either an act of martyrdom or growth, he acknowledges that all of his work has been linked to his familial trauma and gives Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) his stake, making his cousin, sister Natalie (Abby Elliott) and restaurant partner Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) its three owners.


	For a show that has spent all this time exploring the duality of abuse and resilience within the toxic kitchens of America's restaurants, it's a somewhat risky move. But through Carmy's choice, The Bear captures not just how we can use work to process, escape or bury our trauma, but also potentially destroy ourselves, our work and our relationships doing the things we love.

	That's not a particularly new thread for the series, which has spent four seasons exploring the destructive nature of passion, inspiring a wave of pieces about the restaurant industry and its many problems. But what has made the FX series one of TV's biggest hits is how it uses the professional kitchen to speak to a larger truth of toxic workplaces and mental health.




			Related Video		







	As Americans, we spend an estimated third of our lives working, and that work is seen by many as a major metric for evaluating self-worth. So if work offers feelings of joy, accomplishment or success, then you must be doing “well,” right? That's complicated in a culture where both blue- and white-collar Americans are working more than ever while facing stagnant pay and fewer promotions amid rising costs. It's a modern work culture in which jobs are also increasingly encroaching on our personal lives — from homes becoming offices (and as we front that cost) to personal devices delivering more work emails and messages in off-hours.

	











	It's harder to escape work, and as a result, American workers are facing more and more psychological and physical strain, leaving “work-life balance” in the dust. For those who don't have healthy mechanisms for dealing with their trauma, that can be appealing. Everyone knows that the relentless speed of Carmy's kitchen, and his more recent obsession with reimagining The Bear's daily menu, has been equally ambitious and outlandish. But if your work is how you bury your feelings, reimagining your restaurant every 24 hours — while creating an endless stream of impossible goals and expectations — means you'll never have time to think about those feelings.


	Instead, you can pile on more and more, distract yourself through the work and justify it all by the moments it's successful. In the meantime, you're chipping away at your sleeping, eating, relationships and other interests, becoming emotionally dysregulated and cycling among bouts of mania, fatigue, disassociation, anxiety and overstimulation. Destroying yourself for a job you need but hate while trapped in a cycle of survival and responsibility isn't the same as choosing a job you love that ultimately hurts you. As someone in the latter category, I know some people love work that doesn't love them back — and there's a reason why they like that dynamic.


	When I was 25, my mother died at 51 because she couldn't stop working. On paper, it was kidney failure following a series of undertreated disabilities and medical emergencies exacerbated by being a single parent working 40-plus-hour weeks in a position that was toxic and abusive. But even as she became increasingly sick and people began to tell her to retire early, she wouldn't stop. Ask anyone who knew her, and they'll tell you why: She loved the work she did.

	











	Carmy's complicated relationships (to work, alcohol) are learned responses from his mother, Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis), and something most recognize as a coping mechanism. For nearly a decade, I followed my mother on the path of weaponizing my work to find temporary relief from the mental discomfort and emotional pain of losing her. In our culture, (over)dedication to our jobs is championed, but like addiction, it can be destructive. I'm not sure I would've even realized that if I wasn't so quickly losing everything: friends and time with family, but also emotional regulation, mental and physical health and, ultimately, the drive to do what I supposedly loved.


	From the first season of The Bear, Carmy's been racing against a ticking clock — to save the restaurant, to reopen it, to make it profitable, to prevent his own implosion. With every new goal or demand, he's pushed himself and his kitchen further, resulting mostly in skin-of-their-teeth success. It's also created a fresh trail of injuries fueled by constant professional chaos, leaving less time and energy to tend to older wounds etched by familial trauma.


	And that's the whole idea. Carmy has given himself to his career and The Bear, not just because it's easier to explain away how you've destroyed yourself for something you love, but because transforming your dead brother's restaurant into a success in his honor is easier than addressing why you ran away from him and your family to begin with.


	But that's also why Carmy's decision to leave The Bear isn't just his avoidant coping mechanism. It's a sign of his resilience. For Carmy to get off the path of completely destroying what he and his crew love, he must accept that growth and healing will not always come from pushing through. No matter how many things or people you put between you and the bear, you cannot outrun it. You cannot outrun your trauma. You have to stop, get off the path and look it in the face.

Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem nets a 10th nonconsecutive week atop the Billboard 200 chart (dated Aug. 16). The set earned 136,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Aug. 7 (down 5%), according to Luminate. I'm the Problem debuted at No. 1 on the May 31-dated chart, spent it first eight weeks in the pole position, stepped away from the top for two frames, and then returned to No. 1 for the last two consecutive weeks.

			Trending on Billboard		







	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Aug. 16, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Aug. 12. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.




	Of I'm the Problem's 136,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 7, SEA units comprise 131,000 (up 2%, equaling 172.27 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for an 11th nonconsecutive week), album sales comprise 4,000 (down 5% — it rises 16-13 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (down 26%).


	Cumulatively, Wallen's three No. 1 albums (I'm the Problem, One Thing at a Time and Dangerous: The Double Album) have spent a total of 39 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. That ties him with Elton John for the fourth-most weeks at No. 1 among male artists in the chart's history, which dates to March 1956, when the chart began publishing on a regular weekly basis. Among male artists, the leaders are: Elvis Presley (67 weeks), Garth Brooks (52), Michael Jackson (51), John and Wallen (39 each), Harry Belafonte and Drake (37 each). Among all artists, The Beatles have the most weeks at No. 1, with 132 across 19 No. 1 albums.


I'm the Problem has now spent 10 weeks at No. 1, One Thing at a Time ruled for 19 nonconsecutive weeks in 2023-34 and Dangerous: The Double Album was tops for 10 straight weeks in 2021.


	In total, only six acts, including Wallen, have at least three albums that have spent at least 10 weeks at No. 1. He joins The Beatles and Elvis Presley (four such albums each); Whitney Houston, The Kingston Trio, Taylor Swift and Wallen (three each). Additionally, Wallen is the only act to spend at least 10 weeks at No. 1 with three consecutive full-length albums.


	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack holds at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, with 100,000 equivalent album units earned (its best week yet by units earned — up 7%). The set has posted a gain every week since its debut on the list seven weeks ago.

	











	Reneé Rapp achieves her highest-charted album yet (and first top 10) as BITE ME bows at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 with 64,000 equivalent album units earned — the singer-songwriter-actress' biggest week by units. Of that sum, album sales comprise 47,000 (her best sales frame ever, it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 17,000 (equaling 21.85 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs, it debuts at No. 34 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	Rapp previously placed one entry on the Billboard 200, Snow Angel, which debuted and peaked at No. 44 in 2023.


BITE ME's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across 11 vinyl variants (including signed editions) and five CD variants (including signed editions).


	$uicideBoy$ earn their highest-charted album as THY KINGDOM COME debuts at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 with 57,000 equivalent album units earned. It's the fifth top 10 set for the hip-hop duo, who had previously gone as high as No. 5 with their last charted project, 2024's New World Depression. Of THY KINGDOM COME's first-week units, SEA units comprise 34,000 (equaling 45.48 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it debuts at No. 6 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 23,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales, boosted by its availability across six vinyl variants) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	Justin Bieber's SWAG is a non-mover on the Billboard 200 at No. 5 (44,000 equivalent album units earned, down 16%), Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid climbs 8-6 (nearly 44,000, down 8%), Wallen's chart-topping One Thing at a Time rises 11-7 (39,000, up 1%) and SZA's former No. 1 SOS is up 12-8 (36,000, down 5%).

	











	Yeat collects his sixth top 10-charted effort as DANGEROUS SUMMER starts at No. 9 with 34,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 18,000 (equaling 25.83 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it debuts at No. 29 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 16,000 (boosted by its availability across three CD variants, all signed, exclusive to his webstore, it debuts at No. 3 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	Sabrina Carpenter's chart-topping Short n' Sweet rounds out the latest top 10, as it climbs 16-10 with 30,000 equivalent album units earned (up 5%).

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Refresh for latest…:  Two new studio movies entered the marketplace this weekend, and both exceeded expectations. 


	To wit: New Line/Warner Bros' Weapons led the charge for the studios at the international box office with the well-reviewed horror from Zach Cregger grossing $27.5M from 72 markets. Combined with domestic, that takes the global debut to $70M.


	Meanwhile, Disney's Freakier Friday, with a $15.5M overseas launch in 46 material markets, had a global bow of $44.5M.


	And, there's a new milestone afoot for Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth. Read on…

Weapons' international opening, in like-for-like markets and at today's exchange rates, is tracking above Speak No Evil (+164%), Smile (+77%), The Black Phone (+59%), Evil Dead Rise (+34%) and M3GAN (+29%).


	Notably, in Europe, Weapons was tops for the region including UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Holland and Poland. In like-for-likes, the debut was ahead of Sinners (+33%), Smile (+46%) and Speak No Evil (+110%).


	In Latin America, the film ranked No. 1 regionally, though came in below Freakier Friday in Mexico and some other markets. Still, it was above The Black Phone (+17%), Evil Dead Rise (+22%) and M3GAN (+32%) on a reigional basis.


	In Asia, Weapons topped studio play, far ahead of the above comps and with Indonesia particularly notable at No. 1 amid local horror titles which, as we know, increasingly dominate.


	The Top 5 overseas starts for the Julia Garner-starrer are: UK ($3.6M), Mexico ($2.7M), France ($2M), Australia ($1.8M) and Spain ($1.6M).

	











	The Imax portion worldwide was $8.1M, including $1.9M from overseas.


	Turning to the other new opener, Disney's Lindsay Lohan/Jamie Lee Curtis reteam, Freakier Friday, the body-swap comedy saw overperformance in Latin America, landing a surprise No. 1 in Mexico ($2.8M) and other regional markets.


	Overall, the female and family-skewing pic opened bigger than 2003's Freaky Friday and 2024's Mean Girls in like-for-like markets at current rates. The film is yet to open in Korea, Japan and some smaller Asian territories..


	Talent traveled to Mexico City and did a junket for Latin America which clearly helped — other Lat Am markets that debuted to No. 1 include Argentina, 


	Across Europe, Freakier Friday opened at No. 2 in the UK, among others, and No. 3 in Italy. In Australia, the comedy scored a No. 2 debut. 


	The Top 5 overseas markets at open are: Mexico ($2.8M), UK ($2.4M), Australia ($1.4M), Argentina ($800K) and Colombia ($800K).

	This frame added $17.5M overseas, a 56% dip. In Brazil and Chile, the fantastic family held No. 1 and is the highest grossing superhero release of 2025 across the Latin American region.


	Here are the Top 5 so far: UK ($25.5M), Mexico ($24.2M), France ($12.5M), Brazil ($11.6M) and Australia ($9.7M).


	As noted above, Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth is on the cusp of crossing $800M global, repping only the third studio movie to the milestone this year. The estimated offshore cume is $473.2M through Sunday with worldwide at $799.9M.


	Amid a 50% overseas drop during this 6th session, Mosasaurus & Co added another $16.1M in 83 markets. Japan, the final market to release, opened at  $7.5M, the biggest 3-day launch for a studio title since The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023. It's in line with 2015's Jurassic World, well above the 3-day openings of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and A Minecraft Movie, more than 3x The Fantastic Four: First Steps, and more than double Superman and F1.


	The weekend gross there, despite competition from local title Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, will surpass the total lifetime of Gladiator II and Captain America: Brave New World in the coming days.


	The Top 5 JWR markets to date are: China ($78.1M), UK ($45.3M), Mexico ($35.3M), Germany ($30.5M) and France ($26.6M).


	And, after becoming Brad Pitt's highest-grossing movie ever worldwide, Apple Original Films' F1, via Warner Bros, is still seeing incredible holds. Down just 34% overseas, this session put another $11.7M in the tank in 77 markets. The overseas total is now $392.1M for $570.7M global.

	The Top 5 markets through Sunday are: UK ($5.9M), Germany ($4M), Netherlands ($1.3M), Mexico ($1.2M) and Austria ($728K).

Superman will end up 100 million short of breaking even.

F1 and Superman are looking quite close in the end.

Weapons is not a hit. Every smart movie fan knows that in order to calculate a film's success first you double the budget. Then you double the marketing budget then you add those 2 numbers together and then double that. You then assume it got 0 tax rebates and that the theaters take 20 percent more than they actually do. Once this is done you realize Weapons like most movies needs 700 million to break even. 70 million is not good in my book.

I feel like this post is intended to be read as tongue in cheek, presumably to mock the dozens of comments under every box office report claiming Superman needs $700M to break even. Correct?

If you're that butthurt about Fantastic Four flopping then Avegers Doomsday will be the end of you😆

Weapons' budget was $38M… what are you talking about? Breakeven is $200M even if marketing was $62M (which I doubt).

“movie fan”? You seem to have that term confused with “broken calculator fan.”

Actual movie fans had a blast at this movie. The end.

Oh look, another bitter Marvel bro

Can you blame Marvel fans for being bitter?  The past few years have been floppy for Marvel but now EVERYTHING Marvel has released in 2025 has flopped!

Associate Editor


SPOILER: This post contains details about The Fantastic Four: First Steps


	Despite the intense media training and spoiler deterrents Marvel Studios has been rumored to inflict on its stars, Paul Walter Hauser played it fast and loose with his character reveal.


	The Golden Globe winner, who makes his MCU antihero debut as Mole Man in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, recently confessed that he wasn't as discreet as most of his Marvel peers about the surprise role.


	“For the most part I was zip-lipped, and everybody understands at this point. They all know if you do Star Wars, or Marvel, you can't talk about it,” he explained to GQ. “But if I'm being honest—and I pride myself on my honesty nowadays—I probably told 70 or 80 random people, be it family members or fans. I'm not gonna lie and say I told literally no one. I told several dozen people.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Hauser continued, “But at the same time, they weren't blabbering it out, or giving it to news outlets. They were respectful, and excited, and what-have-you. But if a little kid comes up to me in a wheelchair with a comic book, and they're like, ‘Are you Mole Man?' I would say something like, ‘I don't know man, I hear there is a mole…' And wink at them, just to get them excited.”


	After the Russo Brothers have said they're cracking down on spoilers while filming Avengers: Doomsday, Hauser said he sees the strict MCU secrecy “kind of like jaywalking,” assuming they have bigger fish to fry.


	“It's like, you can get [arrested] for that, but it's like, hopefully they're catching the bad guys,” added Hauser. “And when I look at Kevin Feige and the Marvel folks, I go, I think they're probably busy with some other stuff. They're probably not gonna chase me down and scalp me, or shoot a little [dart] into my neck.”

	











	Now playing in theaters, one of The Fantastic Four: First Steps‘ multiple surprises is the introduction of Hauser as Harvey Elder (aka Mole Man), a former enemy of the Fantastic Four and leader of Subterranea who ultimately joins forces with the titular team against Galactus.

For Sharon Stone, the ultimate dream come true was working with Robert De Niro in “Casino.” She told Business Insider that she auditioned for De Niro movies “many times” before she was cast in the 1994 Martin Scorsese classic. Stone had even told an acting teacher years prior that her career goal was to “work with De Niro and hold my own.” 

But when Stone finally realized what she called “the apex,” De Niro ended up setting Stone off while shooting one of the movie's most electric verbal sparring sessions. The “Basic Instinct” actress recalled, “There's a scene in the movie where we're sitting across a table arguing, and he says to me, ‘You're a good actress, you know that?' And I remember in that scene when he said it, how furious it made me because it was my dream to do it, and then he challenged me at the table. I remember thinking, ‘Oh, you crossed a line today, mister.'”

The challenge, though, ended up bringing layers to the scene and the relationship between the characters. “He knew every button to go for with me because he is the greatest observational actor. He can crawl under your skin and get in there,” Stone said.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






It all paid off for Stone, who landed a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her work in “Casino.”

Stone will next appear in Universal's “Nobody 2,” the Bob Odenkirk-starring action sequel that adds not just Stone, but also Colin Hanks and John Ortiz to its roster. In discussing her role, described as the film‘s antagonist, she said she came close to turning it down. “I just don't want to play a cookie-cutter villain, which is something that I really have a thing about,” she said.

The hesitation comes after what she felt was typecasting after her turn as a sultry femme fatale in “Basic Instinct.” “But that was not cookie-cutter; it was a villain that touched upon the zeitgeist of the moment,” Stone said. “That was why it was so specifically successful, and why it remains interesting to watch.”

“Basic Instinct,” too, has a follow-up (or a reboot? or a remake?) in development over at Amazon MGM Studios. In a statement to IndieWire, screenwriter Joe Eszterhas said, “To those who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller: The rumors of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist. I call my writing partner the TWISTED LITTLE MAN and he lives somewhere deep inside me. He was born 29 and he will die 29 and he tells me he is ‘sky high up' to write this piece and provide viewers with a wild and orgasmic ride. That makes me very happy.”

 










Rumors suggest Stone might join for this new “anti-woke” “Basic Instinct,” as she did for its misbegotten 2006 sequel.

Meanwhile, “Nobody” will hit theaters August 15. Watch the trailer below.

Justice for movie stars. We are just a few months shy of when Noah Baumbach‘s ode to a fictional movie star is released, with one of our starriest film stars at its center playing said fictional movie star — George Clooney — and plenty more playing less famous characters. “Jay Kelly” will present a modern day Cary Grant (who is even referenced in the teaser trailer) as he struggles to juggle his life as a mega famous actor. As the teaser previews, Jay Kelly is accused of just playing himself — a criticism that has been levied, too, on Clooney, as well as the Netflix movie's co-star Adam Sandler. And Clooney said he doesn't “give a shit” if people do think that.

 








Related Stories Sharon Stone on the Moment Robert De Niro ‘Crossed a Line' Filming ‘Casino' ‘Garbo, by Joan Crawford' — Rare BBC Documentary Resurfaces: Here's How to Watch in the U.S. 

“Have you ever tried playing yourself? It's hard to do,” Clooney told Vanity Fair, co-opting a line from “Jay Kelly.”

The “Ocean's Eleven” star pointed out that, “There aren't that many guys in my age group that are allowed to do both broad comedies like ‘O Brother [Where Art Thou?]' and then do ‘Michael Clayton' or ‘Syriana.' So if that means I'm playing myself all the time, I don't give a shit.”

 










Clooney also defended Sandler, who he called a “beautiful, heartfelt, soulful actor.” “I kept telling the cast, ‘Don't call him ‘Sand Man.' Don't talk to him like he's just some goofy comedian. He's actually a really beautiful, wonderful actor… Because of what his paycheck is, which is doing big goofy comedies, when he does these other, beautiful, ‘Uncut Gems' kinds of movies, it reminds people of that. He's not just a good comedian.”

In the movie, Sandler is Jay Kelly's manager Ron. Explaining his role to Vanity Fair, Sandler said, “My character loves George's character so much, and I thought that would be fun to do and easy to do with George. And as a guy who's an actor who'd live a similar life to Jay Kelly, it's a crazy depiction — how accurate a lot of it is.”

The film showcases Jay and Ron going on an “unexpectedly profound journey through Europe,” or so Netflix's official synopsis reads. This seems to be a journey full of big names. The movie, co-written by Baumbach with actress Emily Mortimer, also features Mortimer with… big breath… Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Grace Edwards, Stacy Keach, Jim Broadbent,  Patrick Wilson, Eve Hewson, Greta Gerwid, Alba Rohurwacher, Josh Hamilton, Lenny Henry, Nicôle Lecky, Thedda Graham, and Isla Fisher. Phew.

 










To compare Jay Kelly to Cary Grant is astute, considering that the legendary Old Hollywood actor — who spent the better part of three decades as a top box office star and continued to be a well-known personality through retirement — was on the record saying, “Everyone wants to be Cary Grant. Even I want to be Cary Grant. I pretended to be somebody I wanted to be until finally I became that person. Or he became me. Or we met at some point.”

Grant's persona ended up being, like Clooney's, versatile across a wide variety of genres, from action flicks like “North by Northwest” and screwball comedies like “Bringing Up Baby,” to epics like “The Pride and the Passion” and heartfelt dramas like “None but the Lonely Heart.” Clooney, similarly, has stretched his charm across every type of film and has even bridged into the theater. Last spring, Clooney was Tony-nominated for his stage adaptation of “Good Night, and Good Luck.”

Netflix will give the movie an awards-qualifying limited release November 14 before releasing it on the streamer December 5.

	It's Saturday night in New Jersey and My Chemical Romance have set the MetLife stage on fire — literally. Flames engulf the stage floor and bright orange flares shoot up in bursts around lead singer Gerard Way, bassist Mikey Way, and guitarists Frank Iero and Ray Toro as the band delivers an electrifying performance of “Famous Last Words” worthy of the blaze that surrounds them. 


	In this moment, with a jam-packed stadium of fans screaming the song's emotional bridge back to My Chemical Romance, they are undoubtedly the saviors of the broken, the beaten, and the damned. Gerard sings the final line, “Nothing you can say can stop me from going home” and in their hometown stadium, the lyrics couldn't ring more true.


	Saturday night marked My Chemical Romance's sixth stop on the Long Live the Black Parade Tour, which kicked off last month in Seattle. At each stop, the band has played their seminal 2006 album, The Black Parade, in full. Prior to their 2024 set at emo nostalgia festival When We Were Young, My Chemical Romance hadn't played the entirety of the album live since wrapping the project's original tour in 2008. 

	











	Fans were already excited to hear My Chemical Romance's magnum opus live, but the feeling was compounded by the band's homecoming to New Jersey in the state's largest venue. In fact, Courtney and Mike, two fans from Eastern Canada who arrived at noon on Saturday in order to secure their spots at the barricade, were adamant about getting tickets to the band's MetLife show. “It's their home,” Mike said.

	My Chemical Romance's show at MetLife marked the band's headlining debut there, and nearly every minute of their two-and-a-half hour set made sure to commemorate that very fact. The Garden State pride was felt before MCR even took the stage, when openers Thursday kicked off the night. Back in the day, when the Way brothers attended shows on the Jersey basement circuit, Geoff Rickly was a major inspiration for the future rockers. It was only right to give Rickly, and the rest of Thursday, their due and have them join My Chemical Romance's headlining debut at MetLife.

	While not Jersey Boys, the additional special guests at MetLife were none other than indie staple, Death Cab for Cutie. It was a lineup made of early-aughts emo dreams. The show was coursing with Jersey energy till the very end, when My Chemical Romance closed out with an unexpected, and explosive cover of Bon Jovi's “Living on a Prayer,” or what Way called, “the New Jersey state anthem.”


	Earlier in the night, before they launched into their hit song “Welcome to the Black Parade,” the band was granted a ceremonial key to the city of Belleville, where Gerard, Mikey and Iero were raised. “Never once in the history of Belleville, have we ever handed a key to the city,” Belleville mayor Michael Melham said. “It's long overdue and they deserve it,” Melham added. 


	By this point, My Chemical Romance were dressed as their alter-ego band the Black Parade, and Gerard refused to break character, even to receive the key. Instead, he gifted Mayor Melham wheat and a fake fish from the fictional city of Draag, which has played a role in the entire tour's storyline. (Afterwards, on the B stage, Gerard did thank the mayor for being a good sport through all the theatrics.) Funnily enough, moments after receiving the key, Gerard briefly broke character when he yelped, “Oh wait! We got one more thing to do. Let's fucking kill some people,” in a full North Jersey lilt.

	That brings us to the theatrical portion of the Long Live the Black Parade Tour, which has gone viral online for its dark, intensely political elements like the fake execution. (At one point in the show, a mock election was held where attendees were forced to vote with “Yea/Nay” reversible signs on whether or not they believe people should be executed. Regardless of the actual vote, the people were still killed.) 


	The play at the heart of the show is set in Draag, which is under the dictatorship rule of the Great Immortal Dictator. The timing of the Long Live the Black Parade Tour and political satire at the heart of the show is particularly poignant and feels intentional, given the political turmoil in the U.S. The world-building of Draag has been in play since last fall, when My Chemical Romance began teasing the tour on social media with cryptic Instagram posts and imagery that felt similar to Nazi Germany. In a long caption, the band revealed that alter-ego band the Black Parade has had their “work privilege ceremoniously reinstated” as “His Grand Immortal Dictator's National Band.” 

	











	From the first moment My Chemical Romance graced the stage in their the Black Parade marching band suits, the world of Draag was front and center with the newly-shared instrumental track “Over Fields” (Draag's National Anthem) and a rotation of World War II inspired characters playing a role in the theatrics. The band took everything to the extreme. There's a clown that blows himself up, and at one point, Gerard uses his one last gasping breath after being stabbed to launch a nuclear war. The band even tapped director Claire Marie Vogel to help create intricate tour visuals that fit the tour narrative. It all an astounding amount of creative output that makes for a stellar show.


	Whether or not attendees were able to grasp all the details and the story being told in between The Black Parade songs or just went along for the ride, it was one hell of a dramatization. It's clear My Chemical Romance wanted to outdo themselves. After all, the massive impact of The Black Parade demanded it; they needed to up the ante, especially nearly 20 years after the album's initial release.


	The dedicated My Chemical Romance fans loved every second of the show, and welcomed their hometown heroes with their wide open arms. Swaths of attendees were dressed in outfits inspired by the Draag world and past MCR eras. During “I Don't Love You” and “Cancer,” the slower songs on the setlist, fans showed their appreciation for the band when they lit the entire stadium up with red and white lights using their phones and colored paper. 


	Even as My Chemical Romance played out as the rock gods they've become on the main stage, their star power was truly underlined during the latter half of the show. From a B stage situated near the center of the stadium, My Chemical Romance commanded their hometown stadium with songs from the rest of their catalog and a raw, effusive energy that was contagious. Gone were the marching band uniforms and outsized production; instead, the band stood as New Jersey-bred rockers taking in the preternatural full-moon that hung above them. “It looks so fake, that's how big it is here,” Gerard remarked.


	The band delivered plenty of insane deep-cuts like “Skylines and Turnstiles” and “Vampires Will Never Hurt You” from their debut LP I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love. My Chemical Romance even played a raucous rendition of “Boy Division,” a track from their scrapped material collection Conventional Weapons, which was released shortly before the band broke up in 2013.

	“It's truly fucking wild that we are up here,” Gerard said while on the B stage. In a way, he was right. For a band that came up in New Jersey basements and became the biggest act from the emo era of the 2000s, rocking out sold-out stadiums seemed like a far-fetched dream. But this was reality and My Chemical Romance reveled in the career-high. With each riff, Mikey, Toro, and Iero couldn't help but smile from ear-to-ear while Gerard continued to fling his body around and command massive singalongs.  There was headbanging, screamo singing, and high-voltage energy that reached every corner of the stadium before My Chemical Romance exploded into fan-favorite “Helena.” For the final chorus of the track, Gerard belted the notes along with the entire sold-out crowd while he was down on his knees. “I felt that one in my bones,” he said.

Zach Bryan has pledged to never perform in Kansas City again after once again beefing with Chiefs fans on social media.


	With NFL season nearly upon us, Bryan — a diehard fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, who defeated the Chiefs in this past Super Bowl — decided to revive his feud with the Kansas City squad on social media.


	“Where are all the three peat people from last year,” Bryan tweeted, referring to the Chiefs' failed quest for three straight Super Bowl wins. After the shit-talking intensified in the replies, Bryan laid down his punishment.

Please understand I will never play in Kansas City https://t.co/VicevXBjda


	“Please understand I will never play in Kansas City,” Bryan warned. “I'll be about to finish my show and then get a taunting call if I play at that stadium”


	The beefing got so heated that one Chiefs fan told Bryan to remove “Fifth of May (Live from Kansas City)” from the singer's digital-only 24 live album. “Done brother,” Bryan responded. (As of Sunday morning, the track was still on streaming services.)

	“Bro all u have to do to piss off a chiefs fan is play a fair game of football,” he added. “Guys it's okay to talk trash to each other about football yall are weird as hell.” (Thankfully, this row with Chiefs fans didn't end with Bryan apologizing to Taylor Swift and deleting his Twitter.)

	











	While Bryan has promised to never perform in Kansas City again, he might have found a loophole for fans along the Missouri/Kansas border: “I miss you Bonner Springs coming to play next year,” Bryan tweeted Sunday, referring to the Kansas city that's a 30-minute drive from Kansas City.

Donald Trump demanded that unhoused Washington, D.C., residents “have to move out [of the city] IMMEDIATELY.” The statement comes amid his continuing attacks on homeless people after signing an executive order pressing local governments across the country to unhoused people from the streets.


	“We're having a News Conference tomorrow in the White House,” Trump wrote Sunday on Truth Social. “I'm going to make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before. The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.”


	Accompanying the post were photographs of tents on stretches of grass near D.C. roads, which have become an increasingly common sight in the nation's capital over recent years. Although the official count of homeless individuals in the city decreased by nine percent last year, housing advocates say the true number is higher and will continue to rise unless the city budgets money for services to help them. 

	











	The executive order Trump signed last month, titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America's Streets,” attacks homeless people by allowing law enforcement to displace and institutionalize them, with little to no guardrails.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“It's one of the most harmful things to happen to folks who live outside in decades. It is not going to help anybody,” Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center, told The Guardian. “It sets the stage for rounding up folks who are homeless, folks with mental health issues, folks who are disabled — and instead of helping them, forcing them into detention camps and institutions. So it's terrifying.”

	











	Trump has hinted at his plans to attack individuals without permanent housing for years. In 2022, he called for using “large parcels of inexpensive land in the outer reaches of the cities” to create tent cities full of unhoused people — essentially internment camps. His 2024 campaign plan proposed cracking down on people who are unhoused, addicted to drugs, or mentally ill by putting them in institutions, forced substance use treatment, or incarceration.

	A June 2024 decision by the conservative majority in the Supreme Court made criminalizing homelessness easier by allowing cities to ban sleeping outdoors. 


	“Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, adding that the majority's decision was “unconscionable and unconstitutional.”


	Sadly, within six months of the court's ruling, approximately 100 cities — both Democratic- and Republican-led — banned people from sleeping outside. In just one additional month that number increased to around 150 cities across more than half of U.S. states.


Consistently low wages and rising cost of living — made worse by the Trump tariffs — keep “more than half of Americans” living “paycheck to paycheck and one crisis away from homelessness,” according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness — whose website the Trump administration apparently deleted last month.


	Meanwhile, Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill strips away access to affordable or free health care by kicking millions off Medicaid.


	“This law is devastating to the health and well-being of low-income, underserved, and unhoused individuals — people who have already faced many barriers to care,” the National Health Care for the Homeless Council said.

	Now, the House and Senate are considering Trump-backed proposals to cut Section 8 affordable housing funds by 43 percent as part of the 2026 federal budget. Those subsidies help low-income households afford rent by filling in the gap between their income and housing costs.


	That bill would leave approximately 411,000 additional Americans without stable and affordable housing, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The House version would also give the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) the authority to let state and local housing agencies raise rent on low-income households.

Bobby Whitlock, keyboardist in Eric Clapton's short-lived but acclaimed band Derek and the Dominos, has died at the age of 77.


	Whitlock's death early Sunday morning was confirmed by his manager Carol Kaye, who said in a statement to ABC Audio, “With profound sadness, the family of Bobby Whitlock announces his passing at 1:20am on Aug. 10 after a brief illness. He passed in his home in Texas, surrounded by family.”


	The Memphis-born Whitlock began his career in the mid-Sixties at his hometown Stax Records, becoming the first white artist signed by the label and recording alongside the likes of Booker T & The M.G.'s and Sam & Dave.


	In the late-Sixties, Whitlock would join the husband-wife duo Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett and an army of talented musicians in a group dubbed Delaney & Bonnie and Friends; some of those “Friends” included a post-Cream Eric Clapton, guitarist Duane Allman, bassist Carl Radle, and drummer Jim Gordon. Those four artists and Whitlock would eventually form Derek and the Dominos.

	











	Whitlock, who previously played on Clapton's 1970 self-titled debut album, co-wrote half of the songs that appear on Derek and the Dominos' 1970 studio album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, including the classic rock standard “Bell Bottom Blues,” “Anyday,” “Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?,” and opener “I Looked Away.” 

	











	Whitlock also played the piano part on the band's classic “Layla,” and had long been vocal about Rita Coolidge being credited with the song's second movement; drummer Jim Gordon, Coolidge's boyfriend at the time, was instead credited as “Layla” co-writer.


Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs would later be named be named one of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. However, it was not commercially successful upon release, and compounded with the 1971 death of Duane Allman as well as Clapton's drug addiction, Derek and the Dominos ultimately broke up in 1971 in the midst of recording their second album.

	While recording that failed sophomore album in London, Whitlock also worked on his own self-titled debut album, which featured his Derek and the Dominos band mates as well as George Harrison; Whitlock previously contributed organ and piano to the former Beatle's 1970 masterpiece All Things Must Pass, appearing on songs like “My Sweet Lord,” “What Is Life,” the title track, and the vinyl-length Apple Jam.

	(Whitlock also appeared, uncredited, on the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St., and later claimed that he and the Stones' Mick Taylor, and not Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, co-wrote that album's “I Just Want to See His Face.”)


	Whitlock's second solo album, 1972's Raw Velvet, also featured Clapton and Harrison. Whitlock released two more solo LPs before largely leaving the the music industry by the end of the Seventies. However, by the turn of the millennium, Whitlock returned to recording, often accompanied by his wife and musician CoCo Carmel. Whitlock and Clapton also reunited in 2000 to perform “Bell Bottom Blues” together on Later With Jools Holland:

Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab joins 'Fox & Friends' to examine a new study on the effects of pathogenic gut bacteria and tips for limiting exposure to harmful bacteria.

James van der Beek has revealed the first warning sign of his colon cancer — and it's one that did not seem alarming at the time.

The ""Dawson's Creek"" actor, 48, who announced his colorectal cancer diagnosis in November 2024, recently told Healthline that ""there wasn't any red flag or something glaring.""

""I was healthy. I was doing the cold plunge,"" he said. ""I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea.""

COLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSES SOAR AMONG YOUNGER ADULTS FOR ONE KEY REASON

The one symptom that he did experience was a change in bowel movements, which the actor chalked up to an effect of his coffee consumption.

""Before my diagnosis, I didn't know much about colorectal cancer,"" van der Beek said. ""I didn't even realize the screening age [had] dropped to 45; I thought it was still 50.""

He ultimately underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed that the actor had stage 3 colon cancer.

Professor Eitan Friedman, M.D., Ph.D., an oncologist and founder of The Suzanne Levy-Gertner Oncogenetics Unit at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel, confirmed that changes in bowel habits is the primary red flag that should raise the suspicion of colorectal cancer.

Others include fatigue as a result of anemia, blood in stool, weight loss, loss of appetite and abdominal discomfort, Friedman, who has not treated van der Beek, told Fox News Digital.

""I was in amazing cardiovascular shape, and I had stage 3 cancer, and I had no idea.""

Dr. Erica Barnell, M.D., Ph.D., a physician-scientist at Washington University School of Medicine — and co-founder and chief medical officer at Geneoscopy — noted that van der Beek's experience of having no ""glaring"" signs is common.

""Many colorectal cancers develop silently, without obvious symptoms,"" Barnell, who also did not treat the actor, told Fox News Digital. ""By the time symptoms appear, the disease may already be advanced.""

Symptoms are ""especially worrisome"" for those 45 and older who have at least one first-degree relative with colon cancer or other GI malignancies, and those with active inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, added Friedman, who is also an advisory board member at SpotitEarly, a startup that offers an at-home breath test to detect early-stage cancer signals.

The overall chance of an average-risk person getting colorectal cancer over a lifetime is 4% to 5%, according to Friedman.

""Colonoscopy at age 45 onwards, at five- to 10-year intervals, has been shown to lead to early detection of polyps that have the potential to become malignant, and to allow for their removal as an effective means of minimizing the risk of malignant transformation,"" he said.

Unfortunately, Barnell noted, ""screening compliance in the U.S. remains below national targets, and gaps are widest in rural, low-income and minority communities.""

To help close those gaps, she called for greater access to ""accurate, noninvasive screening technologies,"" along with efforts to increase public awareness.

""Colonoscopy at age 45 onwards, at five- to 10-year intervals, has been shown to lead to early detection of polyps that have the potential to become malignant, and to allow for their removal as an effective means of minimizing the risk of malignant transformation,"" an expert said.  (iStock)

""Most people don't like talking about bowel habits, but paying attention to changes can save your life,"" Barnell said. ""Screening gives us the chance to find problems early — often before you feel sick — and that can make all the difference.""

The rise of generative AI and large language models has drastically shifted the cybersecurity landscape, empowering attackers with easy-to-use tools that can create realistic video and voice deepfakes, personalized phishing campaigns, and malware and malicious code. 

That has opened the door for AI on the defense as well. As agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in the enterprise in areas like finance and legal, cybersecurity AI agents are on the rise, too, becoming a key asset for detection, analysis, and alerts. 

""It's a massive challenge to detect, contain, investigate and respond across larger companies,"" said Brian Murphy, CEO of cybersecurity technology company ReliaQuest. ""AI is allowing us to remove a lot of that noise, that tier one or tier two work, that work that's often not at all relevant to something that could be threatening to an organization,"" Murphy said. 

Putting a tool in the hands of human workers that can automate otherwise menial tasks or time-consuming ones, freeing them to do more important work, has often been the pitch for agentic AI. 

In a message shared with Amazon employees in June, CEO Andy Jassy said ""We have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live,"" adding that he sees a future with ""billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field,"" helping workers ""focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically"" while also making ""our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today."" 

Murphy shares a similar view across cybersecurity, where he sees an industry of workers who are inundated with work they likely shouldn't be spending time on, causing more burnout and exacerbating the existing issue of a lack of available talent. 

He's also seen the way AI is being wielded to attack companies. ""Those phishing emails, they used to look almost laughable with the misspellings and the fonts wrong,"" he said. ""AI can take the average bad actor and make them better, and so the trick is if you're on the defensive side, they have to use AI because of the reality of what AI can do."" 

ReliaQuest recently released what it calls GreyMatter Agentic Teammates, autonomous, role-based AI agents that can be used to take on tasks that detection engineers or threat intelligence researchers would otherwise accomplish on a security operations team. 

""Think of it as this persona that teams up with a human, and the human is prompting that agentic AI, so the human knows what to do,"" Murphy said, adding that it's like having a ""teammate that takes that incident response analyst and multiplies their capability."" 

Murphy gave an example that is a frequent occurrence for any security team at a global company: international executive travel. Every time a laptop or cell phone is connected to a network in, say, China, the security operations team would be alerted, and the security team would have to verify that the executive is abroad and is securely using their device each day of that trip. With an agentic AI teammate, that security person could automate that task, or even set up a series of similar processes for board meetings, off-sites, or other large team gatherings. 

""There's hundreds of things like that,"" he said. 

Justin Dellaportas, chief information and security officer at communications technology company Syniverse, said that while AI agents have been able to automate some of those basic cybersecurity tasks like combing through logs, it's also starting to be able to automate actions, like quarantining flagged emails and removing them from inboxes, or restricting access by a comprised account across a variety of logins.

""[AI] is being used by criminals to efficiently find vulnerabilities and exploits into organizations at scale, and all of that is resulting in them having a higher success rate, getting initial access sooner and moving laterally into an organization quicker than we've seen,"" he said. ""Cyber defenders really need to lean into this technology now more than ever to stay ahead of this evolving threat landscape and the pace of cyber criminals.""

Dellaportas said that while every company has a unique risk profile and tolerance when it comes to deploying different types of cybersecurity tools, he views the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity as stages of a ""crawl, walk, run methodology.""

""You roll this out, and it's going to reason and then take action, but then it's got to iterate through the actions that it's previously taken,"" he said. ""I come back to a kind of trust but verify, and then as we get confidence in its effectiveness, we'll move on to different problems."" 

While Dellaportas said AI agents can take over some tasks from human cybersecurity professionals in the future, he still sees the technology as an augmentation to make workers more effective, not as a replacement.

Murphy agrees, and said he does not see agentic AI taking the place of actual cybersecurity workers, but helping with tasks where automation is the better option while also addressing the skills gap that many organizations struggle with when filling cybersecurity roles. 

""There may be a shortage of trained and skilled cybersecurity professionals, but there's no shortage of people who would like to be trained and skilled at cybersecurity,"" he said. ""The reason that knowledge transfer takes so long in cyber is that when you get your entry-level job, it's equivalent to working on a help desk."" 

Murphy said he understands that there is still plenty of education needed when it comes to deploying agentic AI in any part of a business, as well as concerns about how decisions are made by AI. 

Dellaportas said what has helped is the fact that agentic AI is being used by all types of business lines, so discussions of how these AI tools can help accomplish objectives are not new ones.

AI agents are catching on inside companies. A May 2025 poll of 147 CIOs and IT function leaders by Gartner found that 24% had already deployed a few AI agents, with more than 50% of those AI agents working across functions like IT, HR and accounting, compared to just 23% of external customer facing functions.

Avivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst on Gartner's AI strategy team, said that in the cybersecurity space, companies experimenting with agentic AI are finding it ""moderately beneficial,"" but there remain some questions as to the ability of these tools to scale beyond simpler tasks.

""Security has always been the low-hanging fruit use case for AI,"" Litan said. ""You first saw AI show up with fraud detection, so it's 100% that we're going to have digital security assistance in the future doing work and freeing up staff to take on the new attacks; the key will be making sure they stay up with all this innovation so they can see the whole attack surface.""

Murphy believes that corporate adoption and evolution of agentic AI in cybersecurity may occur even more quickly than in finance or legal. 

""They absolutely understand AI is being used against them, and the only way to defend that is to use it in their own defense,"" he said.

Iga Swiatek's battle back to the summit of tennis has been an arduous one after struggling to find her feet early in 2025.

Earlier in the year, Swiatek suffered shock exits to Mirra Andreeva and Danielle Collins at Indian Wells and Rome respectively.

In fact, the Pole went over a year without winning a WTA Tour title after losing in the French Open semi-finals to Aryna Sabalenka.

However, her form was soon to change. Swiatek's first grass-court final appearance at the Bad Homburg Open foreshadowed future events, as she went on to lift the Venus Rosewater Dish at Wimbledon in July.

Fast forward to August and the 24-year-old is gearing up for a third-round match at the Cincinnati Open. The Pole will face Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk after defeating Russia's Anastasia Potapova in the second round.

There has been a change in geographical scenery recently as tournaments have moved from the European clay and grass-court surfaces to the North American hard courts.

A change to the type of ball has faced much scrutiny due to an apparent difficulty in controlling them. The North American hard-court swing uses Wilson US Open balls, while Wimbledon uses Slazenger balls, and the French Open uses Wilson Roland Garros balls.

Swiatek addressed this issue while speaking to reporters after her victory over Potapova.

The Wilson US Open balls have been frequently discussed in recent weeks due to an apparent lack of control. At the Canadian Open, Taylor Fritz said they were ‘the hardest balls to control.'

After playing her first match at the Cincinnati Open, Iga Swiatek has weighed in on the issue. The Pole was asked by one reporter to expand on her perspective and approach on dealing with the ‘light' US Wilson US Open balls.

Swiatek said: “Yeah I won the US Open but I also like lost couple times second round, or third.

“So I'm kind of being humble and knowing that you need to kind of adjust to the balls because they're not going to help you a bit.

So yeah, they are light. They are much different than what we played at on like clay and on Wimbledon.

So yeah, the only way to like think about it is to focus on adjusting as best as possible and accepting that there are going to be some shots that are just going to kind of fly away from your racket and trying to control it as much as possible.

Swiatek was also asked to comment on her early-season struggles.

The Pole noted there were a variety of factors, pinpointing her clay-court expectations as one particular area of struggle.

She said: “I think there were a lot of factors back then. Well for sure the expectations on clay and just me kind of feeling like I don't know, I need to compete my best every week, but I sometimes needed just time to kind of reset but didn't really get it until I lost in Rome.

“Yeah me being like frustrated quicker from different reasons like… and not working the proper way, kind of being stubborn sometimes with the way I approach stuff so I think it was a mix, and I needed some time to get out of that after Rome.”","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

""Thank you for making me aware,"" the reality star wrote on social media.

Kourtney Kardashian is speaking out after facing backlash over a photo of her 21-month-old son, Rocky Thirteen, seen on a boat without a life jacket.


	On Friday (Aug. 8), the 46-year-old reality star — who shares Rocky with her husband, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker — posted a series of Instagram snapshots, one of which showed her young son on a boat without a life vest, sparking criticism online.

	











	Other photos in the post suggested the family was vacationing in Idaho, where state law requires children 14 and under to wear a life jacket while on a boat.

	“Great photo except for the fact the child has no life jacket on,” one user commented. Another urged, “Please, please put a life jacket on that sweet babe!” A third wrote, “You gotta make sure the kids are wearing life vests at all times! Just like you wouldn't drive them around without a seatbelt/car seat. Water is so unpredictable and can be devastatingly dangerous.”


	Kardashian addressed the controversy the next day through her Instagram Story.


	“Update: bought a life vest that fits!” she wrote over a photo of an infant-sized life jacket. “Good looking out. Honestly didn't think about some of the dangers. Thank you for making me aware and hopefully this helps make other mommies aware of the dangers of certain types of boating without a life vest.”

	











	The original image showed Kardashian seated at the back of a boat while holding Rocky, whom she welcomed in November 2023 with Barker. The Lemme founder is also mom to three children with ex-partner Scott Disick: sons Mason, 15, and Reign, 10, as well as daughter Penelope, 13.


	Other snapshots from Kardashian's Instagram post included a mirror selfie of herself in a bodysuit, scenic views of the lake, and a variety of meals enjoyed during the trip. “Food for the soul,” she captioned the post.

Eddie Murphy is an Academy Award-nominated actor — but, to him, that doesn't mean that you only have to make prestige pictures. Firmly established as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, Murphy — who just premiered “The Pickup” on Amazon Prime — has always made exactly the kind of movie he wants to make in the moment. Hence why he followed up 2006's “Dreamgirls” — which netted not just an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, but five other nominations and two wins — with the widely panned “Norbit” in 2007.

“I love ‘Norbit,'” Murphy said on Complex's interview series “360 With Speedy Morman” (via The Wrap). “There were articles like, ‘How can he get an Oscar, he did this?' They're two different movies. I wrote ‘Norbit' with my brother, Charlie [Murphy], and we think ‘Norbit' is funny. Here's the thing with ‘Norbit': It came out, it got voted for Razzies for Worst Actor of the Decade, Worst Actor, and Worst Actress. They gave me a Razzie for Worst Actress, Worst Actor, and Worst Actor of the Decade. And I was like, ‘Come on now, shit ain't that bad.'”

In the movie, Murphy not only played the titular Norbit, he also donned drag to portray the character's wife, Rasputia. Murphy has rarely given much heed to what critics think, though he isn't afraid to admit when he feels he's made a genuine stinker — not that he harbors any regrets about the movies that passed him by. In fact, he turned down one of the '90s biggest hit comedies (or one of the biggest ones Murphy wasn't already in).

 










“They came to me, it was two scripts,” Murphy explained. “It was ‘Rush Hour,' it's going to be action-comedy and you're going to be with Jackie Chan, and it's action, it's summertime, running, all this physical stuff. This other [offer] was, ‘You in a robe in Miami' — it was a no-brainer. We went to Miami and made a horrendous film, but it was easy. I have to stop saying horrendous. The movie was soft, it wasn't a great picture.”

1998's “Holy Man” was indeed one of the few Murphy movies to lose money, in addition to savage critical reviews. One other major project Murphy passed on was “Malcolm X.” Interestingly, it was a historic Oscar-winner who told Murphy to sit that film out.

“They were talking about doing ‘Malcolm X,'” Murphy said in the Apple TV+ documentary “Number One on the Call Sheet: Black Leading Men in Hollywood.” “Norman Jewison was putting it together. They were going to use ‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X' by Alex Haley, and they approached me about playing Alex Haley. Around that same time, I bumped into Sidney Poitier at something, and I asked him, ‘Yeah, I'm thinking about playing Alex Haley!' And Sidney Poitier said, ‘You are not Denzel [Washington], and you are not Morgan [Freeman]. You are a breath of fresh air, and don't fuck with that!' […] I didn't know if it was an insult or a compliment. I was like, ‘What?'”

 










Alex Haley ended up not being a character in 1992's “Malcolm X,” which ended up directed instead by Spike Lee and starring Washington, who earned an Oscar nomination for his work.
