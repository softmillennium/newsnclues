                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Goldie Chan knows how to put herself out there. Chan, the founder and head of content for branding agency Warm Robots, is also an author, a frequent keynote speaker and a LinkedIn Top Voice. Still, she describes herself as an introvert at heart — which presented a challenge in growing her career. "I think a lot of people underestimate introverts in the workplace," she says. In 2017, she began posting short videos about pop culture branding and marketing on LinkedIn, which was beta-testing its video feature at the time. While in between roles, she posted over 800 consecutive daily videos — a pace she doesn't necessarily recommend "unless you never want to sleep again" — and quickly attracted a large audience. Today, she has over 100,000 followers on LinkedIn, and that platform has helped her land new roles, obtain a book deal and share her expert advice as a Forbes contributor. "I grew my own personal brand through a lot of consistency and hard work," she says. Chan writes about how introverts can level up their careers in her upcoming book "Personal Branding for Introverts," which debuts in October. Whether you know it or not, "everyone has a personal brand," Chan says. If the idea of a personal brand sounds intimidating, just think of it as "something in your career that people know you for," whether that's your penchant for public speaking, affinity for colorful blazers or your humorous LinkedIn posts. Developing a strong personal brand can help introverts bring their talents to the forefront and boost their careers, she says: "It allows you to shape the story that other people are telling about you." "I've had so many introverts who have come up to me and said, 'I'm so terrified of growing my personal brand because I don't want to put myself out there,'" she says. To combat her social anxiety, she challenged herself to speak with a new person at her local coffee shop each day for a month. Just one small, consistent action can help you break out of your comfort zone, she says. Keep in mind that your personal brand doesn't just exist online. According to Chan, participating in social events like hobby groups or networking meetups can also contribute to building your brand. "A personal brand is never created in isolation," Chan says. "Being involved in groups that interest you, even if they're not directly related to your career, can actually help with your career." "All these different spokes are all the different things that you do, and they all connect back to a central hub — so whatever small things you do are always going to help your overall personal brand," she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in the enterprise in areas like finance and legal, cybersecurity AI agents are on the rise, too, becoming a key asset for detection, analysis, and alerts. "It's a massive challenge to detect, contain, investigate and respond across larger companies," said Brian Murphy, CEO of cybersecurity technology company ReliaQuest. Putting a tool in the hands of human workers that can automate otherwise menial tasks or time-consuming ones, freeing them to do more important work, has often been the pitch for agentic AI. In a message shared with Amazon employees in June, CEO Andy Jassy said "We have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live," adding that he sees a future with "billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field," helping workers "focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically" while also making "our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today." Murphy shares a similar view across cybersecurity, where he sees an industry of workers who are inundated with work they likely shouldn't be spending time on, causing more burnout and exacerbating the existing issue of a lack of available talent. He's also seen the way AI is being wielded to attack companies. ReliaQuest recently released what it calls GreyMatter Agentic Teammates, autonomous, role-based AI agents that can be used to take on tasks that detection engineers or threat intelligence researchers would otherwise accomplish on a security operations team. Every time a laptop or cell phone is connected to a network in, say, China, the security operations team would be alerted, and the security team would have to verify that the executive is abroad and is securely using their device each day of that trip. With an agentic AI teammate, that security person could automate that task, or even set up a series of similar processes for board meetings, off-sites, or other large team gatherings. Justin Dellaportas, chief information and security officer at communications technology company Syniverse, said that while AI agents have been able to automate some of those basic cybersecurity tasks like combing through logs, it's also starting to be able to automate actions, like quarantining flagged emails and removing them from inboxes, or restricting access by a comprised account across a variety of logins. "[AI] is being used by criminals to efficiently find vulnerabilities and exploits into organizations at scale, and all of that is resulting in them having a higher success rate, getting initial access sooner and moving laterally into an organization quicker than we've seen," he said. "Cyber defenders really need to lean into this technology now more than ever to stay ahead of this evolving threat landscape and the pace of cyber criminals." Dellaportas said that while every company has a unique risk profile and tolerance when it comes to deploying different types of cybersecurity tools, he views the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity as stages of a "crawl, walk, run methodology." "I come back to a kind of trust but verify, and then as we get confidence in its effectiveness, we'll move on to different problems." While Dellaportas said AI agents can take over some tasks from human cybersecurity professionals in the future, he still sees the technology as an augmentation to make workers more effective, not as a replacement. Murphy agrees, and said he does not see agentic AI taking the place of actual cybersecurity workers, but helping with tasks where automation is the better option while also addressing the skills gap that many organizations struggle with when filling cybersecurity roles. "There may be a shortage of trained and skilled cybersecurity professionals, but there's no shortage of people who would like to be trained and skilled at cybersecurity," he said. "The reason that knowledge transfer takes so long in cyber is that when you get your entry-level job, it's equivalent to working on a help desk." Murphy said he understands that there is still plenty of education needed when it comes to deploying agentic AI in any part of a business, as well as concerns about how decisions are made by AI. Dellaportas said what has helped is the fact that agentic AI is being used by all types of business lines, so discussions of how these AI tools can help accomplish objectives are not new ones. A May 2025 poll of 147 CIOs and IT function leaders by Gartner found that 24% had already deployed a few AI agents, with more than 50% of those AI agents working across functions like IT, HR and accounting, compared to just 23% of external customer facing functions. Avivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst on Gartner's AI strategy team, said that in the cybersecurity space, companies experimenting with agentic AI are finding it "moderately beneficial," but there remain some questions as to the ability of these tools to scale beyond simpler tasks. "Security has always been the low-hanging fruit use case for AI," Litan said. "You first saw AI show up with fraud detection, so it's 100% that we're going to have digital security assistance in the future doing work and freeing up staff to take on the new attacks; the key will be making sure they stay up with all this innovation so they can see the whole attack surface." "They absolutely understand AI is being used against them, and the only way to defend that is to use it in their own defense," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the world of online payments, the buzzword these days is frictionless, as companies entice customers with increasingly convenient online payment options. With that aim in mind, the growing presence of generative AI such as ChatGPT in the shopping ecosystem may next take a shape that has a seismic impact on the economic model of internet retail. Currently, a search for a large London Fog men's coat on ChatGPT will bring up a purchase option, but you still have to click over to London Fog's site to complete the transaction. Gen AI search engine Perplexity already has a deal with PayPal for this kind of function, allowing online shoppers to make purchases such as concert tickets and travel directly in chat, with payments completed with PayPal or Venmo, and PayPal handling the processing, shipping, tracking, and invoicing. OpenAI has already rolled out several features designed to enhance shopping and other consumer experiences, and experts say that in one form or another, this further use of gen AI in retail's future should be expected, and companies need to be planning for the consequences today. "Enabling customers to purchase without leaving the chat will have a significant impact on the sales cycle," said Elizabeth Perkins, professor of practice of business administration and economics at Roanoke College. But she added that from a marketing perspective, any time you consolidate or eliminate a part of the purchase cycle, you get your customer that much closer to spending money. Customers get what they want faster, with less hassle, and honestly, with less chance of changing their mind," Perkins said. Perikins says that payment interfaces like Venmo or Apple Pay could be disrupted. Power's senior director of banking intelligence, says he thinks that while AI checkout capabilities will disrupt the checkout ecosystem, big players will find a way to stay in the game. "This is one more competitor looking for a slice of the pie. There will be a shakeout," but he added, "PayPal, Apple, and Google are pretty entrenched, so I don't think they are going anywhere. At eBay, AI checkout is not being viewed as a threat, but as a sign of further innovation in the industry. "AI is proving great at speeding up workflows and generating ideas. We believe the true magic lies in blending that speed and scale with trusted, expert, enthusiast communities," said Blair Ethington, vice president of the company's focus categories and buyer experience division. Ethington says that eBay will be investing heavily in an increased AI experience at checkout that delivers real-time, hyper-personalized product picks and guidance tuned to each buyer's shopping preferences. "Ultimately, we believe our scale, unique inventory, and trusted community position us extremely well to thrive in an agentic commerce future," Ethington said. PayPal pointed to its deal with Perplexity as a sign of its embrace of the gen AI feature rather than viewing it as a threat. "We're partnering with some of the biggest players in this space, like Perplexity, to deliver personalized, secure, and seamless payments and commerce experiences to our network of more than 400 million consumers and merchants worldwide," said a PayPal spokesperson. In one form or another, the checkout experience online is ripe for change, according to Dee Waddell, global managing director of travel & transportation industries at IBM. "Consumers are no longer satisfied with the status quo," said Waddell, citing a recent IBM study that shows only 14% of consumers say they're satisfied with their e-commerce experience. "They're demanding seamless, hyper-personalized experiences across every touchpoint, and retailers must lean into AI to meet those expectations,"  Waddell said. IBM's retail clients are prioritizing AI to deliver a seamless experience throughout the entire customer journey. "I believe we're on the cusp of a revolution, where generative AI platforms like ChatGPT will act as 'personal assistants' to streamline the digital shopping experience from product discovery to fulfillment,"  Waddell said. The online shopping experience of the future could feature a consumer going into ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude to ask for gift ideas. Then, Waddell says, without ever leaving the chat, they'll receive personalized recommendations, confirm their payment method easily, verify their shipping address, and complete the purchase. "This will be a key part of staying relevant and delivering the integrated shopping experiences that consumers are demanding," Waddell said. "For ecommerce players who've relied on 'watch time' to keep users browsing, like Amazon, Etsy, or even Shopify storefronts, this is an existential threat," Graf said. "Users who previously started their search on e-commerce platforms are now starting with AI. "Amazon's most profitable business isn't Prime or AWS, it's retail media," Graf said. Amazon is investing heavily in its own generative AI features for shopping and has made significant investments in gen AI companies including Anthropic. Graf says that when a gen AI like ChatGPT becomes the "new homepage" of commerce, it doesn't need to sell products directly. "It just needs to own the watch time, then monetize via paid placements, affiliate links, and product recommendations, just like Amazon does internally. This re-routes billions in potential retail media revenue toward whoever owns that conversational layer,"  Graf said. Amazon's ads business has been a bright spot within earnings in recent quarters. Graf says fintech players like PayPal or Zelle, the online payment app run by a consortium of major banks, will be impacted, but indirectly. Once ChatGPT, or similar AI agents, corner end-to-end shopping, there's less space for third-party payment tools. "Integrated systems or AI-native wallets may eat that slice of the pie over time," Graf said. The ultimate winners, he says, will be those who can monetize attention and intention, not just transactions. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like many Americans, I had always dreamed up moving to Europe. And in 2015, at 35, I decided to leave Texas for Spain. Two years later, I founded She Hit Refresh, a community that helps women over 30 take the leap abroad. Since then, I've helped hundreds of women build new lives in countries like Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. Spain and Portugal top the list because they're relatively affordable for Western Europe, enjoy a relaxed pace of life, and have residency pathways that don't require you to be independently wealthy or retired. One country that few Americans could probably find on a map, let alone consider moving to, is Albania. In recent years, I kept hearing about Albania from members of my community. A handful had moved there and couldn't stop raving about it. Albania may not be for everyone — no place is — but for many Americans dreaming of a soft landing, it checks a lot of boxes. 1 overlooked destination in Europe for those hoping to relocate from the U.S.: Albania is one of the few places in Europe where you can still rent a comfortable apartment for under $500 a month, according to the women in my network. Take Cheryl Orlov, who moved from Redondo Beach, California, to Tirana. "Even though the cost of living is rising in Tirana, it's still a fraction of what I paid in California," she told me. Her rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Tirana, for example, is less than one sixth of what she'd been paying for a two-bedroom cottage in Redondo Beach before she left California in 2023. Groceries, dining out, and healthcare are also much more affordable. One of Albania's biggest advantages is that Americans can live there visa-free for up to 12 months, a rare benefit in Europe. You can hop on a plane tonight and start your new life in Albania tomorrow, no paperwork required. This makes it ideal for those who want to "test drive" life abroad without navigating complex visa systems. She explained that while staying beyond a year does require paperwork, it's possible and her organization helps newcomers with the process. At her weekly meetups, I met dozens of Americans: solo women, couples, and families. They stay for a year or two before moving on to another part of Europe once they've figured out the visa situation elsewhere. It was September and the weather was still warm enough to swim and sunbathe, but the beaches were practically empty — a rare treat compared to places like Spain or Italy. On a clear day you can see Greece in the distance! The island of Corfu is just a 30-minute ferry ride away. I didn't make it to the northern mountains, but they're high on my list for next time. Remote villages, hiking trails, and gorgeous landscapes make it a dream for outdoor lovers. Tourism has only really picked up in the last decade or so. At the same time, Albanians are notably welcoming of Americans, something that surprised many expats I spoke with. The pro-America sentiment and friendliness to expats makes it easier for newcomers to feel at home and connect with the local community. "I didn't know much about Albania," she told me. Monica has now lived in Albania for nearly two years and recently received her five-year residency card.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When she heard about President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill," which includes a section called "no tax on tips," she said her first reaction was: "It's a little too good to be true." Lopez said that in her experience, tax breaks often seem to include "a catch," and she isn't sure the benefit will be as generous as some workers expect. It's a reasonable question, experts say: Some key details of the provision — including which occupations and kinds of gratuities may qualify — are still unclear. There's also some confusion among workers about how the tax break works. More from Personal Finance:What private assets in 401(k) plans mean for investorsEducation Department launches college financial aid form Trump's 'big beautiful bill' slashes this tax break for high earners in 2026 T. Cooper, a hair and makeup stylist in New York City, said that the measure is "being perceived incorrectly" among tipped workers she knows. "A lot of people don't understand that you will still have to pay the tax on tips," she said. The "no tax on tips" provision in Trump's "big beautiful bill" provides a deduction worth up to $25,000. This tax break, which is available even if you don't itemize deductions, reduces taxable income. The deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000. However, "you're still likely paying state taxes" on tip income, and you'll owe payroll levies for Medicare and Social Security, said Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner with advisor platform Kitces.com, who analyzed the legislation. Deductible tips must appear on information returns from your employer, such as Form W-2 or 1099. But the agency's reporting rules for tip income remain unclear, experts say. Tips can include cash directly paid by customers, payouts from tip-sharing structures among employees and credit card payments. According to the provision, "qualified tips" include cash or gratuity paid by credit card, as well as earnings from a sharing arrangement. But it also says tips must be paid voluntarily by the customer. Adding to the reporting confusion, it's not unusual for those kinds of mandatory gratuities to mix with other tip income and simply appear as tips on tax forms, Lopez, the bartender, said of her experience. In some industries, tipping has decreased as consumer sentiment declines. "As consumer confidence in the economy shifts and tips fall, workers are taking home less," Ming-Tai Huh, head of food and beverage at Square, wrote in the report. Some workers say higher service costs and reduced consumer spending have contributed to these tipping trends. "So it's not that people have an issue with tipping," she said. "The service overall has just become way more expensive." In restaurants and bars, it's not unusual to see smaller checks these days, Lopez said, which makes your tip average decline. For example, previously, a $200 tab could earn $40 in tips. But nowadays, a typical tab could be $100, she said, and "you're only making $20 on the same guest."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liu Jianchao, a senior Chinese diplomat widely seen as a potential future foreign minister, has been taken away by authorities for questioning, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Liu was taken away after returning to Beijing in late July from an overseas work trip, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. China's State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party International Liaison Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. Liu, 61, has led the Communist Party's body in charge of managing ties with foreign political parties. Since taking the role in 2022, he has travelled to more than 20 nations and met officials from more than 160 countries. Liu's busy schedule, especially his meetings with the former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, stoked expectations that the former ambassador and ministry spokesman was being groomed to be the next foreign minister. His detention marks the highest-level probe involving a diplomat since China ousted its former foreign minister and President Xi Jinping's protégé, Qin Gang, in 2023 following rumors of an extramarital affair. Born in the northeastern province of Jilin, Liu majored in English at Beijing Foreign Studies University and studied international relations at Oxford before taking up his first post as a translator with the foreign ministry. During his time as ministry spokesman, he was known for humorous off-the-cuff comments while making a no-nonsense defense of China's interests. Read the complete Wall Street Journal report here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China wants the United States to ease export controls on chips critical for artificial intelligence as part of a trade deal before a possible summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. Chinese officials have told experts in Washington that Beijing wants the Trump administration to relax export restrictions on high-bandwidth memory chips, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The White House, State Department and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. HBM chips, which help perform data-intensive AI tasks quickly, are closely watched by investors due to their use alongside AI graphic processors, particularly Nvidia's. The FT said China is concerned because the U.S. HBM controls hamper the ability of Chinese companies such as Huawei to develop their own AI chips. Successive U.S. administrations have curbed exports of advanced chips to China, looking to stymie Beijing's AI and defense development. While this has impacted U.S. firms' ability to fully address booming demand from China, one of the world's largest semiconductor markets, it still remains an important revenue driver for American chipmakers.
