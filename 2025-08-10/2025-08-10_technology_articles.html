                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AR/XR has also clearly been a priority if the last few weeks are any indication (see this paper in Nature about its wristband tech and drips on groundbreaking VR research for proof), and its vision on that front is starting to actually take shape. According to Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth, the company's annual Connect conference in September, where it showcases the latest VR and XR hardware, is going to be a major one. In the past, that's meant a new Quest that's better or cheaper than the last generation, but this year all signs point to new smart glasses. There are a lot of directions a potential Meta smart glasses announcement could take (new third-gen Ray-Ban AI glasses, for example), but there's only one thing I really want to know about what Meta plans to offer, and it's actually pretty simple: will its glasses have a display or not? If I had to guess, that's likely the biggest question on most people's minds, at least anyone who's at all interested in smart glasses as a category. In my experience, it's been the one thing people want to know about Meta's existing Ray-Ban smart glasses when they find out I'm wearing them. And most of those people who ask, “Does it have a screen?” are pretty disappointed by my answer. As surprisingly useful as I've found Ray-Bans to be, they still don't make the idea of smart glasses feel truly smart, and “smart-ish” glasses probably isn't the vibe that Meta is going for. The good news is, for anyone who's hopeful (or expectant) for a pair of Meta-made smart glasses with a screen, it looks like those prayers may be answered. Rumors of a pair of glasses codenamed “Celeste” have been funneling in, and it looks like those smart glasses might have a HUD (heads-up display) on them. What that HUD will do is just as speculative as the Celeste glasses themselves, but rumors suggest that it will be able to show relatively simple information like weather and notifications. One thing you can count on is that if there is some kind of screen involved, they'll likely reach a new, significantly higher price to go along with it. If Celeste has the capabilities we think it will, it'll definitely be a much chunkier gadget than Meta's Ray-Bans, which are only slightly larger than a regular pair of sunglasses. Either way, in my book, Meta only has one metric for success when Connect rolls around next month, and that's finally giving us smart glasses with a screen.

I'm less interested in what Meta could bring to the smartwatch space and more interested in what a smartwatch can do for its smart glasses. Alibaba's smart glasses may sound like a Ray-Ban dupe, but there are already plans for so much more. Smart glasses out of China are operating on another level, and a rumored pair from Alibaba is the latest example. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I expected the hallways to be buzzing with conversations about AI, and they were, but not in the way I'd hoped. For the first two days, the phrase I heard most from my fellow journalists was “we must protect ourselves.” In session after session, the consensus was that AI is a danger, a threat, an enemy coming to replace us. Then I had breakfast at Betts, the restaurant in my hotel, and a single conversation with my waiter gave me another perspective on the AI revolution. Haunted by the fearful rhetoric from the convention, I expected him to either rebuff me or launch into an anti-AI tirade. “You should talk to these guys,” he said. It quickly became clear that for Hamzah and Sargent, ChatGPT is a part of their daily lives. They don't see it as a threat. (Helping You Produce Excellence), ChatGPT has effectively replaced Google. “I use it to build solid, well-structured PowerPoint presentations for my speaking engagements with students,” he told me. But its use extends far beyond his professional life. It's his trip planner, health advisor, and personal coach. “I just used it for my lady's birthday,” he said. It gave me a whole itinerary, a phenomenal itinerary.” When back problems flared up, he turned to the chatbot for help. “I asked it to give me specific home workouts and mobility exercises to relieve pressure from a degenerating disc in my back. Sargent, a former special education teacher, has been using ChatGPT since it launched in late 2022. “I saved about an hour's worth of time writing a lesson plan,” he said. I asked him if it felt like cheating. “No, because I would have done the same thing it did. We spend so many hours outside of the classroom working on our own stuff. If we can make it faster, the better.” Like Hamzah, Sargent is also an avid travel planner, using ChatGPT to map out complex international vacations. Both men hold a pragmatic view of AI's future. They believe jobs will be lost, but that it's on individuals to adapt. Sargent agreed, adding that the key is to focus on what makes you human. Kevin, who first introduced me to the group, represents a different demographic's journey into AI. I'm just going to ask it now,” he told me. His regret over missing out on the Bitcoin boom has also made him wonder if AI could be a tool to help “the little guy” get an edge in investing. “I guess I'm from the generation where all the Wall Street fat cats make money, while us little people just get crushed,” he said. “How do we not be the little guy anymore?” Their manager, Curtis Helser, 56, was also introduced to ChatGPT by his wife about a year ago. He uses it to refine important work emails, making them shorter and more professional. He isn't afraid of it, seeing it as a tool that can be used for good or ill, just like a car. “You have to be in the building,” he said with a laugh. “Kissing babies, shaking hands, that kind of stuff.” The younger employees had fully embraced it, while the older generation was more cautious but still open, integrating it into their lives at their own pace. Perhaps those of us whose jobs are built on creating and controlling information see AI as an existential threat, while those in the service of people see it as just another tool to get the job done. It was happening quietly, in conversations like this, one practical problem at a time. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A social media account linked to Chinese state media wrote an article on WeChat asserting that Nvidia's H20 chips are neither technologically advanced nor environmentally friendly. According to Reuters, the account, Yuyuan Tantian, is connected to China Central Television, which is a key organization in the country's state media (propaganda) apparatus. “When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it,” Yuyuan Tantian said in the article (a translation, we assume). Although its performance is only a fraction of what the top-of-the-line H200 can accomplish, it still sold surprisingly well, resulting in Nvidia posting a record revenue despite temporarily falling under export control between April and July 2025. Aside from its reduced horsepower, Chinese authorities are also concerned with possible hidden geo-tracking and backdoors in the Green Team silicon. Although the headlining statement is not from a government source, China often uses state-linked social media accounts to shape its agenda and signal changes in its official stance without making a direct commitment. So, the criticism may be part of a broader campaign to steer domestic firms away from foreign AI hardware and toward homegrown alternatives like Huawei's Ascend chips. Despite all these issues, many Chinese organizations and entities still purchase Nvidia products. It's been estimated that a billion dollars' worth of these GPUs have been sold in the past quarter, with some companies already advertising the upcoming B300, which is expected to arrive later this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And as a late submission, it already lit Torvald's fuse. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Linus Torvalds, the creator and lead developer of Linux, has publicly dismissed a RISC-V code contribution from a Google engineer as “garbage.” The code was sent as a pull request for inclusion in the Linux 6.17 kernel on Friday, but has been roundly rejected by Torvalds for both its poor quality and for being late. Those are two cardinal sins in pull requests, and misdemeanors that have clearly ignited the Linux creator's infamously short fuse. In response to the RISC-V Patches for the 6.17 Merge Window, Part 1, from Google's Android team member Palmer Dabbelt, Torvalds didn't pull any punches. This is garbage and it came in too late. I asked for early pull requests because I'm traveling, and if you can't follow that rule, at least make the pull requests *good*,” insisted Torvalds. “This adds various garbage that isn't RISC-V specific to generic header files. This is stuff that nobody should ever send me, never mind late in a merge window,” he brusquely elaborated. But even in this mostly reasoned response, Torvalds couldn't resist adding a few more barbs. Rounding off his unvarnished public broadcast to the Google engineer, Torvalds strongly recommended that they try and get in early for Linux kernel 6.18. Moreover, code “without the garbage” would be preferred, in case that wasn't quite clear. Social media responses to the latest Torvalds tantrum have been mixed. It can be true that being unfiltered and direct is an efficient way to communicate. Especially when backed up with reasoning and constructive comments. Also, you could say that Torvalds didn't attack anyone involved, personally. On the other hand, charm can also be a winning strategy. As per the well-known Italian proverb — Il mele catta più mosche, che non fà l'aceto — “Honey catches more flies than vinegar.” But that might be somewhat less fun in terms of tech headlines, and we would probably never again get the chance to put ‘random turd files' in a headline if Mr Torvalds decided to turn a new leaf.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The '90s kid in us will love this aesthetic. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Handheld console modder @natalie_thenerd built a Game Boy Color motherboard using a fully clear PCB, allowing us to see its copper circuit traces in all their glory. Although this is crucial for modern devices, Natalie says that it's not an issue with the handheld console because of its simplicity. It used an acrylic-like material to build the see-through board, which had a low 200-degree Celsius melting point — meaning she had to be extra careful soldering the chips to avoid damage. Aside from the chips, copper, and screen (and a small daughter board), everything else on her custom Game Boy Color is completely clear. Unfortunately, the custom-built clear Game Boy Color is a one-off art project she made for fun, so you cannot buy one for yourself. The clear PCB is flexible and fragile, meaning it may not withstand the rigors of daily use (or a rage-quitting gamer). A couple of users suggested replacing the copper traces with silver for a cleaner look, or adding backlighting to make the handheld console look even cooler. After all, the transparent aesthetic is experiencing a resurgence in tech circles, with the appearance of clear power banks, SSD enclosures, and more. But unless manufacturers can improve the durability of clear PCBs, and make them more affordable, we will not see this hit the mainstream. Nevertheless, we applaud Natalie for her great work and marvel at the truly clear Game Boy Color. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Given the recent news cycle surrounding Intel's administration and its ambivalent future ambitions, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the company lacks proactive plans. The Blue Team is working on its upcoming Panther Lake (mobile) lineup at the moment, set to release later this year, but it's next year's Nova Lake that has leaked yet again. This time, we have spied the purported exact core configs of all Nova Lake variants, including the top-end Nova Lake-HX chip. Coming from reliable tipster Jaykihn, Nova Lake will launch in the usual HX, H, and U variants, each targeting different laptop categories. At the top, the highest-end Nova Lake-HX SKU will feature eight P-Cores, 16 E-Cores, and four low-power LP-E Cores, plus a quad-core Xe3 iGPU—a total of 28 CPU cores when added up. That puts it in the same ballpark as the current Arrow Lake 285HX, albeit with a different balance of high-efficiency cores. Interestingly, this leak does not mention the Nova Lake-AX chips that surfaced earlier. Recently, reports have suggested these are seemingly on the chopping block already, which means Intel still won't have an answer to AMD's Strix Halo. Still, it paints a better picture than Panther Lake, which won't even have an HX variant, but both will fall far behind the rumored 48-core GPU that we might get with Nova Lake-AX. These designs share similarities with the previously leaked Panther Lake-H chips, though with different CPU microarchitectures and a slightly altered GPU layout. Anyhow, we then have likely the Nova Lake-U family with a maximum core count of eight (4P+4LP) along with four Xe3 cores going to the iGPU. On the lowest end, a 2P+4LP model is also expected, carrying only two Xe3 cores, positioned as the successor to Intel's Wildcat Lake platform, catering to budget notebooks where cost and battery life are the main priorities—justifying its lack of standard E-cores. This also means that, if we believe the leak, every single Nova Lake chip is going to have four LP-E cores. We expect to see Coyote Cove P-Cores and Arctic Wolf E-Cores, alongside Skymont-based LP-E cores. As mentioned previously, the GPU cores are from Intel's Xe3 'Celestial' architecture. We also got rumor-mill confirmation that Nova Lake mobile will not use two compute tiles like its desktop counterpart. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. One of the most important senses we have as bike riders is our hearing. Whether you're in a group ride, where other riders are calling out road and traffic hazards, or alone, to keep ears out for vehicles or other rides coming from our rear, our ears are nearly as essential as our eyes. Bone-conduction headphones—which sit outside the ears and deliver sound through vibration—have been around for some time. But Irvine, California-based Sena has consistently raised the bar on bicycling helmets with integrated speakers. Their newest offering, the S1, blends Sena's audio technology with the aerodynamic advantages craved by so many road cyclists. It's sleek, with a quintet of front-facing vents and a pair out the back to keep your head cool during hot rides. Its mixture of flat and gloss finishes gives the helmet a modern contrasting style that would look at home in the Tour de France peloton. It's light, weighing just 360 grams, and at $229, it's priced like a higher-end aero helmet, despite the fact that it's equipped with a pair of over-ear speakers and a microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, a built-in taillight, and Sena's proprietary Mesh Intercom system, which allows you to communicate with other riders wearing any variety of Sena helmets. I tested the Sena S1 on one of the stupidest rides I've done in a long time: that is, when I set out to ride a hundred miles around a quarter-mile asphalt track near my home. For a ride as boring and monotonous as the ¼-mile century I was set to undertake, I needed a bit of distraction. Luckily, I had a Sena S1 sitting in my office. I've never really messed with any sort of headphones while on my bike for a few reasons. I like to hear what's happening around me, especially when riding on the road. The bike is my sanctuary from all that, a place where no Instagram Reel or hot take on a podcast can find me. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Getting my new S1 up and running proved to be no issue. After charging it in full, which took two and a half hours (giving a reported maximum 12 hours of use time), the helmet immediately found and paired with my phone. Once paired, I was able to listen to music and podcasts during my seemingly infinite loop, and take calls from my wife, who reached out every half hour or so for status updates on my silly ride. If I was doing anything other than turning left some 1,600 times, the Sena S1 could have delivered turn-by-turn directions straight into my ears. Despite the fact that I was rolling anywhere between 17 and 20 mph and fighting a vicious headwind on the track's backstretch, my wife's calls were shockingly clear, with the little microphone embedded into the helmet's crown picking up everything I was saying to her. Additionally, even as I listened to music, I was able to hear everything that was happening in the world beyond my helmet, which is essential. One friend, a local racer, volunteered not only to ride with me, but to try a second S1, that we might test out the brand's mesh intercom. We stayed on opposite sides of the track, talking about our families, news around town, about why the hell I was riding a hundred miles in quarter-mile increments. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Now, if you're an audiophile looking for high-end sound quality on your rides, it's best to skip the S1, as the sonics coming out of the speakers is nothing to write home about. I had only one minor problem with the S1. The helmet only has four buttons—a volume up and down button, a multifunction button, and a light button—which means several different functions are assigned to each. For example, the helmet's volume buttons double as cue buttons, allowing you to scan between music tracks on your phone. The problem is, to change the functions of each button, you have to hold them down for a quick second or two. However, it took me a good bit of usage for the order of operations to become second nature. If you, unlike me, are someone who likes a bit of distraction during your rides, it's more than worth the spend. Unless you're also planning on riding a century, one quarter-mile loop at a time, in which case, it's probably essential. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The scam isn't particularly complex, but it has been highly effective. By sending spam text messages that look like genuine notifications for popular services, from postal deliveries to local government programs, unsuspecting victims click a link that loads a phishing page, they enter their credit card details, and that information is swiped and used for fraud. Some victims lost thousands of dollars in the scam, researchers say. As revealed by the Oslo-headquartered security firm Mnemonic and reported in tandem by Norwegian media earlier this year, behind the fluffy cute cat in Darcula's profile photos is a 24-year-old Chinese national named Yucheng C. The researchers say Yucheng C. develops Magic Cat for his hundreds of customers, who use the software to launch their own SMS text message scam campaigns at their victims. Ahead of sharing new findings at the Def Con security conference in Las Vegas on Friday, Harrison Sand, an offensive security consultant at Mnemonic, told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse has been surging in popularity since the demise of Darcula's Magic Cat. Sand also warned of the operation's growing ability to steal people's credit cards on a massive scale. During their investigation, Mnemonic found photos from inside the operation posted in a Telegram channel that Darcula administered, showing a line-up of credit card payment terminals and videos showing racks with dozens of phones used for automating the sending of messages to victims. Sand told TechCrunch that Magic Mouse is already responsible for the theft of at least 650,000 credit cards a month. Sand said these kits contain hundreds of phishing sites that Magic Cat used to mimic the legitimate web pages of major tech giants, popular consumer services, and delivery firms, all designed to trick victims into handing over their credit card details. But despite the prolific nature of Magic Cat and, now, Magic Mouse, and their ability to net millions of dollars in stolen funds from consumers, Sand told TechCrunch in a call that law enforcement is not looking beyond a few scattered reports of fraud or at the wider operation behind the scheme.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of those screens is just my laptop, a very normal thing to have a cuppa joe next to. Nobody seems to care about this very conspicuous tech monstrosity, and that's a blessing because with all of these screens in front of me, I just can't shake the feeling that I'm the Worst Person Here. “Portable” triple-monitor accessories that give your laptop more pixels to work on spreadsheets or whatever multitasking you may require to boost your productivity aren't new. In recent years, cheap display command centers have been flooding social media as a life hack product. I thought it would be fun to take the Triple Aero out into the wild, both to test its tote-ability and to see how socially capable I am of using it in public. This setup has appeal, especially if, like me, you find the cramped confines of a laptop display unworkable, but sitting in the same room for hours and hours, every day, with your dedicated multi-monitor setup feels a little like hell to you. The Triple Aero features three 15.6-inch, 1080p IPS LCD displays on a folding, height-adjustable stand that put it high enough for me to work with proper computer posture instead of hunched over like a laptop gremlin. The displays are just bright enough that I didn't have trouble viewing them in a window-filled coffee shop, but you might have trouble seeing if, on a very bright day, one of those windows is behind the Triple Aero. There are also three Micro HDMI ports, each corresponding to one of the displays, useful if you want to connect multiple devices rather than just a single computer. Aura also doesn't label the buttons, leaving you to figure out how to adjust the monitor's internal settings. I guess I could label everything myself with a strip of tape and a Sharpie, or Aura could just put the labels on the front! Actually using the Triple Aero is a mixed bag, and I don't just mean because it feels weird to set it up in public if that's what you choose to do with it. On one hand, the matte finish IPS displays keep a fairly consistent image, even from broad viewing angles. And they're not even great for that if the software you're working with calls for a monitor with very good color separation—for instance, in macOS, I had a hard time telling between the gray of an active Safari window and the slightly lighter gray of an inactive one. As a result, I just kept trying to type in windows I thought were in the foreground and weren't. This is fine for basic tasks, but it takes a decent chunk of CPU power to run, and I've never met a version of it that doesn't needle you with small bugs. It can take a few tries plugging it in before your computer recognizes it; you may have to rearrange the displays every few tries so your Mac actually knows which is which; the display can lag, with your mouse disappearing and reappearing at random. Maybe that's all fine if you're only using the Triple Aero occasionally, but it immediately reminded me why I gave up using similar tech to add dual display support to my old M1 iMac after just a few weeks. You won't get these problems if you only use the Triple Aero's three Micro HDMI ports, but you'd need a computer that supports that many external displays, which many Apple silicon-equipped Macs do not, along with a Thunderbolt dock that sports three HDMI outputs—and again, many do not. I like the foldable side displays, and my neck was grateful for its height. And since you can use the HDMI ports individually, you and two others can each have an external display. Also, I bet having the displays folded back into a triangle would also be a very fun way to game with friends, old-timey LAN party-style. I didn't get to try that, but I feel it in my bones—show me a few people, a Triple Aero, and three Nintendo Switches (or Switch 2s) equipped with some flavor of Mario Kart, and I'll show you a good time. Also in the plus column, the Triple Aero isn't overly jiggly even with two displays hanging way off its stand. That said, you'll need to get creative to transport the 7-pound unit, as it's got the wrong proportions for a laptop case and the box it ships in is too big to casually toss into a backpack. Aura does sell a felt sleeve and a zippable soft case that each accommodate the Triple Aero, but without a hard case I would still worry about pointed impacts to one of the displays, which faces outwardly when folded for travel. At $699, the Aura Triple Aero 15.6-inch Pro Max falls squarely in the category of things I think would be very handy to have, but would never buy for myself. I just can't see paying as much or more than a decent 4K portable monitor like the Espresso Pro, which is priced the same but is far more premium-feeling, judging by reviews praising its image quality and neat iPad-like modularity. Sure, you lose overall screen real estate with the Espresso, but it sounds like a much more pleasant experience, and you don't have to screw around with drivers that force external display support that your laptop's hardware potentially doesn't do natively.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I've never had particularly sensitive nipples—except for the first time I went to a clothing-optional beach and failed to use enough sunblock—so I was excited to give the Lovense Gemini a try. No, it has nothing to do with Google's AI chatbot. These are vibrating nipple clamps from Lovense, and I've had great experience with many of the company's sex toys. Many of my partners have had sensitive nipples, so I was curious if I could join the ranks with the Gemini. Usually sold for less than $80, they're an inexpensive way to spice up the bedroom. After I fully charged the Gemini, which takes about an hour or so, I used it on myself. What I love is that I can clip the base of the clamps to my bra (there's also a cord you can put around your neck if you don't wear a bra), making them 100 percent hands-free. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Gemini is app-controlled (Android, iOS), so I can lie back and play with the slew of intensities and patterns—surprisingly fun even though I was solo. When I added a bullet vibrator to the mix, the vibrations all over made everything even more exciting in a low-key, kinky sort of way. I also appreciate that the clamps are adjustable, so if you love a tight squeeze, a barely there hold, or somewhere in between, you have options. As much as I enjoyed the vibrations and found the sensation interesting, the Gemini made me realize that, ultimately, I prefer that my nipples get attention from a partner's tongue or with a slight graze of their teeth. To paint a picture of this experiment, I had the app in hand, and three men sat on the couch across from me, waiting for their turn to try the Gemini. (It's the closest I'll probably ever get to an orgy.) Each man had a different preference in intensity and patterns, as well as the tightness of the clamps, so I was able to see just how much the Gemini can be the perfect fit for anyone who's into nipple play. Not only is it waterproof—for all those times you're craving a proper buzz on your nips while in the shower—but you also get a whopping two hours of run time when it's fully charged. The device is discreet, in case you're into public play where one partner enjoys the vibrations, while the other controls what they want you to feel. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. My only gripe is that it can take a bit for your phone to connect to the Gemini. If you're not an app person, don't sweat it. It's here that you can turn it on and off by holding the button down for about three seconds. The biggest selling point is that it takes nipple play to new heights. I'm not just talking about the vibrations, but the reality that we're dealing with actual nipple clamps that might scare some away. If you dip your toe into nipple clamps, what's next? Are you headed toward orgy territory à la Jerry Seinfeld? The Gemini delivers great vibrations, and if you're someone who loves nipple play, I strongly recommend giving it a shot. Even if you don't think it's for you, it will open your mind up to something new, and that newness might be everything your nipples have been seeking.
