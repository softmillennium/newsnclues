                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a tumultuous few seasons in Europe, and a recent transfer saga between Premier League side Nottingham Forest, Ligue 1 club Lyon and the New England Revolution, the U.S. men's national team goalkeeper began to find some stability on Saturday night at Gillette Stadium. While Turner had struggled to find playing time during spells at Arsenal, Forest and Crystal Palace since leaving the Revolution in 2021, it was like no time had passed, as he started in a 2–0 win against D.C. United. “It was pretty emotional walking out for me,” Turner said after the match. I love New England, it's really like home for me.” Neither New England nor D.C. are likely playoff teams this season, sitting 11th and 15th in the Eastern Conference after the match, but it was still a homecoming of sorts for Turner, and some much needed stability. It also ensured an upbeat occasion for the alumni in the building, which included club greats such as Alexis Lalas, Taylor Twellman, Gustavo Bou and many others. Meanwhile, the stops also allowed Carles Gil to have his record-breaking moment come in a victory, as his ninth goal of the season pushed him past the attending Twellman for most goal contributions in club history with 130. Carles Gil has passed Taylor Twellman for the most goal contributions in Revs history (130)!! “For me, it was more than just showing up, but also understanding that there's something to achieve, something to do. So, I want to put in good performances,” Turner added. “I was really happy to be here for Carles. I think there's no one more deserving to have that record for this club right now.” Although the move to MLS may have been seen as a downgrade, it's allowing him to play regular minutes and also return to a club and environment where he knows he can thrive. He makes a couple of key saves, a big one in the first half...his presence, his distribution, really helped us,” Porter said of Turner, even as the Revolution sit eight points out of a playoff spot with nine matches remaining. We've gotta find a way against a really talented team with really talented players, but I think our group can do it.” Ben Steiner is an American-Canadian journalist who brings in-depth experience, having covered the North American national teams, MLS, CPL, NWSL, NSL and Liga MX for prominent outlets, including MLSsoccer.com, CBC Sports, and OneSoccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arne Slot and Oliver Glasner's sides could only be separated by spot kicks at Wembley, with the FA Cup winners trumping the Premier League champions Liverpool were beaten in the Community Shield by Crystal Palace on Sunday, with the Eagles earning a 2-2 draw before winning via a penalty shootout. The Reds failed to put a winnable game beyond Oliver Glasner's side and were denied victory in the season's traditional curtain raiser. A disappointing afternoon for the Merseysiders did begin brightly, as it took only four minutes for Liverpool to have lift-off, and it came from one of their newer faces. However, Palace regained possession in the ensuing scramble, with Virgil van Dijk tripping Ismaila Sarr and conceding a penalty. But Palace were only on equal terms for a matter of minutes, as another Liverpool new boy got on the scoresheet when Jeremie Frimpong scampered away down the right flank beyond Tyrick Mitchell and appeared to dink a cross towards the back post, only for it to float over Henderson and inside the net instead, restoring the Reds' lead. Liverpool had chances to kill the game off in the second half, and were made to pay for their wastefulness when Palace equalised once more in the closing stages. The south Londoners grew in confidence, and Liverpool had Milos Kerkez to thank for making a last-ditch challenge to deny Sarr his brace moments after he had scored Palace's second. VAR checked for a penalty for a handball against Alexis Mac Allister in the build up, though controversially decided the on-field decision was allowed to freely stand. Mohamed Salah, Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott all missed from 12 yards, however, as Palace triumphed 3-2 on spot kicks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club World Cup champions continue their short run-up to the Premier League season with a visit from AC Milan to Stamford Bridge on Sunday for a preseason friendly. Chelsea have Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan in a three-day span as Enzo Maresca has everyone back from the break earned following last month's 3-0 upset of Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup Final. The Blues have a bunch of new faces for this season, a figure that's even higher if you count players they added prior to or during the Club World Cup. That list may grow as Levi Colwill has now suffered a long-term injury. Max Allegri's men are 3-0 this preseason, beating Arsenal on penalties before taking care of Liverpool and Perth Glory over 90 minutes. Ex-Chelsea men Christian Pulisic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and Fikayo Tomori give Milan plenty of familiarity with the venue. Kick off time: 10am ET Sunday (August 10)Venue: Stamford Bridge — LondonTV Channel/Streaming: DAZN Tosin Adarabioyo, Wesley Fofana, and Trevoh Chalobah are with the club while Mamadou Sarr has been loaned to Strasbourg, Chelsea are quite deep in attack and may still add this summer as Alejandro Garnacho continues to be linked with a move to London. While Brighton export Pervis Estupinan and Real Madrid free transfer Luka Modric will take a lot of the headlines, A pair of 23-year-old midfielders, however, are perhaps the more intriguing additions to Milan's project. Samuele Ricci (Torino)Ii is a box-to-box type with 10 caps for Italy who Milan are hoping gives them a true maestro for the long haul, while Swiss star Ardon Jashari arrives from Club Brugge off an impressive season in Belgium after multiple campaigns with Luzern in his home country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than a year away, and preparations to ensure the tournament runs seamlessly have commenced, with organizers now recruiting volunteers. Notably, the 2026 World Cup will mark the first occasion that three countries jointly host games, featuring a record-breaking 48 teams in competition. Dallas, Texas, stands among the cities designated to host World Cup action, with AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, slated to stage nine matches. In advance of the approaching tournament, FIFA plans to launch volunteer applications to assist with the celebrations, requiring more than 6,000 volunteers for the organization. Potential volunteers must be a minimum of 18 years old to qualify and must consent to face-to-face interviews, plus successfully complete background screening. Interviews are scheduled to begin in November and December, with final selections occurring in January and February. Selected volunteers will be required to complete nine shifts lasting six to eight hours each, contributing to guest services, media operations, hospitality, fan operations, and additional responsibilities. Vaca emphasized that bilingual and trilingual candidates represent "an absolute plus." World Cup volunteers are buzzing with excitement as they anticipate receiving their uniforms and accreditation in May and June. Vaca, one of the lucky individuals selected for this honor, can't wait to don the official FIFA World Cup volunteer gear. So that is one of the biggest perks. As Dallas-Fort Worth gears up for the grand soccer event, MetLife Stadium, notoriously dubbed the worst in the NFL and home to the New York Giants and Jets, is set to host eight matches. Jets standout receiver Garrett Wilson didn't mince words about the subpar playing surface. "You're out there running and all of a sudden your legs aren't in the same place your head is at. It's worth mentioning that MetLife Stadium was also the site of NFL icon Aaron Rodgers' Achilles injury.
