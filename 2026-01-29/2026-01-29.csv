            For nearly half a century, Iran has prepared for a war with the United States. Unable to match America's military power, Tehran has instead focused on ways to impose heavy costs that could shake the Middle East and the global economy.
    


            As a US carrier strike group arrives in the Middle East and US President Donald Trump warns he may strike Iran, fears of a wider war are growing once again. Despite being significantly weakened by Israeli and American attacks last summer and mounting domestic unrest of late, the Iranian regime still has a range of options to hit back, experts say, including attacking US interests and Israel, mobilizing allied groups and launching economic retaliation that could trigger global turmoil.
    


            How Tehran chooses to use the tools at its disposal depends on the level of threat it perceives it is facing.
    


            “The regime has a lot of capabilities to use if they see this as an existential war,” said Farzin Nadimi, a senior fellow with the Washington Institute specializing in the security and defense affairs of Iran. “If they see this as a final war, they might throw everything they have.”
    


            Here are the options ahead of Iran in case of a strike against it:
    


            Iran is believed to have thousands of missiles and drones within range of US troops based in a number of countries in the Middle East and has threatened to strike them, as well as Israel.
    


In June, after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran, the Islamic Republic retaliated by firing wave after wave of ballistic missiles and drones at Israel that inflicted damage by bypassing Israel's sophisticated air defenses.
    


            Iranian officials claim many of the stocks used in that war have been replenished, and US officials believe that these battle-tested weapons, as well as aging Russian and American fighter jets, continue to pose a threat.
    


            Iran's Shahed suicide drone, for example, has proved to be a destructive tool in Russia's war in Ukraine. The Iranian regime has also developed, tested or deployed more than 20 types of ballistic missiles, including short, medium-, and longer-range systems capable of threatening targets as far as southern Europe.
    


            “We have 30 to 40,000 American troops stationed across eight or nine facilities in that region,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday. “All are within the reach of an array of thousands of Iranian one-way UAVs (drones) and Iranian (short-range) ballistic missiles that threaten our troop presence.”
    


            Two US officials told CNN that Tehran's military capabilities, even if far outnumbered and much older than modern US systems, make a decisive US strike on the country far more difficult.
    


            Tehran has repeatedly warned that it would retaliate against US allies in the region if attacked. When US bombers struck Iranian nuclear facilities in the summer, Iran launched an unprecedented missile strike in Qatar, targeting al-Udeid Air Base, the largest US military installation in the Middle East.
    


            Over the past two years, Israel has battered Iran's regional network of proxies, significantly curtailing the regime's ability to project power beyond its borders.
    


            Still, the proxies have vowed to defend the Islamic Republic. Iraqi groups like Kataeb Hezbollah and Harakat al-Nujaba — militias that have targeted US forces in the past — as well as Lebanon's Hezbollah, said this week they will come to Iran's aid if it is attacked.
    


            On Sunday, Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, the commander of Kataeb Hezbollah, called on Iran's loyalists “across the globe … to prepare for all-out war in support of the Islamic Republic.”
    


            Despite the threats, Iran's proxies face constraints. In Lebanon, the once formidable Hezbollah has been significantly weakened after 13 months of conflict with Israel and now faces a domestic disarmament campaign. In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias are powerful, but they, too, face hurdles from a central government that is under mounting US pressure to curb Iranian influence.
    


            The Houthi group in Yemen has been targeted by both Israel and the US, but it remains one of Iran's most destructive surrogates, and it has also indicated that it will defend its patron. Last weekend, the Houthis released a video showing images of a ship engulfed in flames, accompanied by the simple caption, “Soon.”
    


            With Iranian support over the past few years, the group has struck Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel, as well as American ships in the Red Sea.
    


            Iran has repeatedly warned that a war against it would not be contained to the Middle East but would send shockwaves through the world. Though militarily outmatched, Tehran has leverage in its ability to disrupt energy markets and global trade from one of the world's most strategically sensitive regions.
    


            Iran, one of the world's biggest energy producers, sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway through which more than a fifth of the world's oil and large share of liquefied natural gas flow. The regime has threatened to close it if attacked — a prospect that experts warn could send fuel prices soaring far beyond Iran's borders and trigger a global economic downturn.
    


            Experts say that targeting the global economy through the strait may be one of Iran's most effective options. It is also the most dangerous because of its widespread impact.
    


            A prolonged closure of the strait would represent a “dangerous scenario,” said Umud Shokri, a Washington, D.C.-based energy strategist and senior visiting fellow at George Mason University. “Even partial disruptions could drive sharp price spikes, disrupt supply chains and amplify inflation worldwide. In such a scenario, a global recession would be a realistic risk.”
    


            Such a move would likely be a last resort for Iran, as it would severely disrupt its own trade and that of neighboring Arab states, many of which have lobbied Trump against attacking Iran and pledged not to allow Washington access to their territory for an assault on Iran.
    


            The Iranian regime says it has naval bases deep underground across the country's coast with dozens of fast attack boats ready to deploy across Persian Gulf waters. The military has spent three decades building its own fleet of ships and submarines with production ramped up over the past years in anticipation of possible naval showdown.
    


            Retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a former US Navy SEAL and deputy commander of US Central Command, said Iranian naval capabilities and proxies present a challenge for shipping in the Strait of Hormuz that “can be addressed very quickly.” But “asymmetric” tools such as mines, drones and other tactics could prove challenging for shipping and oil flow, he said.
    


            Iran's ability to disrupt global shipping and shock the world economy has historical precedent.
    


            Toward the end of a prolonged war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iran laid sea mines in the Persian Gulf, including near the strait, one of which nearly sank the USS Samuel B. Roberts in 1988 as it escorted Kuwaiti oil tankers during what became known as the “Tanker War.”
    


            In 2019, several oil tankers were struck in the Gulf of Oman during heightened tensions between Iran and Arab nations of the Persian Gulf following Trump's withdrawal from a nuclear agreement with Iran. Iran was widely believed to have been responsible.
    


            More recently, during the Israel-Hamas war, the Houthis disrupted commercial shipping at the Bab al-Mandab Strait in the Red Sea, through which about 10% of the world's seaborne trade passes. Together with Iran's ability to threaten traffic through the Strait of Hormuz, Tehran wields outsize power to inflict global economic pain.
    


            “The next war might start not in downtown Tehran, but in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf,” the Washington Institute's Nadimi said.

            President Donald Trump did it after the 2021 attack on the US Capitol. He did it after the 2022 attack on the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He did it after the murder last month of filmmaker and Democratic activist Rob Reiner. And he did it again on Tuesday after an attack on another Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.
    


            After cases of violence targeted at his political opponents, Trump has shown a penchant to respond with conspiracy theories baselessly suggesting the targets of that violence are at fault. When he was asked by an ABC News reporter on Tuesday night whether he had seen the video of Omar being sprayed with a substance by a man at her town hall event, Trump responded, “No. I don't think about her. I think she's a fraud. I really don't think about that. She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”
    


            Such false-flag conspiracy theories were already spreading Tuesday night in pro-Trump circles on social media.  As usual, there was no apparent basis for them.
    


            The man who was arrested, Anthony Kazmierczak, had previously shared anti-Omar content and photos of Trump on social media. He texted his neighbor that he might get arrested at Omar's town hall, then rushed the podium and sprayed her with a substance police believe was apple cider vinegar. Kazmierczak was arrested by Minneapolis police in connection with alleged third-degree assault, and a federal law enforcement official told CNN's Holmes Lybrand on Wednesday that US Capitol Police were pursuing potential federal charges.
    


            The Capitol Police said in a Wednesday statement: “A man is in custody after he decided to assault a Member of Congress – an unacceptable decision that will be met with swift justice. We are grateful for the rapid response from onsite security and our local law enforcement partners. We are now working with our federal partners to see this man faces the most serious charges possible to deter this kind of violence in our society.”
    


            In the past, Trump has been undeterred by official confirmation that his conspiratorial accusations were inaccurate. His comments are part of a long series of unsympathetic responses to incidents affecting people not aligned with him politically.
    


The murder of Rob and Michele Reiner: When director, actor and Democratic activist Rob Reiner and his wife Michele were murdered in December, police arrested their son Nick Reiner, who had a history of addiction and mental health issues, later the same day. But the next morning, Trump wrote a social media post in which he baselessly said Reiner had died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” This might well have been an act of trolling rather than a serious claim, but Trump was at least on the surface blaming Reiner for his own killing.
    


The attack on Paul Pelosi: After a man seeking to kidnap Nancy Pelosi broke into her home in 2022 and hit her husband Paul Pelosi with a hammer, the FBI said in a court filing that the assailant, David DePape, had admitted to smashing a door to get in. But Trump went on to wrongly claim the glass was broken from the inside of the home, “so it wasn't a break-in, it was a break-out,” and joined other Republican figures in hinting suggestively that something in the Pelosis' personal life was responsible for the unprovoked attack. DePape, who had subscribed to various right-wing conspiracy theories, was later convicted by state and federal juries and sentenced to life in prison.
    


The attack on the US Capitol: In the five years after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump has cast baseless blame on a variety of people who were targeted by the violence that day.
    


            Trump has repeatedly claimed the riot was caused by Nancy Pelosi, though there are no grounds for that claim and though rioters were seen on video angrily trying to find her; a Pelosi spokesperson told CNN in 2024 that “as numerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed, Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination.” Trump has also explicitly said that “in many ways, you can blame” his former vice president, Mike Pence, “for January 6th” – though Pence, who was forced to flee from rioters that day, merely did his legal duty to preside over the tallying of the electoral votes and did not have the power to thwart the defeat of the Trump-Pence 2020 ticket.
    


            This month, five years after the insurrection, Trump's White House added another target to the victim-blaming – posting a web page casting aspersions on the police officers who were trying to defend lawmakers and the building in the face of waves of assaults.
    


The kidnapping plot against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: This Trump comment was vaguer than the others. But after the FBI thwarted a 2020 plot to kidnap Whitmer, Trump said at a campaign rally, “I mean, we'll have to see if it's a problem. Right? People are entitled to say maybe it was a problem, maybe it wasn't.” He did not explain why a violent plot against a governor wouldn't have been a “problem”; multiple perpetrators were subsequently convicted and sentenced to years in prison.

Washington is disappointed with the European Union's trade deal with India, a top official in the Trump administration has said.

Europe has been purchasing refined products made in India with sanctioned Russian oil, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Wednesday.

“They should do what's best for themselves, but I will tell you, I found, I find the Europeans very disappointing,” he said.



Bessent said the India-EU deal makes it evident why the trade bloc was wary of joining the US decision to impose a 25% tariff on India last August.

US Treasury Secretary Says Europeans 'Have Put Trade Ahead Of Ukrainian People' By Trading With India📹 CNBC pic.twitter.com/QUcBp2m8jx



“The Europeans were unwilling to join us, and it turns out, because they wanted to do this trade deal,” Bessent said. The US imposed a 50% tariff on India in August, 2025, half of which was due to its oil purchases from Russia.

“So every time you hear a European talk about the importance of the Ukrainian people, remember that they put trade ahead of the Ukrainian people,” Bessent said.

India and the EU finalized a trade deal at a summit in New Delhi on Tuesday, as the South Asian nation and the European bloc aim to negotiate an expanding US tariff regime.

Bessent's comments came amid escalating tensions after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on some European countries due to their opposition to his Greenland annexation plans. Trump later dropped the threat.

Earlier this month, Bessent had claimed that India's purchases of Russian oil had halted following the tariff imposed by Trump.



New Delhi was facing increasing pressure from Washington to stop buying Russian oil in recent months as the White House sought to compel Moscow to settle the Ukraine conflict.

India's oil minister on Wednesday admitted that purchases of oil from Russia were on a downtrend, but attributed it to market conditions and New Delhi's diversification of sources.

MOSCOW, January 29. /TASS/. The North Atlantic Alliance is actually preparing for conflict with Russia, Vladislav Maslennikov, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's department of European affairs, said in an interview with TASS.

""At present, Russia is defined as `the most significant and direct security threat' in all of the North Atlantic Alliance's doctrinal documents as the bloc emphasizes that it will remain such a threat in the long term, even if the Ukraine conflict is resolved,"" the senior Russian diplomat said when asked if Russia and NATO could revive dialogue any time now or in the future.

""Given this, NATO is in fact making preparations for a potential conflict with Russia by increasing military expenditure, building up its capabilities along our borders and deploying additional missions and operations in eastern Europe,"" Maslennikov explained.

On November 15, Germany's defense chief Boris Pistorius said in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that a war between Russia and NATO could allegedly begin before 2029. Commenting on his remark, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova addressed his comment saying that there was no longer any doubt about whom the aggressor is. For his part, Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, added that Pistorius will have to live with the statement that war between NATO and Russia is ""inevitable."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, January 29. /TASS/. Russia is ready to assist with Syria's reconstruction; the European Commission has begun drafting a plan to stop buying Russian nuclear fuel; and US tariffs are unlikely to provide a lifeline to the budget. These stories topped Thursday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Russia supports Syria's territorial integrity, and Moscow is ready to assist with the country's reconstruction, President Vladimir Putin said on January 28 during a meeting with his Syrian counterpart Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is currently visiting Moscow. The Russian leader called regional integration a crucial step in this direction. In turn, the Syrian president acknowledged Russia's role in stabilizing not only the situation in the country but also across the Middle East. The two heads of state praised the notable success of their bilateral relations, noting that trade turnover has grown by more than 4%.

Following al-Sharaa's October visit to Moscow, the two countries established a framework for a new cooperation format. The Russian president addressed key issues across a range of topics, including the humanitarian agenda, prospects for military-technical cooperation, political contacts, and the regional situation, Vladimir Akhmedov, a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Issues of the Modern East at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Izvestia.

Against this backdrop, practical military coordination has also stepped up in recent months. According to Izvestia's source, cooperation between the defense ministries continues. In mid-November, a large Russian delegation arrived in Damascus, and talks between the leadership of the two countries' defense ministries focused on enhancing cooperation and coordination mechanisms.

""During earlier negotiations, the Syrians requested increased security in the southern and central regions and the return of Russian S-300 and S-400 systems, which were dismantled in 2016, because the country's airspace remains open without reliable air defense,"" Vladimir Akhmedov added.

In turn, Russian Center for Middle East Studies President Murad Sadigzadeh told Vedomosti that al-Sharaa's visit to Moscow was partly prompted by recent events in northeast Syria. Russia has maintained contact with all sides of the fragmented Arab Republic through various channels, even during the Assad government. Russia also has traditionally had relatively friendly ties with various Kurdish forces in the region, he stressed.

The Russian-Syrian negotiations are an indication of the gradual recovery of Russia's lost positions in Syria after Bashar Assad's overthrow, Andrey Zeltyn, senior lecturer at the School of Oriental Studies at the Russian National Research University Higher School of Economics, pointed out. The restoration of trade and economic ties between the two countries is a positive sign, despite the interest of the US and Europe in the region, the expert said. ""However, this process should be viewed with caution. The situation in Syria is constantly changing. The withdrawal of Russian military forces from Qamishli, on the contrary, may signal a decline in Moscow's role. Nevertheless, al-Sharaa's visit to Moscow has undoubtedly had a positive impact on bilateral relations,"" he emphasized.

 

The European Commission has started drafting a plan to stop buying Russian nuclear fuel, but that doesn't mean it will be adopted this year. Thirty-one countries worldwide are involved in nuclear energy, but only a few, including Russia, have achieved a high level of development in this area.

Vladimir Chernov, an analyst at Freedom Finance Global, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that gas can be replaced by alternative suppliers, albeit at a higher price. However, nuclear energy does not work that way. There are about 20 Soviet-and Russian-designed VVER reactors in the EU. These are located in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria. They were originally designed for Russian TVEL fuel and Rosatom services. Alternatives only exist on paper. There is no stable, mass-produced replacement so far, the expert emphasized. In theory, the US and France could partially replace Russia in the European nuclear fuel market. South Korea may also participate in this process to a degree. However, their production capacities are limited.

Uranium enrichment is insufficiently developed in the EU itself, Chernov explained. A significant part of the supply chain is still tied to Russian or Soviet-era technologies. A sharp refusal would mean either increased dependence on the US or the risk of disruptions at nuclear power plants. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Europe. Nuclear power provides nearly 25% of the EU's electricity; in some countries, such as France and Slovakia, nuclear power accounts for over 50% of power generation.

Therefore, the consequences for the EU will primarily be related to prices and technology, Chernov noted. The cost of fuel will increase. There will be costs for adapting reactors. The risks of emergency shutdowns during the transition phase will grow. Rising costs will lead to higher electricity prices.

In turn, energy expert Kirill Rodionov stressed that restrictions on nuclear fuel exports would be among the most unpleasant and painful for the Russian nuclear industry. It has many segments: the construction of nuclear power plants, the operation of existing facilities, the production of turnkey nuclear reactors, and so on. Among all these segments, nuclear fuel production is the most profitable. Furthermore, the nuclear fuel sector essentially subsidizes the other segments of the Russian nuclear industry.

 

US tariffs are unlikely to provide a lifeline to the budget. President Donald Trump assures that tariffs have already brought in $600 billion to the treasury. However, in light of the rapidly growing public debt, this sum seems insignificant: during his first year in office, the country's liabilities increased by over $2.3 trillion, setting a new record. Consequently, the total US debt has grown to exceed $38.6 trillion. For comparison, Russia's debt is 86 times smaller at 34.4 trillion rubles.

According to the US Treasury, tariffs brought in about $200 billion to the budget in 2025, economist and financial market expert Olga Gogaladze recalled in a comment to Izvestia. These revenues cover only 10-12% of the increase in public debt, Igor Rastorguev, chief analyst at AMarkets, noted. Assuming borrowing stops rising, it would take the US about eight years to close the gap solely through tariffs. However, this is largely impossible in practice.

The funds received from tariffs are not only intended for debt servicing. The US administration has repeatedly stated its plans to allocate these revenues to other purposes, including payments to citizens and military spending. Thus, tariffs cannot be viewed solely as a tool for reducing debt: they are only a temporary source of revenue that does not stop the growth of borrowing, but only partially eases the situation, Sofya Glavina, associate professor at the Russian University of People's Friendship's Faculty of Economics, pointed out.

By the end of January, markets began selling off the dollar rapidly. This is directly linked to Trump's threats to impose punitive tariffs on eight European countries for disagreeing with his plans for Greenland. These statements sparked panic among investors and an outflow of capital from US assets because they perceived this as an escalation of the trade war with key allies, Gogaladze stressed.

The weakening of the dollar directly impacts US consumers because imported goods, including everyday items, are becoming more expensive. For the global economy, in which the dollar remains the main reserve currency, such sharp fluctuations cause instability in global financial markets and raise the cost of servicing debt for countries with dollar-denominated debt, the expert added.

 

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in China on January 28 for a four-day official visit, the first of its kind since 2018. He will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, and National People's Congress' Standing Committee Chairman Zhao Leji. Starmer is expected to visit Beijing and Shanghai before traveling to Japan.

After the Labor Party came to power in the UK, Beijing and London effectively resumed cooperation, Sergey Tsyplakov, a leading researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Chinese Socio-Economic Studies Center, recalled in a comment to Vedomosti. And Starmer's visit can certainly be called historic, he noted, as it is the first such trip in eight years. According to the expert, China will try to bolster relations with London, as establishing good relations with ""old Europe,"" including the UK, is a strategically important task for the Chinese side. This is also important for the UK, given the uncertainty in its relations with the US. Britain and China have a large volume of mutual trade, in which Beijing has a consistently positive balance, Tsyplakov noted. As for the potential reaction of the US, Washington will undoubtedly closely watch Starmer's visit, who is ""a very cautious man."" However, a sharp reaction from the Trump administration in the form of political statements cannot be ruled out, Tsyplakov emphasized.

Starmer's visit to China is more of a political one, and it's unlikely to lead to any major business deals right now, Alexander Lomanov, head of the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' World Economy and International Relations Institute, stressed. Currently, there are no major joint projects between China and the UK. However, Beijing is interested in high technology and foreign participation in upgrading its old economic sectors. At the same time, participation in these sectors is largely unacceptable for Europe due to security concerns and fears that such products from China will flood its markets, Lomanov said.

Despite the large UK delegation, Starmer's visit is more symbolic than substantive, Sergey Shein, a research fellow at the Center for Advanced European and International Studies at the Russian National Research University Higher School of Economics, pointed out. According to him, one should not have too high expectations from the visit, and it will not open a new chapter in relations between Beijing and London. At the same time, the parties' interest in cooperation is evident: the UK needs Chinese markets and investments, the expert recalled. Trump is not currently interested in undermining special relations with Britain, although an outburst of anger with the threat of new tariffs may still occur, Shein noted.

 

Major Russian refineries are preparing to resume gasoline exports in February. Total exports in February and March are estimated to be between 700,000 and 900,000 tons per month. Expectations that the embargo will be lifted have already been reflected in stock market prices, which have begun to edge higher.

Currently, gasoline exports are prohibited for all market participants until the end of February, and only refineries are permitted to export diesel fuel. These restrictions were introduced in September 2025 amid record exchange prices and the risk of fuel shortages in some regions. However, the embargo does not apply to supplies under intergovernmental agreements. On Tuesday, a source told Kommersant that the Energy Ministry had submitted a resolution to remove the ban on gasoline exports from February.

Before the ban was introduced, Russia's average monthly gasoline export volume was about 850,000 tons, the OMT-Consult analytical company's calculations show. Experts believe that, assuming stable refinery operations and no logistical problems, shipments could reach 800,000-900,000 tons per month in February-March. However, Kirill Bakhtin, head of the Russian equity analytics center at BCS, estimates shipments at 700,000-800,000 tons per month, noting that February and March are periods of seasonally low demand.

Russian refineries have the potential to export light petroleum products, and the economic appeal of exports is very high, Maxim Malkov, partner at Kept and head of the oil and gas sector services practice, emphasized.

However, the decision to lift the ban seems somewhat risky, as the gasoline market balance does not have much reserve, Sergey Frolov, managing partner at NEFT Research, pointed out.

Nevertheless, according to him, temporary permission for foreign supplies during a period of low demand does not pose a significant overall risk, and refineries will be able to boost profitability by utilizing spare capacity and selling at higher prices.

MOSCOW, January 29. /TASS/. Moscow's core demands on Ukraine peace, as set out by President Vladimir Putin, remain unchanged, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

He told reporters that Russia does not have information about the security guarantees the United States and Ukraine could have agreed on.

TASS has compiled the key statements of the foreign minister.

Russia does not comment publicly on the course of the negotiations, believing that they should be shrouded in secrecy: ""[Russian Presidential Spokesman] Dmitry Sergeyevich Peskov has already said that unlike the Ukrainians, we do not comment publicly on the negotiations, which should be kept confidential.""

Russia will look at ""real proposals"" for Ukraine and will not focus on ""those very public games.""

The media will be informed about the progress of negotiations in the UAE on the settlement in Ukraine, ""when everything is already clear.""

Border czar Tom Homan in Minneapolis says ‘no agency is perfect' and acknowledges improvements that need to be made to federal immigration enforcement

‘Nothing has changed': Minneapolis on edge despite Trump's de-escalation vow

During Thursday's press conference, Tom Homan noted that the administration has “recognized that certain improvements could and should be made” in the ongoing immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, but didn't specify what those looked like or when they would be implemented.

The border czar also refused to comment on the newly published video footage of Alex Pretti earlier this month, which appears to show officers grabbing Pretti and bringing him to the ground during intense protests that have gripped Minneapolis.

“We'll let the investigation play out and let it go where it goes,” Homan added.

Moments after Trump said ‘we're getting close' on a deal to avert a US government shutdown, Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for Trump's surge of immigration enforcement.

Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday.

As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands on Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest.

If these demands are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said that Democrats won't provide the needed votes until the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is “reined in and overhauled” and that this is “a moment of truth.”

Trump said that Russian president Vladimir Putin agreed to not fire on Kyiv for a week due to cold weather.

“I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that,” Trump said at the Cabinet meeting, citing “extraordinary cold” in the region.

“It was very nice. A lot of people said, ‘Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he did it,” Trump added.

Trump also said the US “had zero illegal aliens being admitted into our country for the last eight months”.

“That's hard for even me to believe,” he quipped. According to the department of homeland security's own 2025 year-end review, border crossings dropped by 93% year-over-year.

Speaking on the possibility of a government shutdown, Trump said: “Hopefully we won't have a shutdown and we're working on that right now. I think we're getting close. The Democrats, I don't believe, want to see it either. So we'll work in a very bipartisan way, I believe, not to have a shutdown. We don't want to shut down.”

Talks of a government shutdown have been looming since Senate Democrats demanded a series of reforms on federal agents involved in Trump's mass deportation campaign, including a prohibition on wearing masks, the imposition of a code of conduct and independent investigations of violations.

Speaking on Venezuela, Trump said: “We have the major oil companies going to Venezuela now, scouting it out and picking their locations, and they'll be bringing back tremendous wealth for Venezuela and for the United States. And the oil companies will do fine to Venezuela, will actually make for themselves more money than they've ever made before. And that's a good thing.”

He continued: “I just spoke to the president of Venezuela, informed her that we're going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela. American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela, and they'll be safe there.” He also added that he has “instructed Sean Duffy and everybody else concerned, including the military, that if you would, by the end of today, I'd like you out of the airspace over Venezuela”.

Donald Trump has begun speaking at this afternoon's Cabinet meeting. We will bring you lines from the meeting as they come.

Since returning to office, Trump has used his cabinet meetings to review his administration's accomplishments and provide Cabinet members with an opportunity to shower him with compliments.

There's news of shifting sands in Florida, where Alex Vindman, a key player in Donald Trump's first impeachment, announced Tuesday he was running as a Democrat for a US Senate seat.

The army veteran's campaign says it raised a record $1.7m in the 24 hours after launching his candidacy, and it was given a further lift Thursday when Sabato's Crystal Ball, the respected political forecasting arm of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, nudged the race in his favor.

Vindman still has a mountain to climb to topple the incumbent Republican, Ashley Moody, in November. But the shift from “safe” Republican to “likely” Republican is still a notable development in the former swing state that has become reliably red in recent election cycles.

It follows other small but significant Democratic advances during the second Trump administration, including pushing two Republican candidates close in a special congressional election in April, and Eileen Higgins's stunning upset win in Miami's mayoral run-off last month.

Vindman, a retired Lt Col, and his brother Eugene, now Democratic congressman for Virginia, served the national security council in Trump's first term, and raised concerns that sparked an investigation into the president's demands for Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

Florida has not elected a Democratic senator since Bill Nelson in 2012.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels next month, a US official and a Nato diplomat told Reuters.

If Hegseth does not attend the regular gathering, he will be the second US cabinet secretary in a row to skip a Nato ministerial meeting. Secretary of state Marco Rubio did not attend the last Nato foreign ministers' meeting in December.

The US standing in Nato has been on shaky ground since Trump set aggressive sights on obtaining Greenland. Earlier this month, Trump rattled Nato allies after threatening to impose tariffs on a group of European members of the alliance that opposed his bid for Greenland, prompting outrage from EU leaders.

Matt Mahan, the moderate Democrat and mayor of San Jose, California, announced on Thursday that he would run for governor, joining a sprawling but stagnant field to succeed Gavin Newsom.

In a series of interviews on Thursday, Mahan suggested he saw an opening as a candidate focused less on the national politics dominated by Donald Trump and more on the problems facing the state, including homelessness and the soaring cost-of-living.

“We have a lot of candidates following a tired playbook,” Mahan told Politico. “They're either running against Trump or they're running in his image. I'm running for the future of California.”

Mahan, 43, is a former tech entrepreneur who was first elected mayor of Silicon Valley's largest city in 2022. Since then, he has drawn support for his pragmatic approach that he touts for helping make San Jose the safest big city in the nation.

For weeks, he has signaled an interest in running for governor. His entrance into the race, months before the June primary, reflects the unsettled nature of the field, which has so far failed to produce a front-runner.

Mahan is a frequent critic of Newsom, who is term-limited and cannot run again, over the governor's approach to homelessness, crime reduction and even his social media taunting of the president.

The Democrats running for governor include former congresswoman Katie Porter, congressman Eric Swalwell, former health and human services secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer.

Welcoming Mahan to the race, Steyer said in a statement: “California needs a governor who will stand up to powerful interests, not carry their water.”

Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum said today she had a “productive and cordial” conversation with her US counterpart Donald Trump.

“We continue to make progress on trade issues and the bilateral relationship. We agreed that both teams will continue working together,” Sheinbaum said in a post on X.

To stave off the threat of tariffs, the Mexican government has already helped the Trump administration with aspects of its security agenda – the US-Mexico border – by suppressing the number of migrants arriving there and receiving deportees. Earlier this month, Sheinbaum defended the transfer of 37 Mexican cartel operatives to the US as a “sovereign decision”, as her government strives to alleviate pressure from the Trump administration to do more against drug-trafficking groups.

Earlier, Homan said that the immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities is “targeted”.

“We know exactly who we're looking for,” Trump's border czar said, despite many people who have minor or no criminal convictions being caught in the dragnet.

When a reporter asked whether undocumented immigrants — who have not committed a crime — would be affected by the ongoing operation, Homan was resolute.

“If you're in the country illegally, you're never off the table,” he said.

A reminder that living in the US without legal status is a civil offense.

Homan said if the “message” that the Trump administration sends to undocumented immigrants is “don't worry, unless you commit a serious crime, you're good to go” they are “never going to fix this problem”.

A man attempted to raise the American flag in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Wednesday and was stopped by bystanders, according to Danish television channel TV 2. 
  When police later questioned the person, he identified himself with a German satire program called Extra 3, broadcast on the German television station Norddeutscher Rundfunk. Extra 3 is working on a satirical film about the U.S. posture toward Greenland, the station said. 
  A fine was issued “on the spot” for the act.

Officials in Springfield, Ohio, are bracing for an immigration enforcement surge next week as Temporary Protected Status for Haitian immigrants expires.Reporting by the Springfield News-Sun cited messages within the city's school system expecting that a federal immigration enforcement operation may begin in Springfield lasting at least 30 days.
  ”Federal authorities signaled an enforcement window of at least 30 days,” said an email obtained by the News-Sun from Springfield City School District Superintendent Bob Hill, citing a meeting with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. “A federal list of individual removal orders has been identified in Springfield as an initial focal point for enforcement activity, with discretion to detain additional individuals encountered who lack lawful status.”
  Donald Trump falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating residents' pets during a 2024 debate. The fabrication had been pushed by a neo-Nazi group in Ohio. Trump's amplification of the lie made the city a focal point for national immigration debates and threats against immigrants there.

ICE agents have been instructed not to engage with “agitators” following the arrival of Tom Homan amid the fallout after federal agents shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, Reuters reports. 
  The new orders instruct agents to focus on “targeted enforcement,” as Homan described in a press conference this morning, while refraining from random seizures in street stops in Minneapolis. 
  “DO NOT COMMUNICATE OR ENGAGE WITH AGITATORS,” said an email disseminated by a top ICE official. “It serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation. No one is going to convince the other. The only communication should be the officers issuing commands.”
  ICE officers will receive megaphones so that they can issue commands to the public and “need to verbalize every step of the arrest process”, Reuters reported.

Homan didn't answer a reporter's question about the specific number of federal immigration agents that are currently in Minneapolis.

“There's been some rotations,” he said.

This comes after reports that, after Gregory Bovino left the state, a number of border patrol officers were also directed to leave.

Homan also noted that “cooperation” from local officials in Minnesota, specifically access to jails, could lead to the federal immigration crackdown easing up, and a reduction of agents throughout the state.

“As we see that cooperation happen, then redeployment will happen,” he said.

During Thursday's press conference, Tom Homan noted that the administration has “recognized that certain improvements could and should be made” in the ongoing immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, but didn't specify what those looked like or when they would be implemented.

The border czar also refused to comment on the newly published video footage of Alex Pretti earlier this month, which appears to show officers grabbing Pretti and bringing him to the ground during intense protests that have gripped Minneapolis.

“We'll let the investigation play out and let it go where it goes,” Homan added.

Tom Homan, border czar for the Trump Administration, is appealing for politicians and the public for a shift in tone.

“The hostile rhetoric and dangerous threats must stop,” Homan said. “I said in March that if the rhetoric didn't stop, there would be bloodshed. I wish I wasn't right. … “If you want certain laws reformed, take it up with Congress.”

“God bless Minnesota. We can do better,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russian energy giant Lukoil agreed to sell most of its foreign assets to the American investment firm Carlyle, Lukoil's press service announced on Jan. 29.

The U.S. sanctioned Lukoil and another Russian energy company, Rosneft, in October, freezing Lukoil's U.S.-based assets and threatening secondary penalties for foreign entities engaging with them.

The sanctions, the first such measures imposed by the second Trump administration, were designed to pressure Moscow into peace talks in Ukraine, as fossil fuel revenues play a key role in sustaining Russia's war efforts.

The Carlyle deal does not include Lukoil's assets in Kazakhstan and is still subject to approval by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Russian company said, adding that negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing.

The deal's value has not been disclosed, though the estimated value of Lukoil's international assets is up to $22 billion.

Lukoil is Russia's second-largest oil producer and one of the country's largest companies, accounting for 2% of global oil output.

Apart from stakes in oil fields in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere, Lukoil also operates three oil refineries in Europe and hundreds of gas stations worldwide, including in the U.S.

The Trump administration previously granted a sanctions waiver to Lukoil's gas stations abroad as talks on the sale continued.

Swiss-based oil trader Gunvor initially sought the purchase of the company's foreign assets, but withdrew its bid in November after the U.S. Treasury Department described the trader as the ""Kremlin's puppet.""

Estonia is pushing for an EU-wide entry ban on former Russian soldiers who participated in the war against Ukraine, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on Jan. 29.

 ""There cannot be a path from Bucha to Brussels,"" Tsahkna told reporters in the Belgian capital, adding that he would raise the proposal at a meeting of EU foreign ministers later that day.

Estonia, a NATO member sharing a border with Russia, banned access to the Schengen area for the first 261 Russian fighters earlier in January. Tallinn is now calling for a coordinated approach across the bloc.

""We have close to 1 million combatants in Russia. They're mainly criminals; they are very dangerous people,"" Tsahkna said.

""We have information that most of them will come to Europe after the war. And Europe is not ready for that.""

An undisclosed senior Estonian diplomat told Politico that existing methods for identifying and banning individuals are too slow and dependent on individual countries, which is why Estonia advocates for a more robust approach.

Another European official told the outlet that while Estonia has the right to impose a blanket entry ban, this would be difficult for many other EU countries, which would have to list each fighter and the necessary evidence individually.

In Russia, soldiers returning home from the front in Ukraine have been linked to spikes in criminality. Over 1,000 people have been reportedly killed or injured by returning combatants over the past four years, with cases of robbery and drug trafficking also on the rise.

Russia has been extensively recruiting convicts for the war in Ukraine, offering pardons in exchange for service at the front.

A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at the opening bell in New York on Jan. 23, 2026.TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images

Chris Gay is a former Wall Street Journal staffer. He has also worked or written for U.S. News and World Report, the Far Eastern Economic Review, Forbes, Slate and others. He writes the newsletter Figure at Center.

Vegas and Wall Street have way too much in common, but there is one critical difference: What happens on Wall Street tends not to stay there. That's why the world should worry when the Masters of the Universe start emitting hints of crisis.

The news site DCReport ran an exclusive article recently suggesting that unnamed too-big-to-fail banks are feeling a bit stressed these days. The evidence: sudden, highly unusual infusions of New York Federal Reserve cash into the banks since October totalling at least US$85-billion, and a drastic relaxation of the limits on these transactions in early December, possibly to save one of them from the consequences of reckless speculation.

Does this mean the U.S. financial system – and by implication the world's – is circling the drain of the next meltdown? Probably not, but because markets are so easily spooked it doesn't help that the Trump regime is creating the kryptonite of uncertainty by moving to weaken regulatory guardrails put up for good reason following the fiasco of 2008.

Opinion: Markets have proved resilient to Trump's chaos. But investors should be ready for more

Its chief instrument here seems to be Michelle Bowman, since June the Fed's vice-chair of supervision, a role critical to bank regulation. As a shot across the regulatory bow, Ms. Bowman has announced plans to cut the Fed's Washington staff 30 per cent by year's end, largely through attrition and voluntary departures. (Current chair Jerome Powell had already planned a 10-per-cent cut.) Ms. Bowman says that won't impair oversight, which resides in the Fed's 12 regional banks, not in Washington. Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a harsh critic of Wall Street, doesn't buy it, warning that the Fed is “taking more cops off of the Wall Street beat” and risking a return to the reckless behaviour of the early 2000s.

Ms. Bowman has also rebranded part of the Division of Supervision and Regulation as the “business enablement group.” Time will tell whether enablement means “regulatory capture” by powerful industries over agencies that are supposed to police them.

Meanwhile, the Fed is revamping the “stress tests” it uses to assess bank resilience in a crisis. Ms. Bowman says this will enhance system-wide risk monitoring. Her predecessor, Michael Barr, isn't so sure, warning in October that the proposed revisions “will provide illusory comfort in the resilience of the system.”

Opinion: As Trump tries to dominate the U.S. Federal Reserve, how bad could things get?

The biggest banks passed their latest stress tests and posted strong results in 2025, but did so under less rigorous standards than the previous year's, the Fed concedes.

The retreat from postcrisis regulation is not new to Trump 2.0. Trump 1.0 pared back rules instituted under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Washington's postcrash attempt to make banks less risky. The 2018 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act raised the threshold for the strictest level of testing to US$250-billion in assets from US$50-billion, reducing to 12 from 38 the number of banks subject to the most stringent supervision. Many blame the change for the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

The thing to remember about systemic financial crises is that they don't happen at the moment when banks default and stock prices collapse; that's just the moment when most people notice. They happen in a years-long cycle that proceeds something like 1) easy credit, lax regulation and bubble formation, 2) a Minsky moment that deflates the bubble, 3) government bailouts of the culprits, 4) a new round of prudential regulations. 

Gamble, fail, bail, repeat. See how that works?

Problem is, legislators and regulators, like the people who built the Maginot Line, are often girding for the last war, not the next one. All the while, a new generation of risk agents is inflating the next asset bubble.

Seven charts to make sense of stock markets in 2026

The loudest proponent of guardrail removal, of course, is the financial-services lobby, which would do well to recall that former Fed chair Alan Greenspan, once the high priest of light regulation, was forced in 2008 to refute his own claim that financial markets self-regulate, telling Congress that the crisis unfolding as he spoke had revealed a “flaw” in his free-market ideology. That's a bit like saying that there was a little problem at Chernobyl.

Keep in mind also that there is still such a thing as a shadow banking system, where risk proliferates outside regulatory purview, and that black swans are always hovering somewhere. As economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's note in their excellent 2009 book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly – the title a reference to “the most dangerous four words in investing” – “What one does see, again and again in the history of financial crises is that when an accident is waiting to happen, it usually does.”

France's Emmanuel Macron, the EU's Kaja Kallas and the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland spoke of a ""changing world order,"" calling for Europe to act in the wake of US President Donald Trump's Greenland dispute.

French President Emmanuel Macron hosted the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday, while top EU officials at a defense summit in Brussels called for a proactive response to US President Donald Trump's recent Greenland demands.

The leaders called for an urgent European response, taking greater responsibility for its own security, albeit while maintaining the close defense ties with the US touted by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte earlier in the week.

Macron said in Paris that the arguments over Greenland at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week needed to prompt an ""awakening"" in Europe.

He said this would have to focus ""on asserting our European sovereignty, on our contribution to Arctic security, on the fight against foreign interference and disinformation, and on the fight against global warming.""

Speaking to Denmark's Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Macron also confirmed France's solidarity and ""its commitment to your sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

Switching briefly to the indigenous Greenlandic language, Macron said: ""Greenland is not for sale, nor is it up for grabs. The Greenlanders will decide their own future.""

He then addressed Frederiksen in Danish, saying Paris would continue to stand ""side-by-side"" with Copenhagen.

Denmark's Frederiksen, who visited Berlin and Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday, said that despite the turbulence, recent weeks had shown Europe could stand up for itself.

""The world order as we have known it is under pressure, it's changing rapidly,"" she said. ""Maybe it is gone.""

Prior to Wednesday's joint press conference, Frederiksen had also said it was necessary for Europe to improve its defense ""now"" to become less reliant on US protection.

Meanwhile, Greenland's 34-year-old Prime Minister Nielsen thanked Macron for ""standing by us without hesitation.""

""We in Greenland will not forget it,"" he said.

Trump has ""shaken the transatlantic relationship to its foundation,"" the EU's foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas said at the European Defense Agency's annual conference on Wednesday.

While Europe had sought to stay on Trump's good side in the hope of maintaining US support for Ukraine, Trump's threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark sparked a change in tone from European leaders.

""Let me be clear: we want strong transatlantic ties. The US will remain Europe's partner and ally,"" Kallas said. ""But Europe needs to adapt to the new realities. Europe is no longer Washington's primary center of gravity.""

""This shift has been ongoing for a while. It is structural, not temporary. It means that Europe must step up — no great power in history has outsourced its survival and survived.""

She went on to say that for NATO to maintain its strength, it ""needs to become more European"" and to achieve this, ""Europe must act.""

""The risk of a full-blown return to coercive power politics, spheres of influence and a world where might makes right, is very real,"" Kallas warned, insisting that Europe ""must acknowledge that this tectonic shift is here to stay.""

Kallas, who previously served as the prime minister of Estonia, has been a leading voice in support of Ukraine and long opposed European relations with Russia before the 2022 invasion.

However, her comments approached the issue from the opposite angle to those made by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday who warned that Europe could not fend off Russian aggression without the US.

Rutte, speaking in the European Parliament, said the bloc would have to double its defense spending targets — currently at 5% — if it wanted to replace the US nuclear umbrella.

He went on to say, ""Putin will love it"" if Europe seeks to build up its own forces as a means to get rid of US support. Instead, he called for continued cooperation as Europeans boost defense spending and take steps to strengthen their defense industries.

Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt and an office in Berlin were searched. The German government also lowered its growth forecast for 2026.

This blog is now closed, thanks for reading our coverage of what Germany was talking about on Wednesday, January 28. 

Thuringia's state Premier Mario Voigt announced on Wednesday that the Technical University of Chemnitz was revoking his Ph.D. title amid allegations of plagiarism in his thesis. 

He said he would appeal the decision. He accused the university of an unfair evaluation of the charges, which originally surfaced in the heat of the 2024 state election campaign. 

Voigt argued that the university had brought in external evaluators in 2024 who did not find grounds to revoke the title.

""Why the university did not heed this report, which it had commissioned itself, is not clear to me,"" he said at a press conference, arguing that they then reevaluated the case after coming up with ""new rules of the game."" 

Christian Democrat Voigt completed his doctorate in 2008, with a thesis that he had primarily compiled in the United States, entitled: ""The American presidential election campaign. George W. Bush versus John F. Kerry."" That was the 2004 presidential election, when Bush won a second term.

A considerable number of German politicians seek advanced degrees before entering politics. In recent decades, similar plagiarism scandals have emerged and dogged or even destroyed a string of senior politicians' careers.

The populist, far-right Alternative for Germany, which leads the opposition and was the largest single party in 2024's regional election, has called for Voigt's resignation, saying the alleged plagiarism brings shame on the eastern state.

A proposal from the economic wing of Germany's conservative Christian Democrats to place tighter restrictions on part-time contracts has come under hefty criticism.

A wing of the party that represents entrepreneurs has called for measures to discourage people from cutting their hours for ""lifestyle"" reasons.

The German government has lowered its 2026 growth forecast to 1%, conceding that efforts to kickstart Europe's beleaguered top economy with vast public spending were moving more slowly than hoped.

""The expected stimulus from economic and fiscal policy measures did not materialize as quickly or to the extent that we had assumed,"" Economy Minister Katherina Reiche (CDU) said on Wednesday.

Back in October, the government had predicted 1.3% growth and, while the performance is still set to be better than in recent years, officials in Berlin had hoped for a stronger turnaround.

After two years of recession between 2023 and 2025, and further challenges including a manufacturing slump, high energy prices, fierce international competition and US President Donald Trump's tariff blitz, Germany's export-driven economy has been struggling.

Since taking office last year, Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has eased Germany's strict debt rules to pave the way for hundreds of billions of euros of defense and infrastructure spending, but critics say the outlays have been slow to filter through to the wider economy.

Nevertheless, Reiche insisted that ""we are now seeing a significant recovery"" — albeit slower than hoped.

The offices of Germany's leading bank, Deutsche Bank, were searched by police prosecutors on Wednesday morning as part of an investigation into suspected money laundering.

The raid, which took place at the bank's headquarters in Frankfurt as well as at one of its offices in Berlin, come one day before the bank presents its annual results for 2025.

According to Der Spiegel news magazine, the search in Frankfurt started just after 10:00 a.m. and involved around 30 plainclothes investigators.

""We can confirm that the Frankfurt prosecutors' office is carrying out measures at the premises of Deutsche Bank,"" a bank spokesman told the AFP news agency, adding that it was ""cooperating fully with prosecutors.""

The probe, which is being conducted by Frankfurt state prosecutors in cooperation with the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), is believed to be linked to the bank's previous business dealings with foreign companies that are themselves suspected of money laundering.

According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) broadsheet, the foreign companies in question are linked to Russian billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich – who has been sanctioned by the European Union following Russia's invasion of Ukraine due to his proximity to the Kremlin.

Abramovich is most well known as the former owner of English Premier League football club Chelsea, which he was forced to sell for around £2.5 billion (€2.88 billion, $3.44 billion) in May in 2022 in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

""No further information can be provided regarding the background to the business relationships, the transactions carried out via Deutsche Bank AG and their scope, or the companies themselves,"" a spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office explained.

The SZ reported that Deutsche Bank was being investigated on suspicion of not reporting possible money laundering in a timely manner – an accusation the bank has faced once before.

The bank's headquarters were raided in April 2022, while the national financial supervisory authority also assigned a special representative to monitor its progress in the fight against money laundering.

As the generation that witnessed the Holocaust slowly passes away, Germany ""must find new ways to keep remembrance alive,"" parliamentary speaker Julia Klöckner (CDU) said at a commemorative event in the Bundestag on Wednesday.

""We don't just uphold our reason of state outside our borders,"" she said. ""It begins here on the streets of Berlin, outside the synagogue in Munich, on school playgrounds, in lecture theaters, on X and TikTok.""

Klöckner said life in Germany had become ""more dangerous"" for Jews in recent years and called for greater protection of Jewish life through increased understanding and also tougher punishment for antisemitic crimes.

""If you live in Germany, you live in the freedom and protection afforded by the constitution,"" she said. ""If you have a German passport, whether by birth or naturalization, that constitution must be respected. It's not a suggestion; it's a categorical imperative. It's your country, and your history.""

Police in Berlin have confirmed that 14 people were injured in a fire at the city's Jewish Hospital on Tuesday night (see earlier post) but said that no political motive had been established.

A 71-year-old patient, who was being treated for generally ill health in the clinic, is suspected of setting fire to an object near his bed, with the fire spreading to his mattress.

Hospital staff immediately began tackling the blaze and moved patients to another ward, but couldn't prevent 14 smoke inhalation injuries to patients, staff and two police officers.

Prosecutors are investigating a case of suspected arson, but have ruled out any political motive behind the incident.

The Jewish Hospital in Berlin's northern Wedding district was founded more than 260 years ago by the city's Jewish community, offering rabbi visits and kosher food for Jewish patients, but also offers medical services regardless of religion, origin, or political beliefs.

German customs officials have made one of their biggest drug busts in years, uncovering 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of heroin being smuggled into the Hamburg port.

Following an X-ray check, about 400 individual packages of the drug were discovered in a container arriving from Singapore full of paper for the printing industry. That took place on December 5, but was only announced on Wednesday for investigative reasons.

The street value of the haul is around €32 million ($38 million). According to the Federal Criminal Police Office, a total of 144 kilos of heroin was found by authorities in Germany in the whole of 2024.

Following investigations, the customs authorities raided several residences and businesses in Bremen, Bremerhaven and Osterholz-Scharmbeck. The investigations are still ongoing.

Despite the historic size of the find in Hamburg, Dutch authorities secured an even greater drug bust in Rotterdam, seizing 5,000 kilograms of cocaine, with an expected value of around €250 million.

All four German Bundesliga representatives are in action in the final round of the Champions League league-phase on Wednesday night – although only Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen have anything left to play for.

After drawing at home to Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt in December and losing away at Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur last week, Dortmund only have a mathematical chance of finishing in the top eight and qualifying directly for the knock-out stage.

A draw at home to Italian giants Inter Milan at the Westfalenstadion will secure qualification for the play-off round  in which BVB can ensure they land in the top half of the draw with a win.

For Leverkusen, the situation is more dangerous as they host Spanish side Villarreal. Only a win will guarantee a play-off spot while a defeat or a draw could leave them reliant on results elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Bayern Munich travel to PSV Eindhoven having already qualified directly for the knock-out round, and Eintracht Frankfurt host Tottenham, but have already been eliminated.

The eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt on Wednesday elected a new state premier, seven months ahead of key state elections.

Sven Schulze — a member of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — was elected by local parliamentarians, achieving an absolute majority in the first round of voting.

Schulze, 46, who previously served as Saxony-Anhalt's economy minister, takes over from long-serving predecessor Reiner Haseloff (also CDU) at the head of a coalition government which also includes the Social Democrats (SPD) and Free Democrats (FDP).

But it's the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) who are leading in the polls ahead of the September 6 elections with 39%, followed by the CDU (26%), the Left Party (11%), the SPD (8%) and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) on 6%.

As it stands, the Green Party (3%) and FDP (2%) would fall short of the 5% hurdle required to enter the state parliament.

Like other CDU leaders across Germany, Schulze has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD.

The AfD won a state election for the first time in neighboring Thuringia in 2024, but was unable to form a government after other parties refused to form coalitions with it  a policy known in Germany as the Brandmauer, or ""firewall.""

Police in Berlin said on Wednesday morning that they had indications of a possible political motive following a fire at the Jewish Hospital in the German capital.

The fire occurred at the clinic in the northern Berlin district of Gesundbrunnen on Tuesday evening.

Investigators said a 71-year-old patient was detained after allegedly setting fire to an object in a hospital room — thought to have been a mattress that then caused heavy smoke.

Initial reports said three emergency responders and five hospital staff members suffered smoke inhalation while the suspect was also injured.

The fire was reportedly extinguished without the need to evacuate the hospital.

A police spokesman said investigations into the motive were ongoing.

Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, will hold an hour of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust on Wednesday, in the presence of Tova Friedman, a survivor of the Nazi genocide.

Friedman, now 87, was born near Gdansk, Poland, in September 1938 and imprisoned in Auschwitz concentration camp in June 1944. She and her mother survived and were liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945.

""The authentic voice of Tova Friedman is a voice of warning in the present day,"" said parliament speaker Julia Klöckner , of the Christian Democrats. ""Her special commitment against forgetting is more important than ever.""

Now a US citizen after moving to the United States, Friedman is a therapist and author who, with the help of her grandson, produces short videos for TikTok to raise awareness about the Holocaust.

International Holocaust Remembrance Day is celebrated on January 27, the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by the Red Army. Wednesday is the German parliament's closest plenary session to the actual day.

Two men reportedly fired shots at an elite police unit during a car chase in southern Germany Tuesday evening, causing a road accident in which five people were lightly injured.

Officers from the Spezialeinsatzkommando (special deployment unit, or SEK) had attempted to arrest three men, aged 23, 24 and 30, in the small town of Absberg near the city of Nuremberg on suspicion of illegal possession of weapons.

While the 30-year-old was arrested, the other two reportedly fled in a car and fired shots at pursuing SEK officers before crashing into another vehicle near the town of Weißenburg, about 23 kilometers (14 miles) away. According to police, the SEK also fired one targeted shot at the tires of the fleeing car in order to bring it to a halt.

""We have to presume at the moment that we were dealing with live ammunition, since the officers' car has a bullet hole in it,"" said a police spokesman, confirming that both men had been arrested and a firearm recovered from the vehicle.

Prosecutors have charged the 23-year-old driver with dangerous driving and the 24-year-old passenger with attempted murder, while an investigation has been opened into whether the suspects were involved with violent criminal groups.

Police were also looking for a potential fourth suspect with the help of a helicopter and sniffer dog — but found no one was found.

Guten Morgen! Welcome to DW's coverage of what Germany is talking about on Wednesday, January 28.

Five people were lightly injured Tuesday evening in a dramatic car chase in Bavaria, during which fleeing suspects and pursuing police officers exchanged gunfire.

The 11 members of gangs based in northern Myanmar were sentenced to death in September. Beijing has been cracking down on cyberscam compounds in Southeast Asia in recent years.

China has executed 11 people who were convicted of being part of criminal gangs in Myanmar, including ""key members"" of telecom fraud operations, Chinese state media reported on Thursday.

The 11 were found guilty and sentenced to death in September by a court in Wenzhou, in China's eastern Zhejiang province, Xinhua news agency said.

The executed criminals included members of the ""Ming family criminal group,"" state media said.

They were sentenced to death ""for crimes including intentional homicide, intentional injury, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling establishments,"" Xinhua reported.

The 11 criminals had been found guilty of having ""established multiple operational bases in Myanmar to engage in telecom fraud, operate illegal gambling dens and commit other crimes"" in operations dating back to 2015.

According to the Supreme People's Court (SPC), which reviewed the case after the 11 defendants appealed the verdict, the funds involved in the fraud operations and gambling exceeded 10 billion yuan (around €1.2 billion or $1.4 billion).

""The gangs also intentionally murdered, assaulted, and illegally detained people involved in fraud, resulting in the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and causing injuries to others,"" Xinhua reported.

Scam compounds have thrived in Southeast Asian neighbors Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, particularly in the latter's lawless border areas.

The scam centers, which are part of a multibillion-dollar illegal industry, are usually staffed by foreigners, including Chinese nationals.

Many of them claim they were trafficked and forced to work at the centers, scamming people online.

In recent years, Beijing has increased its collaboration with Southeast Asian countries to clamp down on the scam centers.

According to crime experts, most of the compounds are operated by Chinese crime syndicates collaborating with militias in Myanmar.

Tens of thousands of people have been repatriated to China as a result of the crackdown.

In 2025, over 7,600 Chinese citizens suspected of telecom fraud and online gambling were repatriated from the Myanmar town of Myawaddy, on the southeastern border with Thailand.

This month, Chinese tycoon Chen Zhi was extradited to China from Cambodia. The US accuses Zhi of having run the Prince Holding Group, one of Cambodia's largest conglomerates that the US says served as a front for ""one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations.""

In April, the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime warned that the cyberscam industry was proliferating globally and that hundreds of thousands of people were estimated to be working in scam centers around the world.

Donald Trump was accused of abandoning Iranian protesters when he decided against a military response to the regime's brutal crackdown.

But since then, the US has been quietly building up a fearsome military force in the Middle East that leaves it poised to strike, if the president so chooses.

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying destroyers entered the Middle East on Monday.

Two days later, Mr Trump announced that an armada was heading for Iran with “great power, enthusiasm and purpose”. He threatened to bombard the regime if it did not kill its nuclear programme.

“The next attack will be far worse” than the lightning bombing campaign carried out against Iran's nuclear facilities as part of Operation Midnight Hammer in June, he warned early on Wednesday.

In June 2025, following a week of escalating airstrikes between Israel and Iran, the United States directly intervened, hitting three Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz with bunker-buster bombs.

“Don't make that happen again,” Mr Trump said.

Elements of the Lincoln Carrier Strike Group (CSG) have been dispatched from the South China Sea, an area of strategic importance for the Pacific-facing United States.

The fact that the assets were moved from a region crucial to US national security operations suggests Mr Trump is attempting to put on a display of awe-inspiring might ahead of any negotiations with the Iranian regime.

Mr Trump has long insisted that Iran must not be allowed to possess nuclear weapons or develop its nuclear capabilities.

After weeks of violent protests, the Iranian regime is depleted, and Mr Trump appears to be strong-arming leaders into denuclearising by threatening a strike in response to the killing of demonstrators.

The death toll rose to at least 6,221 on Thursday, according to the Associated Press.

Mr Trump would not move the armada into the region without any forethought of how it will be used. The equipment will have been specifically selected to crush Iran's defence systems in the event Tehran refuses to play ball.

The aircraft carrier was escorted by three Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyers. Normally, lurking beneath the waves nearby would be a nuclear attack submarine.

The CSG boasts a huge amount of firepower.

It brings eight squadrons flying F-35 stealth fighter jets, F/A-18 Super Hornets, as well as E-18 Growler electronic warfare planes.

These capabilities were all used in tandem during the recent Operation Absolute Resolve to topple Nicolas Maduro's regime in Venezuela and bring the long-time dictator into American custody to face drug charges.

The Growlers swooped in to scramble and jam radars and communications, while the F-35s and F/A-18s delivered kinetic strikes to suppress enemy air defence, allowing special forces helicopters to carry commandos in and out of Venezuela with barely a dent.

Like Venezuela, Iran's air defence architecture is based on Russian technologies.

A similar operation would likely make light work of the Islamic Republic's radar and surface-to-air missile systems.

What is not known is whether Tehran was able to rebuild its air defences after Israel obliterated them, giving the Jewish state's F-35s and other jets air superiority during the 12-day war.

The US took advantage of this window to drop bombs on Iran's nuclear sites.

While it is highly unlikely the US will attempt to land ground forces in Iran, a similar aerial sortie can be expected to test its air defences before mounting a more sizeable bombardment against the Islamic Republic, should Mr Trump follow through on his threats.

Waiting off the shore, the three destroyers — USS Frank E Petersen Jr, USS Michael Murphy and the USS Spruance — bring a series of missile tubes to the region which could be used for long-range strikes with Tomahawk land attack missiles, as was the case during Operation Midnight Hammer.

These vessels could also play a key role in defending US and allied assets from any Iranian counter-attack.

The United States has also deployed F-15E jet fighters to a base in Jordan, and is moving Patriot and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defence) air-defence systems into the region to protect American installations and its partners from Iranian retaliation, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“The US is flooding assets back into the region,” said Michael Hanna, the US programme director at International Crisis Group. “We see this major buildup in the region.”

According to the Associated Press, the Lincoln strike group has joined three Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), small, agile combat vessels, that were docked in Bahrain on Friday, as well as two other US navy destroyers already operating in the Persian Gulf.

Central Command also said on social media that the Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle now has a presence in the Middle East, stating that the aircraft “enhances combat readiness and promotes regional security and stability”.

Analysts of flight-tracking data have also identified dozens of US military cargo aircraft heading to the region, the Associated Press reported.

The carrier's arrival is believed to have added roughly 5,700 service members to the already around 50,000-strong US military presence in the region.

Mr Hanna said the strikes on Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz set an “important precedent”. He added that, since then, Mr Trump has broadened his rhetoric on Iran, escalating from ballistic missiles to the repression of protests.

“He seems to have expanded the way he's thinking about Iran,” he said.

As US warships headed to the region, Iranian authorities unveiled a new mural on a giant billboard in a central Tehran square with a direct warning to the United States not to attempt a military strike on the country.

The image depicts an aircraft carrier with a flight deck littered with damaged fighter jets.

Bodies are scattered across the deck, and it is smeared with blood which spills into the sea behind the ship, forming a pattern evocative of the stripes of the US flag.

Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who heads coordination between Iran's army and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has warned that any military strike on Iran would turn all US bases in the region into “legitimate targets”.

And following Mr Trump's Truth Social threat on Wednesday, Iran insisted that “if pushed, it will defend itself and respond like never before”.

Mr Hanna noted that the US already maintains extensive forward-deployed forces and bases across the Middle East, but said the latest buildup could reflect political constraints on launching operations from allied territory.

“US partners may not want the United States to launch strikes from their soil,” he said.

The United States has maintained its military presence in the region for decades.

The Council on Foreign Relations reports that the US runs an extensive network of permanent and temporary military facilities at a minimum of 19 sites.

Mr Hanna added that Washington also does not technically need an aircraft carrier to strike Iran, pointing to previous long-range operations launched from outside the region, but said deploying the Lincoln provides “a lot more options”.

When the US hit Iran's nuclear sites last year, its forces reportedly launched 30 tomahawk missiles from submarines and carried out strikes with B-2 bombers.

While some observers believed the window for US action tied to Iran's protest crackdown had closed – there have been no further protests for days – the new military buildup has reopened questions about Washington's intentions.

“I think it's a fool's game to predict what Trump is going to do. But what is clear is that the United States is in a very different regional posture now,” said Mr Hanna.

“It could be an attempt at diplomacy,” he added. “There might be ultimatums related to Iran's nuclear programme, its ballistic-missile programme, regional behaviour, or possibly even issues tied to domestic protests.”

While some assets are already in place, additional deployments are expected over the next few weeks.

On Wednesday, Mr Trump ended his warning by saying: “Time is running out, it is truly of the essence! As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL!”

Critics said the action in Fulton County had triggered fears of federal interference in this year's midterm elections.

When the FBI executed a warrant on Wednesday to seize records from the 2020 presidential vote in Fulton County, Georgia, it marked both an extraordinary event in the history of American elections and a significant escalation in President Donald Trump's breaking of democratic norms, several legal experts said.

Trump has long claimed, without evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from him and blamed Georgia, in particular, for his loss to Joe Biden. After the election, he famously made a call pressuring the secretary of state to “find” him enough votes to win. About a week ago, in a speech at the World Economic Forum, Trump once again called the 2020 election “rigged” and promised, “People will soon be prosecuted for what they did.” 

The warrant served on the Fulton County election center sought ballots, tabulator tapes, digital data and voter rolls, which it alleged might constitute “evidence of the commission of a criminal offense.” It cited stiff criminal penalties related to “the procurement, casting, or tabulation” of fraudulent ballots.

“I'm not aware of something like this happening ever before,” said Rick Hasen, a professor at the law school of the University of California, Los Angeles. “The idea that federal officials would seize ballots in an attempt to prove fraud is especially dangerous in this context when we know there is no fraud because the Georgia 2020 election has been extensively counted, recounted and investigated.”

Trump and his allies filed over 60 legal cases across the nation seeking to overturn the 2020 election results — all of which failed, even those before Trump-appointed judges. 

“This just looks like a way to use the might of the federal government to further Trump's voter fraud narratives,” Hasen said.

An FBI spokesperson declined a request for comment except to say that the bureau “is conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity. No other information is available at this time.”

At a press conference, Fulton County Commission Chair Robb Pitts said that the ballots had been “safe” in the county's custody and defended its handling of the election as fair and accurate. But now that the ballots had been seized, he said, the county “can no longer satisfy … that those ballots are still secure.”

Mo Ivory, a Democratic Fulton County commissioner, arrived on the scene shortly after the FBI agents and said that once an error on the warrant was corrected, they backed up lines of trucks to the elections warehouse and spent hours carting away boxes of ballots and other materials. The search began in the morning and was still going well past nightfall. 

“This is not legitimate. This is Donald Trump's obsession with losing the 2020 election,” Ivory said. “This is his way to sow doubt that Fulton County doesn't hold proper elections.”

Fulton County — which covers much of the Democratic-stronghold of Atlanta — has long been the target of attempts to call into question its election systems as a way to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 vote. 

In the immediate aftermath of the election, Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani accused election workers of rigging the vote with suitcases of ballots in his arguments to overturn the election — claims that were quickly debunked and for which he lost a nearly $150 million defamation lawsuit brought by two of the workers.

But this did not end the focus on the county by Trump's allies, who inundated it with thousands of voter registration challenges and continued to make claims of voter fraud, as ProPublica has reported. 

The Fulton County Board of Elections became a battleground, once the Republican Party appointed Julie Adams to it. Adams, ProPublica has reported, played a key role in trying to change rules around certifying elections in Georgia that could have allowed activists to dispute a Trump loss in 2024. (Adams didn't respond to questions from ProPublica for these articles.)

In advance of the 2024 election, right-wing activists also forced out a moderate conservative on the Georgia State Election Board, tilting its balance of power. Its new MAGA majority — which Trump praised by name at a rally as “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory” — began relitigating the 2020 election. In October 2024, the State Election Board voted to issue subpoenas for 2020 materials, including ballots. 

Once Trump returned to the White House, state and federal officials combined to pressure Fulton County to hand over 2020 voting materials. 

In the months after the State Election Board passed a resolution suggesting the Justice Department should intervene, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters to Fulton County officials demanding records and citing “anomalies” in counting votes during the 2020 election, according to a court filing.

Fulton County Clerk Ché Alexander didn't respond, and in December the U.S. Department of Justice sued her.

In a court filing, Alexander said that the federal government had no right to the ballots and documents, which were under seal because of ongoing cases related to the 2020 election.

Alexander said that if Bondi could “identify a legitimate basis” for accessing the 2020 election materials, then she should seek an order from a Fulton County Superior Court judge to unseal them.

On Wednesday, agents wearing tactical vests and jackets reading “FBI Evidence Response Team” arrived with a warrant. Shocked officials looked on as the boxes were paraded away.

Ivory, the Fulton County commissioner, said that while county officials had complied with the warrant, they expected to challenge the administration's actions in court. 

“We've assembled a team to fight back against this,” Ivory said. “We'll see what happens. The legal maneuvers are happening right now.”

Experts said the action in Fulton County had triggered fears of federal interference in this year's midterm elections.

“It's a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to expand federal control over our country's historically state-run election infrastructure,” said Derek Clinger, a senior counsel at the State Democracy Research Initiative, an institute at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

Some Europeans have cited Trump's violent immigration crackdown and threats to annex Greenland as reasons for a boycott.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Calls are growing for European countries to boycott the 2026 FIFA World Cup later this year in opposition to President Donald Trump, as many of the games are set to take place in the United States. 

The World Cup will be held in multiple locations across three countries in North America (Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.), with most games happening in the U.S. Many fans are concerned about traveling to the U.S., noting not only the high ticket and travel costs, but also difficulties getting travel visas due to Trump's immigration policies and the invasive surveillance measures his administration is implementing against people entering the country. 

There are additional political concerns for fans and world leaders alike, including the Trump administration's invasion of Venezuela earlier this month, its continued threats against Greenland, and its violent crackdown on immigrants and protesters.

Left-leaning French politician Éric Coquerel has urged a boycott of the games, taking note of numerous actions by President Donald Trump over the past year. 

“Can we really imagine going to play the footie World Cup in a country that attacks its ‘neighbors,' threatens to invade Greenland, undermines international law, wants to torpedo the U.N.?” Coquerel recently asked. 

Polling indicates Europeans would potentially consider a boycott under certain conditions. A survey in Germany, whose team is considered a top contender, found that 1 in 2 residents (47 percent) approved of a boycott of the games in the event the U.S. attempts to annex Greenland.

In the Netherlands, an online petition has amassed over 156,000 signatures calling for the Dutch team to boycott the games.

“We do not want our players, through their actions at the tournament, to implicitly support President Donald Trump's violent terrorist policies against innocent migrants,” a translated version of the petition reads. 

“We also condemn the aggressive military intervention of the United States in other countries and find it unacceptable that our players should play at a tournament hosted by a president who threatens to invade and occupy” Greenland, the petition adds.

Oke Gottlich, vice president of the German Football Association, said he would like to have a more serious discussion about a boycott, referring to the geopolitical situation that led to a U.S.-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

“By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then,” Gottlich opined. “We need to have this discussion.”

Other voices are not necessarily calling for a boycott, but for other actions to be taken. Dozens of members of Parliament in the United Kingdom have called on FIFA to exclude the U.S. team from the games, citing reasons similar to those used to exclude Russia in other international competitions, including that the Trump administration's “conduct undermines the rules-based international order.”

Swiss attorney Mark Pieth, who chaired the Independent Governance Committee, which oversaw FIFA reform over a decade ago, has pushed for soccer fans in Europe to avoid the U.S.-based portion of the games.

“For the fans, there's only one piece of advice: stay away from the USA!” Pieth said.

On Monday, former FIFA president Joseph Blatter shared Pieth's comment in a post on X, backing the fan-based boycott of the games held in the U.S.

“I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup,” Blatter wrote.

Boycott the FIFA World Cup in the USA. Don't reward fascism. #3E #BoycottFifaWorldCup #BoycottUSA #BoycottFifa

The likelihood of a boycott at this time is still considered extraordinarily low, given the magnitude of the international soccer tournament. 

“The vast love of the sport shared by many tends to win out over any moral hesitation,” an analysis from The Washington Post noted. 

But with some voices calling for a boycott now — and the start of the World Cup several months away — support for such an action could grow, especially if Trump continues to implement foreign policy that affects footballers' home countries, or policy domestically that the international community cannot overlook.

Complicating the matter is that FIFA President Gianni Infantino is close friends with Trump, which might make reticence against boycotting the event easier to overcome. 

After Trump failed to win the Nobel Peace Prize last year, Infantino created his own “FIFA Peace Prize,” awarding it to the U.S. president at the newly renamed Trump-Kennedy Center in December.

FIFA itself has a sordid history, particularly under Infantino's tenure, that may warrant calls for boycotts on their own.

The soccer organization has overlooked human rights abuses to advance its own interests on several occasions — including selecting Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup, despite that country's vast history of human rights violations, use of child labor, and treatment of foreign laborers.

FIFA has also brushed aside its own governing rules when it comes to Israel's genocide of Palestinians. Israel has violated multiple FIFA statutes, including playing league matches on occupied land and killing Palestinian soccer players.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

ICE's kidnapping of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and other kids echoes the US's long history of child snatching.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

The image of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos being detained outside of his house upon arriving home from school has gone viral. Wearing a blue fuzzy hat and Spiderman backpack half his size, he faces the bed of a black truck, a white hand holding his backpack.

According to the Columbia Heights Public School District in Minnesota, federal agents have detained four students that attend their schools four separate times over the course of two weeks. Conejo was one of them, and he was used as “bait” to draw family members out of their home for them to be arrested and detained. Conejo was apprehended in his driveway when he returned home from school with his father.

According to Columbia Heights superintendent Zena Stenvik, “the agent took the child out of the still-running car, led him to the door and directed him to knock on the door asking to be let in in order to see if anyone else was home, essentially using a 5-year-old as bait.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents then took the father and child away to ICE's South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, said that the family had been following everything they were asked to do, “so this is just … cruelty.”

A judge issued a stay Monday on their deportation order. Liam's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, told Rep. Julian Castro that Liam has been “depressed and sad.” Liam's mother, Erika Ramos, told MPR News that her son “is getting sick” and not eating due to the poor quality of the food at the Dilley center.

Conejo is not the only recent example of child abduction. Earlier this month, 5-year-old Génesis Ester Gutiérrez Castellanos and her mother were deported to Honduras. Both of them are U.S. citizens.

The forced abductions of these two children are deeply reminiscent of the forcible abduction of Indigenous children in the 19th century. Under the guise of child welfare (enabled in the U.S. by the 1887 Dawes Act), Indigenous children were often taken from their families and communities without their family's consent, sometimes with military or police presence if parents resisted. Sometimes parents were tricked or coerced into sending their children, especially if the parents were threatened with criminal charges or violent repercussions.

The children were moved to boarding schools as part of “re-education” campaigns, where they underwent forced white Christian assimilation — their hair was cut and they were forbidden to speak their native languages. Many of these schools were run by the Catholic church or other Christian institutions, and under their care, children suffered sexual and other forms of physical abuse. Almost a thousand children died at boarding schools, according to a recent federal investigation, but an investigation by The Washington Post found that the number was much higher — more than 3,000 Indigenous children died in the custody of the U.S. government.

Liam Conejo Ramos's kidnapping also recalls another despicable chapter of U.S. history, when people who bought, sold, and traded enslaved individuals as well as professional “kidnapping clubs” abducted both free and enslaved Black people off of the street, including children, and then sold them into slavery. Many kidnappers worked under the guise of the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act that allowed people to capture and return escaped enslaved individuals, but oftentimes, kidnappers abducted any Black child or adult, even if they did not match the escaped enslaved individual. In order to cover their tracks, kidnappers destroyed freedom papers that would confirm a Black person's freedom in a court.

Even Black Americans who knew the abducted person could not testify to their freedom because Black Americans were not allowed to testify in most courts. Even white witnesses to the kidnapping, friends, or acquaintances often refused to testify that a free Black person was unjustly abducted because they feared retribution from both their neighbors and from the kidnappers themselves. While white and Black abolitionists alike raised concerns about the kidnapping, many white people who lived in the North did not pay much attention because they did not “own” enslaved people.

Children were often targeted by “slave catchers” and kidnapping rings because they often did not have the ability or awareness to assert their rights or the strength to fight back. They were sometimes lured with promises of food and apprenticeships. Richard Bell's book Stolen: Five Free Boys Kidnapped into Slavery and Their Astonishing Odyssey Home charts how five Black boys were kidnapped from Philadelphia in 1825. Four of the boys were raised free and one had just run away from a slaveholding plantation in New Jersey. While the boys were cautious around white men, they were tricked by John Purnell, a “mixed-race” man who went by the fake name John Smith, into an interstate kidnapping campaign run by a man named Joseph Johnson.

Sometimes the children were abducted directly from the street or playground, while traveling to and from school just like Conejo. Historian Jonathan Daniel describes in The Kidnapping Club how a kidnapping ring targeted Black children in New York City in order to sell them into slavery in the 1830s.

And it didn't stop when slavery was abolished. In the Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras in the South and other parts of the country, as many Black Americans migrated to North, Black children were targeted by lynching gangs. Enforcers of sundown towns, or towns where Black Americans were targeted and attacked after dark, targeted children with impunity.

And the history of child snatching continued into the 20th century with the “Baby Scoop Era” from the 1940s to the 1970s, when young, largely unmarried mothers were tricked or coerced into placing their babies up for adoption. To this day, children put up for adoption during this period are still searching for their birth parents and unpacking the legacies of harm and abuse.

Today, the family policing system perpetuates racism and colorism through practices and policies that mean that Indigenous and Black children are significantly more likely to have their homes investigated, be taken from their homes and placed into foster care than white children. According to a study published in 2017 in the American Journal of Public Health, over half of Black children will experience contact with child protective services by the age of 18. Child abuse and neglect is real, but a system that fails to confront and abolish its own racist and colorist practices perpetuates histories of child snatching.

And now, with the enormous increase in funding for ICE alongside the white nationalism emanating from key Trump advisers like Stephen Miller, ICE looks much like a white supremacist employment program for bodysnatchers, to the benefit of private prisons and other carceral institutions.

Liam Conejo Ramos and Génesis Ester Gutiérrez Castellanos are victims of the latest iteration of this violence, of a cruelty descended from federal agents forcibly abducting Indigenous children, “slave catchers” and kidnapping clubs, lynching mobs and family policing officers disproportionately targeting and removing Black children from their homes.

I call out these histories because ICE is not the reflection of a foreign evil. It is the product of escalating white nationalism and a long history of state-sanctioned kidnapping and disappearance of adults and children of color.

Yes, ICE officials are using strategies and aesthetics that are most often associated with the Nazi Gestapo, but in reality, these aesthetics and their associations with “racial hygiene” largely drew on what was happening in the eugenics movement in the United States in the early 20th century, when poor, disabled, and BIPOC women were forcibly sterilized; when “unsightly beggar” laws barred disabled people from public streets; and when disabled, poor, or so-called “undesirable” people were institutionalized en masse.

ICE uses similar Gestapo tactics of surprise abductions of people from homes, worship spaces, and schools — but these tactics are homegrown.

As Holocaust scholar Daniel H. Magilow wrote this past July, “I believe that comparing ICE to the Gestapo is less a historical judgement than a reflection of modern anxiety — a fear that the U.S. is veering toward authoritarianism reminiscent of 1930s Germany.” He highlights how other comparisons also ring true, from the Soviet Union's KGB to Iran's former secret police and intelligence agency SAVAK. And of course, there are many, many examples from U.S. history.

This tragedy is one that the U.S. has built itself, and sometimes by leaning too much into analogies or conflating it with a foreign evil, like the Nazi Gestapo, we overlook its deep roots in our own society. Seeing how Liam Conejo Ramos and Génesis Ester Gutiérrez Castellanos's kidnapping and disappearances are connected to a long history of child snatching is vital to understanding where ICE agents got their playbook. The call to “Abolish ICE!” could then be regarded as the minimum demand for a deeper reckoning. To truly root out the evil, we may need to dismantle far more than a 23-year-old federal agency.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 The Unexpected Conflict Brewing in South Asia

 Michael Kugelman

The most worrisome flash point in South Asia today lies not between the nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan but to the west, along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. A simmering conflict between these two neighbors now threatens to explode—with damaging consequences for the wider region.

For nearly 20 years, Pakistan has suffered numerous attacks from terrorists belonging to the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, a militant group that aims to overthrow Pakistan's government and turn the country into an Islamist emirate. Islamabad blames the Taliban regime in Afghanistan for harboring TTP militants and allowing them to launch attacks on Pakistan from Afghan territory. Terrorist violence has spiked in Pakistan since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, with militants often targeting security forces near the border.

According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, Pakistan experienced its deadliest year in a decade in 2025, with most of the violence caused by terrorist groups, including the TTP. Another Pakistani research organization, the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, tallied 699 terrorist attacks in 2025 (a 34 percent increase from 2024) that killed 1,034 people (a 21 percent increase from the previous year). Umar Media, the TTP's official outlet, claims the group carried out 3,573 attacks and killed 3,481 people in 2025. Those figures are likely exaggerated. Still, the overall upward trend in attacks is deeply concerning. And it is made worse by the fact that the TTP can draw on increasingly sophisticated weaponry, including drones. Pakistan could very well face more devastating and deadly attacks in the near future.

In October, Pakistan carried out airstrikes on a terrorist convoy in Kabul and also hit TTP targets in Afghanistan's Paktika Province. Those assaults precipitated retaliatory Taliban attacks on Pakistani border posts, which then led to another round of Pakistani strikes in Afghanistan. Subsequent talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey failed to secure a formal Taliban commitment to curb the TTP, although they did win a temporary cease-fire. The most recent round of talks, this time brokered by Saudi Arabia, took place at the end of November but made little progress. Several days later, Pakistani and Taliban forces exchanged fire, killing five Afghan civilians and wounding several more civilians on both sides of the border.

In recent weeks, both the Taliban and the Pakistani military have escalated a war of words. In early January, the chief Taliban spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, accused Pakistan of working with outside powers, including the United States, to destabilize Afghanistan. “Pakistan should not harbor dreams of dominance over Afghanistan,” he warned. Several days later, Pakistan's army spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, denounced the Taliban in a long press conference, declaring that terrorists across the board, including the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), al-Qaeda, and other regional militant groups, “all have one father—the Afghan Taliban.” (Ironically, Pakistan itself sponsored the Taliban from the group's inception in the 1990s until the end of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan in 2021). In recent days, there have been indications that Pakistan may be planning an offensive in the Tirah Valley, a TTP stronghold in the northwest of the country near the border with Afghanistan. Thousands of people have evacuated the area. Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif has denied that a military campaign is imminent, but he did acknowledge that hundreds of TTP fighters are living in Tirah and that the area could be subject to future Pakistani operations.

With the Taliban rejecting Pakistani demands to rein in the TTP, and with Pakistan committed to rooting out the terrorist group, this conflict looks likely to intensify. It has also proved resistant to outside mediation efforts. If Afghanistan and Pakistan truly do come to blows, the fighting could not just destabilize the two countries; it could spur militant attacks against Americans and American interests in South Asia, cause chaos in the wider region, and even trigger further conflict between India and Pakistan.

Neither the Taliban nor Pakistan has an incentive to de-escalate, which increases the risk of all-out war. The Taliban are closely tied to the TTP, and they don't typically turn on their militant allies: after the 9/11 attacks, the Taliban refused to give up al-Qaeda even when facing a U.S. military invasion. Part of that calculation has to do with maintaining cohesion among the Taliban's various factions. If the Taliban expel or use force against the TTP, they risk sparking internal rebellions within their ranks and exposing gaps between the more pragmatic political leadership in Kabul and the supreme leadership, which is largely composed of hard-line mullahs in the southern city of Kandahar. The Taliban also fear that abandoning the TTP could drive the group into the arms of Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), the fearsome ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan and an avowed adversary of the Taliban. So far, Taliban members have maintained a united front in defense of the TTP.

The Taliban also have political incentives to ignore Pakistan's demands. Given that much of the Afghan public isn't fond of Pakistan—because, ironically, Pakistan once sponsored and sheltered the Taliban insurgency—the group actually gains legitimacy at home by defying Islamabad. If the Taliban's continued intransigence causes additional Pakistani airstrikes, Afghans will rally around the flag and support the Taliban regime.

Pakistan, meanwhile, is in no mood for conciliation. Its military—which has suffered the brunt of the TTP's attacks—dictates Pakistan's Afghanistan policy and feels betrayed by the Taliban. Earlier talks with the TTP collapsed when the group made demands unacceptable to the Pakistani state, such as asking for sharia law to be imposed across the country and for the withdrawal of Pakistani troops from areas near the border, which would have effectively ceded territory to the TTP.



But most alarming to Pakistan is the Taliban's new embrace of India. During the 1990s, New Delhi was hostile to the Taliban and supported their chief adversary, the Northern Alliance, which eventually swept to power in Kabul in 2001 on the coattails of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. India then invested in various infrastructure projects and expanded its diplomatic presence in the country, much to the vexation of Pakistan. The Taliban's return to power in 2021 seemed to augur the end of significant Indian involvement in Afghanistan. But the Taliban's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, spent a week in India in October and held a series of high-level meetings, including one with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. Afterward, Muttaqi proclaimed that “the future of India-Afghanistan relations seems very bright,” and India fully reopened its embassy in Kabul for the first time since 2021. Commercial ties between the two countries may also be growing again. In November, Haji Nooruddin Azizi, the Taliban's commerce minister, met Indian government officials and business leaders in New Delhi and discussed trade and investment possibilities. The two sides announced the establishment of a “joint chamber of commerce and industries” that would foster a greater commercial partnership. In December, the Taliban's health minister, Noor Jalal Jalali, became the third top Taliban official to visit India in three months.

On December 8, Asim Munir, the head of Pakistan's armed forces and the country's most powerful leader, delivered an ominous warning: the Taliban, he said in a speech to military officers, must choose between having ties with Pakistan or having ties with the TTP. Were they to choose the TTP, Munir implied, Pakistan could resort to greater punitive actions against the Taliban regime.

In principle, Pakistan has several options. It can intensify kinetic operations against TTP fighters on its side of the border—a step it may take in the Tirah Valley—or it can use its economic leverage over Kabul, including threatening to seize Taliban assets and property in Pakistan or cutting off trade with Afghanistan altogether. The problem for Pakistan, however, is that it has already done much of this but to no avail. Pakistan's military has previously staged offensives in Tirah and the surrounding areas, with no lasting results. It shut down trade in October, and while that led to a modest decrease in attacks, it hasn't prompted the Taliban to end or reduce its sponsorship of the TTP. If the TTP ramps up attacks again, the only real option left for Pakistan may be to up the ante by resorting to more escalatory and high-risk measures, such as ground-based incursions to strike TTP targets across the border in Afghanistan.

Any such escalation would have alarming implications for the region. The Taliban insist that Afghanistan's sovereignty is inviolable. Sustained Pakistani cross-border strikes, especially if carried out deep into Afghanistan, could provoke Taliban-sponsored militant attacks all across Pakistan. The Taliban command the loyalty of a wide variety of militants and are able to recruit fresh radicals. For the TTP, which was inspired by the Taliban victory in Afghanistan in 2021 and is keen to replicate it in Pakistan, such a campaign would advance its plans of unseating the current Pakistani government and turning the country into an Islamist emirate.

A car bomb attack in Islamabad in November, which killed 12 people, could be an ominous portent. It was the first attack on civilians in the Pakistani capital in a decade. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, an especially brutal faction of the TTP, claimed it carried out the bombing before denying responsibility—likely because the TTP in recent years has insisted it doesn't target civilians. But Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, while remaining relatively quiet over the last few years, previously targeted civilians across the country, including an Easter attack in a Lahore park in 2016 that killed 75 people and an assault on a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency delegation in Peshawar in 2016 that killed two U.S. consular staff members.



Between 2007 and 2014, the TTP and other militants staged thousands of attacks on security forces and civilians across Pakistan, including in all major cities. More than 5,000 security forces and 16,000 civilians lost their lives. Escalating Afghan-Pakistani tensions could further inflame Pakistan's greatest terrorist threat since that long, bloody period.

Escalation could also destabilize Afghanistan and heighten international terrorism risks. Were Pakistan to formally turn on the Taliban, Islamabad might create and arm anti-Taliban groups, target Taliban leaders, and even sponsor efforts to overthrow the Taliban regime. Fresh conflict in Afghanistan would fuel the violent and chaotic conditions that benefit militants there—including ISIS-K, which in recent years has staged attacks as far afield as Iran and Russia and had plots foiled in Europe and the United States.

Trouble on Pakistan's western frontier could also cause problems on its eastern border. Pakistan has accused both the Taliban and India of sponsoring militant groups active in its territory. With surges in attacks in Pakistan coinciding with warming ties between India and the Taliban, Islamabad could very well accuse Kabul and New Delhi of collusion. Accordingly, Pakistan, through its own proxies, could look to lash out at India—and risk a fresh clash with its giant neighbor. After the two countries fought in May 2025, New Delhi warned that future terrorist attacks in India would be treated as acts of war.

Given the intransigence of both Pakistan and the Taliban, outside powers have struggled to lower tensions. The efforts of the Qataris, the Saudis, and the Turks—which Pakistan has welcomed—have produced only limited negotiation achievements, with the two sides agreeing to uphold a cease-fire. China may be the best bet for an external mediator. It has skin in the game (the TTP has attacked Chinese nationals and investments in Pakistan), leverage (the Taliban seek Chinese capital for infrastructure investments), and precedent (in August 2025, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Taliban and Pakistani counterparts in Kabul, and Wang pledged to work with Islamabad and Kabul to tackle terrorism). Beijing has called for de-escalation and dialogue. The Taliban, however, may not see China as a neutral intermediary, owing to China's deep alliance with Pakistan.

As a result, greater strife between Afghanistan and Pakistan remains a distinct possibility. Such a conflict could be bloody, displace thousands of people, destabilize the broader region, and spur global terrorism. The world can't afford to look away.

 An Overtly Transactional Order Spells Trouble for Everyone

 Matias Spektor

This month, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney took the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos and delivered a blunt verdict on the international order. For decades, he argued, Western countries prospered by invoking a rules-based system that they knew was hypocritical. They cited liberal ideals while routinely exempting themselves from adhering to them, championed free trade while enforcing it selectively, and spoke the language of international law and human rights while applying those principles unevenly to friends and rivals. “We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality,” Carney acknowledged. This system was tolerable because it provided stability and because American power, despite its double standards, supplied the public goods that other Western countries depended on. But, in Carney's words, “this bargain no longer works.”

This “rupture” in the international system, as Carney called it, stems from the collapse of that bargain. Powerful countries—namely the United States under President Donald Trump—are abandoning not only the rules that sustained the international order but also the pretense that their actions are and should be guided by principle. Carney is right that something fundamental has shifted. But in calling for middle and emerging powers to stop paying lip service to a broken system, he underestimates what else vanishes when pretense disappears.

Carney insisted that smaller countries, such as Canada, could still uphold certain liberal values even as the overarching “rules-based order” faded away. It remains altogether unclear how middle powers could pull off such a salvage job, and whether any international, values-based regime can arise from the wreckage left by the United States. That is worrying. A world in which powerful states no longer feel compelled to justify themselves morally is not more honest—it is more dangerous. When great powers feel obliged to justify their behavior in moral terms, weaker states gain leverage. They can appeal to shared standards, invoke international law, and demand consistency between rhetoric and action. But without the need to maintain even the fiction of principle, a powerful country can do what it pleases knowing that it can be constrained only by the power of others. The instability this breeds will not spare even the strong.

Hypocrisy has long played a double role in international politics. It has bred resentment and distrust between global powers, but it has also constrained power by making states answerable to the moral standards they claim to uphold. Throughout the Cold War, the United States justified its leading role in the international order by using the language of democracy and human rights, even as its actions fell short of those ideals. That hypocrisy did not go uncontested. Allies and nonaligned states alike repeatedly invoked American rhetoric to criticize U.S. behavior and demand greater consistency between the principles the United States was championing and what the country was doing in practice. This pressure yielded tangible results. For instance, domestic and international scrutiny prompted a congressional investigation by the 1975 Church Committee into the conduct of the U.S. intelligence community, including its covert operations abroad. The committee's findings reshaped oversight of U.S. intelligence operations and elevated human rights as a meaningful consideration in foreign policy decisions.

That pressure persisted into the post–Cold War era. When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, it justified the war by invoking international law and the threat of weapons of mass destruction. These arguments collapsed because the weapons never materialized. The international backlash to the invasion was severe precisely because Washington had claimed to operate within a rules-based order. A similar dynamic later surrounded the use of drone strikes by the United States across multiple countries. As the U.S. drone program expanded under several administrations, international lawyers, allies, and civil society groups cited American commitments to due process and the rule of law to demand accountability for the killings. In response, Washington developed legal rationales, narrowed targeting criteria, and accepted greater political scrutiny over how and where it used drone strikes.

The constraint that hypocrisy provided was always imperfect. American power still prevailed. But the obligation to justify—to maintain at least the appearance of principled action—created friction. It gave weaker states a language with which to resist and made great-power behavior answerable, even if incompletely, to something beyond raw interest.

That dynamic has weakened sharply in recent years. The defining feature of the current moment is not that the United States violates the principles it once championed but that it increasingly dispenses with the need to justify its actions in those terms at all. Whereas earlier administrations cloaked U.S. power in the language of law, legitimacy, or universal liberal values, Washington now defends its foreign policy in bluntly transactional terms.

This shift was already visible during Trump's first term. When he withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018, Trump did not argue that Tehran had violated international norms or that the agreement endangered regional stability. He dismissed it as simply a bad deal for the United States. Likewise, when confronted with the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump defended continued U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia not by appealing to strategic necessity, but by pointing to arms sales and jobs that benefited the United States financially. In both cases, Washington did not deny the underlying facts. It denied that moral justification was required.

In his second term, Trump has stripped away the language of justification altogether. When he threatened Denmark and seven other European allies with tariffs over their opposition to his bid to acquire Greenland, he framed the dispute not in terms of shared interests or alliance obligations but explicitly as leverage—a transactional demand to extract territorial concessions. Similarly, in February 2025, Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court not because he contested its legal authority or offered an alternative framework for accountability, but because the ICC had investigated his ally Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. Perhaps most starkly, when asked in an interview with The New York Times in early January whether Chinese President Xi Jinping might move against Taiwan, Trump replied that although such aggression would make him “very unhappy,” the decision was up to Xi. These are not violations of stated principles that appeal to necessity or higher purpose. They are naked assertions of interest, unadorned by even the pretense of principle.

Washington's refusal to cite principle when making foreign policy fundamentally alters the terms of contestation for weaker states. Critics can condemn Trump's policies as crude or self-interested, but they struggle to accuse the U.S. president of hypocrisy. There is no gap between professed virtue and practice when the claim to virtue is abandoned. Power no longer appeals to universal principle; it asserts particular entitlement. The result is not simply a harsher diplomatic style, but a shift in the fundamental terms by which American power operates—and, crucially, how it can be resisted.

At first glance, the abandonment of moral justification appears to solve a long-standing problem. If hypocrisy erodes credibility and invites backlash, then refusing to make moral claims can seem like a more efficient way to exercise power. Without appeals to universal principles, there are fewer reputational costs to pay when mere material and political interests prevail. Some observers welcome this shift. Celso Amorim, one of Brazil's senior diplomats, has argued that with Trump “there is no hypocrisy,” only “naked and raw truth” that allows countries to negotiate without illusions about true U.S. motives.

But efficiency comes at a cost. When great powers no longer feel compelled to justify their behavior, disputes that once unfolded as arguments over legitimacy increasingly become tests of leverage. Sanctions are a prime example. Under the old regime, a sanctioning power was expected to explain why its measures responded to specific violations and conformed to shared rules. When the Obama administration negotiated the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, it documented Iran's violations of Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations and UN Security Council resolutions, presenting the agreement as a legalized framework subject to verification. Today, a great power can impose sanctions simply to advance its interests. In August 2025, for example, Trump imposed 50 percent tariffs on India not because India had violated a trade agreement, but because Trump was personally indignant over New Delhi's rejection of his offer to mediate during tensions with Pakistan. In such a system, bargaining replaces persuasion, and compliance depends less on consent than on coercion. International politics loses the language through which disputes can be negotiated—allowing the stronger parties to determine outcomes as they please.

This shift may appear manageable for the most powerful states, which can easily impose costs and absorb backlash. But it is far more destabilizing for the global system as a whole. Without the pressures of hypocrisy to constrain it, power operates with fewer buffers and mediating institutions. A bare hierarchy arises in which cooperation is harder to sustain and conflict more likely to escalate.

The costs of this shift are not borne evenly, and they extend beyond U.S. rivals to harm American interests themselves. One of the clearest consequences is visible in the U.S. relationship with the global South, where the disappearance of shared standards and moral justification has begun to make it harder for Washington to manage conflict through institutions rather than relying on its leverage. For much of the post–Cold War era, appeals to shared rules allowed countries in the global South to contest pressure from the United States without letting disputes become mere tests of power.

Brazil's experience is illustrative. A latecomer to trade liberalization, Brazil long resisted the rules of global free trade. But once it finally embraced that system, it learned to use the rules to its advantage. When Brazil, a major cotton producer, challenged U.S. cotton subsidies in the early 2000s on the grounds that by bolstering its domestic cotton industry the United States was violating its obligations under the World Trade Organization, it did so through the WTO's litigation mechanisms. Washington lost the case and was forced to make concessions. The dispute unfolded within a shared, mutually accepted international legal framework that kept relations intact and expanded bilateral trade.

Contrast that with U.S. trade policy toward Brazil today. In 2025, Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on Brazilian exports not on the basis of trade violations, but as retaliation for domestic political developments in Brasília—specifically, judicial action against the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, a political ally of Trump's who had tried and failed to overturn an election. Brazil did not appeal to multilateral trade norms in response. It instead reduced its exposure to the United States, deepened its trade ties with China, and signaled that its rare-earth reserves could become a bargaining chip. De-escalation came only after American companies with a stake in Brazil applied pressure on the White House.

The same shift is visible in the United States' relationship with its closest allies. For decades, countries such as Germany accepted asymmetric partnerships with Washington because shared principles, rules, and institutions gave them a voice within the international system. Multilateralism did not eliminate American dominance, but it did soften it.



West Germany's—and starting in 1990, a unified Germany's—postwar relationship with the United States rested on this logic. Deeply embedded in NATO and the global trading system, German leaders relied on law, institutions, and proceduralism to manage asymmetry with Washington. Disputes were framed as arguments within a common order, not confrontations over power. When the United States pressured the West German government in Bonn to constrain nuclear technology exports to developing countries in the 1970s, Bonn accepted restrictions through the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and Nuclear Suppliers Group, subordinating commercial interests to nonproliferation norms that were U.S.-led but shared by both countries. That approach enabled it to resist American authority selectively while remaining a key U.S. ally.

As Washington has stopped justifying U.S. actions through appeals to liberal values and norms, however, that equilibrium has been disturbed. Trump has framed U.S. pressure on Germany in overtly transactional terms: tariffs were justified as leverage, threats of secondary sanctions were tied to energy policy, security commitments were recast as protection services. Germany's response has been to make itself less reliant on the United States, doubling down on European industrial policy, investing in energy and defense autonomy, and diversifying its partnerships with other countries. Berlin is insulating itself against a world in which U.S. power operates through leverage rather than shared rules and dependence on Washington becomes a vulnerability.

Canada faces a similar predicament. Trump has threatened Canada with punitive tariffs and demanded that the country abandon its independent energy policy in favor of U.S. interests. More starkly, Trump has repeatedly suggested that Canada become the 51st U.S. state. Like Germany, Canada has begun to reduce its reliance on Washington, accelerating efforts to diversify trade partnerships and strengthen ties with other powers. Both countries are pursuing what might be called strategic autonomy—an effort to preserve independence in decision-making now that the United States no longer constrains itself through appeals to shared norms. This is precisely the dynamic that Carney, in his Davos address, identified as the defining feature of the new international rupture: the collapse of the rules-based order has forced even the closest U.S. allies to treat the United States not as a partner bound by shared principles, but as a power to be hedged against—or, in Canada's case, defended against.

For the United States, the implications of its shift away from moral justification are stark. This abandonment does not simply erode U.S. advantages; it triggers the kind of strategic diversification among Washington's partners that could dissolve the system it once controlled. The distinctive achievement of American power was not dominance itself, but the ability to translate that dominance into the genuine consent of other countries. Alliances held together by transactions alone may persist, but they are thinner and less likely to mobilize when leadership is most needed. In losing the language of principle, the United States loses the ability to make the imposition of its power acceptable to others.

The disappearance of hypocrisy can be mistaken for progress. It may feel like a trend toward honesty and an end to double standards, posturing, and self-deception. But hypocrisy played a structural role in the international order that is now being dismantled. By claiming to act in the name of shared principles, powerful states made themselves vulnerable to contestation. That vulnerability gave weaker states leverage, allowed allies to manage asymmetry without rupture, and helped turn dominance into something other states could accept, even when they resented it.

To be sure, this is not an argument for restoring a world that no longer exists. The rules-based order was never as principled as it claimed to be, and hypocrisy often concealed injustice as much as it constrained power. But by pretending to act in the name of universal values, powerful states conceded that those values mattered. When those states no longer feel compelled to legitimize their authority, the international system once sustained by consent devolves into one where power operates without restraint, making conflict more frequent and harder to contain. The paradox of hypocrisy was that it limited power even as it enabled it. The United States could well discover that raw dominance is harder to sustain than a flawed order that others once had reason to believe in.

            Sen. Amy Klobuchar launched a Democratic bid for governor on Thursday, pledging to unify her state and move beyond a deadly battle with the federal government over immigration.
    


            “These times call for leaders who can stand up and not be rubber stamps of this administration,” Klobuchar said in an announcement video. “But who are also willing to find common ground and fix things in our state.”
    


            Klobuchar, who has served in Washington for two decades, is seeking to govern Minnesota during an extraordinarily fraught moment. The state has become the epicenter of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has sparked waves of outrage and protest from residents, particularly after two fatal shootings of protesters by federal agents.
    


            “We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is,” she said, “but in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom, and simple decency and good will.”
    


            Her formal entry into the race comes after Gov. Tim Walz ended his reelection bid in the wake of a deepening federal investigation into widespread fraud of social service programs in Minnesota. Nearly a dozen Republicans were running for governor in hopes of challenging Walz, though one candidate left the race to protest what he called “retribution on the citizens of our state,” two days after a Border Patrol agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti.



            Minnesota is now on the front lines of a searing debate over the politics of immigration enforcement and the exertion of federal power, emerging as a national test for whether the actions of President Donald Trump's administration are seen as overreach or justified.
    


            Klobuchar, 65, has  long been seen as one of Minnesota's most popular leaders in one election after another. She could face one of her biggest political tests yet in seeking to unify a state entwined in a fierce battle over immigration policy during a critical midterm election, with a race for governor, Senate and competitive House seats on the ballot in Minnesota.
    


            In a four-minute campaign video, Klobuchar did not explicitly mention Trump by name or the broader immigration challenges facing the state, but she denounced the “3,000 ICE agents on our streets and in our towns, sent by an Administration that relishes division.”
    


            “I'm asking Minnesotans across this state to not look down, to not look away,” Klobuchar said. “I'm asking you to look to each other.”
    


            As she debated whether to stay in the Senate or run for governor, friends say, she often talked about the appeal of serving as a chief executive without the limitations of a dysfunctional Congress.
    


            She joins a long list of lawmakers from both parties who are retiring or seeking an office away from Washington, though she is not planning to resign as she embarks on her campaign. If she wins in November, Klobuchar could resign and allow Walz to appoint her successor or choose her own replacement after being sworn in as governor. If she loses, she could return to the final four years of her Senate term.
    


            The politics of the state have been scrambled since Walz stepped away from his reelection bid on January 5. Two days later, an ICE agent killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman.
    


            Klobuchar began considering jumping into the governor's race long before unrest rocked Minnesota in the wake of Good's death and intensified after Pretti was killed. As she weighed a campaign, she told CNN: “Minnesota is right now the center of America's heartbreak.”
    


            She is expected to largely clear the Democratic field, party strategists say, even though some progressive leaders have not ruled out recruiting a candidate to challenge her in the primary.
    


            Klobuchar, who previously served as Hennepin County Attorney in Minneapolis, won her first US Senate race in 2006 with 58% of the vote. In her four Senate contests, she built a moderate record and notched a string of blowout victories. The closest challenge came in 2024, when she still won by 16 points.
    


            Klobuchar's ability to reach voters across the political spectrum will be tested anew in this highly polarized moment. Yet the number of voters casting split tickets has fallen dramatically, a sign that party strategists say is a change in the bipartisan nature of the state.
    


            “I'm asking Democrats, Independents, and Republicans to join our campaign,” Klobuchar said in her announcement video. “It is a home grown one, born in a moment like no other. It is for people who believe in something bigger than ourselves.”
    


            While Klobuchar has not entirely ruled out running for president again, as she did in 2020, aides acknowledge it would be difficult to enter the 2028 Democratic primary because she would have to launch a campaign during the first year of her term as governor if she wins her race.
    


            In the race for Minnesota governor, a crowded GOP field is already engaged in a competitive primary including Lisa Demuth, the speaker of the Minnesota House and highest-ranking Republican in the state. Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and a right-wing conspiracy theorist, is also running.
    


            No Republican has won a statewide election in Minnesota since 2006, a point that Chris Madel, the Minneapolis lawyer who dropped his gubernatorial bid in protest of the federal immigration crackdown cited in his critique of the national GOP.
    


            “National Republicans have made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota,” Madel said.
    


            Klobuchar, the state's senior senator, has urged the Trump administration to reconsider its focus on Minnesota, which has been the site for what officials have called the largest immigration enforcement action in the nation's history that unfolded as Pretti, an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, was killed January 24 while protesting federal agents.
    


            “Donald Trump and all your lieutenants who ordered this ICE surge: watch the horrific video of the killing today. The world is watching,” Klobuchar said in a social media post after Pretti's death. “Get ICE out of Minnesota NOW.”
    


            Some progressives are calling for the abolishment of ICE and other Democrats like Klobuchar have advocated a more nuanced approach, even as many Republicans blame local Democratic officials for encouraging protestors to confront federal immigration agents.
    


            The White House has signaled a retreat from some of its hardline positions on the Minnesota immigration operation, mindful of being on the wrong side of public opinion with what advisers acknowledge Americans are viewing with their own eyes. The reckoning could be litigated, at least in part, at the ballot box.
    


            When Walz dropped his reelection bid, he said he did not want to be a distraction amid that deepening fraud probe in the state from social service programs intended to feed children during the pandemic. He is not accused of wrongdoing but faces criticism for failing to swiftly respond.
    


            More than 90 people have been charged in prosecutions that began during the Biden administration. Many of those charged are of Somali descent, which allies of Trump have cited as grounds for launching “Operation Metro Surge” even as many Somali community members in the Twin Cities are US citizens.
    


            While the sweeping fraud is expected to be a central part of the debate in the race for governor, the federal investigation has been complicated by the administration's actions in Minnesota.
    


            Six federal prosecutors from the US attorney's office in Minneapolis, including those leading the fraud probe, resigned over the Justice Department's decision to investigate the widow of Good, the woman killed by the ICE agent, rather than the shooter.
    


            If elected, Klobuchar pledged to prioritize punishing those who stole taxpayer money earmarked for meal and housing programs, Medicaid services and other social programs and implement greater accountability reforms in state government.
    


            “I don't like fraud or waste in government – that's why I went after crime as county attorney,” Klobuchar said. “I will make sure the people who steal taxpayer money go to jail and root out the fraud by changing the way state government works.”

            Chatty, bright-eyed children surrounded US Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon as she walked with them through an airy building in Texas.
    


            Part of a 50-state tour, this stop last year was at an unusual institution: the Austin campus of Alpha, a chain of private schools that educates students from grades K-12 using AI to speed-teach core academic subjects in just two hours a day.
    


            They emphasize learning through AI rather than human teachers. There's no homework and no textbooks — just software that students use each morning to learn, with human “guides” for motivation and classroom support.
    


            A typical day starts just before 9 a.m. with a group activity that introduces a life skill to be taught during the day.
    


            Students then sit down in front of laptops, plug in headsets or even virtual reality sets, and learn academics through an AI tutor. The two-hour curriculum includes four 30-minute sessions in math, science, social studies and language, and 20 minutes of additional learning concepts, like test taking skills.
    


            The rest of the day is spent on workshops such as financial literacy, communication or problem solving.
    


            “There is so much to do, so much opportunity that I'm just seeing here,” McMahon declared during her visit, at a roundtable with students and MacKenzie Price, one of Alpha's founders and its public face.
    


            Much has been made of the promise of artificial intelligence for every facet of life, and education is no exception.
    


            The Trump administration has said that it wants to pioneer new uses of AI in schools, and McMahon has held up Alpha, whose network spans over a dozen locations across the US, as an exemplar of where education should be headed.
    


            Founded with the backing of a tech billionaire in Austin in 2014, Alpha's rise has coincided with technological leaps in what artificial intelligence can do. At the same time, the US education system is undergoing serious disruptions and challenges — the latest national assessments of student achievement show scores in math and reading continuing to fall, part of a decadelong slide.
    


            Amid this, parents across the country are seeking out alternatives to traditional public schools.
    


            With AI already increasingly common in education — 6 in 10 teachers used an AI tool in the 2024-2025 school year, according to a Walton Family Foundation and Gallup poll — turning to AI-led learning would seem to be one cutting-edge option.
    


            Some parents say their experiences with Alpha have lived up to the promise of providing a new, exciting and better education for their children. The personalized pace of teaching, practical skills and incentives were among some of the bright spots they praised.
    


            But for some parents who embraced Alpha in the past, the unusual and little-tested form of schooling proved problematic. The second school Alpha opened, in Brownsville, Texas, faced serious questions from some of the parents who sent their children there in its first years after opening in 2022.
    


            According to documents and communications from the 2023-2024 school year seen by CNN, some half a dozen families voiced concerns about the efficacy of its teaching model and the anxiety the school's culture and AI-set learning targets were placing on their children.
    


            Some students were “so stressed out” and yet the school was “propping them up as, like, the model” and “evidence why Alpha works,” Jessica Lopez, one of the most vocal parents, told CNN this year, when speaking of the experience. She withdrew her two daughters from the school in 2024.
    


            “I realized that the school is not the right fit for us,” she wrote to Price at the time, noting issues such as the reliance on apps as sole teachers, lack of support for students from human teachers and punishing hours children were keeping in order to keep up with AI-set metrics as points of contention she and other parents had raised.
    


            Alpha has denied any link between its schools and anxiety and noted the Brownsville school has changed from a homeschool-hybrid model that was “confusing and ineffective” and bears “no resemblance to the school model today.”
    


            “The entire school experience, pedagogy and approach to learning have transformed dramatically,” including its apps, goals, workshops and other parts of the school system, the company said. “There is no accurate or fair way” to hold the Brownsville experience from those early years “as representative of the current Alpha student or school experience,” the school said, adding that Alpha now has many families across all of its campuses who have positive experiences.
    


            More broadly today, though, experts say there is little outside scrutiny of Alpha's model and how successful it really is at teaching children.
    


            “What has been a big concern amongst scholars and researchers is that Alpha is refusing to allow for any independent research to evaluate the claims or to really scrutinize what's going on from disinterested parties,” said Victor Lee, an associate professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education.
    


            “That sort of behavior sort of implies there's something to hide,” he said, adding that he found some of Alpha's claims of success “dubious.”
    


            And while some education experts see promise for AI, others fear that heavy reliance on AI and computers may leave children without opportunities for socialization and use of their own critical thinking.
    


            In lengthy replies to CNN's request seeking comment, Alpha defended its methods and results, and insisted that characterizations from critics who spoke to CNN were “false” or “misrepresentative.”
    


            Outside experts who question the school's transparency and results “are people unfamiliar with Alpha's approach and it should be presented as such,” the school said. “That is not [a] scientific way to present an accurate depiction of Alpha's approach to learning.”
    


            The school “has hired world-renowned learning scientists, advanced degreed academic experts and researchers” to assess outcomes and develop its curriculum, and its students “learn two times faster and build better comprehension across all core subject matter,” the company added.
    


            However, Alpha declined several months of requests from CNN reporters to visit its campuses or speak to Price, its co-founder, for this story. (The company told CNN last autumn that they had “paused” non-essential visits as they “fielded 15-20 requests per day from not only media but national and international academic institutions, school leaders around the world” and others, though some media coverage has surfaced since then.)
    


            A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Alpha School is reimagining K–12 education by equipping students with practical AI skills and preparing them for a rapidly evolving technology-driven workforce.”
    


            “While this approach may not be right for every family, it has proven transformative for many, prompting Secretary McMahon's visit in a state that has invested significantly in school choice and innovation in the classroom.”
    


            Alpha bills itself as an alternative model for education, with a twist.
    


            “What if I told you this school has no teachers, and students learn academics through an AI tutor, on AI apps that give each students a one-to-one personalized mastery-based academic journey that guarantees success,” Price says in a 2024 promotional video.



            Alpha was co-founded by Price, a Stanford graduate and education entrepreneur, and technology billionaire Joe Liemandt, founder of Trilogy Software and private equity firm ESW Capital.
    


            Since opening its doors to a few dozen students in Austin, Alpha has expanded to major cities like Miami and San Francisco, as well as smaller cities and towns like Brownsville and, more recently, Chantilly, Virginia. Some of its campuses are selective to focus on sports or high academic achievers.
    


            CNN attended a prospective parent information session in Chantilly where Alpha leadership described its teaching model, as well as some of the projects students have engaged in, including second graders running 5Ks and third graders competing in triathlons.
    


            The schools can come with a hefty price tag, with tuition ranging from $10,000 to $75,000 a year, depending on location.
    


            Jennifer Gabler, a Brownsville midwife and former math teacher, says that her children — aged 7, 11, and 13 — have thrived at Alpha since they enrolled in March 2023, after previously being homeschooled.
    


            Her youngest rapidly improved her reading skills, Gabler said, telling CNN: “She went from zero to 100 in four or five weeks, and she loved it. … She would come home, and they don't have to do homework, but she would come home and voluntarily do it because she was so excited to learn.”
    


            Alpha motivates students by offering the children “incentives,” which they are either given or asked to propose as rewards for performing well. Students' progress is tracked through Alpha's online platform on a daily basis, and these metrics are used to measure performance.
    


            Gabler has seen incentives ranging from hosting a pajama and movie day, stopping by the local cafe or spending a day at the trampoline park. But they have also included more lavish prizes like money or even funding for overseas field trips.
    


            Local and international trips are sometimes covered by tuition and at other times paid for out-of-pocket by parents. Gabler's two oldest children have taken excursions to Italy and Switzerland, and to a Formula One qualifying event in Austin after Alpha students competed in a computer coding challenge to recreate the F1 racetrack.
    


            Adults in the room who oversee the students during their two-hour learning sessions and lead the life-skills workshops are known as “guides” rather than teachers. Alpha told CNN children have access to human teachers for handwriting, reading specialists and specialists for diverse learners, who are credentialed in those areas. According to Alpha, the two hours of AI learning is on par with the amount of screen time US students in traditional schools get across a day.
    


            According to job postings for guide roles — which can pay up to six figures a year — the guide “won't grade papers or follow a curriculum.” Instead, “you'll lead workshops, ignite curiosity, and prove that learning knows no bounds when students own their education.”
    


            Guides are not required to have post-graduate or education degrees — only a bachelor's in any field is required — and can have varying amounts of experience with children or education, depending on the role.
    


            Two former guides told CNN that non-disclosure agreements were part of their employment contract with Alpha, which the school says are used to protect proprietary information.
    


            One of the guides, who CNN agreed not to name because they signed an NDA, described a relaxed, informal environment with no classrooms. Kids wouldn't sit at desks but would work in common spaces. Some would lay on the ground and kick their feet in the air.
    


            “It felt more like I was working at a startup than a school,” the former guide said.
    


            Gabler said she appreciated the way Alpha is “always kind of trying to change and improve things, and so the children have learned to be very flexible.”
    


            “I would say there have been several learning curves because Alpha is not a static school,” she said. “I think it's challenging for children when things suddenly change, but it's a great life skill for them to learn the sort of resilience to that sudden changing.”
    


            But she noted areas for improvement. Though she likes the guide system, she said “there is still a place for that teacher who understands, you know, the material that's been covered” to jump in to assist when needed, she said.
    


            When a student is struggling with a lesson, the guide is there to encourage the child to figure it out on their own, oftentimes through YouTube links or Google searches, but, according to Gabler, no teaching from the guides takes place. “Alpha has a very strong policy that they will have zero teaching from their staff. They really don't want the teachers to actually teach the academics at all,” Gabler said.
    


            Gabler, whose children continue to attend the Brownsville school, says she has noticed improvements to the AI apps last year that she felt helped cut down on stress.
    


            The school has worked well for her family, Gabler said, but she added: “I know it's not for every single family.”
    


            Alpha says that its approach to academics is successful, claiming its students learn twice as fast as their peers at schools across the country. It backs the claim by measuring results against a national test, the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test, which tracks knowledge acquisition across subjects by grade level.
    


            A report Alpha provided to CNN measuring its students from fall 2024 to spring 2025 shows the schools' students outperformed their peers nationally on subjects like math, science and reading over grades K-12.
    


            However, Justin Reich, the director of the Teaching Systems Lab at MIT, questioned whether the tests were an appropriate measure for Alpha's success, pointing out that MAP is “not primarily used by students going to schools that cost $40,000 a year,” but public schools across the country.
    


            “It's sort of strange to be comparing [Alpha's] students to students from a wide variety of very challenging circumstances, rather than comparing their students to other students in elite private schools,” Reich said.
    


            Reich, a former middle school teacher, expressed skepticism of the hyper-individualized learning method being used by Alpha.
    


            Some of the most important learning experiences for children come from communal moments in the classroom, he said.
    


            “I think if you ask most people about the kinds of experiences that they have in schools that meant the most to them, they are more orchestral than individual,” he said. “The most powerful moments are these collaborative moments.”
    


            “What kinds of neighborhoods will we have if each kid is trained to optimize their own individual, you know, accomplishments? Would you want to live in that town or would you want to live in a town where we come together to build community, to learn together, to explore together?” Reich asked.
    


            The advocates Alpha has attracted include billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a supporter of President Donald Trump, who has called Alpha a “breakthrough innovation in K-12 education,” and Trump's Department of Education secretary. This month, first lady First Lady Melania Trump delivered remarks at a virtual event on “how artificial intelligence can be used responsibly, creatively, and confidently,” that also featured an Alpha student as a speaker.
    


            Elon Musk has reposted favorable press coverage on X, and, according to a 2024 promotional video, half of the students who attended the Alpha school in Brownsville were children of SpaceX employees. The city is not far from the site of Musk's ‘Starbase' facility and launch development site.
    


            Lee, the Stanford education expert, says the Alpha model represents a desire for schools to try different approaches. AI does have a role to play in education, but, he said, “I'm really hesitant for Alpha school to be the sort of mascot of AI and education.”
    


            “I think it's a narrow view of what the potential is for AI and the classroom,” he said.
    


            Besides expanding its private schools, Alpha has also attempted to gain some footholds in public education through a public-charter network called Unbound Academy, which offers a virtual version of its school, completely online.
    


            In 2024, Arizona became the first state to approve Unbound, marking its — and by affiliation, Alpha's — first foray into public schools.
    


            But Alpha's applications for charter-school status have been rejected by several states, including Arkansas, Norh Carolina, Utah, South Carolina and Pennsylvania.
    


            The Pennsylvania Department of Education, in denying its application, pointed to the lack of teachers and concern about the model being largely untested.
    


            “The artificial intelligence instructional model being proposed by this school is untested and fails to demonstrate how the tools, methods and providers would ensure alignment to Pennsylvania academic standards,” the department said. 



            Lee, the Stanford education expert, noted that there are real concerns about using AI in situations that present risks for some children. “There's a concern that what works in one context, we don't know if it works in another context,” he said.
    


            The move to Alpha's school in Brownsville in 2022 was supposed to be a positive one for Jessica Lopez's two daughters — and a chance for her older daughter, who is autistic and had always excelled academically, to reach new academic heights. The fact that students could learn at their own pace and have specialized lessons seemed like an appealing model for her needs, Lopez said.
    


            But Lopez said she almost immediately noticed a change in both her girls after they started at Alpha. Although on paper, they met their academic targets, their attitude shifted from curiosity about knowledge to extreme focus on metrics.
    


            In a 2023 town hall with parents and Alpha employees seen by CNN, several parents expressed their concern with how the daily data-driven metrics seemed to supersede learning. Some children were staying up late into the night or logging extra hours on their apps to boost their metrics, sometimes leading to anxiety and tears, some parents said.
    


            After their second year, Lopez decided to withdraw her children and enroll them in public school, where she says she discovered that the girls had fallen behind.
    


            “They were doing what the school wanted them to do. In the end, it really wasn't out of joy,” Lopez said, adding that she felt that, by the end of their time at Alpha, her children had turned “zombie-like.”
    


            Several families left Alpha Brownsville around the time of the Lopez children's departure.
    


            While they were sending their children to Alpha, some of the parents formed a support group to share troubling experiences. In text messages from the group seen by CNN, some suggested their children were being pressured to engage in school activities they didn't want to do, under the guise of building grit and testing their limits. The parents discussed the stress their children were exhibiting related to the school.
    


            A spokesperson for the school said Alpha's personalized learning model is designed to fix learning gaps developed in traditional schools. “No credible person who studies Alpha's model first hand would say that foundational concepts are lost at Alpha,” she said.
    


            Families that chose to leave the Brownsville school around the same time as the Lopez did so because it “no longer aligned with their preferences,” the spokesperson added, noting that the school has grown exponentially since then.
    


            “My biggest complaint is — just be honest about what it is,” said Lopez. “There's no perfect system, and for a group that sells perfection, this is less than perfect.”

            For decades, the unwritten rule of the East Wing was that an American first lady's private life was a gift to the National Archives, eventually traded for a post-presidency memoir and maybe a library wing.
    


            But as Melania Trump prepares to walk the red carpet at the newly rebranded Kennedy Center on Thursday evening, she is proving that a peek behind the curtain of her life isn't just a historical record, but a multi-million-dollar commodity. 



            With the “Melania” documentary, which captures the 20 days around her return to the White House, the first lady cast aside the privacy she's long sought to instead become a paid executive producer of her own narrative — one that turns the presidential transition into an unprecedented cinematic event.
    


            “I'm very private person and a very selective person – what I do, what I don't do, when I talk, when I don't talk. And that's my choice, and nobody is in charge of me,” Trump said during a Wednesday evening appearance on Fox News' “The Five,” underscoring the calculation she's making to tell her story.
    


            “Melania” premieres Thursday evening to a who's who of President Donald Trump's Cabinet and minor celebrities, including the Chrisley family of reality TV fame, rapper Waka Flocka Flame and the financial criminal “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort. The film will have concurrent, invitation-only premiere screenings in 21 cities.
    


            The business of being first lady, it turns out, is quite lucrative.
    


            Melania Trump and her team, led by agent and senior adviser Marc Beckman, secured a $40 million deal with Amazon MGM Studios, plus a blockbuster $35 million marketing budget, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            It all culminates Friday with a theatrical release across the globe that will test whether the significant public curiosity about the first lady can drive her fans – and even foes – to movie theaters at a time of slumping ticket sales.
    


            The substance of the one hour, 44-minute film has been kept closely under wraps. Reporters have not received advance screeners, though Fox News' Maria Bartiromo and Newsmax's Greta Van Susteren are among the expected red carpet attendees at the Kennedy Center, whose facade now also bears Donald Trump's name.
    


            A synopsis of the documentary promises “exclusive footage capturing critical meetings, private conversations, and never-before-seen environments.”
    


            And it was made with Melania Trump's full participation and editorial control. She was deeply involved in the production, post production and promotional aspects of the film, Beckman said in an interview with One America News.
    


            Directed by Brett Ratner, the film marks his first major project since 2017, when he was accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women. (Ratner has denied the allegations.)
    


            When choosing a director for the project, Trump told Fox News, the most important thing was “that he puts out my idea, what I have, and cinematic film that I want to achieve. So he was the best one, and he was great to work with.”
    


            The film's trailer offered more questions than answers about the dynamic between the president and first lady. But while it's expected to address their relationship, don't expect the first lady to drop any major bombs – the president called it a “MUST WATCH” on Truth Social as he posted a link to buy tickets.
    


            Some of the other broad themes can be gleaned from the film's cast: The first lady's interest in fashion appears to be a key player, with her longtime designers Hervé Pierre and Adam Lippes, who designed her navy Inauguration Day coat, taking prime billing.
    


            Family factors in, with son Barron Trump, father Viktor Knavs and the president listed in the credits (but none of her stepchildren).
    


            The appearance of fellow first spouses Brigitte Macron of France and Queen Rania of Jordan, suggests diplomacy could be a feature too. It's possible Melania Trump's Catholic faith plays a role, with Monsignor Joseph LaMorte and Father Enrique Salvo appearing.
    


            Members of her small staff will also be featured: chief of staff Hayley Harrison, White House visitors office director Alexandra Veletsis and longtime aide Justin Caporale.
    


            Photographer Régine Mahaux, hairstylist Mordechai Alvow, makeup artist Nicole Bryl and interior designer Tham Kannalikham will also be in the film. Kannalikham helped Trump decorate the White House private quarters during both terms and assisted with key restoration projects in the home's public spaces.
    


            “In the film, I speak about my passion for preservation and restoration,” Kannalikham said in a social media post.
    


            While the film offers a massive payout to the first lady, it's unclear if it will deliver for its production company, which has yet to publicly announce a streaming date. Prime Video has already committed to streaming an accompanying three-part docuseries with additional footage, according to an Amazon MGM Studios spokesperson.
    


            Early signs indicate that the documentary's enormous budget likely won't be recouped during opening weekend, which is expected to generate between $2 and $5 million, according to an estimate from Boxoffice Pro, which notes that the film has “surged in bookings over the past ten days” and will open in approximately 1,500 locations domestically.
    


            Amazon's decision to partner with Trump may also be a political calculation — marking one of the tech titans' many efforts to cozy up to the White House.
    


            “We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it,” an Amazon MGM Studios spokesperson said.
    


            The company is taking the bet that there's an in-person audience for the mysterious first lady.
    


            “There is always an inherent curiosity about Melania Trump that goes beyond just the Trump political base liking her, admiring her. Will that put butts in the seats at movie theaters? You know, who knows?” said Kate Bennett, a former CNN journalist who chronicled the Trump family and author of “Free, Melania.”
    


            She added: “It might, but it's a very heavy investment for an Amazon studio to make in a woman whose forward-facing persona is very, very rarely seen, but is fleeting and not as ubiquitous as Michelle Obama's or Jill Biden's or Laura Bush.”
    


            The first lady has kept an extremely low profile this term compared to the first, opting to spend the vast majority of her time in New York or Palm Beach, Florida. She has promoted several initiatives, including children in foster care, AI safety and the reunification of Ukrainian children allegedly abducted by Russia. But her preference, sources familiar with her thinking have said, is not to be publicly involved in her husband's return to public office.
    


            That shifted in the run-up to the film's release, with the first lady scaling up her public schedule and sitting for a televised interview for the first time in more than a year. Trump is appearing on Fox News thrice this week – on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday, “The Five” Wednesday and in a taped interview with Fox Business' “Mornings with Maria.”
    


            That film's release has come at an awkward time for the White House. The first couple proceeded with a private screening in the East Room on Saturday even as outrage mounted over the administration's handling of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis that morning. Guests, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon's Andy Jassy, snacked on popcorn in custom “Melania” boxes and listened to a performance of the “Melania Waltz” in the Grand Foyer as Americans protested the 37-year-old ICU nurse's killing.
    


            “I'm against the violence. So if — please, if we protest, protest in peace, and we need to unify in these times,” Trump told Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt when asked to address the shooting, offering a rare comment on current events.
    


            On Wednesday morning, she appeared at the New York Stock Exchange, ringing the bell in front of “Melania” signage alongside a pair of NYSE executives.
    


            The promotional campaign has extended to ads on television (including during the highly viewed NFL playoff games), on billboards, in subway stations, plastered on buses across the country and even encompassing the Sphere in Las Vegas.
    


            The significant marketing budget, according to documentary filmmaker Stefano Da Frè, is likely bolstered by a belief the film will be a box office and streaming success. (Da Frè, who was not involved in the project, has directed multiple films streaming on Amazon and other platforms.)
    


            Amazon, he told CNN in an interview last week, “didn't just come up with that number randomly. They believe, through their metrics, that it's worth that amount.”
    


            It is largely unprecedented for a sitting first lady to actively profit off of her position. Many of Trump's predecessors have written books or hit the speaking circuit — but always after leaving office.
    


            Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, for example, both waited until after departing the White House to publish memoirs, with Obama's “Becoming” now the fastest-selling memoir of all time.
    


            Jill Biden kept her day job while serving as first lady. Teaching English at a local community college earned her $85,985 in 2023, according to tax returns.
    


            Eleanor Roosevelt, who wrote syndicated newspaper advice columns, might offer the closest comparison. In 1937, she sold her autobiography rights to Ladies' Home Journal for $75,000 — that'd be just under $2 million today. Critics at the time “accused her of using her media gigs to financially profit from her role as first lady,” according to the National Endowment for the Humanities, but she also donated much of her earnings.
    


            The optics of Trump's film feel different, Bennett said. “We're watching somebody with perhaps one of the biggest global platforms in the world choose to use it primarily when she has a promotional endeavor.”
    


            But she added: “You do have to ask the question – is that so bad? The role of first lady is such a weird, antiquated role. Women do put their lives on hold, their incomes on hold, just because their husbands were elected. And is it time, in 2026, to think about the role differently?”

            Stephen Miller has sought this week to distance himself from the recent fatal shootings in Minneapolis and the administration's miscalculated response. But more than anyone, Miller has been the overall architect of Trump's aggressive deportation push, encouraging heavy-handed operations in blue cities and urging agencies to cast a wide net to meet hefty arrest quotas.
    


            Miller is one of multiple Trump administration officials who have sought to cast blame on each other in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota as they have faced bipartisan criticism for the increasingly chaotic scenes there and for their seeming rush to blame Pretti for the confrontation.
    


            On Tuesday, Miller — who has long been reticent to admit to failure or weakness — took the rare step of acknowledging a possible mistake in the administration's immigration effort, a sign of how much the Pretti shooting has shaken the White House.
    


            Miller said that Customs and Border Protection may not have followed protocols during the shooting, and he noted that the White House based its preliminary response on initial reports from CBP on the ground.
    


            Miller originally called Pretti a “would-be assassin” — and his comment was amplified by other Trump-linked accounts. His description of Pretti was quickly contradicted by video that showed him only filming officers and helping a woman who had been knocked down.
    


            Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, is widely seen in the administration as the mastermind of the president's immigration policy, relentlessly pushing officials to meet goals that he designates on behalf of the president.
    


            His power is evident in his daily 10 a.m. conference calls, including Saturdays, where he demands updates from agencies and exerts pressure on senior officials who deliver less-than-satisfactory results, according to a source familiar.
    


            The call, which a White House official described as a “policy call to ensure interagency coordination,” includes senior leadership of agencies across the administration who are responsible for various aspects of national security and public safety.
    


            And while the call can cover a host of topics, it largely focuses on Trump's immigration push, a core part of the president's second-term agenda.
    


            Miller is militant, according to administration sources, in his belief that he must strictly enforce that push. He has been keenly focused on numbers, including how many immigration arrests are being conducted on a given day and how quickly deportations are happening. Last year, he directed ICE officials to meet daily quotas of 3,000 immigration arrests — an unprecedented number that hasn't yet been met.
    


            The intense White House pressure is felt downstream among agents and officers conducting immigration enforcement operations, resulting in their casting a wide net as to whom they arrest, including those who do not have criminal records.
    


            Officials will often breathe a sigh of relief when Miller is directing his ire to an agency that's not their own during the calls. Miller is also known to call Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem— who has taken significant heat for her handling of Minnesota — multiple times a day, according to sources, to provide guidance and direction on how Trump's immigration agenda is being executed.
    


            “Stephen is laser-focused on implementing the president's agenda and the high success of the Homeland Security Council showcases that,” a White House official told CNN, pointing to the “DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force” and the oil boat seizures, among other items. “This is the definition of good government.”
    


            CNN has previously reported Miller is also heavily involved with the Justice Department day-to-day operations especially when it comes to immigration and messaging. He is in regular contact with officials at all levels of the department, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.
    


            A White House official argued that Miller's role is strictly focused on policy, not operational enforcement. The official noted that Greg Bovino, who until this week led the operation in Minnesota, was not present for these calls.
    


            Miller, a former Senate aide who has long been fixated on immigration policy, joined Trump's 2016 presidential campaign during its early stages, and was the rare White House aide to serve the full four years of his first term. He has become even more powerful during Trump's second term, weighing in on a wide range of issues as Trump and his aides have sought to transform Washington.
    


            One White House official laughed at the prospect of Miller being fired over the Minneapolis response.  Trump “is hesitant to talk about getting rid of someone who has been here a few weeks, let alone someone who has been with him for more than 10 years. It's not even on his radar.”
    


            By Wednesday, Miller was back to sharing X posts about the arrests of “Minnesota rioters” and the “dangerous policy” on immigration supported by Democrats.

Live Updates


• Border czar outlines plan: White House border czar Tom Homan said he has ordered federal immigration authorities to work on an eventual drawdown plan for law enforcement in Minnesota. In remarks to the press in Minneapolis, Homan — who has taken the reins on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown there — said operations on the ground will be targeted and he is “staying ‘til the problem's gone.”



            • New potential guidelines: The administration is considering new guidelines for federal immigration officers in Minnesota, including plans to avoid engaging with “agitators” and only focusing on immigrants with convictions or facing criminal charges, officials familiar with the talks told CNN.
    


            • Alex Pretti shooting: Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said footage showing a clash between Pretti and federal agents over a week before he was killed did not justify the protester's killing. Federal officers involved in the shooting are on administrative leave per standard protocol, DHS said.
    


            Several Democratic state attorneys general asserted their support for Minnesota officials Thursday in a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi. The letter blasts Bondi for making demands this weekend of Gov. Tim Walz that they said “are without lawful basis and inconsistent with fundamental principles of our federal system.”
    


            Bondi told Walz in a letter Saturday that he could “bring an end to the chaos in Minnesota” by abandoning sanctuary city policies, sharing confidential data from the state's social services programs with the Trump administration, and turning over Minnesota's full, non-public voter rolls to the Department of Justice.
    


            The Democratic attorneys general accused the administration of “attempting through force what it cannot achieve through the courts,” saying policy disputes raised by Bondi are the subject of lawsuits that have not produced wins for President Donald Trump so far.
    


            “Your letter, penned on the very day federal agents took the life of a second civilian on Minnesota's streets, makes plain the true purpose behind the administration's violent and unlawful assault,” the new letter, signed by attorneys general of 21 states and the District of Columbia, said.
    


            “It is not to uncover fraud or pursue criminal undocumented immigrants, but rather to terrify the people of Minnesota and coerce the State into abandoning policies and protections it has the sovereign authority to pursue.”
    


            Border czar Tom Homan tried to turn the page in Minnesota on Thursday. But despite his pragmatic rhetoric and focus on how to move forward, it remains unclear what the future looks like.
    


            Eyes are now back on Washington, DC, where President Donald Trump is convening his Cabinet officials for a meeting Thursday morning. It'll be Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's first public appearance since her controversial press conference on Saturday in the immediate aftermath of Alex Pretti's killing in an encounter with federal agents. The president and his top officials have publicly and privately maintained that Trump still has full confidence in Noem, even as he has moved to sideline one of his top officials on the ground, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino.
    


            Similar questions have swirled around deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller's standing. Like Noem, he was quick to malign Pretti in the wake of his death. Miller has since sought to suggest Customs and Border Protection may not have been following proper protocol.
    


            But Miller is viewed as the mastermind of Trump's immigration agenda — and new questions have emerged as to whether the administration's shifting strategy will ultimately impact how he operates moving forward.
    


            Increased cooperation between county jail systems and immigration authorities would be key to the Department of Homeland Security drawing down on the number of federal agents posted in Minnesota, ﻿White House border czar Tom Homan said in a news conference this morning.
    


            Homan said he spoke to Minnesota officials, including state Attorney General Keith Ellison, who “clarified for me that county jails may notify ICE of the release dates of criminal public safety risks, so ICE can take custody of them upon their release from the jail.”
    


            Homan, who noted that the Minnesota state prison system has already been honoring ICE detainers, called the decision a common sense move that would allow for more immigration agents in jails and fewer on the streets.
    


            ICE detainers are requests from ICE to local law enforcement to hold a suspected noncitizen beyond their scheduled release, so they can be turned over to federal custody.
    


            ICE and Customs and Border Protection staff are working on a draw down plan for Minnesota “based on the cooperation” of local officials, Homan said.
    


            “If they [federal agencies] want to work together on catching truly bad guys that have made our city less safe, we do that. By the way, we do that now,” Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said in a CNN town hall last night.
    


            In December, Ellison's office released an opinion stating that local law enforcement officers would not hold people in jail solely based on ICE detainers. The opinion also notes that county sheriffs may not unilaterally set up cooperation agreements with ICE without approval from their board of commissioners.
    


            When kicking off his news conference in Minneapolis, border czar Tom Homan said he would be “staying ‘til the problem's gone,” but added that he has ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a “drawdown plan” for law enforcement in Minnesota following two fatal shootings.
    


            Homan told reporters he came to Minnesota at President Donald Trump's request to improve the situation on the ground.
    


                    “I didn't come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” Homan said. “I came here to seek solutions, and that's we're going to do.”
                





            He acknowledged that federal immigration operations have not been “perfect” and noted that federal officers who don't act with professionalism will be “dealt with, like any other federal agency.”
    


            Sharing details about his conversations with Minnesota officials, Homan said state Attorney General Keith Ellison told him county jails “may notify ICE of the release dates” of “criminal public safety risks” so ICE can take them into custody. A drawndown of forces in the state will happen, “based on the discussions” Homan has had with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ellison, he said.
    


            While Homan stressed that immigration operations are focused on criminal undocumented immigrants who pose public safety or national security threats, he said anyone who has crossed the border illegally remains at risk of deportation.
    


            Homan said he that neither he nor President Donald Trump wants anyone to die, but stressed that “the hostile rhetoric and dangerous threats and hate” against immigration enforcement agents “must stop.”
    


            Homan refused to talk about the shootings by federal agents in Minnesota — which killed two US citizens — citing ongoing investigations.
    


CNN's Chris Boyette, Kaanita Iyer, Michael Williams and Kit Maher contributed reporting. 



            President Donald Trump dispatched border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota this week with a clear goal: clean up this mess.
    


            Homan attempted to do just that Thursday morning, adopting the role many administration officials have credited him for in recent days — being the grown up in the room.
    


            He used his first public appearance since arriving in the state to do something many top administration officials have so far been reluctant, and at times unwilling, to do: acknowledge mistakes have been made in how federal immigration authorities have been carrying out the president's agenda. And he said changes are in the process of being enacted.
    


            Homan said he would not leave Minnesota “until the problem's gone,” stressing the administration and local officials need to have substantive conversations. Upholding “public safety should be paramount,” he said, is a higher priority than the administration's deportation agenda. And he said federal officers who do not act with professionalism will be “dealt with” appropriately.
    


            Homan also emphasized that he is working on a “draw down plan” — something Minnesota's Democratic leaders have relentlessly requested. But he cautioned that such a reduction in federal resources would be dependent upon cooperation with local leaders.
    


            It was a remarkable shift in tone from the aggressive and defiant language the president's top immigration officials used after Alex Pretti was fatally shot in an encounter with federal agents. Homan notably did not mention Pretti's name and quickly redirected questions about his killing by maintaining the administration is going to “let the investigation play out.”
    


            Following a news conference with border czar Tom Homan in Minneapolis, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez described it as following his “classic playbook.”
    


            “Everything that he said is the philosophy that he has had on immigration enforcement for years,” said Alvarez, who covers immigration.
    


Listen to Alvarez's breakdown of the news conference here:



            White House border czar Tom Homan thanked local and state officials in Minnesota whom he had already met with as well as those he has yet to meet with during a news conference on Thursday.
    


            Homan said he's had meetings with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as well as “numerous police chiefs and sheriffs.”
    


            “We've had meaningful, meaningful dialog,” Homan said. “We didn't agree on everything, but we agreed on the things I just talked about — there's much more we can do, and I'm in continuous dialogues.”
    


            He addressed questions from some who wanted to know “why we're talking with people who they don't consider friends to the administration,” saying, “Bottom line is you can't fix problems if you don't have discussions.”
    


            Homan added that he planned to continue talking and meeting with business and religious leaders in Minnesota communities. “I want to hear what they have to say,” he said.
    


            “I came here to seek solutions, and that's what we're going to do. We've come a long way, and we got some good wins for the people of Minnesota.”
    


            Border czar Tom Homan refused to talk about the shootings by federal agents in Minnesota — which killed two US citizens — citing ongoing investigations.
    


            When asked at a news conference about a new video that surfaced of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot Saturday, Homan said, “I'm not going to comment on any shootings.”
    


                    “From day one, I said on any of these shootings, as a career law enforcement officer, we'll let for the — we'll let investigation roll out, let the investigation play out, and let it go where it goes,” Homan said. “I'm not going to come out and make any comments.” 
                





            Earlier this month, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by a federal agent. A week later, an ICE officer shot and wounded a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis.
    


            White House border czar Tom Homan said he that neither he nor President Donald Trump wants anyone to die.
    


            “The President, one of the words he said to me when I came up here, he doesn't want to see anybody die… I don't want to see anybody die, even the people we're looking for. I don't want to see anybody die,” Homan said.
    


Tom Homan, the White House border czar, said Thursday that “the hostile rhetoric and dangerous threats and hate” against immigration enforcement agents “must stop.”
    


            Homan said the rhetoric has caused an increase in assaults on immigration agents and forced the administration to send in additional resources to Minnesota.
    


            “I begged for the last two months on TV for the rhetoric to stop. I said in March, if the rhetoric didn't stop, there's going to be bloodshed, and there has been. I wish I wasn't right,” he said.
    


            Homan said he has spoken with local law enforcement leaders about keeping agents safe as a way to ultimately draw down the amount of federal agents on the ground.
    


            “The chiefs I've talked to are committed to responding to 911 calls when protesters turned violent, agents are in a dangerous situation and there's assaults,” Homan said. “They have committed to upholding public safety and responding to the needs not to enforce immigration law, but to keep the peace.”
    


            White House border czar Tom Homan on Thursday acknowledged that Americans have a right to protest federal immigration enforcement.
    


            “You have your First Amendment rights — I support that,” Homan said during a press conference in Minneapolis today. “You have the right to protest. I'm just asking to keep it peaceful.”
    


            His comments represent a notable departure from how other top officials had referred to protesters. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino had repeatedly called those protesting federal immigration operations in the city “agitators,” “rioters,” or “insurrectionists.”
    


            Homan added that threatening, impeding or assaulting law enforcement is “never okay” and there will be “zero tolerance” for doing so.
    


            When asked by CNN's Shimon Prokupecz how the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota was allowed to proceed in the manner it has and create fear among residents, White House border czar Tom Homan said the extra resources were brought in to provide security.
    


            “Reason for a massive deployment is because of the threats, because of the violence,” Homan explained. “If I'm on an operation arrest team, I'm going to a house, I've got to be busy with that guy, the dangerous guy, and I can't keep looking over my shoulder at what's happening outside the house.”
    


            A drawndown of forces in the state will happen, “based on the discussions,” Homan has had with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the border czar said.
    


            “The drawdown is going to happen based on these agreements, but the drawdown can happen even more if the hateful rhetoric and the impediment and interference will stop,” he said.
    


            Trump border czar Tom Homan shared details during a press conference about his conversations with Minnesota officials, saying state Attorney General Keith Ellison told him county jails “may notify ICE of the release dates” of “criminal public safety risks” so ICE can take them into custody.
    


            Homan also shared that he and state and local officials agreed on the following things:
    


            However, what they disagreed on was the officials' involvement in immigration enforcement.
    


                    “To be clear, we did not agree with Minnesota's state and local officials that … they would be involved in immigration enforcement,” Homan said. “I didn't ask them to be immigration officers. I'm asking them to be cops working with the cops to help us take criminal aliens off the street.” 
                





            While President Trump's border czar Tom Homan stressed that immigration operations are focused on criminal undocumented immigrants who pose public safety or national security threats, he said anyone who has crossed the border illegally remains at risk of deportation.
    


            “All operations will be targeted, but the prioritization are going to be criminal aliens, public safety threats and national security threats,” Homan said. “We got a lot of them to keep us busy.”
    


            “If you're in the country illegally, you're not – you're never off the table,” he added.
    


            Federal officers who don't act with professionalism will be “dealt with, like any other federal agency,” White House border czar Tom Homan said while highlighting the challenging environment ICE officers and CBP agents are working in amid immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota.
    


            “We have standards of conduct,” Homan said.
    


            “These men and women, that carry that badge and gun, are American patriots. They put their selves on the line for this nation every day,” he added. “God bless every one of them.”
    


            White House border czar Tom Homan said on Thursday that he has ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a “drawdown plan” for law enforcement in Minnesota following two fatal shootings.
    


            Homan, who was deployed by the Trump administration to Minneapolis to replace Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino following Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, said officers would be more focused on working in jails and prisons, and less focused on the street operations that have drawn heavy criticism for their severe and sweeping tactics.
    


            “More agents in the jail means less agents in the street,” Homan said. “This is common-sense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here.”
    


            “Yes, I said it,” he added, “draw down the number of people here.”
    


            President Trump's border czar Tom Homan acknowledged that federal immigration operations have not been “perfect.”
    


            “President Trump and I, along with others in administration, have recognized that certain improvements could and should be made. That's exactly what I'm doing here,” Homan said Thursday at a press conference in Minneapolis.
    


            “In meetings I've had with federal law enforcement managers, including ICE and CBP and other federal partners, as well as state and local officials, I have conveyed the president's expectations with regard to federal immigration enforcement efforts.”
    


            Homan, who has a long history in immigration enforcement and previously served as a Border Patrol agent, said he didn't come to Minnesota looking photo ops or headlines.
    


            “I come here looking for solutions. I do not want to hear that everything's been done here has been perfect. Nothing's ever perfect.”
    


            He also stressed how operations on the ground in Minneapolis will be targeted so “when we hit the streets, we know exactly who we're looking for.”
    


            “What we've been working on is making this operation safer, more efficient, by the book,” Homan said. “The mission is going to improve because of the changes we're making internally.”
    


            White House border czar Tom Homan told reporters he came to Minnesota at President Donald Trump's request to improve the situation on the ground.
    


            “I didn't come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” Homan said. “I came here to seek solutions, and that's we're going to do.”
    


            Homan said he's had constructive conversations with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.
    


            “One thing we did agree on … was that community safety is paramount,” Homan said.
    


            Starting his press conference in Minneapolis, border czar Tom Homan said he would be “staying ‘til the problem's gone.”
    


            Homan was sent to Minnesota on Monday to take the reins on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota.
    


            “We've made a lot of progress, a lot of progress in the last three days,” he told reporters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump 2.0 sees terrorism all over the place","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/29/politics/terrorism-definition-minneapolis-pretti-ice-analysis","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:00:46 GMT","


            The Trump administration is living in a state of perpetual terror, both foreign and domestic.
    


Alex Pretti and Renee Good, the two people killed by federal agents in separate incidents in Minneapolis this month, were both labeled “domestic terrorists” by the likes of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and top White House aide Stephen Miller.
    


            Video of both killings has complicated the administration's version of events.
    


            But the idea that federal government officials view protest as domestic terrorism pervades President Donald Trump's second term.
    


            “We have a nice little database, and now you're considered a domestic terrorist,” a masked agent tells an ICE observer in another video from this year, this one filmed in Portland, Maine.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security tried to correct the agent with a statement to CNN: “There is no database of domestic terrorists run by DHS.”
    


            That statement runs counter to CNN's report Wednesday that included this key point:
    


                    “Federal immigration officers have been collecting personal information about protesters and agitators in Minneapolis, sources told CNN – and had documented details about Alex Pretti before he was shot to death on Saturday… A memo sent earlier this month to agents temporarily assigned to the city asked them to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc., so we can capture it all in one consolidated form,” according to correspondence reviewed by CNN.”
                





            The “terrorism” language was slightly different, but the message was exactly the same last September when Trump announced he would be dispatching federal resources to Portland, Oregon, to, as the official White House statement said, “Crush Violent Radical Left Terrorism…”
    


            The move invited further protests in Portland, but courts ultimately rejected Trump's plan to deploy the National Guard to Portland and other cities.
    


            Earlier in Trump's term, it was vandals who targeted Tesla dealerships who were branded as domestic terrorists by the administration.
    


            In each case, either Trump or his aides have suggested the “terrorists” are underwritten by an organized cabal, but they have never provided evidence.
    


            The administration has creatively used the word “terrorism” in foreign affairs as well.
    


            Alleged drug boats are destroyed as part of Trump's war on “narco-terrorists.” The extrajudicial killing of people on the boats seeks to blend his national security duties with the justice system in a way that many experts doubt is legal.
    


            Former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was snatched by US Special Forces in part to bring him into the US justice system. He and his wife now sit in jail in New York awaiting trial for, among other things, allegedly engaging in a narco-terrorist conspiracy with drug cartels, according to the State Department, which had a $50 million bounty for his capture.
    


            Far from rejecting anyone with ties to Maduro, however, the US is now working with his former vice president, Delcy Rodríguez.
    


            Sen. Cory Booker, the New Jersey Democrat, told Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday that the administration is losing its credibility with the word terrorism.
    


            “I don't trust this administration and the way they use terms like ‘terrorist,'” Booker said. “I've seen them calling American citizens ‘domestic terrorists,' who are people trying to peacefully protest.”
    


            The Trump administration does continue to use the word in a way that will feel more conventional to most Americans. When Trump ordered air strikes in Nigeria on Christmas Day, he said it was to protect Christians in that country from Islamic terrorists.
    


            Applying the “terror” term all over the map weakens it, according to Juliette Kayyem, a former DHS official and CNN senior national security analyst.
    


            “They are using the term terrorist to basically define any group of people who criticize them,” she said of Trump's administration.
    


            There is a specific definition of terrorism in US law. It includes things that endanger life  violate laws in order to “intimidate or coerce” the civilian population or government.
    


            Even Todd Blanche, the No. 2 official in Trump's Department of Justice, said the legal term does not seem to apply to someone like Pretti.
    


            “I don't think anybody thinks that they were comparing what happened on Saturday to the legal definition of domestic terrorism,” Blanche said Monday on Fox News. “What we saw was a very violent altercation, and we — I am not going to prejudge the facts.”
    


            In addition to the legal definition, the word is important socially and politically, Kayyem said.
    


            “It is a way to mark a certain activity as immoral and illegitimate, and we want to reserve that for people who are real terrorists, who target civilian populations for violence or the threat of violence.”
    


            If anyone who disagrees with the administration becomes a terrorist of some kind, that flies in the face of the First Amendment, which is supposed to protect freedom of speech and peaceable assembly.
    


            The top lawmaker in the Minnesota House, Democrat Melissa Hortman, was killed alongside her husband by a gunman last year. The conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated on a college campus in Utah. Neither shooting has been attributed to an organized group, but both suggest an era of political violence.
    


            Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Minneapolis-area Democrat who is a frequent target of conspiracy theories and insults by Trump — who has said she and other Somali Americans are “garbage” — had what is now believed to be apple cider vinegar sprayed on her at an event Tuesday night. Omar was unhurt in the incident.
    


            At the event Tuesday, she too nodded at the concept of terror — referencing ICE agents who have become a major presence and sparked violence in her city. According to CNN's report, Omar condemned federal immigration agents' “terrorizing” tactics and “reckless and lawless” actions, as she told attendees that the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities is antithetical to “the America we love.”
    


            Kayyem fears a legacy of this political era is that the threat of violence “becomes an extension of political disagreement.”
    


            It's hard not to see that fear taking hold in shouting matches that break out at town halls held by the increasingly rare lawmakers who take questions in public from constituents in public.

President Donald Trump has gathered his Cabinet for a video broadcasted meeting that's expected to be another lengthy, praise-heavy affair. Since returning to office, the president has used these meetings to review his administration's accomplishments and provide Cabinet members with an opportunity to shower him with superlatives.

During the meeting, Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday.

Addressing the press gathered at the Cabinet meeting, just ahead of the vote, Trump said, “We don't want a shutdown,” and that the two sides were discussing a possible agreement to separate homeland security funding from the rest of the legislation and fund it for a short time.

Other news we're following:








Trump's Cabinet meeting has been going on for an hour. Here's who has given updates on their work so far:

At Trump's cabinet meeting, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner said that home sales in December “rose sharply to their strongest pace in three years” — but that's not quite what appears to be happening in the housing market that has been a persistent source of frustration for U.S. consumers.

The National Association of Realtors did report that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of home sales in December rose to 4.35 million units, “nearly” the highest in three years as the trade association noted. But the sum was just a 1.4% year over year increase. 

More importantly, it could have been a monthly blip as the Realtors separately said that pending home sales in December had fallen 3% from a year ago.

Trump has said that he wants to keep home prices high to increase people's net worth, but doing so will likely keep construction levels low and price out possible first-time buyers.

Religious leaders in Washington called the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers “a profound moral failure” and condemned the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics.

“We affirm the sacred worth of every human life,” they said in a joint statement Thursday, adding they “stand with immigrants” and “condemn … the use of indiscriminate and lethal force against civilians.”

The administration's operations, they said, flout “our nation's deepest moral commitments” and “values of human dignity.”

The group includes Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop Robert McElroy; Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde; Rabbi Abbi Sharofsky of the Jewish Community Relations Council; and Zoroastrian Head Priest Berham Panthaki, among others.

McElroy is the latest U.S. Catholic cardinal to pan Trump's approach, and some Catholic media have specifically slammed Catholic Vice President JD Vance. Budde drew Trump's ire after she asked at his inaugural prayer service to “have mercy” on migrants and LGBTQ+ people.



The president said he'd read coverage suggesting that his health chief might outpace Trump's own impact in November.

“So, I have to be very careful that Bobby likes us,” Trump joked.

It's not the first time Trump has been sensitive to the famous Kennedy surname packing more political punch than his own name.

At the start of his administration, Trump frequently mentioned Kennedy's high profile as a member of his Cabinet. He was fond then of suggesting that Kennedy work to make sure he didn't get too politically famous.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gave an update on TrumpRx, a government website in development that's intended to help people buy drugs directly from manufacturers.

The website is part of the administration's larger push to lower drug prices and give Americans options to buy medications at lower prices by cutting out middlemen.

Trump's administration had said TrumpRx was coming in January 2026, but Kennedy didn't commit to that timeline at a meeting of cabinet officials.

“That's going to be happening sometime probably in the next 10 days,” Kennedy said.

Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies Thursday as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. 

Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday. But Trump said just ahead of the vote that “we don't want a shutdown” and the two sides were discussing a possible agreement to separate homeland security funding from the rest of the legislation and fund it for a short time. 

As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands on Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest. If those are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown.

Trump said at his cabinet meeting that “next week” he'll announce his choice to replace Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve.

The president has criticized Powell for not slashing benchmark interest rates as low as Trump would like. Powell has insisted that the Fed stay independent of politics and make its choices based on inflation and job market data. 

Even though Powell's term as chair ends in May, he could stay on the board of governors until 2028 and block Trump's ability to appoint someone new to the board as chair.

Trump said his pick will do a “good job” and that he wants the Fed to cut rates when there are signs of economic growth.

President Donald Trump said Thursday he has asked Russian President Vladimir Putin not to target the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv for one week as the region experiences frigid temperatures.

The call for a pause in attacks on Ukraine's capital comes as Russia has been pounding the country's critical infrastructure, leaving many around the country without heat in the dead of winter.

“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump added that Putin has “agreed to that.”

After a nearly half-hour recap of administration accomplishments including on drug prices and the economy, Trump turned to envoy Steve Witkoff — not technically a Cabinet member — to give the meeting's first report.

Trump asked Witkoff for an update on the Middle East, where the remains of the last hostage in Gaza, Ran Gvili, were recovered and returned to his family earlier this week.

“Your policy of peace through strength that's what delivered them home,” Witkoff told Trump.

During his opener, Trump told many of the same stories he often does about policy decisions, although he did make news in noting he had he informed Venezuela's leader Delcy Rodríguez that he's going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela, to which the U.S. suspended commercial travel in 2019.

The president said of his Cabinet meeting in December, “It was a little bit on the boring side.”

Recalling being seen as struggling to keep his eyes open during that gathering, Trump insisted, “I didn't sleep. I just closed them because I wanted to get the hell out of there.”

The comment drew laugher, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has made a trademark of laughing loudest during Cabinet meetings.

Potentially less funny for those gathered during Thursday's meeting, Trump said not everyone would be allowed to speak to save time.

“We're not going to go through the whole table,” the president said, after he opened the meeting by speaking for nearly 25 minutes straight.

The participation of the director of national intelligence was unusual, given that Gabbard is not part of the FBI or federal law enforcement.

Asked to explain, a senior administration official said in a statement that “Gabbard has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, and election infrastructure.”

Trump has long insisted that the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden was stolen from him even though courts, his own former attorney general and audits have concluded that there was no widespread fraud that could have altered the outcome of the 2020 contest.

Trump said he informed Venezuela's leader Delcy Rodríguez on Thursday that he's going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela and Americans will soon be able to visit.

Trump said he instructed U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and U.S. military leaders to open up the airspace by the end of the day Thursday.

“American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela and they'll be safe there,” Trump said.

The U.S. suspended commercial travel to Venezuela in 2019.

Watch live as Democratic senators block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies.

The president, as he kicked off his Cabinet meeting, said his administration is speaking with congressional Democrats on avoiding a partial government shutdown.

“We're working on that right now,” Trump said while declining to go into specifics. He added: “We don't want a shutdown.”

Congress has to pass the remaining government funding by Jan. 31 to avoid a partial shutdown; the money for the Department of Homeland Security has been tied up in the aftermath of the shooting death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis as Democrats demand changes to federal immigration enforcement tactics.

Trump opened his Cabinet meeting by briefly highlighting improvements to the room, then moving on to his administration's successes.

He touched on his administration's efforts on crime before moving to Venezuela, where he thanked staff involved with the military operation to end the presidency of Nicolás Maduro.

They say such changes could lead to widespread problems for voters. For example, they say prior Republican efforts to require proof of citizenship have disenfranchised married women whose last names on their photo IDs don't exactly match their birth certificates or other proofs of citizenship.

The Brennan Center for Justice and other groups estimated in a 2023 report that 9% of U.S. citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, do not have proof of their citizenship readily available. Almost half of Americans do not have a U.S. passport.

The GOP election rules legislation has a long road ahead in the narrowly split Congress, where Democrats have rejected similar ideas as disenfranchising Americans' ability to vote. According to a one-page bill summary:

House Republicans are proposing sweeping changes to the nation's voting laws before Americans get their say in this fall's midterm elections.

The package to be released Thursday, a long-shot Trump priority, includes requirements for photo IDs before people can vote, proof of citizenship and prohibitions on universal vote-by-mail and ranked choice voting.

“These reforms will improve voter confidence, bolster election integrity, and make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat,” said Rep. Bryan Steil, chairman of the House Administration Committee, in a statement.

Majority Leader John Thune opened the Senate as Republicans and Democrats eye an emerging deal to consider immigration enforcement changes and prevent a federal shutdown.

“We're getting closer,” the GOP leader said.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said immigration changes must be included in any deal to fund the government.

“This is a moment of truth,” Schumer said.

Democrats want an end to roving patrols and a requirement that federal agents use body cameras and unmask themselves.

Schumer decried the “thugs roaming our streets” during immigration enforcement.

“Enough is enough,” he said.

Kevin Couch confirmed in an email to The Associated Press on Thursday that he resigned Wednesday, without providing an explanation. It's the latest sign of turmoil at the iconic performing arts venue.

The Kennedy Center's Trump-appointed president, Ric Grenell, had welcomed Couch to the role “as we expand our commonsense programming.”

Couch's exit comes as Trump and first lady Melania Trump are expected to walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center on Thursday for the premiere of “Melania,” a documentary she produced. 

The center is navigating a wave of artist cancellations in protest of Trump‘s new leadership, which added his name to the venue. In just the past week, composer Philip Glass called off a world premiere of a symphony about Abraham Lincoln, and Grammy-winning soprano Renée Fleming withdrew from two scheduled appearances.

Homan vowed to hold ICE and CBP officers accountable for their actions but didn't go into specifics of the Saturday shooting or indicate anything he thought they'd done wrong during the course of the operation.

“For decades, ICE and CBP have carried out their duties with integrity, professionalism and compassion. That remains the expectation under President Trump. And we will, I will, hold our agents and officers to that standard,” Homan said.

Homan also blamed “hateful rhetoric” for ratcheting up attacks on his officers who he called “American patriots.”

The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee wants to know why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard joined an FBI search of a Georgia election office that was featured in bogus conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss.

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said that if Gabbard believes a foreign intelligence service tried to swing the election she is obligated to inform his committee. Otherwise, “she is simply attempting to inject the non-partisan intelligence community into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy,” Warner said at a committee hearing Thursday.

Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to questions about Wednesday's action, which involved the FBI executing a search warrant and taking away many boxes of ballots cast by voters. Trump's claims of a stolen election have been repeatedly rejected by courts and state and federal officials, who found no evidence of fraud that would have altered the outcome.

ICE has historically relied on cooperation from local and state jails and prisons with immigrants in custody who've committed or are accused of crimes to alert ICE so that agents can pick them up before they're released. 

Many urban areas don't have such cooperation agreements, saying that keeping detainees beyond their release dates or otherwise working with ICE makes victims or witnesses to crimes more reluctant to support prosecutions. The Hennepin County Jail, which serves Minneapolis, and the Ramsey County jail, which serves St. Paul, don't honor such “detainers,” but both do hand over prisoners if there is an arrest warrant signed by a judge.

ICE argues that arresting immigrants while they're still in custody is safer and better for immigrant communities by avoiding street operations that might result in detentions of other people who are in the country illegally but haven't committed any crimes.

Homan said he appreciates that Minnesota's state prisons honor ICE detainers, “and we're going to expand upon that.”

Trump and his Cabinet have a meeting set for 11 a.m. Eastern. Anyone planning on tuning in should be prepared for a long haul.

The most recent Cabinet meeting ran past the two-hour mark — long enough that the president was caught closing his eyes. While officials defended this as a sign of the president's active listening, he recently suggested in an interview with New York Magazine that he did so because the meeting was boring. December's still fell short of an August meeting that went more than three hours and 15 minutes.

Since returning to office, Trump has used his cabinet meetings to review his administration's accomplishments and provide Cabinet members with an opportunity to shower him with superlatives. Past meetings have also included questions from reporters.

Mayor Frey's office says he'll attend the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday to advocate for an end to the immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis. He'll also meet with federal lawmakers as Senate Democrats threaten to hold up this year's Homeland Security budget unless the Trump administration agrees to limit ICE arrests to the targets of judicial warrants.

“Minneapolis may be where we've seen one of the largest ICE deployments in the country, but it will not be the last if we fail to act,” Frey said in the statement. “I'm going to Washington to make the case for ending this strategy and replacing it with approaches that build trust, improve safety, and put our residents first.”

“I'm staying until the problem's gone,” Homan said.

He said he's made some progress while meeting with elected officials and law enforcement leaders across the city and state, seeking common ground. 

More agreements are now in place between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local jails to hand over immigrants in their custody, and he said this means fewer officers will be needed in the streets, which in turn will allow the Trump administration to draw down staff.

Homan also seemed to suggest a renewed focus on what Immigration and Customs Enforcement calls “targeted operations” designed to focus their arrest efforts on apprehending immigrants who've committed crimes.

Homan said they would conduct “targeted strategic enforcement operations” where they would prioritize “public safety threats.”

He also called on local jails to alert immigration enforcement when they have someone in their custody who is an immigrant about to be released, saying that transferring people over to ICE while they're still in jail is safer for the officers and means they aren't out on the streets.

“Give us access to illegal aliens, public safety threats in the safety and security of a jail,” Homan said.

The Trump administration is looking at basing Trump's new international Board of Peace in the Washington building that formerly housed the U.S. Institute of Peace, according to four administration officials.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the subject has been a matter of serious discussion but stressed that a final decision has not yet been made about where the board's administrative staff will be located.

The building is the subject of litigation brought by former USIP employees and executives after the administration seized the facility last year and fired almost its entire staff. The building has since been renamed the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace, but its name and status remains in legal limbo.

Trump unveiled the board last week in Davos, Switzerland, and it currently has 27 “founding members,” whose first task is to oversee the Gaza peace plan.

The judge's temporary restraining order, which aims to prevent federal officers from arresting and detaining resettled refugees in Minnesota, responded to a lawsuit challenging a new Homeland Security operation to to reevaluate the refugee status of nearly 5,600 people.

The order calls for the immediate release of refugees detained in Minnesota and release within five days of those transferred to Texas.

Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's quick social media response: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”

Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz warned the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that it had violated 96 court orders in 74 cases this month.

“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law,” he wrote. “ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

It was Schiltz who ordered ICE's acting director Todd Lyons to personally appear in his courtroom Friday after the agency failed to obey an order to release an Ecuadorian man from detention in Texas. The judge canceled the order after the agency freed the man, but warned ICE that future noncompliance may result in orders requiring the personal appearances of top government officials.

ICE didn't respond to an email seeking comment.

Trump's border czar says the administration is open to a drawdown of agents in Minneapolis but only after he sees cooperation from state officials.

Trump sent Tom Homan to Minneapolis after the shooting of two U.S. citizens by federal immigration officers.

At a Thursday news conference, Homan doubled down on the need for local jails to alert Immigration and Customs Enforcement to people in their custody who ICE can remove from the country. Homan said that means that fewer agents have to actually be out on the streets looking for people.

He acknowledged that immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota haven't been perfect but was adamant that the administration isn't surrendering.

If there's been a soundtrack to life in Minneapolis, it's the shrieking whistles and honking horns of thousands of people following immigration agents across the city. They are the ever-moving shadow of the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge.

They are teachers, scientists and stay-at-home parents. They own small businesses and wait tables. Their network is sprawling, often anonymous and with few overall objectives beyond helping immigrants, warning of approaching agents or filming videos to show the world what is happening.

And it's clear they'll continue despite the White House striking a more conciliatory tone after the killing of Alex Pretti, including the transfer of Gregory Bovino, the senior Border Patrol official who was the public face of the immigration crackdown.

“I don't think the threat that we're under will change because they change out the local puppets,” said Andrew Fahlstrom, who helps run Defend the 612, a hub for volunteer networks.

Sen. Susan Collins said Thursday that immigration officials have ceased their “enhanced operations” in the state after more than 100 arrests in an enforcement surge.

She made the announcement after saying she had several direct communications with Noem.

“There are currently no ongoing or planned large-scale ICE operations here,” Collins said in a statement. “I have been urging Secretary Noem and others in the Administration to get ICE to reconsider its approach to immigration enforcement in the state.”

Collins said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and border patrol officials “will continue their normal operations that have been ongoing here for many years.”

Jeff Landry, Trump's envoy to Greenland, says in a New York Times op-ed that the framework of an agreement on Arctic security that Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte agreed upon last week builds on existing defense agreements between the U.S. and Denmark.

“It would expand America's operational freedom, support new bases and infrastructure, facilitate deployment of advanced missile-defense systems like the Golden Dome and crowd out hostile Chinese and Russian influence,” Landry writes.

U.S., Danish and Greenland officials held their first technical talks on Wednesday aimed at securing an Arctic security deal.

The talks follow Trump's repeated calls for the U.S. to take over Greenland for security reasons.

As a continuation of Trump's pitch to Americans on affordability and the economy under his administration, the U.S. Treasury and White House are celebrating the upcoming launch of a program they view as a key milestone: Trump Accounts.

A provision of Trump's tax legislation, Trump Accounts are meant to give $1,000 to every newborn, so long as their parents open an account. That money is then invested in the stock market by private firms, and the child can access the money when they turn 18.

A U.S. Treasury event brought together an assortment of politicians and celebrities — from Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to rapper Nicki Minaj and NBC's “Shark Tank” judge Kevin O'Leary — to discuss the program and its potential impact on the economy. Backers of Trump Accounts have said they're a way to help children from low-income households build wealth.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.

The man arrested for Tuesday's attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.

“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.”

The attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown.

Omar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Thursday she is running for governor of Minnesota, promising to take on President Donald Trump while unifying a state that has endured a series of challenges even before the federal government's immigration crackdown.

Klobuchar's decision gives Democrats a high-profile candidate and proven statewide winner as their party tries to hold onto the office occupied by Gov. Tim Walz. The 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Walz abandoned his campaign for a third term earlier this month amid criticism over the mismanagement of taxpayer funding for child care programs.

Klobuchar cited Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota, federal officers killing two Minnesotans who protested, the assassination of a state legislative leader and a school shooting that killed multiple children — all within the last year. She avoided direct mention of ongoing fraud investigations into the child care programs that Trump has made a political cudgel.

A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.

The decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.

The 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.

A federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country's TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.

Senate Democrats are threatening to block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies, potentially bringing the government a step closer to a partial shutdown if Republicans and the White House do not agree to new restrictions on President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement.

As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands ahead of a Thursday morning test vote, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest. If those are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown at midnight on Friday.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that Democrats won't provide needed votes until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “reined in and overhauled.”

“The American people support law enforcement, they support border security, they do not support ICE terrorizing our streets and killing American citizens,” Schumer said.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Thursday she is running for governor of Minnesota, promising to take on President Donald Trump while unifying a state that has endured a series of challenges even before the federal government's immigration crackdown. 

Klobuchar's decision gives Democrats a high-profile candidate and proven statewide winner as their party tries to hold onto the office occupied by Gov. Tim Walz. The 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Walz abandoned his campaign for a third term this month amid criticism over mismanagement of taxpayer funding for child care programs. 

“Minnesota, we've been through a lot,” Klobuchar said in a video announcement. “These times call for leaders who can stand up and not be rubber stamps of this administration — but who are also willing to find common ground and fix things in our state.” 

Klobuchar cited Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota, federal officers killing two Minnesotans, the assassination of a state legislative leader and a school shooting that killed multiple children — all within the past year. She avoided direct mention of ongoing fraud investigations into the child care programs that Trump has made a political cudgel. 

“I believe we must stand up for what's right and fix what's wrong,” Klobuchar said. 

Klobuchar becomes the fourth sitting senator to announce plans to run for governor in 2026. The other races are in Alabama, Colorado and Tennessee.




Multiple Minnesota Republicans are campaigning in what could become a marquee contest among 36 governorships on the ballot in November. Among them are MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, a 2020 election denier who is close to Trump; state House Speaker Lisa Demuth; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator who was the party's 2022 gubernatorial candidate; and state Rep. Kristin Robbins. 

The Minnesota contest is likely to test Trump and his fellow Republicans' uncompromising law-and-order approach and mass deportation program against Democrats' criticisms of his administration's tactics. 

Federal agents have detained children and adults who are U.S. citizens, entered homes without warrants and engaged protesters in violent exchanges. Renee Good was shot three times and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in early January. On Saturday, federal officers fatally shot ICU nurse Alex Pretti during an encounter. 

Many Democrats on Capitol Hill, in turn, have voted against spending bills that fund Trump's Department of Homeland Security. A standoff over the funding could lead to a partial government shutdown. 

Trump and other Republicans also will try to saddle Klobuchar — or any other Democrat — with questions about the federal investigation into Minnesota's child care programs and its Somali community. Trump also has made repeated assertions of widespread fraud in state government, and his administration is conducting multiple investigations of state officials, including Walz. The Democrat has maintained that his administration has investigated, reduced and prosecuted fraud. 

Demuth was quick to release a new video and a web page that illustrate what's likely to be another main line of her campaign: that Klobuchar cannot be trusted to end the fraud in public programs or curb the growth of government. “Minnesotans only need to look at her record to know that she simply cannot deliver the change that our state needs, and would be nothing more than a third term of Tim Walz,” Demuth said in a statement.

Now in her fourth Senate term, Klobuchar is a former local prosecutor and onetime presidential candidate who positions herself as a moderate and has demonstrated the ability to win across Minnesota. 

She won her 2024 reelection bid by nearly 16 percentage points and received 135,000 more votes than Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Harris outpaced Trump by fewer than 5 percentage points.

Klobuchar gained attention during Trump's first term for her questioning of his judicial nominees, including now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. At Kavanaugh's acrimonious confirmation hearings, she asked the future justice, who had been accused of sexual assault as a teenager, if he ever had so much to drink that he didn't remember what happened. Kavanaugh retorted, “Have you?” 

The senator, who had talked publicly of her father's alcoholism, continued her questioning. Kavanaugh, who was confirmed by a single vote, later apologized to Klobuchar. 

After Trump's first presidency, Klobuchar was among the most outspoken lawmakers during bipartisan congressional inquiries of the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol during certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election. As Senate Rules Committee chair, she pressed Capitol Police, administration officials and others for details of what authorities knew beforehand and how rioters breached the Capitol. 

“It's our duty to have immediate responses to what happened,” she said after helping write a report focused not on Trump's role but on better security protocols for the seat of Congress. 

Klobuchar sought the presidential nomination in 2020, running as a moderate in the same political lane as Biden. She launched her campaign standing outside in a Minnesota snowstorm to promote her “grit” and Midwestern sensibilities that have anchored her political identity. 

As a candidate, Klobuchar faced stories of disgruntled Senate staffers who described her as a difficult boss but also distinguished herself on crowded debate stages as a determined pragmatist. She outlasted several better-funded candidates and ran ahead of Biden in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. But Biden, then a former vice president, trounced her and others in the South Carolina primaries, prompting her to drop out and join others in closing ranks behind him.

After Biden's victory, Klobuchar would have been well-positioned for a Cabinet post, perhaps even attorney general. But the Senate's 50-50 split made it untenable for Biden to create any opening for Republicans to regain control of the chamber.

Klobuchar announced in 2021 that she had been treated for breast cancer and in 2024 announced that she was cancer-free but undergoing another round of radiation.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi dispatched 500 National Guard troops to clear roads blocked by fallen trees and Tennessee had nearly 1,000 linemen scrambling to restore power to thousands of Nashville homes as the Southern states raced to recover from a crippling winter storm before another blast of dangerous cold hits Friday.

The National Weather Service said arctic air moving into the Southeast will cause already frigid temperatures to plunge into the teens Friday night in cities like Nashville, where more than 90,000 homes and businesses still had no electricity five days after a massive storm dumped snow and ice across the eastern U.S. 

At least 80 people have died in areas afflicted with bitter cold from Texas to New Jersey. 

The extended deep freeze has left some people increasingly desperate in a region unaccustomed to and ill-equipped for such cold. Emergency dispatchers in Mississippi were getting calls from people running out of food and medications while stuck at home. Tennessee had troopers making welfare checks on residents who hadn't been heard from in days.

The situation in hard-hit northern Mississippi was “life-or-death,” said Jamie Parttridge, a longtime resident of Batesville, where residents shivered in line outside a Walmart store waiting for a turn to buy supplies.

More than 300,000 U.S. homes and businesses had no electricity Wednesday, according to the outage tracking website poweroutage.us. The vast majority were in Mississippi and Tennessee, with roughly 100,000 each.




Nashville Electric Service said in a social media post Thursday that it had 963 linemen working on repairs after the storm snapped hundreds of power poles in the Nashville area. A utility vice president, Brent Baker, said Wednesday crews would need the weekend, or longer, before all customers could be restored.

Interstates 55 and 22 were closed in northern Mississippi after emergency crews with tow trucks and snowplows removed gridlocked vehicles stuck on the icy roads. Gov. Tate Reeves said road crews would continue to work Thursday toward reopening the major highways. 

Reeves said he had mobilized 500 National Guard troops to clear trees and other debris still blocking roads.

Mississippi officials say it's the state's worst winter storm since 1994. About 60 warming centers were opened across the state, known as one of the nation's poorest. But for some communities, they weren't enough.

Hal Ferrell, mayor of Batesville, said Wednesday that no one in the city has power and, with roads still slippery with ice, it's too soon to begin recovery efforts.

“We're at a real mess and warming centers just don't exist for 7,500 people,” Ferrell said.

Forecasters say the subfreezing weather will persist in the eastern U.S. into February and there's high chance of heavy snow in the Carolinas, Virginia and northeast Georgia this weekend. Snowfall is also possible along the East Coast from Maryland to Maine. 

There was a slight chance of freezing rain Thursday night in some-hard areas of Mississippi and a limited possibility of snow showers in Nashville overnight Friday, according to the National Weather Service. But forecasters said the biggest threat was the dangerous cold, with sub-zero wind chills possible in parts of South deal with widespread power outages. 

Officials at the University of Mississippi in snow-covered Oxford opted to cancel classes and campus activities for a second week, with plans to to reopen Feb 9.

Though power had been restored to the campus, workers were still removing limbs dangling from trees, university officials said in statement Wednesday night.

Erik Lipsett in Benton County, Mississippi, spent the last several days scooping ice from the front yard so he can melt it to flush down his toilets. The area has been without water and power since the weekend. 

On Wednesday morning, he lined up at a nearby gas station to shower and said that propane bottles, canisters and hookups for heaters are hard to come by.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies Thursday as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. 

Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday. But Trump said just ahead of the vote that “we don't want a shutdown” and the two sides were discussing a possible agreement to separate homeland security funding from the rest of the legislation and fund it for a short time. 

As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands on Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest. If those are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown. 

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said that Democrats won't provide needed votes until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “reined in and overhauled” and that this is “a moment of truth.” 

“The American people support law enforcement. They support border security. They do not support ICE terrorizing our streets and killing American citizens,” Schumer said. 




Schumer has pushed Republicans and the White House to strip the Homeland Security funding from the rest of the bill, which includes money for the Defense Department and other agencies. In the deal under discussion, Homeland Security would still be funded but for a short time to allow for negotiations on the Democrats' demands. Other agencies included in the bill would be funded through the end of September. 

Still, with no agreement and an uncertain path ahead, the standoff threatened to plunge the country into another shutdown just two months after Democrats blocked a spending bill over expiring federal health care subsidies, a dispute that closed the government for 43 days as Republicans refused to negotiate. 

That shutdown ended when a small group of moderate Democrats broke away to strike a deal with Republicans, but Democrats are more unified this time after the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., encouraged Democrats and the White House to talk and find agreement.

“We're getting closer,” the GOP leader said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. 

Kicking off a Cabinet meeting, Trump said his administration is speaking with congressional Democrats. 

“We're working on that right now,” Trump said while declining to go into specifics. He added: “We don't want a shutdown.”

There's a lot of “unanimity and shared purpose” within the Democratic caucus, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith said after a lunch meeting Wednesday. 

“Boil it all down, what we are talking about is that these lawless ICE agents should be following the same rules that your local police department does,” Smith said. “There has to be accountability.”

Earlier Thursday, Tom Homan, the president's border czar, said during a press conference in Minneapolis that federal immigration officials are working on a plan to begin drawing down the number of agents in Minnesota but that it would depend on cooperation from state authorities. 

It's unclear how far those assurances will go in satisfying Democrats. Amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, Schumer said Democrats are asking the White House to “end roving patrols” in cities and coordinate with local law enforcement on immigration arrests, including requiring tighter rules for warrants. 

Democrats also want an enforceable code of conduct so agents are held accountable when they violate rules. Schumer said agents should be required to have “masks off, body cameras on” and carry proper identification, as is common practice in most law enforcement agencies. 

The Democratic caucus is united in those “common sense reforms” and the burden is on Republicans to accept them, Schumer said, as he has pushed for the Homeland Security spending to be separated out to avoid a broader shutdown. 

As the two sides negotiated, it was unclear whether they could agree on anything that would satisfy Democrats who want Trump's aggressive crackdown to end. 

As the negotiations continued, it was unclear whether all Democrats would agree to a temporary extension of the funding. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, has said that Congress should not send “another penny” to ICE until Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is fired. 

And across the Capitol, House Republicans have said they do not want any changes to the bill they passed last week. In a letter to Trump on Tuesday, the conservative House Freedom Caucus wrote that its members stand with the Republican president and ICE.

“The package will not come back through the House without funding for the Department of Homeland Security,” according to the letter. 

Just ahead of the Senate vote, Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for Democrats to vote to move forward on the bill so they could negotiate the changes ahead of final passage. 

“This morning's vote is about taking the first step, not the final step,” Collins said. 

Several Republican senators have said they would be fine with Democrats' request to separate the Homeland Security funds for further debate and pass the other bills in the package. But it might be more difficult for Democrats to find broad GOP support for their demands on ICE.

North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he is opposed to the Democrats' proposal to require the immigration enforcement officers to show their faces, even as he blamed Noem for decisions that he said are “tarnishing” the agency's reputation.

 “You know, there's a lot of vicious people out there, and they'll take a picture of your face, and the next thing you know, your children or your wife or your husband are being threatened at home,” Tillis said. “And that's just the reality of the world that we're in.” 

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham posted on X that he was putting his Senate colleagues “on notice” that if Democrats try to make changes, he would insist on new language preventing local governments from resisting the Trump administration's immigration policies. 

Democrats say they won't back down. 

“It is truly a moral moment,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “I think we need to take a stand.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — If there's been a soundtrack to life in Minneapolis in recent weeks, it's the shrieking whistles and honking horns of thousands of people following immigration agents across the city. 

They are the ever-moving shadow of the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge.

They are teachers, scientists and stay-at-home parents. They own small businesses and wait tables. Their network is sprawling, often anonymous and with few overall objectives beyond helping immigrants, warning of approaching agents or filming videos to show the world what is happening. 

And it's clear they will continue despite the White House striking a more conciliatory tone after the weekend killing of Alex Pretti, including the transfer of Gregory Bovino, the senior Border Patrol official who was the public face of the immigration crackdown. 

“I think that everyone slept a little better knowing that Bovino had been kicked out of Minneapolis,” said Andrew Fahlstrom, who helps run Defend the 612, a hub for volunteer networks. “But I don't think the threat that we're under will change because they change out the local puppets.”




What started with scattered arrests in December ramped up dramatically in early January, when a top ICE official announced the “largest immigration operation ever.”

Masked, heavily armed agents traveling in convoys of unmarked SUVs became commonplace in some neighborhoods. By this week, more than 3,400 people had been arrested, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At least 2,000 ICE officers and 1,000 Border Patrol officers were on the ground.

Administration officials insist they are focusing on criminals in the U.S. illegally, but the reality in the streets has been far more aggressive. Agents have stopped people, seemingly randomly, to demand citizenship papers, including off-duty Latino and Black police officers and city workers, area officials say. 

They smashed through the front door of a Liberian man and detained him without a proper warrant, even though he'd been checking in regularly with immigration officials. They have detained children along with their parents and used tear gas outside a high school in an altercation with protesters after detaining someone. 

To be sure, federal agents are barely a presence in many areas, and most people have never smelled a whiff of tear gas. But the crackdown rippled quickly through immigrant-heavy neighborhoods. Patients are avoiding life-saving medical care, doctors said. Thousands of immigrant children are staying home. Immigrant businesses shut down, cut their hours or kept their doors locked to everyone but regular customers. 

Activist groups rapidly organized across deeply liberal Minneapolis-St. Paul and some suburbs. Small armies of volunteers began making food deliveries to immigrants afraid to leave their homes. They drove people to work and stood watch outside schools.

They also created interlocking webs of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of rapid response networks — sophisticated systems involving thousands of volunteers who track immigration agents, communicating with encrypted apps like Signal. 

Tracking often means little more than quietly reporting the movement of convoys to dispatchers and recording the license plates of possible federal vehicles. 

But it's not always quiet. Protester caravans regularly form behind immigration convoys, creating mobile protests of anger and warning that weave through city streets.

When agents stop to arrest or question someone, the networks signal the location, summoning more people who sound warnings with whistles and honking, film what's happening and call out legal advice to people being detained. 

Sometimes it all can feel performative, whether it's Bovino in body armor tossing a smoke grenade, or young activists who rarely take off their helmets and gas masks, even when law enforcement is nowhere to be seen.

But crowds often lead to real confrontations, with protesters screaming at immigration agents. Agents respond only sometimes, but when they do it's often with punches, pepper spray, tear gas and arrests.

Those confrontations worry some in the activist world.

Take the recent afternoon in south Minneapolis, where dozens of protesters, some in gas masks, clashed with immigration agents in south Minneapolis. Protesters screamed at agents, threw snowballs and tried to block their vehicles. Agents responded by shoving protesters who got too close, firing pepper balls and finally throwing tear gas grenades and driving away. Demonstrators without masks wretched in the streets as volunteers handed out bottles of water to flush their eyes. 

By then, even many of the people in the protest weren't sure what started it, including the city council member who soon arrived. 

Minneapolis has a long tradition of progressivism, and Jason Chavez is a proud part of that. 

He bristled when asked about the confrontation.

“I didn't see anybody ‘confronting,'” said Chavez. “I saw people alerting neighbors that ICE was in their neighborhood. And that's what neighbors should continue to do.”

To understand this world, talk to a woman known in the rapid response networks only by her nickname, Sunshine. She asked that her real name not be used, fearing retaliation.

A friendly woman who works in health care, she has spent hundreds of hours in her slightly beat-up Subaru patrolling an immigrant St. Paul enclave of taquerias and Asian grocery stores, watching for signs of federal agents. She can spot an idling SUV from the tiniest hint of exhaust, an out-of-state license plate from a block away, and quickly distinguish an undercover St. Paul police car from an unmarked immigration vehicle. 

On the messaging apps, she's simply Sunshine. She knows the real names of few other people, even after working with some for weeks on end.

She hates what is happening, and feels deeply for people living in fear. She worries the Trump administration wants to push the nation into civil war, and believes she has no choice except to patrol — “commuting” it's often called, half-jokingly — every day.

“Sometimes people just want to pick up their kid and walk their dog and go to work. And I get that. I get that desire,” she said while driving through the neighborhood last week. “I just don't know if that's the world we live in anymore.”

She runs constant equations in her head: Should she report an immigration vehicle to the network's dispatcher, or honk her horn as a warning? Would honking unnecessarily scare residents who are already afraid? Are agents leading her around? Are federal vehicles moving to launch a raid, or are they distracting observers while other agents make arrests elsewhere? 

She is careful and avoids confrontation. She also finds hope in the community that has been created, and how offers to volunteer exploded after the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent. And she understands the anger of the people who face off against agents. 

“My strategy, my approach, my risk calculation is different than other peoples'. And at the same time, the vitriol, the frustration, I get it,” she said. “And sometimes it feels good to see someone unleash that.”

Not everyone agrees. Even nationally, some activist groups have pushed back against protest strategies that could lead to clashes.

“Loud does not equal effective,” a group in a heavily immigrant Maryland county said in a recent social media post, explaining why their volunteers don't use whistles. Among other things, the Montgomery County Immigrant Rights Collective warned that whistling can “escalate already volatile ICE agents who don't respect our rights” and “increase the likelihood of aggression toward bystanders or the detained person.” 

“This is not an action movie,” the post says. “You are not in a one-on-one fight with ICE.”

Former presidential speechwriter Bill McGurn analyzes President Donald Trump's speech in Iowa and the messaging heading into the midterm elections on 'Fox & Friends.'

House Republicans are rolling out a massive election overhaul package ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, including new voter ID requirements as well as limitations on how and when votes are cast.

The Committee on House Administration is unveiling new legislation on Thursday called the Make Elections Great Again (MEGA) Act, which would impose new federal standards on national elections across the U.S.

The sprawling bill includes key portions of the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a measure that was led by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, in the House. It comes as the Senate sees a renewed pressure campaign led by Elon Musk and others to take up that legislation.

""Americans should be confident their elections are being run with integrity — including commonsense voter ID requirements, clean voter rolls, and citizenship verification,"" Committee on House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said in a statement.

He said the bill's guardrails ""will improve voter confidence, bolster election integrity, and make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat.""

Like the SAVE Act, the legislation would include mandatory proof of citizenship when a person registers to vote for the first time. 

Casting a ballot in federal elections would also require a photo ID. Progressive Democrats and groups like the League of Women Voters have argued that photo ID laws disenfranchise minority voters, while the Heritage Foundation pointed out that it's shown to be popular across multiple public polls.

CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS WIDEN 2026 BATTLEFIELD, ZERO IN ON NEW HOUSE REPUBLICAN TARGETS

Steil's elections bill would also ban ranked-choice voting in federal races, require states to use auditable paper ballots rather than electronic slips, and impose stronger requirements on voter list maintenance to ensure rolls are up to date.

New guardrails on mail-in ballots include a ban on universal mail-in ballots — meaning voters would have to specifically request one to receive it — while also requiring mail-in ballots to be received by Election Day to count and banning ""ballot harvesting"" by third parties aiming to deliver them to poll centers.

The new legislation comes ahead of what's expected to be a difficult midterm election season for Republicans.

Historical trends dictate that the first midterms after power changes hands in Washington normally see that party in power suffer losses, but GOP leaders are publicly optimistic that they can reverse that trend.

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House to ask whether it supports Steil's bill but did not hear back by press time.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy joins 'America's Newsroom' to weigh in after extreme turbulence forced a Delta Airlines flight to divert to Minneapolis and as NTSB hearings begin on the deadly Washington, DC crash from January.

Not all flight routes are created equal when it comes to turbulence.

A recent report from turbulence tracking site Turbli ranked the most turbulence-prone flight routes in the U.S. and around the world in 2025.

The organization analyzed nearly 10,000 flight routes connecting more than 550 of the world's largest airports — using recorded flight tracks and turbulence forecast data, the analysis said.

Turbulence was measured using eddy dissipation rate (EDR), a standard aviation metric that captures how rough the air is during a flight.

Routes were ranked based on their average turbulence levels, with EDR values categorized as light, moderate, moderate-to-severe, severe and extreme.

The higher the average EDR score along a route — the more turbulence passengers are likely to experience, according to the analysis.

Here are the most turbulent routes in North America in 2025, according to the report. 

The roughly 406-mile route recorded the highest average turbulence score in North America at 18.18, placing it in the light turbulence category.

In 2024, this route ranked the highest average turbulence with a score of 17.45, Turbli said.

This route covers roughly 205 miles and recorded an average turbulence score of 17.68, according to the data.

That places it within the light turbulence range based on eddy dissipation rate measurements.

Flights along this roughly 391-mile route drew an average turbulence score of 17.54.

That reading falls within the light turbulence range.

Flights between Bozeman and Denver logged an average turbulence reading of 17.22 over a distance of about 524 miles, placing the route in the light turbulence category.

Outside the U.S., Turbli's rankings showed turbulence was most pronounced on routes in South America and Asia, with several of the bumpiest flights crossing mountainous regions in Chile, Argentina and western China.

Routes in Europe, Oceania and Africa generally recorded lower average turbulence levels, though certain short-haul flights still ranked high within their regions.

While turbulence can feel alarming, the Federal Aviation Administration has noted that it is a normal part of air travel and is often unpredictable, even when skies appear clear.

The FAA advises passengers to keep seat belts fastened whenever they are seated, as most turbulence-related injuries occur when travelers are not buckled in. 

Pilots and airlines also use weather data and forecasting tools to minimize exposure whenever possible.

White House border czar Tom Homan vowed Thursday to remain in Minnesota leading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations there ""until the problem is gone."" 

White House border czar Tom Homan vowed Thursday to remain in Minnesota leading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations there ""until the problem is gone."" 

Homan made the statement during a Thursday morning news conference, his first since President Donald Trump sent him to the Twin Cities earlier this week. He said the administration is working on a ""drawdown plan"" to decrease presence of federal agents in the state.

The border chief said he had a ""very productive"" meeting with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Wednesday. Ellison agreed to notify ICE when local jails were releasing violent illegal aliens, a major request from federal law enforcement.

""One ICE agent can arrest one bad guy when he's behind the safety and security of a jail when he's behind bars and we know he doesn't have weapons,"" Homan said. ""But when you release that public safety threat illegal alien back into the community--We have a job to do. We're going to arrest him, so we're going to find him.""

""President Trump wants this fixed and I'm going to fix it with your help,"" Homan said.

Trump deployed Homan to Minnesota after heated clashes between anti-ICE agitators and federal agents across the Twin Cities. The unrest resulted in the deaths of two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, at the hands of law enforcement.

Members of the Chicago Teachers Union filmed themselves protesting federal immigration enforcement and anti-DEI measures at a local Target on Friday, sparking criticism both online and from experts who spoke to Fox News Digital. 

In a video posted on Tuesday by the union, members can be seen entering a Chicago area Target holding anti-ICE signs, harassing employees and demanding answers about whether Target will ""protect"" its employees from ICE. 

""As a private business, Target has a choice,"" the post said. ""They can use their Fourth Amendment rights and post signs that demand ICE show warrants to enter their building. Instead, they've allowed harm to their employees and customers, while continuing to roll back DEI commitments and bow to pressure from the Trump administration.""

The post resulted in criticism in most of the replies on social media.

""The CTU can't help itself — they feel compelled to weigh in on every political issue,"" Teacher Freedom Alliance posted on X. ""And they bankroll these so-called ‘protests' with your tax dollars.""

Erika Donalds, America First Policy Institute's chair of education opportunity, told Fox News Digital that the statement made by the union ""tells you everything about the goals of today's teachers unions.""

""They're harassing retailers and pushing radical politics instead of doing the job they're paid to do: advocate for the best education for our nation's children. While kids are falling behind in reading and math, union leaders are staging protests over immigration enforcement. They don't speak for teachers, they don't serve students, and at this point they barely even pretend to care about education."" 

Nicole Neily, founder and president of Defending Education, told Fox News Digital the union priorities aren't in line with what's best for students. 

""Union thugs bullying hourly employees in Target stores isn't brave or just — it's naked intimidation of people who are simply trying to earn a paycheck,"" Neily said.

""The Chicago Teachers Union lost the plot a long time ago, and this is yet another example of their skewed priorities. While the CTU clout-chases on X, two-thirds of Chicago Public Schools students can't read at grade level, and four out of five children can't do math at grade level.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the union for comment. 

Earlier this month, CTU faced blowback from the Washington Post for pursuing social justice initiatives in its school district even as student reading and math proficiency continues to decline.

In an editorial, the Post took aim at the CTU's New Year's resolutions posted to X on Monday. The union stated that its resolution is to ""speak truth to power,"" and it committed to ""defending Black and brown and immigrant communities who are targeted by federal agents,"" as well as ""fighting back against an administration trying to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and roll back civil rights protections.""

""Those are lofty goals in a school district that can hardly teach kids to read and write,"" the Post quipped. ""In 2025, 43 percent of Chicago's third through eighth grade students were reading at grade level.""

Newly confirmed DHS Sec. Kristi Noem joins Fox & Friends to discuss her efforts to crackdown on immigration, including the decision to remove the temporary status directive for Venezuelan migrants and the ICE raids in New York City.

A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully when she ended legal protections allowing hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to live and work in the United States.

The decision by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found she exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezuelans under the Biden-era Venezuela TPS designations, according to The Associated Press. All three judges on the panel were nominated by Democratic presidents.

The ruling comes as the Trump administration has argued that TPS for Venezuela created a ""magnet effect"" for illegal migration and undermined border enforcement. TPS shields eligible migrants from deportation and allows them to work legally in the United States while conditions in their home country are deemed unsafe. 

The panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she moved to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.

The judges ruled that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation.

""The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,"" Ninth Circuit Judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.

Wardlaw said Noem's ""unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences"" for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.

""The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,"" she wrote.

The decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.

Fox News Digital contacted DHS for comment.

DHS TERMINATES TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR AROUND 76K HONDURAN, NICARAGUAN MIGRANTS

Noem's termination meant that 268,156 Venezuelan nationals currently in the U.S. lost their status and were no longer legally allowed to reside in the United States, according to figures shared with Fox News Digital from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

The TPS designation expired on Sept. 10, 2025, with termination effective 60 days after the publication of the Federal Register notice. The Federal Register notice set the termination's effective date as Nov. 7, 2025.

In September, 3,738 pending initial applications that were to be eligible for TPS and 102,935 pending renewal applications were also terminated.

""Given Venezuela's substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration's efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital in September.

""Weighing public safety, national security, migration factors, immigration policy, economic considerations, and foreign policy, it's clear that allowing Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is not in America's best interest,"" the spokesperson added.

The agency also announced in November that approximately 353,000 Haitian nationals currently holding TPS will see their protections expire in February.

Ninth Circuit Judge Salvador Mendoza, Jr. wrote separately that there was ""ample evidence of racial and national origin animus"" that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were ""preordained and her reasoning pretextual.""

""It is clear that the Secretary's vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration's TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,"" he wrote.

A former county elections official in North Carolina has been indicted on felony charges after authorities say he placed pills into the ice cream cones of two teenage girls.

A grand jury in New Hanover County indicted James Edwin Yokeley Jr., 66, on two counts of unlawful distribution of food or beverage and one count of intentional child abuse involving serious physical injury, according to court records reviewed by WBTV.

According to the Wilmington Police Department (WPD), authorities allege that the grandfather placed pills into his 16-year-old step-granddaughter and her 15-year-old friend's Dairy Queen ice cream cones in August 2025.

According to WECT, in a preliminary test, the pills tested positive for the psychedelic drug MDMA and cocaine.

According to the local outlet, the teens had not ingested the pills and reported the discovery to police after finding the foreign objects in their desserts.

Investigators later reviewed surveillance video and allegedly found Yokeley placing the pills into the ice cream.

Founded in 1940, Dairy Queen is a chain that serves primarily ice cream and related products with over 5,700 locations. (iStock)

Authorities initially charged him with contaminating food or drink with a controlled substance, felony child abuse and drug possession after preliminary testing suggested the pills could contain illegal narcotics.

The charges were dismissed on Dec. 22 after a lab test confirmed that the substance was not controlled under North Carolina General Statutes. Prosecutors later presented the case to a grand jury, resulting in the new indictment.

At the time of his arrest, Yokeley was serving as the chair of the Surry County Board of Elections. He resigned shortly after the allegations became public.

""I have concluded that it's in the best interest of the State Board of Elections and Surry County Board of Elections, regarding my own falsely accused circumstances, to step down at this time,"" Yokeley wrote in the letter.

His next court appearance had not been scheduled. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Hanover Police Department for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","ICE officers receive new directive not to engage with ‘agitators' in Minnesota","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/4438539/ice-officers-new-directive-not-engage-with-agitators/","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:54:03 GMT","

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were given two new critical directives on Wednesday that will change how they conduct operations in Minnesota. 

The new orders instruct ICE officers to focus only on arresting illegal immigrants who have criminal charges or convictions. The updated information came in an email from Marcos Charles, the chief of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division, Reuters reported.

“We are moving to targeted enforcement of aliens with a criminal history,” read the new directive. “This includes arrests, not just convictions. ALL ‍TARGETS MUST HAVE ⁠A CRIMINAL NEXUS.”

The policy change comes after a tumultuous month in Minnesota in which two civilians, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were shot and killed while confronting ICE officers engaged in illegal immigration enforcement operations. Charles's email also advised officers not to engage with protesters, demonstrators, or anyone antagonizing officers.

“DO NOT COMMUNICATE OR ENGAGE WITH AGITATORS,” officers were advised in an email, Reuters reported. “It serves no purpose ‌other than inflaming the situation. No one is going to convince the other. The only communication should be the officers issuing commands.”

As part of the operational pivot, ICE officers will be supplied with megaphones to communicate loudly and clearly during their operations. Officers will use them to issue commands to protesters, demonstrators, and others in public, while ensuring they “verbalize every step of the arrest process.”

The new directive is the latest change the Trump administration has implemented this week after Pretti's death on Saturday. The most significant change so far has been the appointment of border czar Tom Homan as a de facto replacement in Minnesota for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Commander-at-Large of the Border Patrol Gregory Bovino. 

Homan met with Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday and posted on social media that it was a “productive” meeting. Homan is scheduled to hold a press conference on Thursday morning, during which he is expected to announce some of the changes being implemented in Minnesota.

DEMOCRATS DRAW RED LINE ON NEW ICE GUARDRAILS: ‘FIX SHOULD COME FROM CONGRESS'

ICE and other law enforcement officers have come under significant scrutiny in Minnesota after the deaths of Good and Pretti. Democrats have criticized the officers' tactics and strategies, categorizing them as dangerous and far too aggressive. However, large groups of protesters have targeted ICE operations throughout the country even before the incidents in Minnesota, beginning after President Donald Trump ordered illegal immigration enforcement operations to commence. 

On multiple occasions, protests have turned violent with participants trying to harm ICE officers in a variety of ways, including throwing Molotov cocktails at officers, weaponizing automobiles to target ICE officers, and a sniper trying to shoot officers at a detention facility. ICE officers have endured an “8,000% increase in death threats against them and a more than 1,300% increase in assaults against them,” said the Department of Homeland Security.

Gov. Jeff Landry (R-LA), U.S. special envoy to Greenland, divulged some new details on Thursday about the deal that brought the United States and Europe from the brink of hostilities.

After a week of European fears that the trans-Atlantic alliance could permanently split, President Donald Trump backed down from his demands to annex Greenland, instead touting a new deal. The exact details of the deal still haven't been divulged, in Landry's op-ed for the New York Times and elsewhere. However, the special envoy did give a general outline and explain how it would benefit the U.S.

“I cannot divulge the details, as they are being worked out, but the framework builds on the 1941 and 1951 defense agreements between the United States and Denmark and would enhance American, NATO and Greenlandic security and reaffirm longstanding trans-Atlantic defense obligations,” he wrote.

The new deal would expand the U.S.'s “operational freedom, support new bases and infrastructure, facilitate deployment of advanced missile-defense systems like the Golden Dome and crowd out hostile Chinese and Russian influence,” he added. 

“These measures are not provocative — they are preventive,” Landry stressed, cognizant of the controversy surrounding the island.

In Landry's telling, the core purpose of the deal is to signal that it will no longer outsource key national security needs to other parties.

“The era when the Arctic could be treated as remote, static, or secondary has passed. President Trump's Greenland agreement confronts this reality directly. The president has been unequivocal: American dominance in the Arctic is nonnegotiable,” he wrote, adding that the deal “signals to allies and adversaries alike that the United States will not outsource its security responsibilities or retreat from critical terrain.”

Though still vague, Landry's comments offer new hints as to what exactly was struck in the framework of a deal that Trump touted as a success at Davos, Switzerland.

TRUMP'S GREENLAND BID DRAWS FOCUS TO RARE EARTHS MINING POSSIBILITIES

On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was similarly cagey on exact details, but promised that the new framework was much more favorable than the 1951 deal Denmark struck with the U.S. over the island.

“I promise you, the deal is not what we had before. It is much more fulsome for the United States.” Bessent said in an interview with ABC News's This Week.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

MINNEAPOLIS — The top White House official handling negotiations with Minnesota officials about Immigration and Customs Enforcement‘s presence in the state said “great progress” has been made during talks this week, and federal agencies are now working on a “drawdown” plan.

“I have staff from CBP and from ICE working on a drawdown plan,” White House border czar Tom Homan said during a press conference on Thursday. Still, he committed to staying in town until the city, state, and federal government agree on how to move forward following the deaths of two U.S. citizens who protested and interfered in ICE operations.

“This is common sense cooperation that allows us to draw down the number of people we have here,” Homan said. “Yes, I said it. Draw down the number of people here.”

Homan has met with Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and state Attorney General Keith Ellison to discuss how to de-escalate the situation in the state.

“What we did agree about is not to release public safety risks back in the community,” Homan said of the conversations he had with local leaders. “I'm staying 'till the problem's solved.”

Homan touted that the state prison system under the Department of Corrections has been honoring ICE requests to detain illegal immigrants in custody for them to be transferred in a secure jail setting rather than allowed to be released.

“The Minnesota state prison system, under the Department of Corrections, has been honoring ICE detainers, and we appreciate that important collaboration, and we're going to expand upon that,” Homan said at an early press conference inside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building.

That cooperation, something that sanctuary cities and states have protested for years, has prompted ICE to go into communities to find criminal illegal immigrants following their release from local and state jails and prisons.

Ellison agreed to possibly begin turning over some illegal immigrants in Minnesota jails to ICE, according to Homan.

“[Ellison] has clarified for me that county jails may notify ICE of the release dates of criminal public safety risks so ICE can take custody upon their release from the jail,” Homan said.

Homan arrived in Minneapolis on Monday evening, two days after protester Alex Pretti was killed in a Border Patrol-involved shooting during immigration enforcement actions on Jan. 24.

Since arriving, Homan has met with Walz, Ellison, Frey, police chiefs, and sheriffs. He said he will continue meetings, including with business and religious leaders.

DHS GRAPPLES WITH PR NIGHTMARE AFTER ALEX PRETTI SHOOTING IN MINNEAPOLIS

In the aftermath of Pretti's death, the White House moved swiftly to demote Greg Bovino from his post as the Border Patrol official overseeing operations at large with ICE.

Bovino was replaced by Homan, who will oversee the operations from Washington, but will be in the Midwest this week, meeting with local and state police and elected officials to try to strike a deal about working together to apprehend illegal immigrants with criminal histories.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Officials overseeing Trump's mass-deportation campaign are fighting one another for power.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appeared before a bank of television cameras in Washington, D.C., on Saturday night to blame the man who had been shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis that morning for his own death, claiming without evidence that he had intended “to kill law enforcement” and had been “brandishing” a weapon. Behind her stood the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Rodney Scott, sending a silent message of unity.

But behind the scenes, the senior ranks of the Department of Homeland Security were divided. Until minutes before they walked in front of the cameras, Noem and Scott had not spoken to each other that day, even as Noem took charge of her department's response to the shooting and coordinated with the White House and other officials in Scott's agency, two people familiar with their interactions told us.

Donald Trump has said over the years that he welcomes and even encourages rivalries in his administration, and delights in watching aides compete to please him. But for the past year, the president has allowed a rift to widen within the team tasked with delivering on the mass-deportation plan that is his most important domestic-policy initiative. That has led to months of acrimony and left many veteran officials at DHS—including those who support the president's deportation goals—astonished at the dysfunction.

The president's crackdown has adopted an improvisational approach, not an institutional one, with blurred leadership roles and no clear chain of command. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has been holding daily conference calls pressuring DHS and other federal agencies to prioritize immigration arrests and deportations above all other objectives. Noem and her de facto chief of staff, Corey Lewandowski, who has been working at DHS as a “special government employee,” have aggressively tried to meet Miller's demands and use the department's advertising budgets and social-media accounts to promote anti-immigrant messaging. They have worked around Tom Homan, the White House “border czar,” who has had little role in operations, instead dispatching a second-tier Border Patrol official named Gregory Bovino to sweep through cities led by Democrats. Bovino told his superiors that he reported directly to Noem, not to Scott—who wanted his agents to go back to protecting U.S. borders, and has struggled to maintain control of his own agency.

This story about the infighting around Trump is based on interviews with 12 people familiar with the tensions inside DHS, including senior administration officials, most of whom requested anonymity to speak frankly about internal events. “The President's entire immigration enforcement team are on the same page,” the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote to us in response.

Scott and Homan declined to comment. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, told us that Noem's Saturday comments on the shooting were based on CBP reports “from a very chaotic scene.” McLaughlin added, “We are not going to spend time giving any oxygen to these anonymous accounts.”

When Noem and Scott stepped before the cameras on Saturday, Noem appeared to have the upper hand. But the balance of power has since shifted. Frustrated by the bipartisan backlash to Alex Pretti's death, Trump announced on Monday that Homan would take over the operation in Minnesota. Bovino has been stripped of his “commander” role and sent back to his old job on the border in El Centro, California. Seemingly well aware of the divides around him, Trump announced that he was removing Noem from the chain of command in Minnesota. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump said.

When Homan spoke to reporters today, with Scott standing behind him, he tried striking a conciliatory tone and that he'd arrived to make changes in federal operations. “I didn't come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” he said. Homan urged Minnesota leaders to give ICE more access to detainees in local jails, and said he'd withdraw federal forces if cooperation improves.

Homan and Scott arrived in the state Monday with orders to de-escalate tensions in Minneapolis, which Trump has flooded with 3,000 federal agents—the largest Homeland Security deployment in history. That same day, Noem and Lewandowski were called into the White House for a two-hour meeting with the president and some of his top aides, but not with Miller. The following day, Trump said that he had come to share the concerns of Scott and Homan, saying that it was normal for him to “shake up teams.”

“You know, Bovino is very good, but he's a pretty out-there kind of a guy,” Trump told Fox News. “And in some cases that's good; maybe it wasn't good here.”

But the battle inside the agency continued. Scott sent an email to senior officials at CBP on Monday reminding them that he was in charge of the agency and that they report to him, according to two people familiar with the document. Yesterday, the DHS general counsel James Percival notified CBP employees to disregard the email because it had not gone through legal review, the people told us.

The split between the two factions is not ideological. Homan and Scott are no less hard-line on border and immigration enforcement than Noem and Lewandowski are. Homan—who was an architect of the family-separation policy during Trump's first term—wants to ramp up deportations with more ICE officers, detention capacity, and deportation flights, but without the social-media trolling and the show-me-your-papers approach to fishing for deportees in American cities.

Both men worked their way up through the ranks of their agencies. They represent an institutional wing of MAGA that wants to pursue the president's deportation goals using existing chain-of-command structures and the conventional division of labor, in which the Border Patrol guards the border and ICE handles immigration arrests in U.S. cities, usually aiming to minimize disruption. They also have the backing of many career officials at DHS who told us that they see Noem's approach as ad hoc, performative, and possibly motivated by her own political ambitions, with Lewandowski pulling the strings. At DHS headquarters in southeast Washington, staffers address Lewandowski as “chief” even though he doesn't have an actual title there, three current officials told us.

Allies of Noem, meanwhile, have decided that Homan and Scott are bureaucratic dinosaurs who are unable to achieve the president's objectives. They have tried to satisfy the demands of Miller, who runs immigration policy inside Trump's orbit and functions as the actual “czar” of the president's deportation campaign. Miller has set aggressive benchmarks for using the $170 billion in ICE and CBP funding included in Trump's budget bill last year, telling ICE officials to make 3,000 immigration arrests a day to hit the White House target of 1 million deportations a year. Noem put CBP officials in charge of ICE offices and diverted highly trained investigative agents from trafficking cases and drug cartels to make immigration arrests on city streets.

The killings of Pretti and Renee Good this month have been the two most politically damaging events in a wider, militarized show of force that has turned Trump's best-polling issue into a political liability. Noem has spent more than $200 million on advertising to promote the deportation campaign, but it has instead been defined largely by images of excess: toddlers being taken into custody, U.S. citizens being yanked from their cars, Bovino's masked commandos storming a Chicago apartment building after rappelling from a Black Hawk helicopter.

“Memes don't win the media narrative. Professionalism does,” a veteran official critical of Noem and her team told us. Another former DHS official told us that Trump's mass-deportation goals have been held back in the process. “Look at the whole thing playing out in Minnesota,” the former official said. “A lot of the controversy and negative optics could have been avoided—and are avoided in other locations—if not for Corey and the secretary.”

Allies of Homan and Scott believe that a reckoning may be coming. “Lewandowski messed up by going to war with Rodney Scott and deploying Bovino to the interior,” one senior DHS official told us. “There is no one at DHS with higher credentials than Scott, and sidelining him for petty reasons distracts from POTUS missions.”

Critics of Scott who spoke with us argue that he lacks the focus and drive to achieve the president's priorities, spends too much time in meetings that don't end in decisions, and is failing to do enough to drive the president's top priority of finishing the border wall. They say that he had little involvement in the CBP deployment to Minnesota and other cities, and did not visit the state to meet with commanders on the ground until this week. “He is not a team player,” one Homeland Security official told us of Scott. “I really think Rodney is kind of on an island.”

During the meeting with Trump on Monday, Noem spoke at length about her concerns with the slow pace of border-wall construction, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Since the start of Trump's second term, only about 24 miles of wall have been built, including replacement sections, the person said. Noem has made clear that she holds Scott responsible.

“The president was very focused on the status of the wall,” the official said. “The president is pissed.”

The breakdown that led to this week's shift inside DHS dates back months. Noem lacks the ability to fire Scott, who was confirmed by the Senate, so she has had to get creative. Late last year, her deputies forced Scott to fire several of his senior staff, moves that were recently reported by the Washington Examiner. Scott's chief of staff was then promoted, and Noem's office selected a replacement. After Joseph N. Mazzara, an attorney working in Noem's office, was installed as CBP deputy commissioner, Scott attempted to reclaim control of his agency.

In a memo sent on January 6, described to us by four people familiar with its contents, Scott asked senior leadership at CBP to report to his office any contact they had with “special government employees”—a request that many interpreted as an effort to curtail the influence of Lewandowski. Within hours, the DHS general counsel James Percival had objected to the memo, as had the White House counsel's office. A White House official told us that the involvement of the White House counsel followed a normal practice of engaging with general counsels at government departments on “issues of common concern.”

Despite the pushback, Scott's office issued a second memo later that day to senior CBP officials: They should log any communications with officials outside the agency, including senior DHS and White House officials. Both memos were ultimately rescinded after legal pushback from DHS and the White House counsel, these people told us. Scott's fumbled attempts to curtail outside influence on his agency raised further concerns at DHS headquarters about his leadership. “You don't get to this level where you jump on your horse and play cowboy like that,” one person familiar with the events told us.

Days later, Scott found his credibility publicly under attack. Politico reported that top brass in Noem's office had objected to plans for a $2.1 million office refurbishment at CBP headquarters in Washington. (Renovation questions are known to get the president's attention. Just days earlier, the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a $2.5 billion renovation he was overseeing.) The Office of Management and Budget, in a move that has not been previously reported, began asking CBP about the plans, exploring whether they violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending that contradicts congressional appropriations, according to three people familiar with the outreach.

Read: The wrath of Stephen Miller

On the same day that the Politico article was published, Miller gathered agency leaders at the White House to discuss the administration's success in spending funds appropriated with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Scott told those gathered that starting on February 1, wall construction would speed up dramatically. Others in the department doubt he will be able to achieve his new goals.

A veteran official involved with the border-wall project told us that contracting rules imposed by Lewandowski last summer—which require Noem's signature on any contract or modification exceeding $100,000—have slowed the pace of construction. The funding bill provides nearly $50 billion for the border wall (10 times the amount that triggered a congressional shutdown in late 2018), and the official estimated that more than two-thirds of the contracts are worth $100,000 or more.

Noem's team says that this is false, contending that she quickly approves contracts and that CBP has not yet awarded all of the prime contracts for construction. “None of this is on Noem,” the DHS official told us.

In recent weeks, DHS officials have discussed hiring a management contractor to oversee the planning and construction of the border wall, replacing senior officials at CBP. The idea has faced some resistance because it would echo an effort undertaken by former President George W. Bush in 2006, when his administration hired Boeing, a defense contractor and commercial-airplane manufacturer, to oversee $2.5 billion in spending on border security. By 2010, CBP's inspector general was reporting that the agency had failed to properly manage the contract, which was dogged by missed deadlines and cost overruns.

“Adults have arrived.” That's how one DHS official deployed in Minneapolis described the appearance of Homan and Scott.

Homan began by meeting with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “While we don't agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan announced on social media afterward. Trump officials have been targeting the two men and other Democratic leaders in the state with a criminal investigation and possible obstruction charges. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, accused them of “terrorism” just two weeks ago.

Administration officials insist that the Minneapolis crackdown will continue, but they have started pulling Border Patrol agents out of the city. Homan is trying to compel Democratic leaders to ease local “sanctuary policies” and give ICE more access to local jails and immigrants with criminal records. Walz and other Minnesota leaders want the government to allow the state to conduct an investigation into Pretti's killing.

Bovino's return to his old job on the border leaves the administration without a field commander for the rolling conquest of blue cities that has defined its strategy since May. The White House has not clarified whether that approach will continue or whether Homan will now be in charge of the president's wider removal campaign. But McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, announced that Noem is “very happy” to have Homan take over in Minnesota. “Her portfolio is really huge,” McLaughlin said.

When the 2018 family-separation policy became a political debacle, Trump officials scrambled to distance themselves. The same impulse is again on display. After previously championing Bovino's efforts in Minnesota, Noem's team has this week privately pointed to the arrest quotas pushed by Miller at the White House as a cause of the problems. Miller called Pretti an “assassin” within hours of the shooting. But on Tuesday, he suggested that the failure of the CBP team in Minneapolis to follow White House guidance may have played a role in Pretti's death.

Bovino's Border Patrol agents were sent to U.S. cities in part because ICE didn't have enough deportation officers to meet Miller's goals. But since last summer, Noem has hired 12,000 new officers, agents, and other staff, more than doubling the size of the ICE workforce. Many of those officers are not ready for deployment, but they could hit the streets in full force over the coming months, giving Homan—or whoever is running the deportation campaign—the ability to ramp up ICE arrests in multiple cities at once. Without Bovino in charge, the effort could look very different, and produce even more deportations.

Venezuela's riches were squandered, souring many on national stewardship.

María-Elena Pombo has created “petroleum weavings,” turning threads made from oil into elaborate yarnlike wall hangings. Oil, she told us, has shaped her life. Her father, an oil engineer, met her mother after he moved to Cabimas, an oil town. Because of Venezuela's oil wealth, Pombo, now 37 years old, studied for free at an excellent public university in Caracas.

For decades, all Venezuelans enjoyed the perks of living in a land where oil was a birthright. They could fill their cars for almost nothing. Education and other public services were heavily subsidized as well. Academics might argue over the wisdom of the state's largesse. But people expected, at the very least, affordable gas as a material benefit from the nation's abundance of oil.

President Trump's military intervention in Venezuela this month was, in part, a bid to seize the source of this wealth. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Trump made no secret of his desire to exploit them in what many have criticized as an act of naked imperialism and the theft of Venezuela's economic patrimony: “We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil,” Trump said in an interview after the January 3 attack that captured the strongman President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

Yet many Venezuelans in the country and abroad celebrated the strike. María Corina Machado, the popular leader of the opposition, has welcomed Trump's actions. Last February, Machado was a guest on Donald Trump Jr.'s podcast. When he asked why Americans should care about Venezuela, her first response was: “Oil and gas.” Machado's strategy could appear to have been a devil's bargain—tempting Trump with the prospect of petrodollars in exchange for ousting Maduro, her nemesis. But her feelings reflected something broader, too: Venezuelans who once viewed oil as a source of wealth and pride, a limitless resource that had shaped their identity and set their country apart from its poorer neighbors, have come to view it more as a curse.

Read: The Venezuelan opposition's desperate gamble

Venezuelans in the past two decades have watched as the regime squandered the wealth that oil had created, let the country's oil infrastructure rot, removed gasoline subsidies, and welcomed a bigger hand from Cuba, bartering oil for professionals and intelligence operatives from Havana. Pombo says her generation is the last that benefited from oil. Today, the university where she studied is in such a sorry state that the roof of one of its buildings collapsed. In the former boomtown of Cabimas, in northwestern Venezuela, people grew so desperate that they jury-rigged refineries in their own backyards because gasoline had become so scarce and expensive.

By that measure, ceding the oil industry to the United States at least holds the promise of importing industrial know-how with some financial benefit for the country. A poll by The Economist found that a majority of Venezuelans “somewhat” or “strongly” supported the capture of Maduro and were optimistic about their economic prospects. Fewer than 35 percent thought that the Venezuelan government should continue running Venezuela's oil industry. Or as Sary Levy-Carciente, Machado's economic adviser, put it to us, the Americans will be “better clients.”

At a ranch in Cabimas one day in 1922, local farmers were awoken by a bang followed by a black rain. Workers for Shell, an Anglo-Dutch company, had been poking holes in the ground, looking for oil—and struck it rich. A plume spouted for many days. Some viewed the discovery as a divine gift, while a local priest chastised the explorers for unearthing Satan, saying the blowout was God's punishment. Word traveled northward, and the Rockefellers of Standard Oil and the Mellons of Gulf Oil saw a business opportunity. The episode ushered in more than a half century of relative prosperity.

Even then, some saw signs of trouble. In the 1930s, Arturo Úslar Pietri, an influential intellectual and historian, argued in an essay that the country needed to “sow the oil” by investing oil profits to cultivate other industries. Generation after generation of schoolchildren have heard these words repeated as advice that the country should have followed but didn't. Instead of sowing the oil, Venezuela became dependent on it.

American companies arrived to drill the wells and build the fields. They brought with them country clubs and baseball. The companies made deals with whichever military despot was in power in Caracas, angering young intellectuals such as Rómulo Betancourt, who harbored dreams of a democratic Venezuela. In his writings, he condemned “the aggressive, juvenile impetus of North American capitalism” and advocated for Venezuelans to be the owners of their oil.

Betancourt became president through a coup in 1945, putting him in position to fulfill his goal of a democratic constitution. But he exercised caution over oil. He didn't kick out the Americans but instead persuaded them to pay more. He then used those proceeds to build schools, hospitals, and roads. Starting in 1948, American companies extracted the oil and gave roughly half of the profits to the Venezuelan state, an arrangement known as el fifty-fifty.

Betancourt's stance that Venezuela resented America but needed America is reflected in Miguel Otero Silva's 1961 novel, Oficina No. 1. The story follows pious, rural Venezuelans who leave everything behind to move to a nameless town where newly arrived Americans are extracting oil with little foresight or planning. The Trinidadian driver who takes the Venezuelans to the fields sings a song in English, as if warning about the type of people the Americans are: “After Johnny eats my food, / After Johnny drinks my rhum, / After Johnny wears my clothes, / Johnny comes back and takes my wife.” But the Venezuelans pay him no mind. They moved to a town with no name because that was their best hope.

Yet many Venezuelans idealize this period. The years of el fifty-fifty were some of the most prosperous in Venezuelan history—a time when migrants were eager to come to Venezuela, rather than leave it, as they have in droves more recently. Hundreds of thousands from Europe and elsewhere arrived for the glorious tropical climate, golden Caribbean beaches, and plentiful job opportunities. The possibilities felt limitless. The country built some of the world's most futuristic highways and was early in eradicating malaria. When Christian Dior decided to open his first shop in Latin America, he opened it in Caracas. The Concorde, that majestic superfast airplane, flew in at least once a week. Oil was the draw that brought the world to Venezuela. Even Venezuela's shanties were made with solid construction materials such as brick and concrete, made cheap by a strong bolivar, Venezuela's currency. It was not uncommon to see new cars parked outside. And although the Venezuelan poor could not afford the shopping trips that the country's rich made to Miami, they could go to Margarita—a Venezuelan island famous for its beaches and low tax rates.

By 1976, however, Venezuela's political class had tired of el fifty-fifty. The government seized the assets of American companies and nationalized the oil industry, creating a state-owned giant Petróleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.

For years, the company thrived. José Guerra, a Venezuelan economist, told us that graduates aspired to land PDVSA jobs. (He didn't make the cut as a young man, and had to settle for a job at the central bank.) The government funded scholarships so that the best and brightest could study abroad and become PDVSA engineers and managers. For Luis Soler, who worked at PDVSA for 30 years, the company represented a certain idea of meritocracy. It had an American-style work environment complete with 9-to-5 workdays and a corporate ladder for promotion. “We had discipline, values,” he said.

By the 1990s, PDVSA had become one of the largest and most influential state-owned oil companies in the world, second only to Aramco, its Saudi counterpart. Venezuelan leaders proved to themselves that they could competently manage the country's oil.

Yet as Pietri had predicted more than a half century before, the country had failed to spread the wealth sufficiently to bolster other industries. “We just traded it! We traded it, and for what? Cars from the United States, whiskey from Scotland, fabrics from Italy, perfumes from France,” Rafael Quiroz, an oil economist at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, told us. “And as time passed, we didn't build anything. We didn't use the oil to make an economy.”

Those outside the circle of PDVSA profits grew resentful. Seeds had been sown, but not for broad economic growth, as Pietri had once hoped, but for revolution.

The socialist Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999 and managed PDVSA for priorities other than maximum profits. He replaced thousands of highly trained company employees with party loyalists. And for the first decade of the 21st century, the state used oil as a tool of diplomacy, with Chávez lavishing petrodollars on tiny island nations whose votes he courted in the Organization of American States, a regional diplomatic forum. Venezuela replaced Russia as Cuba's main oil supplier, a favor that Cuban President Fidel Castro returned by becoming Chávez's mentor on authoritarianism. The consequences of the mismanagement were profound. A country that fully depended on oil became ill-equipped to produce it. After the oil boom, Venezuela somehow ended up poorer, beset by corruption and hyperinflation.

When Chávez died, in 2013, Maduro inherited a failing oil industry and did little to improve it. By 2020, Venezuela's refineries had crumbled to the point that the country had to start importing gasoline from Iran. Even during the worst years of a humanitarian crisis, Maduro continued supplying his friends in the Cuban government with oil. (In January, the U.S. assault to capture Maduro killed 32 Cuban officers on the president's security detail.) Venezuela now produces only about 1 percent of the oil in the world, a mere 1 million barrels a day.

Read: The global oil market is based on a fiction

The perception that Maduro gave away oil to keep himself in power has made some Venezuelans more comfortable with the idea of giving oil to America, the country that got rid of the strongman. “Venezuela is going from having a government controlled by Cuba to having a government controlled by the United States,” the historian Pedro Benítez told us, adding that the U.S. can help with the huge investments needed to revive the oil industry.

The rise of Machado is its own testament to changing attitudes about oil. Of all the opposition leaders, Machado has spoken most consistently in favor of privatization and foreign investment. For a long time, these preferences made her relatively unpopular. But in recent years, her views have spread widely. Many Venezuelans would have liked to see Machado replace Maduro as part of a transition back to democratic government. But so far, the Trump administration has shown little interest in that, preferring instead to work with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's vice president, and the rest of the regime. Like Betancourt, she portrays the United States as an unwelcome imperial power: “Enough of Washington's orders to Venezuelan politicians,” she said on Sunday. But when it comes to oil, she's ready to deal. In a speech before legislators this month, she said that she would proceed with an “agenda of cooperation” nonetheless. “Let's not be afraid of contradictions,” she said.

American companies are poised to develop Venezuela's oil industry anew. Trump said this month that Venezuela would provide 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and that the sale of this oil would “benefit the people” of both nations. Rodríguez said that Venezuela had received $300 million from the sale, the first payments from those barrels. She celebrated the country's much-needed share of the revenue.

Trump sees a fresh era of American investment from the oil giants of today. He recently hosted the chief executives from the major U.S. oil firms at the White House to pitch them on the prospect. But the challenges are legion, including the need for political stability in both Venezuela and the U.S. There are no guarantees that a new American administration would take the same tack as Trump. And although working with the regime has brought its country near-term calm—Venezuela is secured right now by pro-government militias—the Trump administration has spoken about an eventual political transition. This leaves Caracas in a governing limbo and U.S. companies wary. Only a stable government can provide sufficient security for the companies to commit to long-term investments.

Over time, the key power brokers in Venezuela may splinter over their new fifty-fifty-style deal with the U.S. “The current arrangement is unlikely to be convenient at the same time for all of them. One of them or some of them will try to change it,” Jana Nelson, a top Pentagon official on Western Hemisphere affairs during the Biden administration, told us.

Even so, many in Venezuela seem guardedly optimistic. Guerra, the former central-bank official, used to be critical of the opposition for courting a U.S. intervention, but he's now bullish about the economy. He envisions the U.S. government placing conditions on how the regime can spend future oil revenues to make sure the nation's natural wealth is used to revive Venezuela.

We pointed out that this scenario rests on the assumption that Trump cares about the fate of Venezuela and its people. “Well, we cannot assume anything else,” Guerra told us. The Venezuelan people, he added, are “just onlookers, not actors. We are just looking at what's happening, hoping for the best. We don't get to determine anything.”

Go to a small liberal-arts college if you can.

In the waning heat of last summer, freshly back in my office at a major research university, I found myself considering the higher-education hellscape that had lately descended upon the nation. I'd spent months reporting on the Trump administration's attacks on universities for The Atlantic, speaking with dozens of administrators, faculty, and students about the billions of dollars in cuts to public funding for research and the resulting collapse of “college life.”At the same time, I'd been chronicling the spread of AI-powered chatbots that have already changed undergraduates forever.

Initially, I surveyed the situation from the safe distance of a journalist who happens to also be a career professor and university administrator. I saw myself as an envoy between America's college campuses and its citizens, telling the stories of the people whose lives had been shattered by these transformations. By the summer, though, that safe distance had collapsed back on me. The wave of campus crises was causing immediate effects in my own academic life. People I knew were losing their jobs. Yearslong projects were stranded. I heard from students cheating their way through every class with AI, and from faculty following suit. I watched professors lash out at other disciplines with misplaced blame. I listened to friends discuss whether they should send their kids to school abroad. I had personally devoted 25 years to higher education. Now it felt like the whole idea of the university might be ending.

Sitting in my office, I began searching for some cause for hope, some reason to believe that higher ed could stanch the damage for the next generation of students. It occurred to me that I'd been hearing less despair from colleagues at certain smaller schools that offer undergraduate study in the “liberal-arts tradition,” a broad and flexible approach to education that values developing the person over professional training. I wondered if these schools—especially the wealthy ones that cluster near the top of national rankings—might enjoy some natural insulation from the fires raging through the nation's research universities.

I texted, emailed, telephoned, and Zoomed with friends in higher-education leadership. Current and former heads of both research universities and liberal-arts colleges confirmed my intuition: Well-resourced and prestigious small colleges are less exposed in almost every way to the crises that higher ed faces.

To dig deeper, I decided to embark on a fact-finding mission in the guise of a traditional college tour. In November, I went to visit four elite liberal-arts colleges—Amherst, Davidson, Smith, and Vassar—where I joined prospective students and their parents for their campus tours, sat in on classes, and spoke with undergraduates, professors, and administrators. Might schools such as these emerge as the accidental winners of the war on universities?

I came to Amherst College too late in the autumn to observe peak foliage, but amber and ochre remnants still spread across the Pioneer Valley in western Massachusetts. This is the scene Emily Dickinson, a local resident, would have taken in before composing the lines, “The maple wears a gayer scarf, / The field a scarlet gown.”

My tour began at the Colonial Revival residence that serves as the school's admissions office, but we soon arrived in the new science building, a modern structure with oddball green furnishings. Nate Scharf, our sophomore guide, sat us down and gestured toward a small classroom where he had taken a psychology class. At a typical research university, an undergraduate course like this would meet inside a lecture hall, perhaps with separate breakout sections for discussion led by graduate students. But neither Scharf nor any of his classmates had ever been exposed to this scenario—because Amherst, like most liberal-arts colleges, has no graduate students.

No graduate students: The American public may not fully grasp the implications of this statement. At a university, grad students may end up leading class discussions, but that's only part of the story. Their presence on a campus telegraphs a more important truth: that in terms of mission, teaching undergrads comes second to research.

Read: Grad school is in trouble

And at most universities, grad students play a crucial role within the research system: They perform the frontline work of science. Faculty members get federal grants, which are used to pay for doctoral students, who in turn serve as laboratory staff. Professors' feeling of worth and productivity may be a function of how many doctoral students they advise—because that helps determine how many studies they can carry out, how many papers they can publish, and what sorts of new grants they can win to keep the process going. This endless competition is a major feature of the modern university—whether it's an elite private school (such as Princeton or Duke), a public flagship (such as the University of Michigan or UC Berkeley), or a land-grant institution (such as Texas A&M or Virginia Tech).

A school like Amherst, though, which has no doctoral programs whatsoever, is free of the rat race of research productivity and expenditure. As these colleges like to point out, that's good for undergrads, because faculty must focus on education. The lack of doctoral research programs also makes the schools more resilient to bullying from Washington. In 2025, the Trump administration made a point of suspending hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants to Columbia, Harvard, Northwestern, and other schools. It also threatened to impose a tighter limit on what are called “indirect costs”—the portion of each grant that covers all the broader costs of running a large enterprise for research. With so much funding endangered all at once, targeted universities had little choice but to negotiate—which is to say, to accede to some portion of the Trump administration's demands.

At Amherst, this level of pressure simply couldn't be applied. In 2024, the college took in around $3 million from all of its federal research grants put together. (For comparison: Washington University in St. Louis, where I teach, received $731 million that year from the National Institutes of Health alone.) Christopher Durr, an associate professor of chemistry, told me that his research is “designed to be done mostly in-house,” by which he means without external funding, and with the help of undergraduates. He studies biodegradable plastics in a lab that is mostly funded by the college itself, and he gets no research money at all from the federal government. Settling into an Eames-style chair in his office, I asked him what indirect-cost rate Amherst applies to its grants, and he said he didn't know—an innocence that would be unheard of at a research university.

The research that can be done at a small liberal-arts college, with its more modest labs and equipment, is necessarily constrained. Even with Amherst's generosity, Durr said “there's a limit” to how far he can push his research. In truth, the most important scientific and medical discoveries aren't likely to be made at a place like Amherst or Smith, the nearby women's college, which tend to pay their own students to work on faculty research. But this need not be a limitation for undergraduates. The conditions that produce landmark discoveries are not necessarily the same ones that produce a serious education.

Perched along the shores of North Carolina's Lake Norman, in the Charlotte suburbs at the northern edge of Mecklenburg County, Davidson College's location is a crossroads for red and blue America. In the last election, two-thirds of Mecklenburg's voters chose Kamala Harris; just a mile up the road, in Iredell County, two-thirds of voters went for Donald Trump.

Connor Hines, the current student-body president and a senior majoring in political science, is a self-described moderate conservative who grew up in the area. He told me that he chose to come to Davidson in part because its students are able to disagree with one another in thoughtful ways. His good friend Nina Worley, an educational-studies major who was raised in Harlem, said the same. “I knew that to be a good advocate for education policy, I needed to meet a Republican for the first time,” Worley told me. She and Hines do not see eye to eye on everything—the two do not agree, for example, on the policies of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But they said they carry out that disagreement with respect.

Read: The end of college life

According to higher education's many critics on the right, elite universities have tried to stifle disagreement; allegedly they're pushing students into echo chambers instead of broadening their minds. The Trump administration made this accusation central to its war on research universities: With billions of dollars in withheld grants as leverage, it initially pressured nine institutions into signing an agreement, called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” that would commit them to “fostering a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” and protecting conservative viewpoints.

In the meantime, under local pressure, reactionary speech suppression is taking hold at public universities: Many schools, including Auburn and the University of Michigan, have shut down their DEI offices; Texas A&M censored courses based on race and gender content; and Indiana University halted the print edition of the student newspaper, an act its journalists said amounted to censorship. Some private schools, including Columbia, Northwestern, and Cornell, have struck deals to restore funding that variously included provisions regarding civil-rights standards, disciplinary processes, DEI rubrics in admissions and hiring, and policies related to sex and gender identity.

Davidson, which, like Amherst, is far less exposed than research universities to the threat of withheld money, has not been explicitly asked to sign the compact. (Nor have any other liberal-arts schools, including the ones I visited.) Chris Marsicano, an associate professor of education studies who had introduced me to Hines and Worley, told me that the school was way ahead of the national conversation on campus dialogue in any case. In 2019, it created a Deliberative Citizenship Initiative, which runs programming to help students and faculty engage on issues about which disagreement is likely, such as immigration and border control. “We're the hipsters of civil discourse,” Marsicano said. “We were doing it before it was cool.”

Certainly these sorts of efforts can be found at lots of universities: Ohio State has a Civil Discourse for Citizenship initiative, for instance, and WashU has just launched an Ordered Liberty Project, which includes associated coursework on the topic of “disagreement.” But they may be most likely to succeed when they're applied to smaller student bodies, like Davidson's. At lunch in the school's campus commons, I watched President Douglas Hicks greet a dozen students by name. My tour guide explained that students and faculty tend to mingle there; in fact, they can't avoid it, because everyone eats in the same place. Some might find this stifling or claustrophobic, but being forced to live together day by day may also stimulate openness and mutual respect. “You can't hide,” Hicks told me.

At a small liberal-arts college, where a cohort may number fewer than 500 people, admissions officers can also take a stronger hand in assembling a group of students who match the institution's culture and its vibe while also having very different backgrounds. And the fact that almost everyone at a small liberal-arts college tends to live on campus, or very close to it, adds to the sense of intimacy. “It's just much easier for me to get to know faculty here, much easier for me to get to know students, much easier for me to hear what's on their minds,” Amherst's president, Michael Elliott, told me.

One effect of this, he said, is that professors actually show up to faculty meetings to talk about the future of their institution. They participate in budgeting conversations, debate the creation of majors, and approve new courses. This is decidedly not the norm at many larger universities, where professors may not see these meetings as a core part of the job, and where administrators can ignore them altogether. (Last year, Northwestern reached a settlement with the Trump administration despite 98 percent of its voting faculty having recommended otherwise.) Elliott admits that all of this faculty participation can make the college move more slowly in decision making. But done right, faculty governance is a form of healthy campus discourse, too.

Perhaps no threat to higher ed is more acute than the recent, rapid spread of generative AI. “It's just about crushed me,” one college teacher told me in the spring of 2023. “I fell in love with teaching, and I have loved my time in the classroom, but with ChatGPT, everything feels pointless.”

The remarkable test-taking, paper-writing power of AI is hardly under control at liberal-arts colleges such as Amherst or Davidson. But in my conversations with students and faculty, I witnessed a struggle to understand and respond to it with greater earnestness and complexity than I have encountered elsewhere in higher education. In my experience, students and faculty at research universities tend to have a Manichaean view of the technology: Either AI is an existential threat to be cast out, or a vital tool to be embraced as a professional virtue. Little room is left for nuance, which means that little progress can be made on shaping policy.

Davidson prides itself on having an unusually deliberate honor code. (Students I spoke with said this code is taken so seriously that they can leave their belongings anywhere on campus without fear that they will be stolen.) But the seductions of ChatGPT are hard to resist, and Marsicano noted that the college has seen an increase in code violations due to AI. That sounded like less of a problem here than elsewhere, though. If the students are availing themselves of the technology, then at least they appear to be doing so with some reservations.

Hines told me that he uses AI tools, though not for academic work. Worley said she's avoided AI so far, because “I'm still struggling with what makes me comfortable about it and what doesn't.” At Davidson, each professor can set their own approach to AI in the classroom, but that can be confusing. In the meantime, Worley and her roommates ponder what the rules should be. They ask, for instance: If it's now okay to have AI write your emails for you, why is that okay? And they talk about AI data centers' environmental costs. “Everyone's wrestling with it,” she said.

Learning how to wrestle with an issue like AI, which is ambiguous and undecided, is the whole point of an education undertaken in the liberal tradition. It's also made easier in a context where faculty-to-student ratios can be much smaller than they are at even elite research universities. (At a school like Davidson or Amherst, some classrooms will contain just a handful of students and a professor—a scenario in which siphoning work through Claude would not be easy.) Carina Cole, a Vassar media-studies student, told me that a supportive culture on campus also makes it possible to treat AI with greater care. Her fellow students are more likely to ask one another for help than turn to technology, she said. But Worley admitted that the situation feels fragile no matter what: “I'm holding on for dear life.”

At Amherst, I sat down with Matthew McGann, the dean of admission and financial aid. I asked how his school stacked up against the nation's most prestigious universities. If a student also gains admission to Yale, do they go there instead? “They do,” he said. Amherst has a sterling reputation, but it still cannot compete against a famous Ivy.

The relative obscurity of even the best small liberal-arts colleges may be helping them to avoid the Trump administration's war on higher ed. But that doesn't mean that they're immune from any risk of being targeted. Haverford College, in Pennsylvania, for example, has been made the subject of a civil-rights investigation for allegedly failing to address anti-Semitic harassment against Jewish students. (This is the same charge, and the same government action, that has been directed or threatened against Columbia, UCLA, Stanford, Cornell, Rutgers, and many other big universities.) Haverford may not rely on the federal government for giant research grants, but even just defending itself against investigation would be costly, as would, say, losing federal Pell Grants that subsidize low-income students.

Small colleges' endowments could also be attacked, even if the schools are never targeted specifically. In 2025, Congress voted to increase the tax on endowment income, which private colleges and universities draw on for financial aid, from 1.4 percent to as much as 8 percent. (The wealthiest liberal-arts colleges spend a large portion of their endowment earnings to fund students who can't afford to spend up to $100,000 a year to attend.) For the moment, institutions with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students—which means most liberal-arts colleges—are exempted from this increase, so their budgets remain untouched. But that could change.

Then there is the nagging question of practicality. Even if you believe that a liberal-arts college offers the best education, going to school to learn how to think might seem like a luxury today. In the end, you'll still need to earn some kind of living. If the paths for getting there—which may include postgraduate study in a doctoral program or professional school—are diminishing, then college itself will follow suit.

Still, after spending several weeks on my tour of wealthy, liberal-arts colleges, I grew to think that the pitch they're making to prospective students and their parents for the fall of 2026 was convincing. All things considered, when the time comes, I might rather see my own preteen daughter attend a school like Amherst or Davidson, Smith or Vassar, than a research university such as my own. The form of higher ed that they provide seems poised to be the most resilient in the years to come.

In a way, that resilience may pass on to the students who attend them. On my last night in western Massachusetts, I was set up to have dinner with a group of graduating Amherst seniors. By all measures, these were tremendously successful young adults. Hedley Lawrence-Apfelbaum is bound for a fellowship at the University of Oxford on his way to Harvard Law. Ayres Warren, who has already published a journal article on breast-cancer disparities, will pursue a career in environmental health-care management. Shane Dillon is plotting out a career in politics. All three of them told me they were worried about their futures—not because they had attended Amherst instead of Yale or Emory or Michigan State, but because the world seems so uncertain on the whole.

These seniors weren't panicking, though—this was very clear. “We'll see,” Dillon said when I asked what was next, what he feared, and what he hoped for. I've known a lot of brilliant undergraduates during the course of my career at research universities. Some have become wealthy in business; others have become famous; still more have made the world better through research and invention. But Dillon and the other students whom I met during my college tour struck me as being unusually attuned to the facts of their predicament. They were already living in the thickness of their own lives, aware of who they are and not just what they might become. They seemed to understand, by virtue of the education they'd received, that uncertainty is to be expected, and that the future lasts a long time.

Writing a great memoir about choosing a “good enough” life, it turns out, is hard.

Millennials love to talk—and gripe—about ambition. What was once a virtue has become a generational bugbear. Millennial women, raised on Girl Power and rom-coms in which the heroine gets the job and the man, joined the workforce just in time for the girlboss culture of the 2010s, which promised that hard work would lead not only to personal success but also to feminist victory. For many American women, no piece of that promise has come true. And, gender aside, anyone who's gone through two recessions, a pandemic, and the growing precarity of all kinds of careers has reason to side-eye grand dreams of achievement; it's hard enough to just get by. No wonder that cries of protest such as the Canadian writer Amil Niazi's 2022 lament, “Losing My Ambition,” in which Niazi declares that she's “abandoned the notion of ambition to chase the absolute middle of the road: mediocrity,” have gone viral.

Niazi has not given up completely on achievement: She parlayed her hit essay into a new book called Life After Ambition: A “Good Enough” Memoir. In it, she tries to trace the rise and fall of her aspirations as both a personal and a cultural story, framing her gradual disillusionment as a larger meditation on the limits of ambition as a guiding ethic. She describes setting aside her childhood literary dreams as she became overreliant on achievement as a source of self-worth—an issue to which many readers will likely relate, though it's an especially tough proposition in the media world, which has become increasingly unstable in Millennials' working lives. Niazi swings between journalistic writing, editing, and production before she lands a job in the BBC's commissioning department.

But once she's in that coveted role, motherhood reorients her priorities: She no longer wants work that separates her from her baby. This, too, will be readily relatable. But a less common aspect of her experience—and one Niazi does not explain satisfyingly—is that parenthood also reawakened her urge toward a kind of writing that, she notes, “had very little to do with journalism.” As a new mother, she found that the “urge to create felt overwhelming.” Before having a second baby, she quit her job.

For Niazi, abandoning ambition seems to have meant giving up on a career that the girlbosses of 10 years ago would have admired—one that involves climbing up the rungs of a major media company. But for many of her readers, success might well be what Niazi now has: a widely released memoir and a popular New York magazine column that she describes as a “perfect culmination” of her prior work. Niazi never really delves into this disconnect. And strangely, for someone who mentions that writing is “the only thing I'd ever been both good at and interested in, where I didn't feel like I was faking it,” she rarely explores her creative urge. In fact, she seems to shy away from any real exploration of what literary ambition means.

For a quest meant to “navigate what a divorce from ‘ambition' really looks like,” Niazi's memoir gives its audience little sense of why she continues to pursue writing, or what her relationship to literary craft is. So much of writing is battling your own mind to cough up the clearest idea or best word. Niazi doesn't discuss the frustrations or satisfactions of this process. Her book may leave readers wondering what aspect of writing compels her most, if it isn't public success or the private drive to perfect a sentence. As a result, Life After Ambition raises an intriguing question: If conventional visions of success strike so many as bankrupt, how can writers earnestly reclaim—or even hold on to—ambition for art?

As I was reading Life After Ambition, I thought wistfully of another recent memoir about writing: the New Yorker journalist and author Susan Orlean's immensely heartfelt career retrospective, Joyride. Midway through, Orlean observes that to be “empowered to write, to feel entitled to broadcast your thoughts to the world, is an honor.” Orlean has been broadcasting her thoughts in print for decades, and Joyride is at once her expression of gratitude for that career and a tale of life lived in service to her fundamental drive to write.

Orlean is precise about her motivations. She repeatedly describes her desire to write something fascinating and stylish enough to deserve a stranger's time—and then do it again, and again, and again. This is an unusual if not unique form of ambition, and Orlean illustrates it vividly. One of her goals, it seems, is to bring her obsession with writing to life for somebody who does not share it. She even makes the composition process—hours alone at her desk—sound dramatic, at one point comparing it with “walking along a narrow ledge and willing yourself to not look down: If you do, you'll lose your nerve, and you'll fall.” She then argues that the “single essential element” of quality prose is the confidence it takes to look straight ahead on that ledge. “You need swagger to be a writer at all,” she continues, “to be convinced that readers should listen to you.”

Such explicit writing about writing is a performance of both confidence and ambition: Orlean seems to want to put on such a great show that it compels you to go read her whole catalog. Niazi does show a certain devil-may-care swagger by describing Life After Ambition as merely “good enough,” which all but dares readers to dismiss it. (The phrase presumably winks at the child psychologist D. W. Winnicott's idea of the “good enough” mother but doesn't explicitly connect the dots.) In doing so, though, she lowers her audience's expectations. Orlean, in Joyride, does the opposite. She gives her solitary craft an urgency that cannot help but make readers inspect, and then appreciate, the quality of her writing. Repeatedly she promises that her sentences can rivet and enlighten you; repeatedly, they do just that.

Joyride, it seems to me, is an expression of ambition at its purest in that Orlean achieves the very goals—good storytelling and good prose—that the book discusses. But she never tangles with the tricky nexus of internal and external aspiration, likely because her career has gone so well. Though she does not completely omit her setbacks and times of doubt, she seems to understand that readers might not take seriously the professional insecurities of a writer whom Meryl Streep once played in a movie. Joyride remains squarely in the realm of interior, artistic ambition. It's about Orlean's determination to produce better and better work.

Life After Ambition, in contrast, mostly inhabits the realm of the external, and it does not put on a stylistic show. Life After Ambition's sentences are workmanlike, with an overreliance on set or hackneyed phrases; there's a lot of “brokenness,” “broken state,” “what was broken in me.” Niazi appears uninterested in asserting her voice on the page, a lack of literary care that seems connected to her tendency—odd in a memoir—to nudge away from introspection.

Read: A society that can't get enough of work

For instance, she recounts several moments in which a teacher, manager, or partner derided her ambition, treating it as unacceptable given her race or gender. Not wishing to linger on the emotional repercussions of these hurtful incidents is understandable, of course. Still, Niazi treats them with a distinct impersonality, largely using them to gesture at her story's wider applicability (ambition “becomes a funny thing,” she writes, “when it's used against you”) and to create a sense that her ambition allowed her to break away from bigots' and sexists' idea of who she was supposed to be.

Niazi's writing about her career moves also shows some unease with the personal. She grew up poor, and the ambition she describes most explicitly is her very relatable desire to “make money and move up the ladder and have a stable life.” As any writer or journalist reading Life After Ambition will know, achieving these goals in tandem can be challenging in media. In fact, making money is sometimes at odds with getting what you want. Niazi is admirably transparent about this reality: At one point, she recounts taking a $20,000 pay cut to work at a new media start-up where her role would involve more writing than her prior one. But she refrains from discussing the emotions or conversations that went into that decision, tucking it instead into a passage about trying for her first pregnancy. Taking a winding or risky career path is common, regardless of one's background, but it's often still fraught—and, therefore, ripe for investigation, especially in a book meant to probe ambition. Niazi shows her readers her choices; she just doesn't tell us what they mean.

None of this would seem all that jarring if Niazi used her desire to write to give readers a deeper idea of who she is. But she doesn't show herself drafting or consider its frustrations and satisfactions; readers never get to see her wobble on Orlean's narrow ledge. It is as if Niazi expects her audience either to intuit the reason she pursued writing or not to care, rather than treating her literary yearning as a subject worthy of consideration and time.

In this sense, Life After Ambition is legitimately and heartbreakingly unambitious. Reading it, I wondered whether Niazi didn't trust that she could interest readers in her real self. The memoir turns instead into a broad and essentially familiar discourse about ambition as a route out of challenging family circumstances; the pursuit of conventional success leading to alienation; the frequent clash between career and parenthood.

Perhaps a serious literary consideration of ambition, one that breaks through the shell of Millennial disillusionment that has hardened around the subject in recent years, would need to follow Orlean's lead in focusing on craft. After all, it takes confidence to talk about your art—and to get away from convention. In the hip-hop scholar Tricia Rose's seminal Black Noise, the graffiti writer and rapper Fab Five Freddy tells Rose that what makes his art satisfying is “that pressure on you to be the best. Or to try to be the best. To develop a new style nobody can deal with.” A goal like that might torment you, and it might end in failure nine times out of 10, but the most common complaint about conventional ambition is that it so often turns into a trap. If your goal is to chase artistic innovation, to try to tell the best story or put on the best show you can, then effort becomes its own reward.

Even some Republicans have begun calling for the Homeland Security secretary's resignation.

This story appeared in Today, Explained, a daily newsletter that helps you understand the most compelling news and stories of the day. Subscribe here.

Even if you don't follow politics closely, you probably know a few things about Kristi Noem. She's the one that some critics have dubbed “ICE Barbie.” Also, unforgivably: the one who shot her dog.

Noem, most importantly, is the secretary of Donald Trump's embattled and emboldened Department of Homeland Security, and is thus tasked with overseeing the immigration crackdown that's brought chaos to Minneapolis and other cities. Since that campaign claimed the life of a second US citizen last weekend, many lawmakers — including some Republicans — have begun calling for Noem's ouster.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Whether that will actually happen — and whether it would represent any real rebuke or de-escalation of Trump's unchecked deportation campaign — is anybody's guess. But if you want to understand Kristi Noem or the broader palace intrigue at Homeland Security, Ben Terris is a good guy to ask. Terris, the Washington correspondent for New York magazine, published a witty, wild, revelatory profile of Noem last September. So in today's edition, he answers the question: Whither Kristi Noem (...and her wider circus)?

Hey Ben! I wanted to talk to you now because it feels like we're potentially reaching a turning point in Trump's immigration enforcement campaign. 

Since the start of his second term, DHS bulked up, adopted more aggressive tactics and launched these militarized operations in a number of US cities. But even within the administration and the Republican party, it seems like there may be some appetite for some kind of drawdown following the shooting death of Alex Pretti. Can you tell me a little about how we got here? Like, who are the people driving this train?

The first thing to remember about how we got here has to be that last summer Congress passed a bill with just an absolute ton of money for DHS, and specifically money for deportations. Trump has always made deportations a top priority, and suddenly there was funding to build up an entire army to make it happen.

It wasn't exactly an elite army, though: They were throwing $50,000 bonuses to try and fill their ranks as quickly as possible. And the generals running the show weren't exactly elite either.

Kristi Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, has been the head of DHS in part because she asked for the job, and in part because she is, in Trump's opinion, “good on TV.” And her second-in-command is Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

Lewandowski isn't technically an employee of DHS — he's one of those “Special Government Employees” (like Elon Musk once was), a role that he's only supposed to serve in for a finite amount of time. He is also strongly rumored to be romantically involved with Noem. It's a mess.

How has the culture at DHS changed under Noem and Lewandowski? What is their management style like?

Like a lot of successful politicians in the Trump era, Noem is someone without much of an ideological backbone. She was described to me by many of her colleagues as only doing what's best for Kristi Noem. As the head of DHS, that's basically meant being as hardline on immigration as she can be.

There's a sense that the actual person running the show on this issue is Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff and perhaps the most zealous anti-immigrant aide in the president's orbit. This has meant that Noem's job is essentially to try and hit the deportation numbers that Miller bangs on about, and to sell the president's agenda on TV.

As for her management style, in some ways she can be almost Trumpy: often swayed by the last person to have her ear, willing to make decisions based on ambition, and seemingly unconcerned about making enemies.

Reading your piece from September, I was really struck by how many of Noem's former colleagues — many of them South Dakota Republicans — were eager to badmouth her. Often on the record! What do you make of that?

I was a little surprised when people from her past were willing to trash her on the record. It's not a very common thing in politics today to do that, and most of them joked about how they would probably be sent to Alligator Alcatraz for speaking out.

But most of the on-the-record folks are out in South Dakota, living their lives out there, unconnected from the goings-on in Washington — which I think gave them some cover. Plus, she really pissed a lot of people off, so I had plenty of potential sources to call.

In the past several days, Trump has softened some of his rhetoric around Minneapolis and sent his border czar, Tom Homan, to “de-escalate” the situation there. There's almost a sense that Homan is the adult in the room now. Does he seem like a moderating force to you?

It didn't take long into my reporting to learn that there are two major camps in Trump's administration dealing with immigration. There's Noem/Lewandowski's camp, and there's Tom Homan's. And these two camps are always at war with one another.

I would say that many people do see Homan as more of an adult in the room. He's got much more experience on this issue, and he doesn't dress up and go on deportation raids with a camera crew in tow.

He's not without drama, obviously. There's the issue of the $50,000 bribe. Also, it's important to remember that he's not actually a moderate when it comes to immigration. He was a driving force behind the family separation policy in Trump's first term.

Democrats are calling on Trump to fire Noem and have threatened to impeach her. I'm sort of curious, given your reporting on the culture at DHS and the cabal of decisionmakers there, what you think that would accomplish (if anything?) in terms of hemming in some of the agency's recent missteps and abuses.

Even back when I was reporting on Noem last fall, there was an idea that she was on “thin ice” and that she could lose her job. I believed then, and I believe now, that it's totally possible!

But part of me also wonders if all the calls from Democrats et al for an impeachment or a firing, might only make Trump more likely to keep her around for a while. He doesn't like giving in to pressure, and he doesn't like admitting that his administration has fucked up in any way.

We are talking about your New York cover story from September, but you actually just published another big piece that tries to nail down what exactly is going on with Trump's health. 

I don't want to ruin the ending for readers by asking about your overall conclusions. But let's just talk about the bruise on Trump's hand. What did Trump tell you that was from — and honestly, did you believe him?

Trump — and his doctors who joined us in the Oval Office for my interview — swear that the bruising on his hands comes from a combination of daily aspirin use and vigorous hand shaking. Do I believe that's true? I don't know! Kind of?

Trump told me that he takes way over the recommended daily amount of aspirin, and that his doctors have basically pleaded with him to cut back. But he says he wants “thin blood” to avoid any heart problems, and the aspirin seems to be doing that for him. Trump refusing to change up his routine despite his doctors' insistence? That sounds pretty Trumpy to me.

Gen Z men are surprisingly excited about parenthood.

“I definitely want to have kids,” Branden Estrada, an 18-year-old college freshman, told me. “I had such a good family life that I've always thought about what it's going to be like for me to have kids of my own.”

Estrada is excited to share his favorite Transformers and Spider-Man movies with his kids, and he's put some of his old toys aside to pass down to them. He knows he's up to the task, because he grew up with a younger sister. “I'm used to having someone to take care of,” he told me.

He even has a name picked out: Stavros, to honor his family's Greek heritage. “I thought it was just a cool name, because you can shorten it to be like Stav,” he said.

I reached out to Estrada after I saw him in a focus group of Gen Z Americans hosted by The Otherhood Collective, an online community for nontraditional families. He's part of an especially scrutinized group these days: Young men today are widely seen, rightly or wrongly, as a generation adrift. They can't get jobs, they aren't seeing friends, and their isolation and disaffection have been blamed for recent mass shootings and political violence. But even if Gen Z men are increasingly cut off from society (a claim some would dispute), there's one very social endeavor they still want to participate in: having kids.

While not everyone has a name picked out, Estrada's excitement and optimism around fatherhood aren't unusual. In a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, 57 percent of men between 18 and 34 said they wanted to have kids one day, compared with 45 percent of women.

“There's been this cultural understanding that it's women who are driving the desire to get married and have kids,” said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the American Enterprise Institute. “But now there's a raft of polling that is suggesting that's possibly no longer the case.”

Across party lines and demographic groups, young men are eager to be dads. In a May 2025 survey by Young Men Research Project, an organization focused on Gen Z polling, 63 percent of men ages 18 to 29 said having children was important to them. Republicans were the most bullish on parenthood, with 76 percent saying having kids was important to them, but a majority — 58 percent — of Democrats said the same. And within right-leaning America, an NBC News Decision Desk Poll of Gen Z youth conducted last August found male Trump voters ranked having children as the most important factor in a successful life, ahead of marriage, financial independence, and a fulfilling career (having kids ranked sixth on the list for female Trump voters, and 12th for female Harris voters).

Wanting to have kids is one thing; wanting to raise them is another. Some polling suggests that young men today subscribe to more conservative gender roles — in a 30-country study conducted in 2025, 28 percent of Gen Z men said a stay-at-home dad was “less of a man,” compared with 25 percent of millennials and just 12 percent of baby boomers.

But the experts and young men I spoke with told a more complex story — one of a cohort that's authentically excited about fatherhood, even if it may take some work to get there.

“They're basically saying, I want a family; I want to raise the next generation,” said Misty Heggeness, an associate professor of economics and public affairs at the University of Kansas.

As birth rates fall around the world, policymakers and media outlets have devoted more and more attention to young people's attitudes toward childrearing. Those attitudes are complex, and what people tell pollsters doesn't always match what they end up doing in their lives.

Still, experts — and young people themselves — sometimes describe a gender gap when it comes to procreation. Ernest Ntangu, a 23-year-old consultant in mergers and acquisitions, told me that his male friends typically see having kids as “a natural next step.” Among his female friends, he said, there's a lot more trepidation.

The gender gap on kids may not be entirely new — one 1990 survey found that 15 percent of Canadian women without kids never wanted to have them, compared with 10 percent of men. But for women, the opportunity cost of having children has never been higher — as they've entered the workforce and approached wage parity with men, they have more to give up if they take time off to raise kids, said Heggeness, author of the new book Swiftynomics: How Women Mastermind and Redefine Our Economy.

For heterosexual women, there's the added concern that a male partner may be unwilling or unable to share the workload of parenting, or may even add to women's burden by requiring their own emotional maintenance. “Women are looking at the state of affairs, and they're kind of saying, ‘Gee, I don't know,'” Heggeness said.

Women still do the majority of caregiving in American homes. And there's some evidence that young men aspire to a “traditional” division of labor — when Young Men Research Project asked young respondents what it means to be a man, the most popular choice was “providing for your family.”

“The breadwinner model is something that certainly has not abated,” Charlie Sabgir, director of the project, told me.

However, norms of fatherhood may be changing, if slowly. When the pandemic shuttered schools and daycare centers, many men found themselves spending more time with their kids — and that change has persisted, Heggeness and her team have found. Fathers of children under 10 are doing about 1.2 more hours of child care per week than they were pre-Covid.

Young men today are also more likely to take parental leave, and more likely to be engaged in hands-on child care than their fathers, Heggeness said. She pointed to celebrities like podcaster and former NFL player Jason Kelce, a father of four who often talks about his family life.

“He doesn't do as much in the house as Kylie Kelce does,” Heggeness said, but “you can hear their stories about him putting the girls to sleep, or helping in the bathroom when there's potty training.”

Ntangu would love to have five kids one day, he told me. When it comes to raising them, he's not interested in the “heteronormative” model in which “the father's the one that's really being the breadwinner and the mother is doing a lot of the caretaking,” he said.

Rather, he hopes he and his future partner can each play to their strengths. For him, that would mean doing physical activities with his kids and teaching them confidence, but also making dinner.

“I love cooking,” Ntangu said. “I would be perfectly comfortable with making all the meals.”

Estrada, too, hopes for an equitable division of labor. “I would really want to see what my partner needs from me,” he said. “If I didn't have the job that required the most time, then I would probably take more care.”

Of course, hoping for an equitable division of labor and actually achieving it aren't the same thing. If young men are going to realize their family goals, then they'll have to get women on board — women who no longer face the same economic and social pressure to marry and procreate that their grandmothers did.

“It really requires a bunch of earnest and serious conversations,” Heggeness said. “How are we going to divide all the work that's involved in growing a human and educating a human?”

Policies that reduce the cost to women of having kids could also help close the gender gap in family desires, Heggeness said. Those include affordable child care and paid parental leave, especially if it includes leave reserved for fathers, which has shifted social norms in Scandinavian countries.

Young men and women alike, meanwhile, worry about being able to afford kids amid a raft of rising costs, even if they're gainfully employed like Ntangu. He says the price of housing, especially in urban areas, might keep him from having as many kids as he wants.

Estrada is excited about the prospect of universal child care in New York City, and believes programs like that could help him raise a family one day. “It's such a hard time to afford anything for so many Americans,” he said.

Despite these concerns, young men display a striking hopefulness around their ability to be dads one day. Though only 45 percent of men in the Young Men Research Project survey said they felt financially stable, 57 percent believed they'd be able to afford kids in the near future.

“For all the discussion about this hopeless demographic,” Sabgir said, “when you actually ask about your future, there's this optimism.”

It's an optimism clearly on display when young men talk about the families they'd like to have.

“Having kids is where I think that I would get my ultimate meaning,” Ntangu said. “What I'm looking forward to with having kids is being able to give them the best life that I possibly can.”

“I just feel like it's going to be so much fun,” Estrada said.

What Minnesota's immigrant communities need from you now.

In recent weeks, Minnesota has borne the brunt of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration strategy, with federal officials detaining thousands of people, from preschoolers to, occasionally, US citizens. Minnesotans on the ground have responded in turn by establishing remarkable models of community resistance, including vast networks of volunteers monitoring ICE activity, as well as handing out free diapers, food, and other essentials to families in need.

But over the weekend, tensions spiked after federal border patrol agents shot and killed yet another civilian, Alex Pretti, which came 17 days after an agent from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) killed Renee Nicole Good.

Such overt violence against immigrants and protesters — often captured in graphic video — has left many Americans feeling aghast, but also powerlessness over how to respond. Even conservatives have begun taking a much harder stance on ICE's activities, with nearly one in five Republicans voicing support for abolishing the agency in the wake of Pretti's killing.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

At times like these, perhaps the best way to deal with these feelings is to channel them into helping people who need it, not just in Minneapolis, but in your community too. Fortunately there are countless organizations, religious groups, and mutual aid networks that have organized tirelessly over the past year or more to protect vulnerable populations. And it's never too late for you to join them, whether through donating to immigrant groups, volunteering your time, or your advocacy for more humane policies.

Here's how to help.

If you want to support immigrants and their supporters in Minneapolis specifically, two local volunteers have created an extensive repository called Stand With Minnesota, filled with nonprofits, mutual aid networks, and crowdfunding links for specific schools, neighborhoods, and families that need support.

You can choose from an immigrant-serving nonprofit that's over a century old to a GoFundMe offering rent relief in the same neighborhood where Good was killed. If you want someone else to make the decision for you on where to donate, the Immigrant Rapid Response Fund is a pooled philanthropic fund from the Women's Foundation of Minnesota that can direct your donation to where it's needed most.

Among the options that Stand With Minnesota offers are funds for purchasing safety equipment or links to buy dash cams for legal observers documenting ICE activities. These resources are important because they help volunteers safely capture the way ICE operates in their neighborhoods, shedding a light on their activities and ultimately offering evidence for accountability if abuse occurs.

If you do live in Minnesota, there are plenty of groups that train volunteer legal observers or need volunteers to help support immigrants who are afraid to leave their homes right now because of ICE activity. Some have stopped going to work or school — or even the supermarket — as usual.

The vast majority of those detained in Trump's immigration crackdown never get to speak to a lawyer. But when they do have legal counsel, they are up to 10.5 times more likely to win the case, according to the Vera Institute of Justice.

Here are some other organizations recommended by local activists that focus on providing legal support to immigrant families across the state:

If you happen to speak multiple languages, many organizations like the Immigrant Law Center and ICOM need volunteers to help accompany or translate for immigrants navigating the court system, even if you don't have any legal training. Freedom for Immigrants needs multilingual volunteers to help run its national hotline for people in detention and their families.

Minnesota may be ground zero of Trump's immigration crackdown today, but it is far from the only place in the country where families affected by ICE need your support.

Once again, if you have cash to donate, then giving to a local legal aid organization is a great way to make sure that more immigrants see a fair day in court. There are literally hundreds of organizations doing just that in every state of the country.

But if there's something that we can learn from what's happening in Minneapolis, it's that standing with your neighbors really does matter.

For some people — especially US citizens who are far less vulnerable to ICE violence — that might mean connecting with a local organization and training to become a legal observer. (While it is legal to film ICE activities, keep in mind that becoming an observer does have its own risks, with plenty of reports of ICE conducting arrests or becoming physically aggressive.)

But support can also mean volunteering your time with local immigrant-led nonprofits or mutual aid organizations focused on making sure that families get the food, shelter, and support they need to feel safe. It might also be as simple as asking your own friends and neighbors what they need right now — and brushing up on your rights when ICE knocks on your door or enters your neighborhood in the process.

And finally, if you're an American taxpayer and you're unhappy with the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies, then ICE's crackdown has been carried out on your dime. So don't forget to take the two minutes it takes to call your representatives too.

Scientists are baffled by the results from new Arctic research.

Polar bears became the poster child for the peril of climate change for obvious reasons: They hunt seals from the ice, and as fossil fuels warm the planet, the ice where these bears live is melting.

For more than three decades, scientists have been warning that climate change could drive polar bear populations extinct. That message infiltrated the public psyche, perhaps more than any other about the scourge of global warming.

But as scientists are continuing to learn, the reality for these iconic bears is more complicated.

In 2022, scientists published a study showing that polar bears in southeastern Greenland were able to use glacial ice instead of sea ice to hunt, sheltering them from some of the impacts of warming. And a study published late last year revealed some changes in polar bear DNA that may help them adapt to hotter weather.

Now, research in the journal Scientific Reports adds yet another wrinkle of hope for the species. The study, an analysis of hundreds of polar bears in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, found that declining sea ice is not causing polar bears to starve. They actually appeared healthier in the last two decades of the analysis, from 2000 to 2019. The overall population, meanwhile, is either stable or growing, according to Jon Aars, the study's lead author and a scientist at the Norwegian Polar Institute.

“I was surprised,” Aars told Vox from Svalbard. “I would have predicted that body condition would decline. We see the opposite.”

The new study makes clear that, in other regions, the loss of sea ice from warming is indeed linked to ailing polar bear populations. In Canada's Western Hudson Bay, for example, researchers have tied melting ice to lower bear survival and a shortage of food, finding that the population has roughly halved since the 1980s. Climate change remains the largest threat to these animals.

Yet, there are 20 distinct polar bear populations around the world, and they all behave slightly differently. Warming is not uniformly killing them.

Perhaps, then, polar bears aren't the best mascot for the climate crisis — a point some advocates have been making for a while — especially when there are countless other species imperiled by rising temperatures.

Polar bears need fat to survive the harsh Arctic cold; that's why they eat blubbery seals. Seals, meanwhile, need ice to rest and birth pups. Without that ice, polar bears have a hard time finding and catching them.

Since the late 1970s, the Arctic — the northernmost region of the planet, including parts of Alaska, Canada, Europe, and Russia — has lost more than 27,000 square miles of summer ice. That's an area larger than the state of West Virginia. Some estimates suggest that the region could be ice-free by the middle of the century, even under optimistic emissions scenarios.

That melting ice is what's harming polar bear populations in Canada's Hudson Bay; the Beaufort Sea, located north of Alaska and the Yukon; and Baffin Bay in Greenland. And it's why they're listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, a global authority on endangered species.

But the story in Svalbard — an icy archipelago in the Barents Sea, north of Scandinavia — is different.

Between 1992 and 2019, scientists in Svalbard darted hundreds of polar bears from helicopters and measured their bodies. Then they compared those measurements to sea ice conditions, such as the number of ice-free days, and other climate variables.

Remarkably, the number of days with no ice in the region increased by roughly 100 during that period. And yet, as the authors found, the body condition of both male and female polar bears — i.e., how fat and healthy they are — increased from 2000 onward. Female bears were actually in worse condition when the sea ice lasted longer.

Often, the message about polar bears is “100 percent doom,” said Kristin Laidre, a polar bear researcher at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the study. “But that's not true,” Laidre told me. “There's variability in how bears are responding. This [research] adds to the variability story.”

If polar bears in Svalbard are healthy, that means they're finding food. So what are they eating?

One possibility, said Aars, the lead author, is that there may be higher densities of ringed seals, their primary food source, in years with less ice, so they're easier to catch. Even if polar bears have less time to catch the seals — because there are fewer days with ice — they can put on loads of weight quickly and rely on that for months.

The bears may also be eating other animals on land that don't require ice. Reindeer on the archipelago are increasing, for example, and Aars says he's seen bears eat them. Walrus populations are increasing, too. Although polar bears can't easily kill a walrus, they can scavenge their tusked, fat-filled carcass when walruses die from other causes.

“Bears in Svalbard are potentially changing their diet, and that might account for the increase in body condition,” said John Iacozza, a senior instructor and polar bear expert at the University of Manitoba. That's a luxury that polar bears elsewhere might not have. “You wouldn't see the same effect happening in Western Hudson Bay, just because the availability of other species is less,” said Iacozza, who was not involved in the new research.

While the Svalbard bears might be fine for now, researchers still worry about the long-term impacts of warming in the region. “We do think there's a threshold,” Aars told me. “The difficult part is that we don't know what it is.”

No other animal has been so closely tied to climate change as the polar bear. It was on the cover of TIME's 2006 global warming issue. It was featured in Al Gore's seminal documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which premiered the same year. It was used in funding campaigns for environmental groups. (One year, I even dressed up as a drowning polar bear for Halloween with a friend who went as a melting ice cap.)

The bear's symbolism is rooted in good science. Those early studies were in places like Canada's Western Hudson Bay, where these Arctic apex predators were clearly dying from melting sea ice. Media outlets amplified the most sensational conclusions — and they stuck.

That's partly because the message is simple, Laidre said: Polar bears need ice, and warming is making it disappear. “The relationship between [climate and] an animal that needs a platform to eat is easy to wrap your brain around,” she said.

Even before these more recent studies, the climate movement had moved away from using polar bears as a mascot for advocacy, journalist Kate Yoder wrote on the environmental news site Grist. Climate advocates worried that spotlighting the bears made global warming seem like a faraway problem — one for animals in remote regions, not a crisis for species and humans everywhere, right now. Today, messaging tends to focus on the very real human impact and the emotions that come with it: homes engulfed in flames or swept away by floods, for example, or extreme hurricanes barreling towards the coast.

From a scientific perspective, the polar bear still works as a symbol for the climate crisis, Iacozza said; these animals still need ice, so they're still under siege from warming.

But if advocates did want a new mascot, there'd be a long list of other animals to choose from. All kinds of corals, for example, are getting cooked by marine heat waves. Rare Hawaiian birds known as honeycreepers are going extinct from avian malaria, which mosquitoes are spreading further uphill as the islands warm.

Other Arctic animals are threatened, too, Aars said, including ringed seals. “Many of those are more at risk than polar bears,” he told me. “There are also changes in Svalbard, in the sea, that are much more profound than what we see on land with polar bears. But people don't see it, or people don't care.”

Ultimately, it's easy for people to care about polar bears. They're big, they're fluffy, and they're unique. So perhaps, instead of ditching them as a mascot for warming, it'd be better to acknowledge that the story is more complicated than it's often presented. Climate change impacts the natural world differently in different places.

Earlier this week, a government shutdown appeared highly likely. Now, there's a chance that a prolonged shutdown will be avoided.

In the days after Border Patrol agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, Democratic senators vowed to oppose a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), without significant changes to immigration enforcement.

In the span of just a few hours following the deadly shooting on Saturday, shutdown odds rose from roughly 10% to the high 70s on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

Late on Thursday night, after The New York Times first reported that the White House and Democratic senators were working to avert a shutdown, odds of a shudown on both platforms cratered. They have since recovered, hovering in the mid-60s as of Thursday morning.

That's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.

Even if lawmakers reach a deal, a short shutdown at least through the weekend is likely — funding for several agencies and programs officially runs out after midnight late Friday evening.

The House has already passed a series of six funding bills that have been stitched together into one package. That package includes DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things.

The GOP may control the upper chamber, but they can't ignore Democrats. Due to the Senate's 60-vote ""filibuster"" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one.

Democrats are only opposed to the DHS bill, and they want Republicans to work with them to separate out the bills.

But even if the bills are separated, the House would have to vote on them again in order to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.

The House is set to be out of session until early next week, meaning a shutdown at least until then is likely.

Just months ago, the federal government shut down for 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad.

For one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30.

In the event of a prolonged shutdown, SNAP and WIC payments would be unaffected, Capitol Hill staffers would still get paid, and national parks would likely remain open.

Additionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward this time.

In the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding.

That means it's plausible that the Senate would separate out the other five bills, the House would re-pass those bills next week, and the partial shutdown would only last a few days.

Still, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. It also funds the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

That raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time.

Additionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.

While the current DHS funding bill contains an additional $10 billion for ICE, the agency also received roughly $75 billion in funding via the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" in July.

Unless lawmakers were to agree to rescind that funding — extremely unlikely given GOP control of Congress — that money's here to stay.

First, I should admit that ordering Starbucks' new ""Iced Caramel Protein Matcha"" was an obvious mistake. I'm not a huge matcha fan, and combining it with caramel and protein (part of Starbucks' push into trendy wellness drinks)? Come on, I was asking for it.

Still, I had to see what's been working so well at Starbucks lately.

Clearly, something is working. Starbucks' latest earnings report on Wednesday showed sales up for the second quarter in a row. This is a reversal of a downward trend over the last 18 months, ever since Brian Niccol, former Chipotle CEO, took over at Starbucks.

Niccol's big campaign is ""back to Starbucks"" — attempting to revive the coffee chain to its glory days as a place people wanted to sit and chat and drink coffee, not just order over an app for pickup or drive-thru.

This has meant some small but meaningful changes: trimming the chaff from its drink menu, upping efficiency and speed, requiring baristas to doodle cheerful messages on cups, and refurbishing some locations to be more appealing for sitting and spending time — even adding more power outlets.

The location I went to in suburban Connecticut was completely new inside. (It had relocated from a building across the street in the town center.) So I got to experience what a fresh design looks like in a brand-new store.

And you know what? Brian, my boy, you did good. It was a really nice-looking location. There were a few tables with padded chairs or stools, and a back seating section with three different styles of leather chairs.

The far wall was lined with shelves stocked with bags of beans and travel cups, along with framed art. The back wall of the barista's zone had a pleasing, earthy dark green tile. It didn't look like the Starbucks of the late '90s (when I worked at one as a teen), but it also didn't look like a copy of the minimalist, trendy coffee chains like Blank Street or Blue Bottle that usurped it as the preferred coffee destination of the discerning coastal urban office worker.

While I was there, around lunchtime, the location was busy. As I typed this, seated in a plush leather chair at the back of the store, four other people joined me in the comfy area. The ambient bustle is nice, although I couldn't help notice the woman next to me was playing YouTube videos at full volume on her laptop with no headphones, which is fairly unpleasant.

Perhaps Starbucks is trying to get back into the coffee shop/""third space"" glory days, but some customers are still treating it like a public restroom that serves milkshakes — they're not yet following independent coffee shop norms and etiquette (where this kind of behavior would merit a good shaming from the workers or other customers. Me? I'm minding my own business).

The menu (aside from the screen promoting the Iced Caramel Protein Matcha) had been redone to list ""Coffeehouse Classics"" — a smaller, manageable list of drinks that resembled things recognizable as coffee-related. That was a nice relief from two years ago, when I found myself staring at a Starbucks menu, bewildered by all the newfangled drinks and feeling like an out-of-touch grouch. Sure, many of those weird, sweet drinks are available by customization, but I think the slimmed-down menu makes sense.

Yes, the barista wrote on my cup — a practice that I loathe. I find it offensive to the barista that they're forced to write ""you rock!"" on my cup, and offensive to me that the assumption is I'll be charmed by this saccharine mandatory gesture.

As for the Iced Caramel Protein Matcha? I'm sure some people might like it, but next time, I'll stick to ordering something that's more to my taste. For now, I can see why Starbucks is doing well again.

Tesla is making another leap to shed its EV maker title and transform into a full-fledged physical AI outfit.

The theme of Wednesday's fourth-quarter earnings call heavily centered on how Tesla is investing in its future as an AI and robotics company — a narrative CEO Elon Musk has pushed for some time now.

The bets included: a major investment in Musk's xAI, updates on the Optimus humanoid robot, and a renewed push for in-house chipmaking. Musk projected that Tesla's future will require a $20 billion investment, which dwarfs the company's $8.5 billion in capex reported for the 2025 fiscal year.

Meanwhile, Tesla's automotive segment took a back seat: Musk said he's killing the Model S and Model X to free up room for humanoid robot production. And while Tesla's energy and ""services"" revenue jumped 25% and 18%, respectively, auto revenue fell 11% year-over-year — a clear indication that the quarter's growth came from everywhere but its core EV business.

""We've updated the Tesla mission to amazing abundance, and this is an attempt to send a message of optimism about the future,"" Musk said during the call.

The company's stock rose 1.7% after the market closed on Wednesday evening.

Here are 6 biggest takeaways from the earnings call.

Tesla made good on its pledge to investors and announced a $2 billion investment into xAI, the startup behind Grok. It's part of a larger $20 billion Series E funding round from January.

The expectation of the investment is a deeper collaboration between the two companies. xAI, which has been expanding its data center footprint, could provide the compute and other technical capabilities to further advance Tesla's autonomous vehicle and robotics agenda.

Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during the call that the agreement with xAI is in the spirit of finding ""efficient ways for others to help us.""

In a surprise move, Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X would be discontinued by the next quarter, closing a chapter on the company's premium SUV and sedan.

That leaves the EV maker with four cars: the Cybertruck, the more popular Model 3 and Model Y, and the yet-to-be-released Cybercab.

The CEO said during the call that the move will provide more production space in Tesla's Fremont factory for Optimus robots.

The ""long-term goal"" is to produce a million units a year with the freed-up space, Musk said.

The CEO added that killing the Model S and Model X is part of Tesla's ""overall shift to an autonomous future,"" which includes the company's ride-hailing service, Tesla Robotaxi, and autonomy in personally owned vehicles through Full Self-Driving, an advanced driver assistance system.

Tesla expects to start production of the Cybercab, a two-seater coupe, in April for eventual integration into its Robotaxi fleet.

Tesla revealed where it aims to expand the Robotaxi ride-hailing service in the first half of 2026 — Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas — but has yet to announce when it will remove the safety monitors inside the cars for public riders across Austin and San Francisco Bay Area, where the service now operates.

Musk said that FSD — the technology that Tesla says will make personally owned vehicles fully autonomous — is already ""100% unsupervised"" and operating without humans inside. The difference, he said, is that Tesla is being ""very cautious"" with rolling out unsupervised service to the public, though Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides in Austin this month.

""There's like some pretty nutty intersections, where there are a lot of humans who make mistakes and have accidents in various cities,"" Musk said. ""So we want to make sure that FSD can handle those unusual intersections.""

There wasn't much of a progress report on Tesla's AI5 chip, but the CEO said he's spending part of his weekends working on it.

""If I'm spending my Saturdays on something, it's going to be something pretty important,"" Musk said, adding that chip procurement is ""existential"" for Tesla's future, going so far as to bring up the Tesla ""Terafab"" — his aspirational idea of building an in-house chip manufacturing plant.

Musk said he wants to build a factory that integrates ""logic, memory, and packaging"" because Tesla will be ""fundamentally limited by supply chain"" if it doesn't.

Musk said he expects to unveil an Optimus 3 robot in a ""few months,"" but don't expect it to be working the assembly lines just yet.

The CEO said Optimus isn't contributing to Tesla's manufacturing work in any ""material way"" and that the humanoid robot is only in the factory for training purposes.

Musk talked a lot about Tesla's future, but the company's fourth-quarter performance still hinged on its tangible businesses, such as its energy segment, which includes the Megapack, a utility-scale battery system, and the Powerwall, the home battery system.

""On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profits for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue,"" Taneja, the Tesla CFO, said.

Tesla also announced this month that it will pivot FSD to a subscription-based only model starting in February. Customers previously had the option to buy FSD upfront for $8,000.

The move is a clear signal that Tesla sees FSD as a key future revenue generator.

Automakers are increasingly betting that software subscription services will be a critical source of recurring revenue with higher margins. General Motors revealed that its vehicle software generated $2 billion in the past nine months.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Dearest gentle readers: ""Bridgerton"" is back. And with a new season of Netflix's romance series comes a new love story and a new crop of characters to get to know over the course of the story.

Season four is based on the third novel in Julia Quinn's ""Bridgerton"" series, ""An Offer from a Gentleman,"" which tells the story of Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson), the second-eldest Bridgerton and the family's resident free spirit who's determined not to live a conventional life like his siblings — that is, until he meets a mysterious lady in a silver dress, Sophie (Yerin Ha), who makes him rethink his worldview.

Sophie's not the only new face we'll get to know this season. There's also the Penwood family, consisting of the widow of the Earl of Penwood, Lady Araminta Gun (Katie Leung), her two daughters, Posy (Isabelle Wei) and Rosamund (Michelle Mao).

Here's where you may recognize the cast of ""Bridgerton"" season four from.

After three seasons of waiting, ""An Offer from a Gentleman"" fans will finally get their Benedict Bridgerton season. Luke Thompson steps into the spotlight this season, once more playing the second Bridgerton son, Benedict.

""Bridgerton"" is Thompson's biggest project to date, but you might recognize him from a background role in ""Dunkirk,"" the 2020 film ""Misbehaviour,"" or the Netflix series ""Transatlantic.""

Sophie is Benedict's love interest this season — he meets her first in disguise at a masquerade ball, and then again when she's back in her normal life as a servant for one of the families of Mayfair.

Ha's first main role was in the Paramount+ series ""Halo,"" based on the video game franchise of the same name. She also had a small role in ""Dune: Prophecy.""

Ha, who is Australian, has also appeared in Australian series like ""Troppo,"" ""Bad Behaviour,"" and ""The Survivors.""

After leading season three, to the delight of Polin fans everywhere, Newton and Coughlan are back in supporting roles as Colin and Penelope Bridgerton. And now that everyone knows that Penelope is actually Lady Whistledown, her life has become more complicated.

Newton is best known for ""Bridgerton,"" but Disney fans may recognize him from ""The Lodge.""

Coughlan was already beloved by fans of the Irish series ""Derry Girls"" before taking on the role of Penelope. She also stars in the British series ""Big Mood"" and had a small role in ""Barbie.""

After getting married and heading off to Scotland in season three, Francesca and John are back in London for the social season — because, according to Francesca, it was getting a little crowded with the two of them, her sister Eloise, and John's cousin Michaela.

Dodd joined the cast of ""Bridgerton"" in season three, replacing the original actor who played Francesca, Ruby Stokes. Before the show, Dodd had roles in ""Enola Holmes 2,"" ""Eternals,"" ""Anatomy of a Scandal,"" and ""Flowers in the Attic: The Origin.""

Alli also joined in season three. Prior to the series, he had small roles in ""Death on the Nile,"" ""Belfast,"" and ""Andor.""

It's explained during the first episode of season four that Anthony and Kate are still in India after the birth of their first child. Per Netflix, Bailey and Ashley will appear at some point in season four.

Four years after their season, Bailey has become a true A-lister. In addition to being the reigning People's Sexiest Man Alive, Bailey was the No. 1 highest-grossing male actor at the box office in 2025, thanks to ""Jurassic World Rebirth"" and ""Wicked: For Good,"" per Variety.

Ashley was already known to fans of ""Sex Education"" before ""Bridgerton."" Since then, she starred in the Prime Video film ""Picture This"" and is set to appear in ""The Devil Wears Prada 2"" this summer.

Baduza was introduced at the end of season three as John's cousin, Michaela, replacing the (male) character of Michael Stirling from Francesca's book, ""When He Was Wicked."" She only pops in at the very end of part one of season four, so we can be sure to expect more in part two.

Baduza's biggest role pre-""Bridgerton"" was in the BBC series ""Noughts + Crosses"" as the main character, Sephy.

Eloise decided to get a change of scenery from the Ton at the end of season three to join her sister and new brother-in-law in Scotland, but when we pick up season four, Eloise is actually quite happy to be back among the rest of her family in London.

Jessie has appeared in classic British series such as ""Doctors,"" ""Call the Midwife,"" and ""Doctor Who."" She also starred in an ITV adaptation of ""Vanity Fair.""

In 2025, she starred in the Netflix miniseries ""Toxic Town.""

Hyacinth is the second-youngest Bridgerton sibling, and this season, she's desperate to prove that she's all grown up.

This is Hunt's first major role, but in 2025, she played the younger version of Teresa Palmer's character in ""Mix Tape.""

Gemmell has been part of ""Bridgerton"" since season one and also appeared on the spin-off, ""Queen Charlotte."" We've only known Violet as a single mom, but this season, she has her eye on Lord Marcus Anderson (Francis), who just happens to be Lady Danbury's younger brother. He joined the cast in season three.

Gemmell is best known for her performance opposite Colin Firth in the 1997 rom-com ""Fever Pitch."" She's also known to British audiences for roles in ""EastEnders,"" ""Tracy Beaker,"" and ""Home Fires.""

Francis starred in ""Small Axe,"" ""Once Upon a Time,"" and ""The Wheel of Time.""

The Evil Stepmother in this Cinderella story and the season's villain is Lady Araminta, played by Katie Leung.

Leung is most famous for playing Cho Chang in the ""Harry Potter"" films. She also had a voice role in ""Arcane,"" and appeared in ""The Wheel of Time,"" ""The Peripheral,"" and ""T2 Trainspotting.""

Posy (Wei) is the nicer of the two sisters and has a less adversarial relationship with Sophie than her sister Rosamund and her mother. Wei has appeared in the Netflix series ""1899"" and ""Black Doves.""

Rosamund (Mao) takes after her mother in more ways than one, including her disdain for Sophie. Mao most recently appeared in the film ""A Big Bold Beautiful Journey."" She's also been in ""Goosebumps,"" ""Metal Lords,"" and ""FBI: Most Wanted.""

Sophie is close with the other servants at Penwood House, including Alfie (Moorst) and Irma (Marr). Both are instrumental in getting her to the masquerade ball in the season premiere.

This is Moorst's first major role, though he has had small roles in ""Killing Eve"" and ""Grantchester.""

Marr will be familiar to fans of ""My Fault: London."" She also appeared in an episode of ""Ted Lasso.""

The staff at Bridgerton House includes housekeeper Mrs. Wilson (Geraldine Alexander); a footman, John (Oli Higginson); a maid, Celia (Sophie Lamont); and a new maid, Hazel (Gracie McGonigal).

Mrs. Wilson, John, and Celia have all been background players in the first three seasons of ""Bridgerton"" (and ""Queen Charlotte), but this season, since Sophie is also a maid, the staff will play a larger role.

Alexander is a staple on British TV: She's appeared in ""EastEnders,"" ""Doctors,"" ""Coronation Street,"" and more.

Higginson is predominantly a theater actor, as is McGonigal. Lamont had an uncredited role in ""The Batman.""

Lady Portia Featherington is the leader of the Featherington family. Now that her daughters have all married and had children, Portia should be able to relax this season, but a conflict with her housekeeper, Mrs. Varley, may prevent that.

Fans may recognize Walker from her appearances in Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Emma,"" ""Clash of the Titans,"" or ""John Carter."" She also appeared in ""Dune: Prophecy"" and was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work in ""Rome.""

Like Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Varley has been around in the background since the beginning of ""Bridgerton,"" usually to help her employer, Portia, scheme. But this season, Varley is in high demand as a housekeeper.

Ashbourne has been in British series such as ""Grantchester,"" ""Midsomer Murders,"" and ""The Crown.""

Fun fact: Ashbourne has been married to Andy Serkis since 2002.

The first season of ""Bridgerton"" introduced audiences to Queen Charlotte, a real-life monarch who reigned in England in the late 18th and early 19th century, as played by Rosheuvel. She also plays her in the spin-off, ""Queen Charlotte.""

Rosheuvel has a long TV résumé, appearing in British shows including ""Luther,"" ""Coronation Street,"" and ""EastEnders.""

On the big screen, Rosheuvel played Shadout Mapes in ""Dune.""

Lady Danbury has been a fan-favorite since season one, largely due to the performance by Andoh. She's been one of Queen Charlotte's closest friends since her coronation, as seen in ""Queen Charlotte.""

This season, Lady Danbury seems to have tired of society and has even ceded the first ball of the season to Violet Bridgerton.

Like Rosheuvel, Andoh has been acting in British TV for decades. Since ""Bridgerton,"" she has appeared in ""The Witcher"" and ""The Red King.""

Brimsley has also been on the show since season one and made appearances on ""Queen Charlotte."" Viewers have seen that he cares deeply about the Queen, even if she doesn't always treat him well.

Sachs is best known for his role in the British sitcom ""Benidorm."" He was also in an episode of ""Andor.""

Will and Alice were introduced in season one as friends of Simon's (Regé-Jean Page). Originally, the Mondriches were working-class, but they have since moved up in the world. By season four, Lady Danbury has high hopes for Alice and a potential friendship with the Queen.

""Bridgerton"" is the biggest role for both Imhangbe and Naomi. Before the show, Imhangbe was mainly a stage actor, and Naomi had appeared in British TV shows. This year, she appeared in ""What It Feels Like for a Girl.""

Mr. and Mrs. Crabtree are the caretakers of Benedict's country home, charmingly named My Cottage (any ""Heated Rivalry"" fans know that a cottage in a romance story means business).

Brown is best known for playing Septa Mordane in the first season of ""Game of Thrones,"" though she is a well-known theater actor.

Boyle has been in projects since the '70s, including films like ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""A United Kingdom."" He's also been in many theater productions and British TV series.

The Minnesota Star Tribune is the state's biggest newspaper, and has been doing an excellent job of covering every angle of ""Operation Metro Surge"" — the federal government's mass deportation effort that started in December.

But it is also competing in a real-time news environment where everyone is a reporter, and cellphone videos and social media posts are widely distributed. I first saw the killing of protester Alex Pretti via a Reddit post someone sent to me Saturday morning.

That poses a challenge for Kathleen Hennessey, the paper's top editor: In a world where everyone can see everything — or, at least, lots of things — in close to real time, what can her publication do to set itself apart?

I talked to Hennessey about what her outlet does well — and what it's not doing, at least yet — earlier this week for my Channels podcast. Below is an edited excerpt from our conversation.

Peter Kafka: This is a story that's being covered by lots of different sources, including lots of individuals posting videos from their phones. How do you handle reporting on a video that lots of people have already seen, and seems quite clear? How many checks do you have to do before you can say ""This is what happened"" as opposed to ""There's a video that appears to show this?""

Kathleen Hennessey: We are very careful. We know that a video that appears to show something does not mean that that is exactly what happened. Our language is careful. And we recognize we're not going to have every single video first, obviously.

Our job is to verify it, and to watch it closely, and to slow it down a thousand times, to try to get the rights to it, and to call the lawyers, and figure out who took it. To do the hard work.

And inevitably, that just means that we'll be slower than social media. But we'll be more accurate and more careful and fuller.

What do you say to readers who say, ""I'm seeing this thing on Reddit or Instagram. Why don't you guys have it?""

As a journalist, it never feels good to have somebody send you an account and say, ""See? Look, this is what happened!"" And you have to say, ""Yeah, I guess we're not quite reporting it that way. Yet."" We're all competitive, and we know the importance of speed, but we're really trying to hold to our process here.

You've mentioned that your staff spends time chasing ""ghosts"" — stories that might be real, or not. What's an example of that?

A lot of the story, as everyone knows, is being reported through these Signal channels that various activists and neighborhood groups are on. And they're saying, ""ICE reported here, ICE reported there."" And you either get there instantly, or you are there in the aftermath. And they maybe were there, or maybe it was just somebody else in a rental car …

I just think that's the nature of this. It's a hard story to cover that way. I think we're better positioned than some outlets because we're just closer to the community. We know these neighborhoods. We know what's real, what's not. We have had some luck in getting ahead of that and getting better and more solid information first.

Have you thought about saying, ""Look, if this stuff is going to exist on social media, why don't we find some way of collecting it for our readers, because most normal people don't see all of the videos? We can say it's not verified, but you ought to see it.""

We're having those conversations. I don't think people come to us for unverified information. Right? Our job is to show them what is verified and what is real.

And we've all had that experience where we've seen a video on social media and then we ask, ""Wait, what is that?"" And then we go Google the real thing.

Our job is to be additive and to confirm and to name places and dates and locations and get reaction and comment from federal law enforcement officials and others. To really paint the fuller picture.

So we are not yet at the point where we're trying to just gobble up all the [user-generated video], and throw it on our site and say ""Here."" But we are collecting a lot of it, for the production of journalism, going forward.

Editor's note: After this story was published, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ended its ""enhanced activities"" in the state.After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a ""No ICE"" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly.

Gerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung ""No ICE"" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state.

For Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business.

""The posters are up, and they're not coming down,"" Gerry said.

Business Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.

Also on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign.

Gerry said that some owners he's been speaking with favor taking part in the stoppage, and others are calling for businesses to remain open to divert profits to groups helping immigrants.

Already this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. His current thought: Close for the day and donate weekend proceeds to charities helping those affected by the immigration sweep.

These are the sorts of calculations that many small-business owners across the US have considered over the past few months. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week.

While some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action.

Some workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention.

Gerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep.

He said he contacted restaurant review sites to flag the negative ratings, and he and his co-owners instructed the restaurant's more than 50 staffers on how to handle negative phone calls. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to ""review bomb"" the restaurant.

Earlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a ""No ICE"" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. The following week, she attended an online training conducted by a chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union about where federal agents are permitted to go within a business if they don't have a warrant.

Millecchia said she feels she's in a more privileged position to speak up than some other shopkeepers.

""I'm the white lady who can yell,"" she said.

Yet, Millecchia said, motioning toward the poster, the sign is a ""hollow gesture"" — other than the show of support it sends.

What is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said.

""They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here,"" she said, referring to the presence of federal officers.

That could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. Another disruption: She plans to close on Friday to support the strike.

An ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment.

On the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. The cards were printed in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Somali, and Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in parts of Africa.

An employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community.

He estimated that foot traffic at the store had fallen by at least half from what's typical for January.

At a skate shop called Mocean, owner Jasper Tripp said he hung a ""No ICE"" sign because it aligned with his beliefs. Ordinarily, he said, he tries to separate his political views from the store he has run for nearly a decade.

""It just feels right,"" Tripp said of the decision to put up the poster. He worked with an artist to design an anti-ICE T-shirt. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said.

For some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. One restaurant owner said she plans to shut down for at least a week — and pay workers — while she's out of town. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.

She asked that Business Insider not use her name or that of her restaurant to protect her employees, who she said are legal immigrants but who nevertheless feel threatened.

She taped a ""No ICE"" poster to the door to help employees and customers to feel safe, not to denounce immigration agents, she said.

The balance is tricky, the owner added. ""I have the responsibility to keep people safe. I also have an economic responsibility.""

Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist widely referred to as the ""Godfather of AI,"" doesn't feel great about the technology he helped create — but he sees at least one bright spot.

During an interview with ""BBC Newsnight"" that was released last week, Hinton was asked for an example of a good AI use case that makes him feel proud about his role in developing generative AI.

""Uses in education,"" Hinton said, specifically highlighting the Alpha School in the US.

The Alpha School is a network of private institutions that embrace AI-based learning for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The schools use a two-hour learning model, where students complete their core subjects in just a couple hours through the use of AI, freeing up their afternoons to work with teachers on life skills and hands-on workshops.

Hinton said this model, where students can learn with AI instead of classroom lectures and where teachers can focus their time with students on projects and social interaction, was ""a much better use of a teacher's time.""

""A normal teacher is in broadcast mode in a classroom, where they're telling the children the answers to questions the children didn't just wonder about,"" Hinton said. ""Whereas with an AI tutor, the AI tutor can always be telling you the answers to questions you did just wonder about, and you learn much faster that way.""

Hinton said the Alpha School was expensive because AI is expensive, but said he expects it to become much cheaper as the technology becomes more affordable.

Tuition at many Alpha School locations, which can be found in California, Florida, and Texas, among other state, can range from $40,000 to $75,000 a year. The network also includes some locations with tuition in the $10,000 to $15,000 range.

Joe Liemandt, the principal of Alpha School, has said the minimum pay for teachers is $100,000 in order to attract great talent.

While he was optimistic about the uses of AI in education, Hinton told ""BBC Newsnight"" he didn't feel the same about AI generally.

""It makes me very sad that I put my life into developing this stuff and that it's now extremely dangerous and people aren't taking the dangers seriously enough,"" he said.

Federal safety regulators have opened an investigation after a Waymo self-driving vehicle hit a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the incident happened on January 23 during morning school drop-off hours, within two blocks of a school.

In its preliminary evaluation, NHTSA said the child ran into the street from behind a double-parked SUV and was hit by the autonomous vehicle, which was operating without a human safety driver.

In a statement published on its website, Waymo said it voluntarily notified NHTSA on the day of the incident and is cooperating fully with the agency's investigation.

Waymo said in its statement that as soon as the car detected the child, it ""braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.""

The child suffered minor injuries, Waymo reported, according to NHTSA.

NHTSA is now examining whether Waymo's automated driving system exercised appropriate caution in a school zone and how the vehicle responded after the impact.

The investigation comes as Waymo faces heightened scrutiny over the safety of its autonomous vehicles.

In recent months, the company has dealt with a series of incidents, including a crash on Sunday in Los Angeles involving a Waymo vehicle driven by a human employee and a federal recall in May affecting more than 1,200 vehicles after robotaxis collided with chains or gates.

Last December, regulators also examined incidents in which Waymo vehicles stalled in busy intersections, disrupting traffic in San Francisco.

As a kid, I pored over maps, flags, and history books, curious about what life looked like in far-off corners of the world. At the same time, I was quietly struggling with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often left me feeling trapped inside my own mind.

One night during my freshman year at the University of Miami, I came across an article in my apartment that stunned me. It said that more people had been to space than had visited every country in the world. 

Finding that out changed the direction of my life. I decided to set out on a mission to visit every country, not just as a travel goal, but as a way to confront my OCD and prove to myself that it didn't have to dictate the limits of my life.

Over the next few years of college, I saved aggressively while working in nightlife marketing in Miami, putting aside just enough to make the trip possible if I budgeted carefully and kept costs low.

When I told my parents about my plan, they laughed and shrugged it off, not quite taking me seriously. Not long after, I called one of my best friends. He laughed too and said just two words: ""Good luck.""

After graduating, I made it my mission. I backpacked mostly alone across conflict zones, remote islands, and places at the center of ancient history. On April 3, 2025, I reached my 195th and final country in North Korea. The journey was verified by NomadMania, the world's largest travel community, which confirmed that I was the youngest person ever to have visited every country.

After completing my mission, a few places stood out as truly unforgettable. These are three cities I always suggest others experience — and one I wouldn't rush back to.

Out of the hundreds of cities I've visited in my life, Sydney is my favorite. What stood out most was how relaxed and welcoming people were. The pace reminded me of my hometown in San Diego, with the same laid-back energy but an even greater sense of warmth.

One morning, while sitting at a café, an older couple at the table next to me struck up a conversation and started sharing their favorite places around the city. They talked about the coastal walks they loved, which neighborhoods were worth spending time in, and the restaurants they kept going back to. Interactions like that happened often enough that the friendliness stopped feeling like a novelty and became part of everyday life.

As I explored the city, I kept noticing how naturally beautiful it was. More than 100 beaches are within reach, including Bondi, where I watched surfers roll in with the tide. In the city center, I wandered through different neighborhoods and took in the mix of historic architecture and modern design. The sunsets were especially memorable. I watched ferries cut across the water as the skyline came into view, framed by the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.

Sydney is the kind of city I could easily imagine building a life in.

Valletta felt like a living crossroads of history from the moment I arrived. Sitting at the center of the Mediterranean, the city reflects centuries of Italian, Arab, British, and North African influence, all packed into a compact, walkable capital. 

I'd walk past waterfront cafés and, minutes later, find myself standing on the city's fortified walls, looking out over waters once traveled by Phoenician traders, Ottoman fleets, and British warships.

What surprised me most about Valletta was how under-visited it felt compared to much of southern Europe. Even during peak season, it never felt overrun. A short ferry ride away, I spent time on the island of Gozo, where life moved even slower. I visited ancient temples older than the Egyptian pyramids and passed through small villages where fishing and farming still shape daily life.

Experiencing Gozo made Valletta feel even more special: a historic capital with easy access to a quieter, older side of the Mediterranean.

Krabi wasn't even on my radar at first, and it ended up being one of the last places I reached on my journey. A Thai friend I'd met years earlier on the junior tennis circuit told me it was the most beautiful part of the country and insisted I couldn't miss it.

He was right. Krabi Town is the province's main city, but most travelers use ""Krabi"" to refer to the surrounding beaches and islands — and few places on Earth combine land and sea as dramatically. At Railay Beach, limestone cliffs rise from turquoise water, creating a backdrop unlike anything else I've seen.

I took day trips through Phang Nga Bay and out toward the nearby Phi Phi Islands, weaving past mangrove forests and hidden coves that felt largely untouched. And then there was the food. For a few dollars, I could get a delicious local meal and a fresh dragon fruit smoothie from a roadside stall or beachside café.

Krabi is a reminder that some of the most memorable places aren't always part of the original plan.

India was one of the countries I was most excited to visit, and it delivered some amazing experiences. Seeing the Taj Mahal in Agra lived up to every expectation, and witnessing the ancient religious rituals along the Ganges in Varanasi was one of the most powerful cultural moments I've experienced anywhere in the world.

That said, New Delhi isn't a place I feel a strong pull to return to. The air quality was poor enough that I found myself coughing constantly, making it uncomfortable to spend much time outside. In a city of more than 22 million people, the traffic was relentless, adding to a sense of chaos that, unlike in other busy cities I've loved, never felt energizing. Compared to other parts of India, I also didn't find the city's main sights as compelling.

I'm glad I went, and India as a whole left a lasting impression on me. But if I were planning another trip, New Delhi wouldn't be on my list.

Elon Musk recently said that saving for retirement could become ""irrelevant"" in the next decade, as new technologies promise to create such an abundance of resources that nobody will need a nest egg.

Dario Amodei warned this week that achieving a plentiful future won't be easy. The CEO of Anthropic, the AI startup behind ChatGPT-rival Claude, wrote in an essay that AI promises to ""raise the quality of life for everyone"" — but there will be a brutal ""rite of passage"" to get there.

Amodei said that at the current rate of progress, ""it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything.""

Replacing human labor with AI could supercharge economic growth and productivity, but the ""short-term shock will be unprecedented in size,"" he wrote.

Amodei said he was worried that workers displaced by AI ""could form an unemployed or very-low-wage 'underclass,'"" and a tiny minority could capture most of the financial gains from AI, creating a ""level of wealth concentration that will break society.""

He described those potential impacts on labor and equality as ""grave problems"" that AI companies, employers, philanthropists, and governments would have to work together to solve.

Amodei noted that he and Anthropic's other cofounders have pledged to donate 80% of their wealth to good causes, and the company will match individual donations from its staff worth billions of dollars at its current valuation.

Anthropic's boss shared a similar vision to Musk in a 2024 essay. He wrote that AI will eventually become ""so broadly effective and so cheap"" that the current economic system will ""no longer make sense.""

It could be replaced by a ""large universal basic income for everyone,"" or a ""capitalist economy of AI systems"" that distributes ""huge amounts"" of resources to people as the ""overall economic pie will be gigantic,"" he added.

But he also flagged the risk of ""exploitative or dystopian directions"" and said, ""We will likely have to fight to get a good outcome here.""

Business Insider recently spoke to seven AI and personal finance gurus about Musk's vision, and they shared several of Amodei's concerns.

They urged Americans to keep saving for retirement just in case Musk is wrong — and said that even if he's right, making sure everyone reaps the rewards of AI will require immense planning and coordination.

In this article

Alphabet-owned Waymo has informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that one of its driverless vehicles ""struck a child near an elementary school"" in Santa Monica, California

The Jan. 23 incident is now being investigated by the U.S. vehicle safety authority.

According to records posted to the NHTSA website, the child sustained minor injuries. 

The Waymo collision occurred within two blocks of an elementary school during normal school drop-off hours, while other children, a crossing guard and several double-parked vehicles were nearby. 

""The child ran across the street from behind a double-parked SUV towards the school and was struck by the Waymo AV,"" NHTSA said in a document describing the incident that necessitated their ""preliminary evaluation.""

The vehicle was running on Waymo's 5th Generation Automated Driving System with no human safety supervisor in the vehicle. 

NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigations plans to assess ""whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users."" 

The agency's investigation will include analysis of the ""intended behavior"" of Waymo's driverless vehicles in school zones and neighboring areas, especially during normal school pick-up and drop-off times, as well as the company's post-impact response.

""Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made,"" Waymo said in a statement on their blog.

The company wrote that a fully attentive human driver in the same situation would have likely ""made contact with the pedestrian"" at a higher speed of 14 miles per hour.

""This significant reduction in impact speed and severity is a demonstration of the material safety benefit of the Waymo Driver,"" the company said.

After the robotaxi struck the child at low speed, the pedestrian ""stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911,"" Waymo said. The company also reported that its vehicle ""remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene.""

Waymo was involved in a separate incident on Jan. 25 in Los Angeles, where one of its Zeekr vehicles sped through a one-way residential street near Dodger Stadium. The vehicle struck several parked cars, including one that had a person in it.

There were no reported injuries, Waymo said in an emailed response.

The vehicle was being operated in manual mode by a human specialist at the time of the event. Waymo did not respond to questions about how the vehicle ended up speeding in the incident.

Waymo is already facing regulatory scrutiny for the behavior of its robotaxis around school buses. 

Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board initiated an investigation after reports of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing stopped school buses in several different locations. 

In a statement posted on X on January 23, the NTSB said it ""opened a safety investigation to examine the interaction between Waymo vehicles and school buses stopped for loading and unloading students in Austin, Texas.""

The Austin Independent School District previously identified at least 19 incidents where Waymo vehicles passed its school buses, and demanded that Waymo stop using its driverless vehicles during school bus hours in Austin until the safety concerns could be resolved.

NHTSA had earlier started ""to investigate the performance of the Waymo ADS around stopped school buses and the system's ability to follow traffic safety laws concerning school buses,"" it said in a letter the agency sent to Waymo.

While both the NTSB and NHTSA are vehicle safety watchdogs in the U.S. government, their roles are distinct.The NTSB investigates accidents to determine underlying causes of damaging or concerning incidents. The board also makes safety recommendations to regulators (including NHTSA) and the auto industry.

President Donald Trump is holding a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday.

The meeting comes as Trump and other administration officials seek to de-escalate tensions over immigration enforcement activities in Minnesota, where federal agents in the past month have killed two U.S. citizens during confrontations over immigration actions.

There is a risk that there will be a partial shutdown of the U.S. government later this week over opposition by Democratic senators to passing a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement.

On Wednesday, Trump in a social media post said, ""A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose.""

The warning came as Trump has pressured Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program and to cease a brutal crackdown on protestors domestically.

In this article

It's a tale of two different megacaps so far this earnings season when it comes to artificial intelligence.

Meta Platforms surged more than 8% after showing signs that AI investments are boosting the bottom line, while Microsoft shares dropped as the company struggled to justify recent spending plans to investors and showed a slowdown in its cloud segment. 

The money flowing into AI and new technology has been a major source of debate on Wall Street as investors increasingly want to see that companies are reaping rewards from the massive spending over the last year. 

Meta appeared to gain approval from investors to keep putting money into AI. The social media giant issued strong guidance and said it plans to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on its AI build-out this year.

That's nearly double what it spent in 2025.

In past quarters, investors have raised concerns over the company's ambitious spending. However, the company's 24% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled primarily by online advertising, seemed to ease previous worries about its AI strategy.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested the company is working on a range of new products this year and said investments would support his mission for ""building personal super intelligence.""

But while investors seemed to reward Meta's spending plans, Microsoft's stock plummeted more than 11% and headed for its worst day since March 2020. 

The software maker showed slowing growth in its Azure cloud segment, which declined to 39% growth from 40% growth in the company's first fiscal quarter. Investors closely watch the segment as a stand-in for measuring enterprise AI demand.

At the same time, capital expenditures and finance leases in the quarter jumped 66% to $37.5 billion, surpassing the $34.31 billion expected by analysts polled by Visible Alpha, as Microsoft supports demand for its cloud and AI segments.

The company also said its struggling with compute capacity constraints as demand continues to outweigh supply. 

Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said Azure would have grown 40% if the company had funneled all of its new graphics processing unit chips in the first and second quarter into its Azure business.

She also said the company is balancing having ""incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand"" with product innovation and growing first-party AI usage in services like GitHub Copilot and M365 Copilot. 

The company's demand backlog rose to $625 billion, up 110%, which included a $250 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI during the period. The ChatGPT maker accounted for 45% of its commercial remaining performance obligations. 

Analysts at Evercore ISI said ""concerns about OpenAI's ability to meet funding commitments"" likely contributed to the post-earnings stock spiral but called the sentiment ""overblown.""

The contrasting AI-fueled moves bled into the broader technology sector. 

IBM gained a wave of confidence from investors in its AI strategy, with shares popping 8%. The technology and consulting company topped expectations and showed strong software and infrastructure growth as it builds out new automation tools and AI infrastructure. 

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the software and infrastructure growth, coupled with market share gains in consulting, put the company on ""track to complete its pivot to long-term growth.""

Meanwhile, IBM's AI book of business more than doubled to $12.5 billion from $5 billion a year ago. That growth seemed to justify the company's investments.

Analysts at JPMorgan called IBM a ""relatively defensive name with increasingly favorable exposure to Software and AI tailwinds.""

Yet ServiceNow shares dropped 11% as concerns that AI is eating away at the broader software sector's business model overshadowed the company's better-than-expected earnings. Its stock has declined 25% already since the start of 2026 and 50% over the last year.

The sector has sold off in recent months on worries that new AI tools will deteriorate demand for their workflows and licenses and put a dent in long-standing revenue models. 

During an earnings call with analysts, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott defended the company's business model and recent multibillion acquisition spree, which some investors had flagged as a sign that the company is trying to restart growth. 

""Let's clear it up with the facts,"" he said. ""Enterprise AI will be the largest driver of return on the multitrillion-dollar supercycle of investment in AI infrastructure.""

U.S. border czar Tom Homan on Thursday said federal immigration enforcement agencies are working on a plan to reduce their massive presence in Minnesota, while broadly acknowledging problems with the Trump administration's activities there.

""I'm not here because the federal government has carried its mission out perfectly,"" Homan said at a press conference in Minneapolis, where an aggressive surge in federal deportation efforts has stoked major civil unrest.

Homan said he and President Donald Trump, ""along with others in the administration, have recognized that certain improvements could and should be made.""

Trump on Monday sent Homan to Minneapolis to manage U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's operations. The announcement came two days after federal agents killed a second U.S. citizen, Alex Pretti, in the city during altercations that were caught on camera.

Homan on Thursday said he is in conversation with state and local officials, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

""This is common sense cooperation that allows to draw down on the number of people we have here. Yes, I said it, draw down the number of people here,"" Homan said.

ICE and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency are ""working on a drawdown plan,"" he said.

In this article

Starbucks is reintroducing tiers to its North American loyalty program in a bid to encourage coffee drinkers to visit more frequently as part of its broader turnaround strategy.

The company made the announcement on Thursday at its investor day. Executives across the business are sharing more details on Starbucks' plans to drive future sales growth and profitability, including through its all-important loyalty program.

Starbucks Rewards has existed since 2009. The company, long seen as a leader in restaurant technology, relies on its loyalty program to encourage members to visit more frequently and spend more money. In fiscal 2025, the transactions linked to the Rewards program accounted for 60% of the company's revenue.

But the coffee chain also has to balance offering members enticing rewards with maintaining profit margins. In 2019, the company eliminated the two-tiered system, saying that the change was meant to encourage new members to become more engaged. The company now feels that system does not appropriately reward its most loyal customers.

""Our very best customers are coming 200 times a year, and we were treating them the same as someone who comes once a year,"" Starbucks Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman, who joined the company in November 2024, told CNBC's Kate Rogers. ""So we've introduced tiers.""

The tiered program will return on March 10, this time with three levels.

Starbucks Rewards members with fewer than 500 ""stars"" — or points — will belong to the green tier. They can enjoy a free drink or food item on their birthday, receive early access to select menu items and get personalized offers. Green-tier members' stars won't expire for six months, and they can keep them from expiring in several ways, like redeeming a reward or making a purchase.

Once a customer earns 500 stars over a 12-month period, Starbucks upgrades them to the gold tier. Their points never expire, and they earn 1.2 stars for every dollar they spend.

Members can level up to reserve tier after earning 2,500 stars over a 12-month period. Customers at this level get access to exclusive merchandise and events, and they earn 1.7 points per dollar spent.

The current Starbucks Rewards program gives members two stars for every dollar they spend when they pay with a preloaded Starbucks gift card. If they pay with a credit or debit card, members earn just one star per dollar spent.

The rewards available for redemption are largely staying the same, although Starbucks is adding the option for a $2 discount on any order in exchange for 60 stars. 

The company is also adding ""Free Mod Mondays,"" which give loyalty program members a complimentary modification to any drink on a select Monday, once per month.

The announcement comes on the heels of the company releasing its earnings report on Wednesday morning. For the first time in nearly four years, Starbucks saw traffic from both Rewards members and nonmembers grow during the quarter. 

""You have to win both with your Rewards customers and — call it — the light or infrequent customer,"" CEO Brian Niccol said on the company's earnings call on Wednesday.

In this article

DETROIT — General Motors is proving to be a star tightrope walker when it comes to balancing its profits, vehicle portfolio and political whiplashing under the Trump administration.

The Detroit automaker's 2025 results propelled GM's stock Tuesday to a fresh record high as the company beat earnings expectations and projected an even better 2026, including a 20% increase in its dividend and a new $6 billion stock buyback authorization.

Those kinds of results are nothing new for GM, but Wall Street analysts say the company is drawing more investor interest than its peers amid the U.S. auto industry's slowing sales, political turmoil and tariffs.

""GM stands out for strong execution, proven resilience, high earnings quality (i.e. strong [free cash flow] amid inventory de-stock), capital allocation and a unique NA Truck Franchise sporting far better fundamentals vs. traditional passenger auto,"" TD Cowen analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a Tuesday investor note.

Shares of GM are up more than 70% during the past year, with multiple Wall Street analysts raising their price targets to record levels after earnings, including TD Cowen, which hiked its target Tuesday by 10% to $122 per share.

GM is also increasingly standing out from its closest U.S. rivals Ford Motor and Stellantis when it comes to earnings performance and capital execution, according to many analysts.

""We rate GM Overweight for its best-in-class execution amongst North America–based auto OEMs, consistent management team and strategy, and strong product portfolio allowing for above-industry pricing and margin,"" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a Tuesday investor note.

Ford's shares are up more than 35% during the past year, but its adjusted earnings forecast for the year is roughly half of what GM reported for 2025. Its adjusted free cash flow expectations also are billions below GM's in recent years.

U.S.-listed shares of Stellantis, which is going through a major restructuring, are off roughly 27% over the past year. The company's results have largely disappointed Wall Street recently, as it attempts to focus on a U.S. turnaround.

GM's 2025 results included $2.7 billion in net income attributable to stockholders, or earnings per share of $3.27; adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $12.7 billion, or $10.60 per share; and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10.6 billion.

Part of what's set GM apart has been its ability to navigate through political uncertainty under U.S. President Donald Trump.

The biggest challenge for the automotive industry as a whole has been increased costs due to tariffs and inflation. GM expects tariffs will cost it $3.5 billion and inflation will be a $1.25 billion, at the midpoints, in 2026.

But GM plans to mitigate some of that. The automaker expects to offset those costs with $500 million to $750 million in regulatory savings under Trump policies, narrower EV losses of $1 billion to $1.5 billion from lower production, and billions of dollars in other benefits such as pricing and warranty expenses.

""For '26, commodity and onshoring headwinds could be offset by regulatory benefits, warranty improvements, narrowing EV losses, and lower tariffs resulting from USMCA negotiations,"" RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan said in a Tuesday investor note.

More broadly, the automaker's EV retreat, including $7.9 billion in write-downs last year, means it's going to continue to sell more profitable traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.

And GM can now produce as many gas-guzzling vehicles as the company would like without federal penalties, which were eliminated by the Trump administration. It will also save billions of dollars on purchasing credits to offset such penalties.

GM CFO Paul Jacobson said on a call with investors Tuesday that no matter what changes come to the auto industry, GM's success depends on its ability to adapt to new environments and the profitability of its vehicles.

""In the face of a rapidly evolving industry and significant macro challenges, the resilience and adaptability of the GM team have been truly exceptional,"" he said.

GM's balancing act is easier when it can fall, if needed, onto piles of cash. Jacobson on Tuesday noted the company had more than $20 billion to end last year, referring to its $12.7 billion of EBIT-adjusted earnings and $10.6 billion of adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2025.

The Detroit automaker has been able to increase its average annual free cash flow generation from $3 billion to $10 billion over the past five years. 

""This robust cash generation enables us to execute confidently across all pillars of our capital allocation framework,"" Jacobson said. ""Looking ahead to 2026 and 2027, we expect to invest $10 billion to $12 billion annually, including approximately $5 billion to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity for some of the highest-demand vehicles and further reduce our tariff exposure.""

That cash flow has been in addition to returning $23 billion back to shareholders through repurchases since November 2023. That has helped boost the company's stock price by eliminating more than 465 million shares, or nearly 35%, of its outstanding shares that are now at about 930 million.

GM was among the first major automakers to report its fourth-quarter and 2025 earnings. Its performance puts pressure on others to prove their tightrope-walking ability as well.

""We think it's important to remember this is a very different business today vs. the GM of a decade ago, with a much more resilient earnings profile than appreciated, and a more balanced and pragmatic approach to investment. GM seems on track to return to the same robust earnings level achieved in recent years, even with tariff costs in its cost structure,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a Wednesday investor note.

GM also alluded to its costs and earnings continuing to improve post-2026 as it works to realign its lineup, improve costs and onshore more production to the U.S.

GM's 2026 earnings guidance includes net income attributable to stockholders of between $10.3 billion and $11.7 billion; adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $13 billion to $15 billion; and earnings per share of between $11 and $13 for the year.

The IRS owes some taxpayers refunds after they were mistakenly left out of a pandemic-era IRS relief program, according to a new watchdog audit.

More than 2,100 taxpayers have had their tax accounts corrected after auditors found they were collectively eligible for an estimated $463,000, according to a recently released report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.

TIGTA's audit found that 2,138 taxpayers, representing 2,248 tax accounts, should have been eligible for relief from so-called failure-to-pay penalties related to unpaid taxes for 2020 and 2021. The average penalty refund owed per account was $206, the watchdog said, although the exact amount depended on the specifics of the taxpayer's situation.

The IRS has credited the overlooked taxpayers' accounts by the amount owed to them, according to the report. Those adjustments generally either reduce any balance owed or may be refunded via a check or direct deposit if there's no balance.

Nearly 5 million individuals, businesses, trusts, estates, and tax-exempt organizations already received about $1 billion in penalty relief under the temporary failure-to-pay waiver by the IRS. The relief period, announced by the IRS in December 2023, began on the date that the agency issued an initial balance-due notice to a taxpayer, or Feb. 5, 2022, whichever was later, and ended on March 31, 2024.

Generally, the penalty for paying taxes late is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or partial month, and can reach a maximum of 25%. The IRS also charges interest on amounts due, and the rate, which accrues daily, is equal to the federal funds rate plus three percentage points.

There's also a failure-to-file penalty if you don't file your tax return by the due date. That penalty is 5% of the unpaid tax amount for each month or partial month that the return is late, and accrues up to a maximum of 25%.

""As you can see, this adds up quickly,"" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas.

""Always file even if you cannot pay. The IRS will work with you,"" Youngblood said. ""There are a variety of resolutions available.""

As the 2026 tax-filing season gets underway, there may be some reasons to get a jumpstart on preparing your tax return to avoid potential penalties and interest charges.

For starters, be aware that if you mail your returns, it's worth getting to the post office plenty of time ahead of the tax-filing deadline, which is April 15. 

Due to operational changes at the U.S. Postal Service, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and it no longer is always applied the same day you mail an item.

So, while the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, you can't assume that dropping your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked the day you drop it off. You can either mail it well in advance or ask the clerk to manually cancel it.

Given additional challenges such as the 27% workforce reduction at the IRS and tax law changes from President Trump's so-called big beautiful bill, ""the success of the filing season will be defined by how well the IRS is able to assist the millions of taxpayers who experience problems,"" National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins said in her annual report to Congress.

The IRS expects about 164 million individual tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline.

Crude oil prices rose more than 2% on Thursday as President Donald Trump weighed military strikes on OPEC member Iran. 

U.S. crude rose $1.56, or 2.5%, to $64.77 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent was up $1.59, or 2.3%, to $69.99 per barrel.

Multiple sources told Reuters that Trump is weighing targeted strikes on Iranian security forces and leaders to inspire anti-government protesters. The president wants to create conditions for regime change, two U.S. sources told Reuters. 

The Islamic Republic launched a security crackdown earlier this month to quell protests, leaving thousands dead. 

The oil market is monitoring whether the unrest in Iran and possible military intervention by the U.S. could lead to a disruption of crude supplies in the region.

Trump has deployed the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the Middle East, warning Iran on Wednesday that time is running out to make a deal on its nuclear program.

The president threatened Tehran with larger strikes than the attack the U.S. launched last June, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities. 

""The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post.

In this article

Comcast posted mixed results for its fourth quarter on Thursday, beating analyst expectations on earnings but slightly missing on revenue. 

Once again, Comcast's broadband business showed signs of significant competition facing cable companies. Comcast said it lost 181,000 domestic broadband customers during the period, although it said the losses were offset by an increase in international subscribers. 

The company's mobile offering remained a bright spot, notching 364,000 additions during the period and bringing its total to more than 9.3 million mobile customers for Comcast's newest business. 

Last year, Comcast said it was shifting its strategy to focus more on growing its mobile business after facing continued pressure in broadband, mainly due to competition from wireless providers like Verizon and T-Mobile. 

""The competitive environment for broadband remains intense, similar to prior quarters, but we saw wireless competition step up towards the end of the fourth quarter,"" said Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong during Thursday's call with investors. ""Against that backdrop, we continue to advance our new go-to-market strategy we launched earlier this year."" 

Here's how Comcast performed in the period ended Dec. 31 compared with average analyst estimates, according to LSEG: 

Net income attributable to Comcast decreased 54.6% to $2.17 billion, or 60 cents per share, compared with $4.78 billion, or $1.24 per share a year earlier. 

Adjusting for certain one-time items — like the value of intangible assets, charges associated with investments and prior-year tax benefits that Comcast said made for an ""unfavorable comparison"" — the company reported adjusted net income of $3.06 billion, or 84 cents per share. 

Comcast's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were down 10% to $7.9 billion. 

The company's overall quarterly revenue was up more than 1% to $32.31 billion. 

Revenue for Comcast's connectivity and platforms unit – which includes its Xfinity-branded services across broadband, pay TV and mobile – was down 1% to $20.24 billion. 

In particular, revenue fell 1% for the domestic broadband unit to roughly $6.32 billion. While this reflected the decrease in broadband customers, it was partially offset by higher average rates, Comcast said. 

In addition to the broadband customer losses and mobile additions, Comcast lost 245,000 pay TV customers during the fourth quarter. The company now has 11.27 million total pay TV customers. 

Meanwhile, revenue for the company's media unit, which includes NBCUniversal, rose 5.5% to $7.62 billion. 

This marks the final quarter that NBCUniversal's earnings report includes its full portfolio of cable networks, as Comcast spun out most of its pay TV networks, including CNBC and MS Now, into the publicly traded entity Versant. 

Domestic advertising revenue for the media business was up 1.5% due to the addition of the NBA on NBC, which helped propel overall revenue.  

NBC's streaming service, Peacock, added 3 million paid customers after three quarters of essentially no change. It ended the year with 44 million paid subscribers. The streaming service reported losses of $552 million for the fourth quarter, wider than the $372 million in losses it recorded in the prior year period.

Those losses were due in part to the impact of the NBA rights deal which began during the quarter. 

Peacock saw $1.6 billion in revenue compared with $1.3 billion the year-ago quarter.

Comcast's Universal film studio revenue was down 7.4% to $3.03 billion due to a drop in licensing and theatrical revenue when compared with the prior-year quarter. The releases of ""Wicked: For Good"" and ""Black Phone 2"" fell short of last year's ""Wicked"" and ""The Bad Robot.""

Universal theme parks revenue, however, was up 22% to roughly $2.9 billion, driven by last year's opening of Epic Universe.

Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of CNBC. Comcast was the parent company of CNBC through the fourth quarter of 2025.

In this article

Starbucks has returned — at least, that's what executives said at the company's investor presentation in New York City on Thursday.

""Starbucks is back today,"" Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said. ""One in three consumers say that Starbucks is their first choice for coffee or tea away from home.""

Her proclamation comes more than a year after CEO Brian Niccol joined the company and kicked off a turnaround strategy, of course named ""Back to Starbucks."" The plan largely took aim at improving the coffee chain's in-store experience, after years of prioritizing mobile orders and profits at the expense of customers and employees. The strategy included small touches, like reintroducing the condiment bar and requiring baristas to use Sharpies to write personal messages, and bigger investments, like staffing more baristas and revamping its cafes for $100,000 a pop.

""Frankly, the shine is back on Starbucks, both here in the United States and around the world,"" Niccol said on Thursday.

The company's latest financial results seem to show that customers are coming back, and the turnaround is taking hold. As a result, this year, Starbucks plans to look forward, rather than back.

""In fiscal 2026, we're going to be shifting to play offense and to innovate,"" Niccol said. ""We're not finished with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan or our broader transformation, but I am confident in our strategy, our progress, the pace of change and the opportunity ahead of us.""

By fiscal 2028, the coffee chain is projecting global and U.S. same-store sales will grow at least 3%, revenue will rise at least 5% and earnings per share of $3.35 to $4. It also plans to add more than 2,000 cafes globally in fiscal 2028, including 400 net new company-owned U.S. locations.

""This is just a waypoint in our turnaround. Our ambitions extend well beyond this timeline,"" Niccol said.

In the coming months, Starbucks plans to reintroduce tiers to its loyalty program, launch Energy Refreshers and more efficient espresso machines, all with the aim of meeting those new financial targets.

Starbucks investors did not appear as confident as executives Thursday: shares of the company slid more than 1% in morning trading. The stock has fallen about 12% over the last year, dragging Starbucks' market value down to about $109 billion. In addition to skepticism about the company's turnaround, investor concerns about the broader pullback in consumer spending and higher coffee prices have weighed on the company's valuation.

The investor day comes a day after the company released its fiscal first-quarter earnings report. 

For the first time in two years, the coffee chain's traffic rose, fueling same-store sales growth of 4%. A year ago, the company's same-store sales fell 4% as transactions shrank 6%.

The company has made progress on some of its goals, like making every drink in under four minutes, CEO Brian Niccol said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday morning.

""This is really just the beginning,"" Niccol said of the company's turnaround.

But while Starbucks' turnaround strategy is bearing fruit on the top line, investments in its restaurants and labor weighed on profits during its fiscal first quarter. The company's quarterly earnings per share missed Wall Street's estimates.

Executives on Wednesday also shared the company's first annual forecast since Niccol suspended its outlook more than a year ago, shortly after taking the helm at Starbucks. For fiscal 2026, Starbucks is projecting adjusted earnings per share in a range of $2.15 to $2.40 and global and U.S. same-store sales growth of at least 3%.

Menu changes like protein cold foam have helped Starbucks draw both loyal and infrequent customers, Niccol  told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. Ahead, the company has more menu innovation on deck, plus changes to its rewards program and an improved digital experience, he added.

Much of that innovation will, of course, focus on Starbucks' drinks. This spring, the coffee chain plans to launch a premium, sugar-free version of its chai, Lieberman said during the investor presentation. 

Starbucks is also going to introduce Energy Refreshers, the latest expansion of its $2 billion drink line. The new additions will contain more caffeine than the original Refreshers, which give drinkers roughly the same boost as a caffeinated soda.

Executives also shared more details on the company's international operations, which will undergo a major transformation when Starbucks forms a joint venture with Boyu Capital to run its business in China, the company's second-largest market. 

After the deal closes in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, pending regulatory approval, Boyu will hold up to a 60% interest in the joint venture. 

While the deal will result in lower international revenue, the division's asset-light model is expected to boost Starbucks' profits in the long run. Over the last decade, McDonald's and Coca-Cola have pursued similar strategies, refranchising their international restaurants and bottlers, respectively, to cut operating costs and lift earnings. 

In fiscal 2025, Starbucks' international margins were 13%; assuming the joint venture is formed, the company expects that margins will rise to the high teens, according to Brady Brewer, CEO of Starbucks International.

Both the fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028 forecasts assume that the company will continue to operate Starbucks' retail stores in China. While the company expects profit margins would rise as part of the plan, overall earnings may not increase quickly.

 Under the joint venture model, the company's earnings per share in fiscal 2028 would fall by about 15 cents, CFO Cathy Smith said. 

""I do want to say that's with our current plans for the China market,"" Smith said. ""We fully expect, with our new partner, that actually we would see higher growth in China ... and so I would think that we would be able to offset some of that into the future.""

In this article

Drugmakers Roche and Sanofi's latest earnings were largely as expected, with the companies talking up the potential of experimental medicines ahead of a looming ""patent cliff"" for Big Pharma.

Both companies' stocks were down less than 1% on Thursday after reporting earnings before the bell.

They are both among the pharmaceutical companies that could see revenue fall dramatically in the coming years unless they top up their pipelines by developing drugs internally or acquiring drug candidates developed by others.

""On the pipeline side, we've had an amazing run of a number of Phase 3 readouts that are going to be instrumental for future growth,"" the CEO Thomas Schinecker told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

""We have a number of medicines that we've now moved into the late stage of development, and we will have up to 19 new medicines that we can launch by the end of the decade.""

Roche forecast 2026 profit growth to outpace sales growth and for adjusted earnings per share to grow by high single digits at constant currencies, the same outlook it issued for 2025.

In the fourth quarter, Roche's sales grew 8%, driven by some of its blockbuster drugs, including the multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus and Tecentriq, a cancer treatment.

Sanofi posted a quarterly beat on both top and bottom lines, and issued 2026 guidance largely in line with expectations.

It reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 13% at constant currencies and earnings per share of 1.53 euros ($1.20), both above forecasts, even with headwinds in its vaccine business thanks to changes in U.S. vaccine policy. 

""Growth was supported by new medicines and Dupixent, reaching a new quarterly high,"" CEO Paul Hudson said in a statement.

Similar to Roche, Sanofi also sees sales growing by high-single digits in 2026, with profit growth ""slightly higher than revenue."" 

""We anticipate profitable growth to continue over at least five years,"" the company said.

Despite the beat and a newly announced 1 billion euro share buyback, the focus for Sanofi investors remains on the company's research and development.

The need to expand the pipeline will put long-term R&D spend and the potential future M&A front and center in Sanofi's earnings call on Thursday afternoon, Jefferies analyst Michael Leuchten said in a note after earnings.

Apart from its experimental breast cancer drug giredestrant and MS treatment fenebrutinib, Roche is betting big on a slice of the lucrative obesity market in the coming years.

The company is facing key loss of exclusivity for some of its best-selling drugs, but CEO Schinecker told CNBC's that this was ""absolutely manageable."" 

On Tuesday, the company reported positive Phase 2 clinical trial results for its weight-loss candidate CT-388. It showed that the drug resulted in a 22.5% weight reduction over 48 weeks, on par with market rivals Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound. The company hopes it to be able to compete in the increasingly crowded market through differentiation.

Last year, Roche also entered into a partnership with Danish Zealand Pharma to co-develop Zealand's drug petrelintide, an amylin analog, as a stand-alone as well as in combination with CT-388.

""We're not investing in [the] first generation of these medicines – we're investing in the next generation,"" CEO Schinecker told CNBC on Thursday.

""We can differentiate in combination with other therapies we have in house, because there are more than 200 comorbidities in neurology, in immunology, in cancer, and none of the other players have the kind of portfolio that we have for combinations,"" he said, adding that there was also windows for differentiation with the longer lasting molecule itself, as well as in diagnostics.

Gold dropped over 4% on Thursday as ‌investors took profits after a record high, yet prices remained on course for their best month since the 1980s amid heightened economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

Spot gold was 4.6% lower at $5,149.99 an ounce by 10:48 a.m. ET (1548 GMT), after earlier touching $5,594.82.

U.S. gold futures for February delivery were down 2.8% at $5,156.20.

""We are ‌seeing a dramatic sell-off after precious metals made new recent all-time highs,"" ​said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.

However, spot gold prices are still up 19% for the month and 3.6% so far this week.

From crypto money to ‍central banks, demand for gold is widening as ""precious metals are well in the limelight and investors always like to go where they can get high returns,"" said GoldSilver Central managing director Brian Lan.

Adding to geopolitical ⁠uncertainty, U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday pressed Iran to negotiate a nuclear deal, while ‍Tehran threatened retaliation against the U.S., Israel, and allies.

On Wednesday, crypto-group Tether's CEO said it plans to allocate 10%-15% ‌of ‌its investment portfolio to physical gold, while the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, saw holdings at a nearly 4-year high.

The U.S. Federal Reserve left rates unchanged on Wednesday, as investors awaited Trump's announcement of a replacement for central bank chair Jerome Powell, whose term ⁠ends in May. Markets ⁠expect the central ​bank to next trim rates in June.

Spot silver lost 6.6% at $108.84 an ounce after reaching $121.64. It has surged more than 50% so far this year, fuelled by supply deficits and momentum buying.

The silver, platinum and ‍palladium markets are small relative to gold or the S&P 500, making them vulnerable to speculative inflows that have left prices ""totally detached from where physical demand is robust,"" said Guy Wolf, global head of market ​analytics at Marex.

Spot platinum fell 1.7% to $2,650.15 an ounce, having ‍hit a record high of $2,918.80 on Monday, while palladium dropped 6.7% to $1,935.

The fatal shooting this weekend of a second American citizen by federal immigration agents in Minnesota has forced corporate leaders to do something they've rarely done since President Donald Trump returned to office last year: publicly disagree with his policies.

For months, executives have kept quiet as the Trump administration expanded its sprawling immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security in recent weeks has sent thousands of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents into Minnesota, leading to violent clashes with protestors.

It wasn't until the Jan. 24 killing of intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents that more CEOs started to break their year of near silence on the president's actions. The following day, dozens of executives from Minnesota-based corporations co-signed a letter calling for an ""immediate de-escalation"" in the state.

Even then, it was clear the business leaders were treading carefully — they didn't mention the name of the shooting victim, the president by name or his policies. Instead of speaking out individually, they published the message as a group.

The reluctance of business leaders — among the most powerful and wealthiest Americans — to explicitly speak out against the president's policies illustrates how Trump has used his power during his second term. Trump has sued media companies, law firms, universities and banks, and he has threatened corporations with regulatory scrutiny and the review of lucrative government contracts.

""They don't want to speak out alone because they are afraid,"" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor, told CNBC. ""They know that they will be shaken down, coerced, intimidated [by the administration]. Retaliatory gestures are quite severe.""

Some CEOs have been slightly more bold: Days before Pretti's killing, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon became the first prominent U.S. CEO to criticize Trump's immigration crackdown.

In the days that followed Pretti's death, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Apple CEO Tim Cook have spoken out, too. Altman made pointed comments in a Slack message to OpenAI employees, saying that ""part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach"" and that ""what's happening with ICE is going too far.""

In his own internal message to Apple's workforce on Tuesday, Tim Cook described himself as ""heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis"" and called for ""de-escalation,"" adding that he had privately expressed concerns to Trump.

Trump has in recent days appeared to soften his approach to DHS' presence in Minneapolis, using language of de-escalation that mirrored the executives' public letter and saying he had ""very respectful"" calls with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. But he has yet to pull ICE agents from Minneapolis, and it's unclear when he will do so.

Trump's change in tone comes as the risk rises of a partial government shutdown later this week, with Democrats vowing to oppose funding for the DHS in large part because of opposition to the administration's Minneapolis operation.

Experts said one thing has been made clear: Pretti's death and the viral spread of videos and analysis surrounding his final moments show there are limits to the obedience of the business community. 

Minneapolis, home to mega corporations like Target, UnitedHealth and 3M, has become the testing ground for when and how far corporate leaders will wade into escalating political tensions, heightened by a president who pushes the bounds of state power. 

There are examples of corporate leaders having used their influence and turning the tide before. In the fall, Trump planned ICE enforcement in San Francisco. Yet the president called it off in part due to conversations with Bay Area business leaders, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 

Since ICE and Border Patrol agents poured into Minnesota late last year in a plan dubbed Operation Metro Surge, videos have shown agents shoving protestors, detaining children, spraying demonstrators with chemical irritants and, in at least two cases, using their firearms.

The operation followed similar efforts in cities including Chicago and New Orleans, sparking concerns of what some saw as agency overreach. 

″I don't like what I'm seeing, with five grown men beating up little women,"" JPMorgan's Dimon said during an onstage interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""I think we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.""

Later in that discussion, Dimon's interviewer, The Economist Editor-in-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, told the veteran CEO that she was surprised at how careful he and other leaders were in speaking about Trump.

""I'm genuinely struck by the unwillingness of CEOs in America to say anything critical,"" Minton Beddoes said. ""There is a climate of fear in your country.""

Dimon, who has spoken of the need for immigration reform for years, pushed back: ""I think they should change their approach to immigration,"" Dimon said. ""I've said it. What the hell else do you want me to say?""

The day after Dimon's comments, Trump sued JPMorgan and Dimon for $5 billion for closing his bank accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. While Trump had warned he would sue JPMorgan days before Dimon's comments at Davos, the implication was clear: Companies face retribution for perceived slights against the president.

""If you're a corporate CEO, this man has the potential to tank your stock,"" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, said of the president. ""We've seen this administration weaponize every conceivable lever of power it has.""

A CNBC poll of corporate leaders, conducted in the days following Pretti's killing, found 56% said it is ""a lot more challenging"" to speak out today when it comes to social and political causes. The CNBC Councils flash poll surveyed 34 companies about ICE's presence in Minnesota. 

Only one of the 34 corporate leaders surveyed reported they had spoken out publicly about the situation in Minneapolis, with about a third saying it was not relevant to their business, 21% saying they were still contemplating making public comments and 18% saying they were worried about backlash from the Trump administration. 

Some of those companies remained silent even as they acknowledged the challenges were close to home: Among the surveyed businesses, about 15% said they were aware of company employees who had been personally impacted by ICE enforcement in the last 12 months.

In addition to the risk of retribution from the White House, companies have also become hesitant to speak out and anger a divided American public, said Eli Yokley, U.S. politics analyst for Morning Consult.

""A number of them are probably thinking about the post-'woke' backlash that came at least culturally and put some of them on their heels,"" he said. ""If you are a consumer-facing brand, the last thing you want to engage in is politics today in a world that is so polarized.

""People can react pretty fiercely,"" Yokley said.

What's more, the public isn't united even in whether they think corporate leaders should weigh in on Trump or his policies. 

Forty percent of Americans say CEOs who criticize Trump are acting responsibly, but only 28% say they should speak out publicly when they disagree with the president's policies, according to a Morning Consult survey of about 1,000 U.S. adults conducted on Jan. 20. 

About 38% of respondents said they would view a company less favorably if a CEO praised Trump publicly, while 25% said they would view a company more favorably, the survey found.

Around immigration enforcement, specifically, Americans are similarly divided on corporations' role. 

The share of Morning Consult respondents who said companies should cooperate fully with ICE enforcement, 23%, was nearly equal to the share who said that companies should actively resist, at 22%. 

Target, one of the most prominent Minneapolis-based companies, captures the shift in corporate responses to policy from Trump's first term to his second.

In 2020, four days after George Floyd was killed by a police officer just a short distance from the big-box retailer's headquarters, Target CEO Brian Cornell wrote an emotional statement, describing Floyd's death as murder and naming other Black people who had been killed by law enforcement. 

Cornell and Target pledged to take action in support of diversity and inclusion as the Black Lives Matter movement gained steam across the country in the wake of Floyd's death. 

""As a Target team, we've huddled, we've consoled, we've witnessed horrific scenes similar to what's playing out now and wept that not enough is changing,"" he wrote at the time. ""And as a team we've vowed to face pain with purpose.""

Compare that to the current environment. Earlier this month, after Minnesotan Renee Good was killed by an ICE agent, Target leaders did not make a public statement. Instead, the company circulated internal memos from the firm's human resources chief, which acknowledged that employees are experiencing ""a wide range of emotions"" and stressing the company's focus on employee and customer safety. 

A FAQ linked in the memos said the retailer ""does not have cooperative agreements with ICE"" and that federal agents, including ICE, have legal authority to enter its parking lots and guest-facing parts of stores without a warrant.

On Monday, Target's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke shared a video message with employees that more directly acknowledged current events, but stopped short of calling for ICE agents to leave the city or for a review of the two shooting deaths there. Fiddelke didn't reference Good, Pretti or Trump by name. 

""The violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful,"" he said. ""I know it's weighing heavily on many of you across the country, as it is with me.""

Target may have reason to be skittish: Its sales have been hit in recent years by boycotts from both Trump supporters and liberal critics who felt the retailer caved to Trump's push against diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

But local leaders say the company has a responsibility to protect its community, too. 

Over the past three weeks, a group of religious leaders in Minneapolis have called on the company to take a harsher stance against ICE action in Minneapolis, particularly after two Target employees in Minneapolis, both U.S. citizens, were taken by a team of ICE agents the day after Good's death. 

Target's signature on the joint letter among other Minnesota companies didn't go far enough, the group said. 

""It's almost worse than silence, because it felt like nothing,"" said Martha Bardwell, pastor of Our Saviours Lutheran Church in Minneapolis. 

""We know that if Trump is going to listen to anybody, corporate leaders have a lot of power,"" Bardwell said. ""We are looking to CEOs to be very clear and use the power they have.""

Bardwell was part of a small group of Twin Cities clergy who met with Target CEO Cornell last week to encourage him to step up the company's response. Those clergy said they left the meeting without any new pledges from Target.

Bitcoin BTC$84,287.27 tumbled Thursday to its weakest level since mid-December, shedding nearly $3,000 within hours as gold's massive rally abruptly turned.

Soaring above $5,600 per ounce at one point Thursday (gold prior to Sunday night had never been above $5,000), gold in the space of a few minutes in morning U.S. trade plunged nearly 10% to back below $5,200.

The price action in silver followed a similar path, with that metal falling from $121 per ounce to $108.

Adding fuel to the selloff was Microsoft (MSFT), whose shares collapsed more than 11% — potentially their worst day since March 2020 — after the company reported slowing growth in its cloud business. The tech giant's stumble dragged the Nasdaq lower by around 1.5%, deepening the risk-off tone. 

Crypto markets followed suit. Trading above $88,000 earlier in the session, bitcoin fell precipitously to $85,200, its lowest level in more than a month. The largest crypto was down 4.5% over the past 24 hours.

Ethereum's ether ETH$2,961.90, Solana SOL$117.86, DOGE$0.1222 and ADA$0.3342 lost 5%-6% during the same period as altcoins were hit harder in the sell-off.

Looking at crypto stocks, the largest corporate bitcoin holder, Strategy (MSTR), is down 8% on its worst day since Dec. 12, hitting 52-week lows and trading back to September 2024 levels. 

Other names posting big losses include Bullish (BLSH), Twenty One Capital (XXI). Circle (CRCL) and Coinbase (COIN) — all down 4%-8%.

The S&P 500 Volatility  Index has jumped more than 16% to 19, its second-highest level since the end of November, while the DXY index has rebounded to 96.6 from a Wednesday low of 95.5, also potentially putting renewed pressure on risk assets.

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

What to know: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

Gold and other traditional safe-haven assets are surging amid a softening US dollar, yet Bitcoin continues to falter.

This week, gold pushed past the $5,000 mark, setting fresh all-time highs and building on its strong momentum. Silver also joined the rally, climbing above $120 per ounce.

However, and in stark contrast, Bitcoin continued to struggle.

A fleeting recovery attempt to above $90,000 on Wednesday quickly faded into renewed downside pressure that currently sees BTC poised below $88,000.

Why Bitcoin is struggling despite dollar weakness

According to an analysis from J.P. Morgan Private Bank, current dollar weakness hasn't ignited Bitcoin's typical upward response due to one key factor: investor outlook.

In a note to CoinDesk, the analysts said markets appear to currently view Bitcoin more as a high-risk asset tied to liquidity conditions, rather than a reliable hedge against currency weakness.

Notably, gold has exploded as the Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against major global currencies, has fallen.

But Bitcoin, often seen as a beneficiary of such weakness in historical dollar patterns, has underperformed.

The benchmark digital asset is well off its all-time high reached in October 2025.

Strategists at the bank attribute this divergence to the nature of the dollar's slide. 

Unlike past episodes driven by fundamental changes in economic growth or central bank policies, the recent drop stems largely from short-term investor flows and shifting market sentiment.

While gold and similar commodities have capitalized on the dollar's dip as classic hedges, Bitcoin has stayed confined to a tight trading range.

Per the researchers, this behavior signals that cryptocurrency traders aren't interpreting the dollar's softness as a lasting macroeconomic pivot.

Instead, Bitcoin remains anchored as a liquidity-dependent risk asset.

This, and the prevailing macroeconomic environment, continue to hinder fresh inflows.

Bitcoin price forecast

The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated below $90,000 after a brief uptick earlier this month. While the sharp contrast to gold's gains has helped pull capital away, analysts are largely bullish.

André Dragosch, Bitwise European Head of Research, recently noted that BTC's drop to a multi-year low, with the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio of 18.5 oz/BTC, is a “very rare” contrarian buy signal.

He suggested capital rotation from gold to BTC could accelerate in the next few months.

GugaOnChain, a CryptoQuant contributor, shared in a Jan 26 post that dollar weakness only boosts BTC in risk-on environments like high inflation or loose liquidity. 

The contrary is likely in a risk-off environment punctuated by extreme fear.

In this case, investors flock to gold for capital preservation. BTC will thrive as risk appetite shifts.

The coin traded around $87,800 at the time of writing on Thursday, Jan.29.

In the short term, Bitcoin bulls want to see a decisive push above $100,000. Movement in this area will signal renewed strength.

On the downside, key support levels cluster around $85,000, with $80,000 a major accumulation zone if bears strengthen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Why is Dogecoin down: DOGE slumps 7% as bitcoin loses ground in risk-off trade","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/dogecoin-slumps-7-as-bitcoin-risk-off-rattles-memecoin-bets","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:11:59 GMT","

Dogecoin slid sharply as bitcoin pulled back, breaking a key support level and forcing traders to reassess whether the memecoin is stabilizing — or rolling into a deeper corrective phase.

Dogecoin fell alongside broader crypto weakness as bitcoin retreated, dragging high-beta tokens lower. 

The move wasn't driven by a DOGE-specific headline, but by risk-off positioning, with memecoins once again underperforming majors during the pullback.

At the same time, on-chain data showed a sharp drop in large DOGE transactions, highlighting reduced participation from bigger players as price approached critical support levels.

DOGE broke decisively below $0.1218, a level that had acted as short-term support, triggering accelerated selling into the session close. The breakdown occurred on heavy volume, confirming the move as active distribution rather than low-liquidity drift.

Price briefly flushed toward $0.115, where buyers stepped in to defend the level, producing a short-term bounce back toward $0.116. That reaction suggests demand still exists near the lower end of the range — but structure remains fragile unless DOGE can reclaim former support.

The loss of $0.1218 flips that zone into near-term resistance, with rallies now likely to face selling pressure.

Traders are focused on the $0.115–$0.12 zone as the next decision point.

If $0.115 holds, DOGE could stabilize and attempt a range rebuild — but bulls would need a reclaim of $0.1218, followed by $0.125, to signal the breakdown was corrective rather than structural.

If $0.115 fails, downside risk opens toward $0.108–$0.10, with momentum likely to accelerate as remaining support gives way.

For now, DOGE remains a high-beta trade tied closely to bitcoin, with technical levels — not narratives — dictating direction.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","EXCLUSIVE: TheDAO to Become New $220 Million Ethereum Security Fund","https://unchainedcrypto.com/exclusive-thedao-to-become-new-220-million-ethereum-security-fund/","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:30:00 GMT","

For almost a decade, over 75,000 ETH involved in TheDAO has remained unclaimed. Now, Ethereum OGs and Vitalik are using it to create an ecosystem security fund. 

The 2016 DAO hack, in which a hacker obtained 4.5% of what was then all ETH in existence, was Ethereum's defining moment. It caused an existential crisis for the fledgling network, led to a hard fork that spawned an evil twin, Ethereum Classic, and became a turning point for the community. 

And now, the most infamous security failure in Ethereum history will be used to help keep the ecosystem secure. 

Some unclaimed money from the whole DAO debacle is being used to help establish a $220 million endowment to shore up Ethereum's security called TheDAO Security Fund. (However, some funds will stay untouched so they can still be claimed.)

The capital will be granted to projects working on Ethereum security, with funding distributed mostly through DAO processes. A portion of the ETH will also be staked so as to create an ongoing source of funding for security projects.

“It's 2026 and we never touched any of those funds. They've appreciated substantially. And so it's time. It's time to put them to work to make Ethereum safer and more secure,” said Griff Green, one of TheDAO's “curators” or maintainers who was an employee of Slock.it, the company that coded up the original DAO. He then became one of the “White Hat Group” who rescued the money from TheDAO. 

In 2016, after the hack, the community hard forked the blockchain so as to take all the stolen ETH and return it to DAO participants via the so-called Withdraw Contract, which would send back 1 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens sent in, reflecting the original sale price. 

Aside from the pool of money for ongoing claims (yes, even a decade on, Green is still contacted for claims), TheDAO saga created other stashes that can be used for the security fund. 

Any capital left unclaimed in the Curator Multisig of 4,600 worth of ETH (actually mostly DAO tokens) totaling $13.5 million, will be allocated to Ethereum security initiatives. (Many of these tokens were often accidentally and erroneously sent either to TheDAO or Withdraw Contract, and while many such funds had already been returned, not everyone requested that these tokens be sent back.)

Additionally, another stash of money will be used to stake to create an ongoing stream of funds for security initiatives. Back during TheDAO crowdsale, as it inched closer to its closing date, the price ticked up — first, to 1.05 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens and finally finishing at 1.5 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens. 

After the hard fork when the money was being returned, for those who had paid more than 1 ETH for 100 DAO tokens, the overage from their purchases was called the ExtraBalance. The money remaining unclaimed in the ExtraBalance is 70,500 ETH (about $206.6 million). 

Of that ETH, 69,420 (a very crypto number) will be staked, with the yield being used to create an endowment. Currently, that amount of ETH staked would generate about $8 million worth of ETH in yield annually. 

The security grants will be awarded following a process that honors the intention of the original DAO. 

The group plans to use tactics such as quadratic funding, in which larger grants go to projects that have received many small donations vs. ones that have received few large donations; retroactive funding, which funds projects or expenses that have already occurred; and RFP ranked-choice voting, in which security proposals are requested and voters rank them in order of preference. 

The group also plans to solicit applications for operators for future funding rounds. 

The Ethereum Foundation will set the eligibility criteria for each round, and Green's organization, Giveth, will support the operators. 

Nowadays, Ethereum is much bigger and more diverse than it was at the time TheDAO was launched, when it became pretty much the only application generating much interest on the less-than-one-year-old blockchain. 

That raises the question of what an Ethereum-focused fund would be devoted to, since many projects can claim to be connected to or related to Ethereum or the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) in some way.

TheDAO Security Fund will support security initiatives for Ethereum mainnet, layer 2s, smart contracts, incident response, research, user protection, infrastructure, operational security, education, and more, but not, for instance, EVM-compatible alt-L1s. 

Groups doing the kind of work that could be funded include, for instance, SEAL (Security Alliance) and SEAL 911; auditors like Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin and Quantstamp; or products focused on user protection and wallet safety such as Revoke.cash and Blockaid. 

For infrastructure, it could support groups like L2Beat, which does research on layer 2s, and Safe, a multisig wallet service. For operational security, it could fund Yubikey, which can be used to secure servers, or Signal, a popular encrypted messaging app. 

“TheDAO Security Fund … is going to put a lot of money into the hands of security researchers all over the Ethereum space and really make Ethereum security second to none,” said Green.

As for the secondary goal of supporting the advancement of DAOs, Green says this is a focus, “because the DAO ecosystem really is at a low point…. With regulatory issues not really being a thing, people are like, ‘Why would I create a DAO?'” (He was referencing news like that Eigenlayer, Apecoin DAO, Jupiter DAO, and Scroll DAO had closed or paused operations; meanwhile others like the Cronos blockchain have had their communities overruled by centralized entities or whales, such as, in this case, Crypto.com, in controversial votes.)

“For me at least,” he went on, “this is what was exciting about Ethereum, that we could build something better than governments. And we could use this tool — this amazing blockchain technology — to do something that makes it easy for people to signal their decisions and have more whatever level of participation they want into the decision making in society.” 

Ten years after he began working on TheDAO, the new fund that Green is helping to spin up may finally achieve the goal he'd had a decade ago.

Oops, something went wrong

Key Takeaways

Tom Lee has urged investors not to let the rally in gold and silver divert attention from Ethereum.

BitMine continues to build its Ethereum position.

Lee maintains a bullish long-term outlook for Ethereum and Bitcoin.

BitMine chairman Tom Lee urged investors not to overlook Ethereum (ETH) despite a powerful rally in precious metals, reiterating his long-held view that Ethereum is the “future of finance.”

His comments follow recent remarks in which Lee said the surge in gold and silver prices was masking improving fundamentals in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Lee wrote: “Truth. Own what works. But don't let FOMO make you abandon good ideas.”

The comment was made in response to a post by BitMine, which said sharp year-to-date gains in gold and silver were drawing investor attention away from other “structurally strong” macro themes such as AI and crypto.

BitMine said gold and silver are up roughly 18% and 52% year to date, respectively, describing the gains as “astounding and impressive.”

However, the company warned the rally was creating a “vortex” of fear of missing out that could lead investors to abandon longer-term opportunities, particularly in Ethereum.

“Our advice: own what works, but don't abandon structurally strong ideas (hint: Ethereum is the future of finance),” BitMine wrote.

BitMine, which describes itself as the largest Ethereum treasury holder, said in a recent press release that it acquired an additional 40,302 Ether over the past week, worth about $440.5 million at current prices.

As of Jan. 25, the company said its total crypto, cash and “moonshot” holdings stood at $12.8 billion.

Its crypto holdings include approximately 4.24 million Ether, valued at $2,839 per token.

BitMine also reported $682 million in cash and equity stakes, including a $200 million investment in Beast Industries.

Lee said Ethereum's price ratio relative to Bitcoin has been rising steadily since mid-October.

“In our view, this reflects investors recognizing that tokenization and other use cases being developed by Wall Street are being built on Ethereum,” he said.

The comments come shortly after Lee said the rise in gold and silver prices was overshadowing strengthening fundamentals in major cryptocurrencies.

“The parabolic and continued surge in gold and silver is overshadowing inherently strengthening fundamentals of crypto, particularly Ethereum and Bitcoin,” Lee said in a separate post on X.

He added that major financial institutions are increasingly positioning Ethereum as a core settlement and tokenization layer.

“When fundamentals go ‘up and to the right,' it's only a matter of time before price follows,” Lee said.

Lee said discussions among policymakers and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year reinforced his view that financial institutions are embracing crypto and blockchain assets.

Despite Ethereum and Bitcoin trading well below their all-time highs, Lee has maintained a bullish long-term outlook. He has said Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million or more, a move he believes would support Ethereum prices rising toward $250,000.

While Lee argues that the surge in gold and silver is distracting investors from crypto's longer-term potential, near-term price action suggests Ethereum is still in a consolidation phase rather than an immediate breakout.

At the time of writing, Ethereum's price remains range-bound following its recent pullback, trading at around $2,958.

According to CCN analyst Victor Olanrewaju, if ETH can hold above $2,800, the current structure favors base-building that could support a recovery toward $3,172 and $3,512.

A breakdown below that level, however, would expose deeper support near $2,622, Olanrewaju said.

Some key Ethereum members, including co-founder Vitalik Buterin, are reviving one of the network's oldest and most symbolic chapters: The DAO (decentralized autonomous organization).

More than 70,500 ether ETH$2,961.90 that have sat untouched since the 2016 DAO hack — long considered Ethereum's defining existential crisis — will be redeployed into a roughly $220 million Ethereum security initiative, Unchained reported.

According to the report, $13.5 million will be allocated to security grants distributed through DAO-style mechanisms including quadratic funding, retroactive public goods funding, ranked-choice RFPs and other governance processes under a new entity, The DAO Fund.

The remaining 69,420 ETH will be staked to generate an endowment for Ethereum security efforts. The investment is expected to yield roughly $8 million annually at current rates.

The DAO was an experiment in decentralized governance built on the Ethereum blockchain. It was designed as a fully autonomous vehicle where token holders could vote on proposals and allocate capital without traditional intermediaries, an idea that captured widespread excitement and drew one of the largest crowdsales in crypto history

But within months, a flaw in The DAO's smart contract code allowed an attacker to drain $60 million worth of ether ETH$2,961.90 at the time, in what became one of blockchain's earliest and most high-profile exploits. The breach sparked a bitter community debate over how to respond, ultimately leading to a contentious splitting of the network, known in blockchain parlance as a hard fork.

The hard fork also split the community, with those who rejected the rollback thus continued on the original chain, now known as Ethereum Classic, while the mainline chain carried on as today's Ethereum.

The incident not only shaped Ethereum's early governance and security norms but became a cautionary touchstone for smart contract audits, decentralized governance design and crypto's philosophical debates over immutability versus intervention — themes that still resonate in the space today.

Fast forward to today, the move marks a symbolic and practical return to DAO-based coordination nearly a decade after the original experiment fractured the community and led to Ethereum's historic hard fork.

“TheDAO is back,” the project wrote on X. “A decade later, we're opening a new chapter”

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

What to know: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Famous Analyst Says Altcoin Holders Will Be Disappointed, Bitcoin Rotation Not Coming?","https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-holders-be-disappointed/","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 03:00:53 GMT","

The long-awaited altcoin season may fail to meet expectations, according to comments shared by well-known market analyst Ted Pillows. In a recent post on X, Pillows pushed back against the popular belief that gains from Bitcoin and traditional safe-haven assets will naturally rotate into alts. This outlook is based on the analyst's reconciliation with the fact that the structure of today's crypto market is very different from past cycles.

Many crypto market participants have been waiting for many months for a capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins, a trend that played out in previous market cycles, most especially in 2021. However, this has yet to play out as expected, as the crypto industry's dynamics have matured from speculative inflows from investors since then. 

Particularly, Pillows pointed to the current 2024/2025 market cycle as a clear example of misplaced expectations among altcoin holders. According to his assessment, the rotation into alts never materialized because the dominant buyers of Bitcoin were institutions, not retail traders. 

Institutional participants, he noted, tend to accumulate Bitcoin as a long-term asset and do not actively rotate capital into altcoins the way retail investors did in previous cycles. This market behavior from the new cohort of investors has contributed to a strong Bitcoin dominance even during periods of corrections. According to CoinMarketCap's dominance index, Bitcoin's dominance is currently at 58.9%.

The analyst extended this logic to current expectations around gold and silver. Right now, gold and silver are trading near record highs, with social media interest in these precious metals also at remarkable highs. Gold is currently trading above $5,270 per ounce and is steadily pushing to new highs. Silver is also pushing to new highs, currently trading around $113 per ounce.

Some market participants believe that strength in these precious metals could eventually translate into Bitcoin inflows and then into altcoins. However, according to Pillows, this won't happen again, which might leave altcoin holders disappointed. He pointed to the fact that the primary buyers of gold and silver today are central banks, not retail investors. 

Despite the skeptical outlook, Pillows did not claim that altcoins are permanently sidelined. Instead, he outlined conditions he believes are necessary for a widespread altcoin rally to take shape. One is meaningful regulatory clarity, particularly through the approval of the Clarity Act, which could improve institutional confidence across the digital asset space. The Clarity Act, however, is currently facing delays in Congress.

The other condition for an altcoin rally is a return to aggressive liquidity expansion similar to the quantitative easing environment witnessed during the 2020/2021 cycle. Without those conditions in place, only a small subset of altcoins will manage to perform well, while many others will gradually lose relevance and slowly dump to zero.

By fixing how devices connect, researchers may have finally made blockchain fast enough for the real world.

The idea of a fully connected digital world is quickly becoming real through the Internet of Things (IoT). This expanding network includes physical devices such as small sensors, autonomous vehicles, and industrial machines that collect and exchange data online.

Protecting this data from tampering is essential, which has led engineers to explore blockchain as a security solution. Although blockchain is widely known for its role in cryptocurrencies, its core function is as a decentralized digital ledger. Instead of data being controlled by a single organization, information is shared and maintained across many computers.

Despite its security benefits, current blockchain systems often struggle to meet the speed demands of real-world IoT applications. Many connected devices must respond almost instantly, but blockchain networks can introduce delays that make this difficult.

Researchers have found that these delays are not caused by the blockchain protocol itself. Instead, the main issue lies in how nodes communicate within peer-to-peer networks. In particular, earlier studies have paid little attention to how the overall structure of these connections, known as network topology, affects performance in IoT blockchain systems.

To better understand this problem, a research team led by Associate Professor Kien Nguyen from the Institute for Advanced Academic Research/Graduate School of Informatics, Chiba University, Japan, explored ways to improve the efficiency of IoT blockchain networks. Their findings were published in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management on December 17, 2025. The study analyzes how different network topologies influence system performance and introduces a new approach designed to keep data flowing more efficiently.

“We aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical deployment of IoT-blockchain systems by identifying the fundamental causes of their high latency and proposing a decentralized solution that is both simple and effective,” says Dr. Nguyen. The study was co-authored by Koki Koshikawa, Yue Su, and Hiroo Sekiya, all from Chiba University.

To uncover the source of the delays, the researchers created simulations that connected blockchain clients using a variety of network structures. Their analysis showed that the decentralized nature of IoT networks often leads to repeated transmission of the same data.

Existing methods for sharing transactions (the individual data entries) and blocks (the larger bundles of verified records) can cause the number of data copies to grow rapidly. When networks contain too many overlapping communication paths, this duplication creates congestion and long queues, slowing the entire system.

To address this challenge, the team developed a decentralized and lightweight algorithm called “Dual Perigee.” This approach allows each device in the network to make informed decisions about which neighboring devices it should connect with.

Rather than relying on random connections, a device using Dual Perigee evaluates its peers based on how quickly they deliver transactions and full blocks. If a connection consistently performs poorly, the device disconnects and seeks a better alternative. Over time, this process allows the network to reorganize itself into a faster configuration without requiring a central controller.

In simulations involving a 50-node IoT network, Dual Perigee reduced block-related delays by 48.54% compared to the standard method used by the Ethereum blockchain. The algorithm also exceeded the performance of advanced techniques, including the original Perigee algorithm, by more than 23%.

These improvements were achieved without placing additional computational demands on IoT devices. Dual Perigee relies on passive measurements of data that devices already receive and requires only minimal processing.

The findings have wide-reaching implications across multiple technology sectors. By reducing the time needed to confirm and distribute blockchain data, systems become fast enough for applications where timing is critical.

“The proposed decentralized latency-aware peer-selection mechanism can serve as a foundation for future blockchain platforms that support real-time, mission-critical IoT services, ultimately enabling more secure, responsive, and trustworthy digital infrastructures,” explains Dr. Nguyen.

As IoT systems continue to expand and become more complex, the need for reliable and decentralized communication methods will grow. The research team believes Dual Perigee could play an important role in future technologies.

“Our approach can be applied to emerging IoT-based services that require fast and reliable data sharing, such as smart cities, smart homes, industrial monitoring, healthcare systems, and supply-chain tracking,” says Dr. Nguyen.

Ovie Faruq was a good credit trader. He liked being a credit trader, even. But eventually the boredom of using only half of your brain got to him, and he quit for the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). That was in 2022.

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community. ✍️

It's now 2026, and the NFT world has collapsed, for lack of better term. From a peak market size of $1.6bn in 2022, research from CoinLedger last year suggested it's barely a third of that now. Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini was planning to close its NFT marketplace by March.

Faruq is unfazed. In the OFF SCRIPT podcast yesterday, he said that his NFT style – Rekt guy – was launched during the NFT decline anyway. People could related to the Rekt Guy, because they were also Rekt guys. It was almost a metaphysical commentary.

Despite the NFT market being Rekt, Faruq has no interest in returning to the world of trading. ""I could never go [back]”, he said. “If everything failed in my life and I needed to get a normal job, so to speak, I would do something different. I couldn't go back to it.""

Despite leaving finance, Faruq has fond-ish memories of the experience. He told the OFF SCRIPT podcast that he loved the excitement of taking risks and credited the bank and his mentors there for teaching him a lot – and noted that he learned a lot about ethics, regulation, macroeconomics, and risk management. 

Eventually however, the risk-aversion made him quit. “If something didn't go well for you, people would be quick to say you need to cut your losses. And it would be frustrating if you turned out to be right further down the line.”

Still, it's not all negative. Rekt is a whole brand now. We've mentioned their energy drink offerings before, which once upon a time sold for £60 for a case of 12 – now only £47, but still. There's also the Rekt Coin, the brand's own meme coin. It currently has a market cap of around $81m, with a total supply of 420.69 trillion coins.

If you're curious to know how Faruq's NFTs are doing, we found an artwork in 2022 of a self-portrait (of sorts) was on sale for $3.4k (USD). It's now on sale for $212. Just for reference.

Single-chain NFT marketplaces, where users buy and sell NFTs on a single blockchain, may deal with problems such as network congestion, high transaction fees, and limited scalability. This is because single-chain NFT marketplaces are limited by the number of transactions that the blockchain can process. Cross-chain NFT marketplaces allow transactions and interactions between multiple blockchains, which can address limitations such as scalability, cost, and liquidity. Possible solutions to the challenges of existing NFT marketplaces include cross-chain technology such as cross-chain atomic swaps. Cross-chain NFT marketplace solutions ease NFT platform scalability across NFT markets, enabling creators and collectors around the world to access its services.

Scalability is a key factor for NFT marketplaces. When a large number of transactions come in a short time period (as during NFT drops or an auction), a single-chain NFT marketplace may experience delayed confirmation of transactions or even transaction failure. Awareness and timely management of such limitations are necessary for the viability of NFT markets. One of the most important points for the success of NFT markets is scalability, as the number of users and traffic will only increase over time. Cross-chain integration is one way to alleviate congestion by distributing traffic across chains.

Transaction Backlogs: If the maximum throughput for a blockchain network is reached, transactions can fail.

Fixed Network Capacity: Each blockchain has a maximum transaction throughput; exceeding this creates performance degradation..

 

 

Performance Bottlenecks: Slow transaction confirmation times have frustrated users and decreased site reliability.

Growth Limitations: Platforms that do not run multiple chains face an upper bound to their scalability that cannot be overcome.

 

High gas fees (the transaction fees charged to log and thus validate an Ethereum blockchain transaction such as the minting or trading of an NFT) are often cited as the main barrier to entry to NFT marketplaces, and reducing costs can allow for a wider pool of creators, buyers and sellers. Cross-chain solutions take these transactions to the blockchain with the lowest fees, via an interoperability protocol..

Expensive Minting: Minting NFTs can be expensive on congested networks.

High Trading Costs: The costs of buyers and sellers change unexpectedly.

Reduced Marketplace Liquidity: Users trade less when they face high costs.

Barrier for Emerging Creators: Artists with limited funding may be effectively locked out.

Cross-chain NFT marketplace development is the process of creating a marketplace for selling NFTs that can be deployed and run on a variety of other blockchain networks. With this type of marketplace, NFTs can be transferred and traded on a variety of blockchain networks, while still maintaining their unique properties and ownership. Users can choose the most economical, fastest, and most secure network. Cross-chain platforms improve user experience across chains through interoperability frameworks and synchronized management of smart contracts.

 

Interoperability Frameworks: Protocol provides for asset transfers across networks.

Multi-Chain Support: NFTs can be minted and traded on multiple chains.

Smart Contract Synchronization: Ownership and transaction histories on both networks are identical.

User-Friendly Platforms: Single interfaces allow users to trade across multiple chains.

Cross-chain NFT marketplaces could avoid paying a network fee on the host blockchain by sending buyers and sellers to smaller blockchains with lower network fees or avoid unpredictable network fees altogether. It could also bring more small creators and buyers into the ecosystem, effectively increasing the size of the pool of buyers and sellers and therefore increasing liquidity. Adding in optimized fees as well as automatic cross-chain and DeFi protocol routing would create an extremely efficient market for a set of digital assets, solving one of the biggest problems in digital asset trading today.

 

Affordable Transaction Routes: Platforms choose chains based on which have the lowest fees.

Lower Minting Costs: Creators can create NFTs on blockchains with lower transaction fees.

 

 

Avoid Congestion Spikes: Traffic is instead sent to less expensive, lower-priority networks.

Accessible for All Users: Lower prices may induce more market activity.

Most NFT marketplaces want to implement cross chain bridges that allow users on different blockchains to buy NFTs on different NFT marketplaces to improve liquidity and expose more users to NFTs across different blockchains which will lead to better price discovery for NFTs and thus better efficiency of the NFT market. Cross-chain platforms are tools that allow for ecosystems to be built on them, where assets from these ecosystems can move across chains, making the platform more adopted and active.

Access to Multiple Communities: Users on different blockchains can interoperate through the same platform.

Unified Asset Listings: NFTs can be viewed and traded on multiple networks.

 

 

Higher Trading Volume: Large pools of users create liquidity and an efficient market.

Better Price Discovery: More transactions make discovering the fair price easier.

Security is a major consideration in cross-chain NFT marketplaces, and rules must be followed to ensure the ownership of an asset is correct on the different chains. The security of the protocol can be improved through the use of smart contract audits, bridge encryption and distributed control of validator mechanisms. In the case of vulnerabilities that are found and patched up before the actors, that can generally build faith and trust in the long-term viability of cross-chain platforms by the users of the platforms.

Smart Contract Audits: Integrations were thoroughly verified.

Bridge Encryption: Secure protocols enable assets to flow interoperably.

Decentralized Verification: Validators prevent fraudulent transactions by reviewing them.

Real-Time Monitoring: Platforms may monitor activity to identify risks.

 

For example, one leading NFT marketplace interoperates Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon into a cross-chain NFT marketplace to offset chains' scalability and gas fees limitations and enable services to a larger audience. To address speed and costs, the NFT marketplace batches transactions across all three chains, creating liquidity from creators to collectors. This is an example of cross-chain interoperability providing some efficiencies for users of the platform.

Reduced Transaction Fees: It enabled the cheap, frequent minting and trading of NFTs that drove adoption of the technology.

Improved Scalability: To ease scaling, the platform seeks to process transactions in parallel across multiple blockchains, at thousands of transactions per minute.

Broader Market Reach: Connections to other networks increased the user base and attracted international buyers.

Enhanced User Experience: There was to be one interface coordinating all assets, allowing for cross-chain trading and swaps.

 

 

 

 

 

Cross-chain NFT marketplaces aim to improve upon the limitations of customary NFT marketplaces based on a single blockchain, addressing scalability and gas issues. Cross-chain NFT marketplace solutions are intended to provide interoperability, lower transaction costs, better liquidity, and an easier browsing, buying, and selling experience for users across different blockchain networks. An NFT provides a cheaper and faster way for creators and collectors to trade directly with each other. NFT marketplaces are scaling up. NFT marketplaces are now providing the infrastructure needed to trade NFTs. A cross-chain NFT marketplace will be needed to scale the economy of digital assets.

Abstract:  A bond-log interpretation system, apparatus, and computer-implemented method are disclosed. The system ingests a cement-bond log (CBL) containing variable-density log (VDL) data and at least one secondary data track (SDT). A processing core, coupled to toggleable lithology, casing-tally, cementing-data, and prior-CBL libraries, first executes a VDL-only assessment at each depth to flag possible discontinuities. For every flagged depth, the core correlates the concurrent SDT data with selected library information to confirm or clear the discontinuity, delineate imperfect intervals, and identify probable causes. Results are synthesized into an annotated integrity report that includes audit-trail metadata listing which libraries were enabled. In a multi-well deployment, multiple field units synchronize their libraries with a central repository over a secure network, allowing real-time, parallel analysis and fleet-wide visualization. The modular architecture permits on-the-fly enabling, disabling, and versioning of libraries while maintaining a single interpretation engine adaptable to diverse tools and formations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","From HBAR's $0.001 ICO to LivLive's $0.02 Presale: Identifying the Best Crypto to Invest Today","https://blockchainreporter.net/from-hbars-0-001-ico-to-livlives-0-02-presale-identifying-the-best-crypto-to-invest-today/","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:33:28 GMT","

The 2026 digital asset market has officially moved past speculative fluff. Community members are now flocking toward projects that offer measurable real world utility and transparent growth paths. While legacy coins provide stability, the most explosive opportunities are found in early stage entries that solve massive industrial problems. As everyone searches for the best crypto to invest today, one name is dominating the conversation: LivLive ($LIVE).

LivLive is not just another digital asset. It is a high performance operating system for physical engagement that bridges the gap between digital rewards and real world action. By turning verified movements like visits, reviews, and quests into tokenized value, it targets the $1.3 trillion global advertising and loyalty market. This is your chance to get ahead of the curve before the mass market catches on.

LivLive functions as a “Reality Layer” that transforms the physical world into a gamified interface. Using advanced geolocation and AR technology, the platform rewards participants for verified actions rather than passive scrolling. This is a massive differentiator in 2026. While traditional social media platforms monetize attention spans that have dropped to 8 seconds, LivLive monetizes verified presence. This “Protocol of Trust” ensures that every $LIVE reward is backed by a real human being at a real location.

The business case for $LIVE is undeniable. With 400 million businesses worldwide struggling with fake reviews and low trust, LivLive provides an auditable blockchain record of consumer proof. Capturing just 1% of the projected $1.3 trillion loyalty market by 2027 represents a $13 billion revenue opportunity. For early adopters, this means holding a token that is central to a self sustaining economy where businesses pay for real foot traffic and participants earn for their loyalty. This structural demand is why $LIVE is frequently cited as the best crypto to invest today.

The numbers behind the LivLive presale are designed for maximum early advantage. Currently in Stage 1, the price is set at just $0.02per token. With a confirmed exchange launch price of $0.25, the math is staggering. For example, a $1,000 purchase at the current price secures 50,000 tokens. However, by using the exclusive bonus code BONUS200, you receive an additional 200% in tokens. This brings your total to 150,000 $LIVE for the same $1,000 entry.

At the $0.25 launch price, that 150,000 token position would be valued at $37,500. This represents a massive 3,650% increase before the token even hits the open market. The project has already raised over $2.2 million from more than 400 early buyers. As the presale progresses through its 10 stages, the price will rise automatically, meaning the $0.02 window is the only time to secure this specific cost basis. Delaying even a few days could mean paying double for half the tokens.

Looking at the history of Hedera (HBAR) provides a chilling reminder of the cost of hesitation. HBAR launched its mainnet with a clear focus on enterprise utility, much like LivLive. While many doubted its potential at the start, early participants who secured HBAR at its initial low prices saw their positions multiply by hundreds of times as the network became a global standard for corporations like Google and IBM. Those who recognized the shift from speculation to utility early became the millionaires of the last cycle.

Currently trading at $0.11 with a market cap of $4.6 billion, HBAR remains a solid asset, but its era of 1,000% gains is likely in the past. The crypto market is a revolving door of opportunity, and the crypto presale 2026 season has delivered its next champion. If you missed the early days of Hedera, you understand the sting of watching a utility giant grow from cents to a multi billion dollar valuation. LivLive offers that same ground floor entry point with a modern, AR driven twist.

The choice is clear for those who value data over hype. LivLive combines a high demand business model with a gamified user experience that has already proven successful in projects like Pokemon Go. By participating in the LivLive presale now, you are not just buying a token; you are securing a stake in a protocol that verifies human action in the physical world. With 50% of all mining tokens reserved exclusively for presale participants, the long term passive earning potential is just as attractive as the initial price appreciation.

Do not let this become another “should have, would have” story like Hedera. The Stage 1 price of $0.02 is a limited time offer that closes as soon as the funding target is met. Secure your tokens now, apply the BONUS200 code for triple the assets, and position yourself at the forefront of the augmented reality economy. The best crypto to invest today is the one that provides a clear exit strategy and massive real world demand.

In a significant legal escalation within the cryptocurrency sector, a group of U.S. investors has initiated a staggering $100 million lawsuit against Cere Network, a blockchain data storage project, alleging serious misconduct during its 2021 fundraising. This legal action, reported by CoinDesk, centers on claims that Cere Network made false statements about insider token lockups and its business prospects, followed by alleged insider sales that precipitated a sharp decline in token value. The case, filed in the United States, underscores the growing legal scrutiny facing blockchain projects and their fundraising practices.

The plaintiffs' complaint presents a detailed narrative of alleged deception. According to the legal filing, Cere Network made specific, material representations to investors during its 2021 initial coin offering (ICO). These representations primarily concerned two critical areas: the lockup schedules for tokens held by company insiders and the project's overall business outlook and partnerships. The lawsuit asserts these statements were knowingly false or misleading, designed to inflate investor confidence and the subsequent token price at launch.

Furthermore, the complaint makes a direct connection between these alleged misrepresentations and subsequent market activity. The plaintiffs claim that shortly after the token became publicly tradable, insiders associated with Cere Network sold a large volume of their holdings. This substantial sell-off, allegedly contrary to promised lock-up periods, is cited as the direct cause of a severe price crash, resulting in significant financial losses for the investors who purchased tokens based on the original representations. This sequence of events forms the core of the alleged securities fraud.

This lawsuit does not exist in a vacuum. It arrives amid a pronounced tightening of regulatory and legal frameworks governing digital assets in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has consistently increased its enforcement actions against cryptocurrency projects it deems to have conducted unregistered securities offerings. Legal experts often analyze cases like this through the lens of the “Howey Test,” a standard used to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and thus a security under U.S. law.

The allegations against Cere Network mirror claims made in other high-profile crypto cases. If the plaintiffs' arguments prevail, it could reinforce the precedent that certain token sales, especially those with promises of future profits based on the managerial efforts of others, fall under securities regulations. This case also highlights the critical importance of transparency in tokenomics, particularly the disclosure of vesting schedules and potential market overhangs from insider holdings, which are major concerns for sophisticated investors.

Industry analysts note that the Cere Network lawsuit reflects a maturation phase in crypto investing. “The era of ‘buyer beware' as the sole principle is evolving,” observes a financial litigation attorney familiar with digital assets. “Investors are now actively using legal channels to challenge projects that fail to deliver on pre-sale promises or exhibit governance failures. The specific focus on lock-up adherence is pivotal, as it goes to the heart of fair market conduct and the prevention of pump-and-dump schemes.”

The timeline is also crucial. The 2021 ICO occurred during a peak market cycle characterized by intense fundraising activity. Subsequently, the 2022 market downturn, known as the “crypto winter,” exposed numerous projects with weak fundamentals or questionable practices, leading to a wave of insolvencies and, now, litigation. This lawsuit may signal the beginning of a legal reckoning for projects that raised substantial capital during the bull market but are now facing accountability from disillusioned investors.

The outcome of this $100 million action could have ripple effects across the decentralized technology space. A successful lawsuit for the investors would likely compel other projects to adopt more conservative and transparent disclosure practices. It would serve as a stark warning to founding teams about the legal perils of misstating token release schedules or business milestones. Consequently, we may see more rigorous legal vetting of whitepapers and public communications by blockchain startups seeking to avoid similar litigation.

Moreover, the case places a spotlight on the role of exchanges and launchpads that list or facilitate token sales. While not named in this particular suit, platforms may face increased pressure to conduct more thorough due diligence on the projects they support, particularly regarding tokenomics and insider vesting plans. The broader impact is a potential shift towards greater professionalism and accountability, aligning the crypto industry closer to traditional capital market standards, albeit on its own technological terms.

The $100 million lawsuit against Cere Network represents a critical juncture for investor relations and legal accountability in the blockchain ecosystem. This Cere Network lawsuit underscores the escalating consequences for projects that fail to uphold transparency, especially concerning foundational elements like token distribution and insider commitments. As the case progresses, it will be closely watched by investors, legal experts, and project founders alike, potentially reshaping best practices for future token-based fundraising and reinforcing the application of traditional securities law to digital asset offerings. The final resolution will deliver a powerful message about the limits of promotional rhetoric and the enduring force of legal accountability in the digital age.

Q1: What is the Cere Network lawsuit about?A group of U.S. investors is suing Cere Network for $100 million, alleging the project made false statements about its token lockups and business outlook during its 2021 ICO, and that insiders then sold tokens, causing a price crash.

Q2: What are “insider token lockups” and why are they important?Lockups are periods during which founders, team members, and early investors are contractually prohibited from selling their tokens. They are crucial for aligning incentives and preventing immediate mass sell-offs that can destroy a new token's market price.

Q3: Could this lawsuit affect other cryptocurrency projects?Yes. A successful outcome for the plaintiffs could set a legal precedent, forcing other projects to be more transparent and cautious in their fundraising communications and tokenomics design to avoid similar litigation.

Q4: How does this relate to the SEC's view on cryptocurrencies?The lawsuit aligns with the SEC's broader stance that many token offerings constitute unregistered securities sales. The allegations of profit promises based on managerial effort directly touch on criteria the SEC uses to define a security.

Q5: What should investors learn from this case?Investors must conduct extreme due diligence, scrutinizing a project's tokenomics, vesting schedules, and legal disclosures. They should be skeptical of overly optimistic projections and understand that legal recourse, while complex, is becoming a more common tool for aggrieved investors.

					Covering geo-political news and current affairs across Asia				

As India prepares to host the BRICS summit later this year, the focus will be on a payment system linking national digital currencies. By prioritizing this infrastructure over launching a new currency, the bloc makes a pragmatic bet that practical systems will reshape global finance more than symbolic gestures.

At the summit, a crucial agenda item signals a potential shift: developing a BRICS payment system built on interoperable central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

This infrastructure-focused initiative has drawn less attention, as it avoids the drama of calls for a ‘BRICS currency' or overt de-dollarization. However, its avoidance of headline-grabbing moves may make it more consequential, underscoring the main argument: practical infrastructure changes can reshape finance more than symbolic challenges.

In this spirit, rather than challenging the dollar directly, the proposal focuses on a more pragmatic approach—building alternative payment rails that allow trade to be settled directly between national digital currencies, reducing reliance on the dollar-based SWIFT system.

A recurring misunderstanding surrounds BRICS financial cooperation. The current initiative does not seek to create a single BRICS currency, nor does it require member states to cede monetary sovereignty to a supranational authority. 

Earlier proposals along those lines faltered for predictable reasons: divergent inflation regimes, incompatible capital controls, and concerns about dominance of the Chinese yuan.

The present approach moves in a different direction. It aims to link existing national CBDCs, such as India's digital rupee, China's digital yuan, and Russia's digital ruble, through interoperable infrastructure. Each currency remains fully sovereign. What changes is the infrastructure that allows them to interact more efficiently.

In practical terms, this would enable cross-border payments to be settled directly in national currencies, without passing through correspondent banks or the dollar-centric SWIFT network. For participants, the appeal is clear: faster settlement, lower transaction costs, and reduced exposure to sanctions or asset freezes by Western governments.

India's role is pivotal. As the summit host and agenda-setter, New Delhi has pushed CBDC interoperability from an abstract discussion to concrete policy coordination. It reflects India's broader digital payments philosophy, shaped by the domestic success of its Unified Payments Interface (UPI): a focus on interoperability and on preserving monetary sovereignty.

The Reserve Bank of India, which plays a key role in the process, has emphasized that the digital rupee is not a crypto-asset and is not a step toward a currency union. It is a state-backed digital equivalent of cash, designed to improve efficiency while retaining policy control. 

This stance explains why India has resisted proposals for a supranational BRICS currency while supporting infrastructure that makes national currencies more usable in cross-border trade.

Experience has also played a role. Earlier bilateral settlement arrangements with Russia left Moscow holding large amounts of rupees it could not easily spend, a problem known as the “rupee trap.”

That failure underscored the need for a multilateral network in which earned currencies can circulate across a broader trading bloc rather than accumulate uselessly.

At the heart of the proposed new BRICS payment system are two key mechanisms designed to make trade in national currencies seamless, without relying on the dollar: settlement cycles and foreign exchange swap lines.

Settlement cycles act as a periodic netting system. Instead of forcing an immediate exchange for every single transaction, which requires constant, massive cash liquidity, all payments between two countries are accumulated over a set period. At the end of the cycle, only the net difference is settled.

For example, if Indian imports from China total ₹500 billion in a month and Chinese imports from India total ₹400 billion, only the net ₹100 billion owed by India to China needs to be transferred.

This dramatically reduces the volume of currency that must physically move, lowering costs and eliminating the risk of one country being stuck with a large, unusable surplus of another's currency.

Forex swap lines serve as a liquidity safety net. These are pre-arranged agreements between central banks to exchange specified amounts of their currencies for a fixed period.

If a country suddenly needs more of a partner's currency to meet its net settlement obligation due to, for instance, a seasonal import surge, its central bank can temporarily “borrow” that currency via the swap line.

None of this makes the BRICS system a substitute for the dollar, the bedrock of modern global finance. The dollar still constitutes about 59% of global foreign exchange reserves, underpins 58% of international payments and is used to invoice over half of all cross-border trade.

At the same time, the unprecedented scale of US and global dollar-denominated debt has become a primary source of systemic financial risk.

With the US national debt approaching $39 trillion and global debt estimated at $315 trillion, of which 64% is dollar-denominated, the world's economic stability is perilously linked to sustained confidence in the dollar.

The key concern is a self-reinforcing cycle. Servicing the massive US debt relies on continuous global demand for dollar assets, primarily US Treasury bonds. If this demand falters due to factors like geopolitical shifts or US policies, interest rates could rise sharply.

Higher rates would dramatically increase the US government's debt servicing costs (now the largest item in the Federal budget), while simultaneously tightening global financial conditions. This could trigger potential defaults and crises among other nations and corporations burdened by dollar loans.

This dynamic would create vulnerabilities for both the US and the global dependent on dollar liquidity.

To protect the dollar in its role as the main global reserve currency, the United States employs a multi-faceted strategy that blends institutional, financial, and, at times, coercive measures, rather than relying on any single dramatic action.

A primary tool is the use of financial sanctions and access to the dollar-based global payment system (SWIFT) as a deterrent. Countries like Iran and Russia have faced severe economic isolation for challenging US interests, demonstrating the high cost of attempting to operate outside the dollar ecosystem.

This creates a powerful disincentive for others, as “de-dollarization” efforts risk cutting nations off from the world's largest financial market and most traded currency.

Concurrently, the US is working to expand and modernize the dollar's reach. The most significant emerging frontier is digital finance. US regulators and financial institutions are actively shaping the framework for dollar-denominated stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar.

By ensuring these digital assets operate within US regulatory oversight, the goal is to cement the dollar's primacy in the rapidly evolving digital economy, co-opting innovation rather than being disrupted by it.

But recent trends are cause for concern among investors and central bankers. A key indicator is the accelerating demand for gold among central banks worldwide. In 2025, for the first time in nearly three decades, foreign central banks' collective holdings of gold surpassed their holdings of US Treasuries in value terms.

This historic crossover was underscored by gold's dramatic price surge, which rose 60-70% in 2025, pushing prices well above $4,000 per ounce for the first time in history. Prices have continued to rise in the first month of 2026, hitting over $5,500 per ounce. 

This gradual rebalancing toward “neutral” assets like gold, one of the few that have no counterparty risk when the owner holds physical possession, enhances resilience without fully disrupting the current monetary order. But it highlights eroding confidence in an overly dollar-centric system.

The likelihood of the U.S. engineering a “soft landing” for its debt burden through controlled inflation remains a subject of intense debate. It would require inflating the debt away without collapsing the economy. But the erosion of the dollar's purchasing power would lead to lower living standards for most Americans.

Concerns about the dollar partly explain the renewed efforts by the BRICS to develop a parallel payment rail alongside SWIFT. Other concerns were the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system and the confiscation of $300 billion in Russian reserves.

Russia was not the first country to feel the wrath of the Western financial system; Iran, North Korea, and Cuba also had they assesst frozen or confiscated. But Russia became a watershed moment. If Russian assets can be frozen, no country is immune from meeting the same fate.

To be sure, significant hurdles remain before BRICS has a fully operational payment rail that can serve as an alternative to SWIFT, among them legal harmonization and technical implementation.

Most CBDCs of most BRICS countries are still in the testing stage (the digital rupee, e-CNY, and the digital ruble not yet fully scaled), and interoperability faces technical, regulatory, and governance challenges. But with unpredictable US policies and rising geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions, an alternative financial system is no longer an option but an economic and financial imperative.

By developing a parallel payment rail, the BRICS payment system could provide an alternative payment channel in case of a global crisis. It would prevent a complete halt in cross-border commerce and allow essential trades to continue, particularly in energy and commodities.

By ensuring continued transactional functionality for a significant portion of the global economy, a BRICS payment rail could mitigate contagion, buy time for coordinated policy response, and facilitate a more managed, less catastrophic adjustment to a new financial equilibrium.

The development of BRICS payment rails is likely to evolve pragmatically, leveraging existing bilateral systems before expanding into a multilateral network. An example is the foundational link between India and the UAE, a key BRICS-associated economy, and six other countries.

India's Unified Payments Interface is already interoperable with the UAE's Instant Payment Platform (IPP), allowing for fast, low-cost cross-border transfers. This established corridor can serve as a tested model and technical blueprint for other BRICS partners.

Expansion would logically focus on integrating other members with robust domestic instant payment systems, such as Brazil's PIX or, potentially, China's CIPS/digital yuan infrastructure.

The challenge will be creating a central hub or shared messaging standard that connects these diverse national systems without requiring complete harmonization. Initially, this takes the form of a network of bilateral agreements that directly reduce dependency on Western-centric SWIFT for trade settlements in local currencies.

The long-term ambition is a unified BRICS platform that facilitates direct transactions in members' currencies. Participation is voluntary. Success depends on overcoming geopolitical divergences and aligning technical standards.

Despite significant hurdles, direction of travel is clear enough to warrant attention. The age of a single hegemonic financial system is not ending overnight, but an alternative track is virtually a historical inevitability. BRICS, with India in the lead, is laying the first tracks.

Fidelity is launching a stablecoin that investors will be able to buy and sell for $1 when it arrives in the “coming weeks.” The stablecoin, called Fidelity Digital Dollar (FIDD), will live on the Ethereum network and is backed by cash reserves, cash equivalents, and short-term US Treasuries, according to CoinDesk.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that's typically pegged to an asset, like the US dollar. More companies and financial institutions have started launching stablecoins of their own after President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act last July, which lays out a framework for the digital currency. In addition to introducing a 100 percent reserve backing requirement, the law also gives stablecoin holders priority over other creditors in case of a crash, likely to help avoid a repeat of the collapse of the algorithm-backed Terra stablecoin in 2022.

Fidelity will make FIDD available on its own platforms, while also launching it on “major” cryptocurrency exchanges (though it hasn't revealed any specific exchanges yet). Holders can also transfer FIDD to any Ethereum mainnet address, according to the press release.

Digital Currency X Technology Inc. Regains Compliance with Nasdaq...

Digital Currency X Technology (NASDAQ: DCX) announced it regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) for the market value of listed securities. The company said Nasdaq's Listing Qualifications staff determined DCX's market value was at least $35,000,000 for 20 consecutive business days from Dec 23, 2025 to Jan 22, 2026, closing the matter after an earlier notice of noncompliance dated Dec 12, 2025.

Recent Nasdaq-related and structural announcements often coincided with negative price reactions, even when strategically oriented or treasury-enhancing.

Over the past months, DCX has faced multiple Nasdaq compliance issues and structural actions. A $1.0 billion EdgeAI token acquisition on Dec 11, 2025 modestly lifted shares, but subsequent notices about MVLS non-compliance on Dec 18, 2025 and a delisting notification on Jan 23, 2026 saw declines. A 12-for-1 share consolidation effective Jan 22, 2026 also drew a negative reaction. Today's notice that MVLS compliance has been regained closes one of those listing deficiencies and contrasts with earlier Nasdaq warnings.


      This announcement closes a significant listing risk: Nasdaq confirmed DCX regained compliance with the $35,000,000 market value of listed securities requirement after 20 consecutive qualifying days. It follows earlier notices of MVLS and bid-price deficiencies, plus a 12-for-1 share consolidation aimed at maintaining the Nasdaq listing. In context of prior actions and the large EdgeAI token acquisition, investors may watch whether compliance can be sustained and how listing stability interacts with the company's digital asset strategy.

					Covering geo-political news and current affairs across Asia				

As India prepares to host the BRICS summit later this year, the focus will be on a payment system linking national digital currencies. By prioritizing this infrastructure over launching a new currency, the bloc makes a pragmatic bet that practical systems will reshape global finance more than symbolic gestures.

At the summit, a crucial agenda item signals a potential shift: developing a BRICS payment system built on interoperable central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

This infrastructure-focused initiative has drawn less attention, as it avoids the drama of calls for a ‘BRICS currency' or overt de-dollarization. However, its avoidance of headline-grabbing moves may make it more consequential, underscoring the main argument: practical infrastructure changes can reshape finance more than symbolic challenges.

In this spirit, rather than challenging the dollar directly, the proposal focuses on a more pragmatic approach—building alternative payment rails that allow trade to be settled directly between national digital currencies, reducing reliance on the dollar-based SWIFT system.

A recurring misunderstanding surrounds BRICS financial cooperation. The current initiative does not seek to create a single BRICS currency, nor does it require member states to cede monetary sovereignty to a supranational authority. 

Earlier proposals along those lines faltered for predictable reasons: divergent inflation regimes, incompatible capital controls, and concerns about dominance of the Chinese yuan.

The present approach moves in a different direction. It aims to link existing national CBDCs, such as India's digital rupee, China's digital yuan, and Russia's digital ruble, through interoperable infrastructure. Each currency remains fully sovereign. What changes is the infrastructure that allows them to interact more efficiently.

In practical terms, this would enable cross-border payments to be settled directly in national currencies, without passing through correspondent banks or the dollar-centric SWIFT network. For participants, the appeal is clear: faster settlement, lower transaction costs, and reduced exposure to sanctions or asset freezes by Western governments.

India's role is pivotal. As the summit host and agenda-setter, New Delhi has pushed CBDC interoperability from an abstract discussion to concrete policy coordination. It reflects India's broader digital payments philosophy, shaped by the domestic success of its Unified Payments Interface (UPI): a focus on interoperability and on preserving monetary sovereignty.

The Reserve Bank of India, which plays a key role in the process, has emphasized that the digital rupee is not a crypto-asset and is not a step toward a currency union. It is a state-backed digital equivalent of cash, designed to improve efficiency while retaining policy control. 

This stance explains why India has resisted proposals for a supranational BRICS currency while supporting infrastructure that makes national currencies more usable in cross-border trade.

Experience has also played a role. Earlier bilateral settlement arrangements with Russia left Moscow holding large amounts of rupees it could not easily spend, a problem known as the “rupee trap.”

That failure underscored the need for a multilateral network in which earned currencies can circulate across a broader trading bloc rather than accumulate uselessly.

At the heart of the proposed new BRICS payment system are two key mechanisms designed to make trade in national currencies seamless, without relying on the dollar: settlement cycles and foreign exchange swap lines.

Settlement cycles act as a periodic netting system. Instead of forcing an immediate exchange for every single transaction, which requires constant, massive cash liquidity, all payments between two countries are accumulated over a set period. At the end of the cycle, only the net difference is settled.

For example, if Indian imports from China total ₹500 billion in a month and Chinese imports from India total ₹400 billion, only the net ₹100 billion owed by India to China needs to be transferred.

This dramatically reduces the volume of currency that must physically move, lowering costs and eliminating the risk of one country being stuck with a large, unusable surplus of another's currency.

Forex swap lines serve as a liquidity safety net. These are pre-arranged agreements between central banks to exchange specified amounts of their currencies for a fixed period.

If a country suddenly needs more of a partner's currency to meet its net settlement obligation due to, for instance, a seasonal import surge, its central bank can temporarily “borrow” that currency via the swap line.

None of this makes the BRICS system a substitute for the dollar, the bedrock of modern global finance. The dollar still constitutes about 59% of global foreign exchange reserves, underpins 58% of international payments and is used to invoice over half of all cross-border trade.

At the same time, the unprecedented scale of US and global dollar-denominated debt has become a primary source of systemic financial risk.

With the US national debt approaching $39 trillion and global debt estimated at $315 trillion, of which 64% is dollar-denominated, the world's economic stability is perilously linked to sustained confidence in the dollar.

The key concern is a self-reinforcing cycle. Servicing the massive US debt relies on continuous global demand for dollar assets, primarily US Treasury bonds. If this demand falters due to factors like geopolitical shifts or US policies, interest rates could rise sharply.

Higher rates would dramatically increase the US government's debt servicing costs (now the largest item in the Federal budget), while simultaneously tightening global financial conditions. This could trigger potential defaults and crises among other nations and corporations burdened by dollar loans.

This dynamic would create vulnerabilities for both the US and the global dependent on dollar liquidity.

To protect the dollar in its role as the main global reserve currency, the United States employs a multi-faceted strategy that blends institutional, financial, and, at times, coercive measures, rather than relying on any single dramatic action.

A primary tool is the use of financial sanctions and access to the dollar-based global payment system (SWIFT) as a deterrent. Countries like Iran and Russia have faced severe economic isolation for challenging US interests, demonstrating the high cost of attempting to operate outside the dollar ecosystem.

This creates a powerful disincentive for others, as “de-dollarization” efforts risk cutting nations off from the world's largest financial market and most traded currency.

Concurrently, the US is working to expand and modernize the dollar's reach. The most significant emerging frontier is digital finance. US regulators and financial institutions are actively shaping the framework for dollar-denominated stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar.

By ensuring these digital assets operate within US regulatory oversight, the goal is to cement the dollar's primacy in the rapidly evolving digital economy, co-opting innovation rather than being disrupted by it.

But recent trends are cause for concern among investors and central bankers. A key indicator is the accelerating demand for gold among central banks worldwide. In 2025, for the first time in nearly three decades, foreign central banks' collective holdings of gold surpassed their holdings of US Treasuries in value terms.

This historic crossover was underscored by gold's dramatic price surge, which rose 60-70% in 2025, pushing prices well above $4,000 per ounce for the first time in history. Prices have continued to rise in the first month of 2026, hitting over $5,500 per ounce. 

This gradual rebalancing toward “neutral” assets like gold, one of the few that have no counterparty risk when the owner holds physical possession, enhances resilience without fully disrupting the current monetary order. But it highlights eroding confidence in an overly dollar-centric system.

The likelihood of the U.S. engineering a “soft landing” for its debt burden through controlled inflation remains a subject of intense debate. It would require inflating the debt away without collapsing the economy. But the erosion of the dollar's purchasing power would lead to lower living standards for most Americans.

Concerns about the dollar partly explain the renewed efforts by the BRICS to develop a parallel payment rail alongside SWIFT. Other concerns were the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system and the confiscation of $300 billion in Russian reserves.

Russia was not the first country to feel the wrath of the Western financial system; Iran, North Korea, and Cuba also had they assesst frozen or confiscated. But Russia became a watershed moment. If Russian assets can be frozen, no country is immune from meeting the same fate.

To be sure, significant hurdles remain before BRICS has a fully operational payment rail that can serve as an alternative to SWIFT, among them legal harmonization and technical implementation.

Most CBDCs of most BRICS countries are still in the testing stage (the digital rupee, e-CNY, and the digital ruble not yet fully scaled), and interoperability faces technical, regulatory, and governance challenges. But with unpredictable US policies and rising geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions, an alternative financial system is no longer an option but an economic and financial imperative.

By developing a parallel payment rail, the BRICS payment system could provide an alternative payment channel in case of a global crisis. It would prevent a complete halt in cross-border commerce and allow essential trades to continue, particularly in energy and commodities.

By ensuring continued transactional functionality for a significant portion of the global economy, a BRICS payment rail could mitigate contagion, buy time for coordinated policy response, and facilitate a more managed, less catastrophic adjustment to a new financial equilibrium.

The development of BRICS payment rails is likely to evolve pragmatically, leveraging existing bilateral systems before expanding into a multilateral network. An example is the foundational link between India and the UAE, a key BRICS-associated economy, and six other countries.

India's Unified Payments Interface is already interoperable with the UAE's Instant Payment Platform (IPP), allowing for fast, low-cost cross-border transfers. This established corridor can serve as a tested model and technical blueprint for other BRICS partners.

Expansion would logically focus on integrating other members with robust domestic instant payment systems, such as Brazil's PIX or, potentially, China's CIPS/digital yuan infrastructure.

The challenge will be creating a central hub or shared messaging standard that connects these diverse national systems without requiring complete harmonization. Initially, this takes the form of a network of bilateral agreements that directly reduce dependency on Western-centric SWIFT for trade settlements in local currencies.

The long-term ambition is a unified BRICS platform that facilitates direct transactions in members' currencies. Participation is voluntary. Success depends on overcoming geopolitical divergences and aligning technical standards.

Despite significant hurdles, direction of travel is clear enough to warrant attention. The age of a single hegemonic financial system is not ending overnight, but an alternative track is virtually a historical inevitability. BRICS, with India in the lead, is laying the first tracks.

                Dakota aims to streamline cross-border transactions by embedding compliance features within its stablecoin platform.

Dakota, a stablecoin-focused neobank founded by veterans of Coinbase, Square, and Airbnb, has launched a platform that allows fintechs and enterprises to embed regulated, programmable global money movement via APIs.

Cross-border money movement remains slow and expensive, and while stablecoins offer speed, adoption has been limited by regulatory and operational challenges. Dakota wants to address this by providing infrastructure that works across jurisdictions and rails, unlocking scalable global payments.

The platform enables companies to offer payments, treasury, and payouts using stablecoins directly in their products, bridging digital assets with real-world compliance across the US and Europe, the company stated.

“Most companies don't want to become banks or payments networks,” said Ryan Bozarth, Dakota's co-founder and CEO. “They want reliable, regulated primitives that let them move money inside their own products. Dakota is building that infrastructure so teams can stay focused on product and growth, not licensing, custody, or compliance.”

Dakota operates as a registered Money Services Business in the US with active state Money Transmitter Licenses and is acquiring an EMI and CASP in Europe. Compliance features are embedded directly into the platform through automated KYB, AML, transaction monitoring, and risk controls.

“If stablecoins are going to power real economic activity, they need to integrate with existing compliance and risk standards,” Bozarth added. “Our role is to make that integration native, not an afterthought.”

Founded in 2022, Dakota offers business customers bank-like services such as checking accounts and yields on deposits, while using stablecoins to move money between customers and its banking partners.

In July 2025, the firm secured $12.5 million in a Series A funding round led by crypto venture firm CoinFund, with participation from 6th Man Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and Triton Ventures.

Why the crypto industry spent $130 million buying the 2024 election.

In 2024, the cryptocurrency industry spent more than $130 million to influence elections nationwide. Their campaign donations and lobbying efforts turned the tables for their risky boom-and-bust business, which is now poised to overtake our entire financial system.

In Part Two of What Tech Wants, Lever Time's investigation into why Silicon Valley is buying our democracy, producer Ariella Markowitz reveals how crypto companies aligned with President Donald Trump to advance their agenda. Could crypto's rise unleash a new era of corruption and threaten Americans' retirement accounts?

[00:00:00] David Sirota: From The Lever's reader, supported newsroom, it's Lever Time. I'm David Sirota. In our last episode, you heard the story of how a handful of Silicon Valley leaders organized to purge progressive politicians from San Francisco politics and how that recall movement spread. Those political strategies showed the tech industry they could organize to remove politicians that don't agree with their agenda.

In this next installment of our investigation, The Lever's producer, Ariella Markowitz, is gonna tell you the story of how the cryptocurrency industry hijacked the 2024 election. But what even is cryptocurrency? Why are billionaires and tech moguls pushing to unleash crypto into our financial system? Why has Donald Trump embraced the cryptocurrency industry and how does the high stakes boom-and-bust crypto casino affect everyone in America with a retirement savings account?

That's all coming up on today's episode.

[00:01:06] Donald Trump: Bitcoin just seems like a scam.

[00:01:08] Ariella Markowitz: That was Donald Trump on Fox News in 2021.

[00:01:12] Donald Trump: I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar.

[00:01:15] Ariella Markowitz: At the time, Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency industry were writing high, but sure enough, the crypto industry crashed in 2022, incinerating billions of dollars of investments.

[00:01:27] Jacob Silverman: Capitalism has its own pretty rapid cycles of boom and bust, it seems. But crypto's even faster. I mean, a lot of people joke that crypto's been speed-running the last 500 years of capitalism.

[00:01:38] Ariella Markowitz: That's Jacob Silverman. He's a journalist based in New York City.

[00:01:41] Jacob Silverman: In Brooklyn, of course, like everyone else.

[00:01:44] Ariella Markowitz: Jacob writes about technology and the digital revolution of American democracy. His most recent book is called Gilded Rage:  Elon Musk and the Radicalization of Silicon Valley.

[00:01:54] Jacob Silverman: It's about the rise of the tech right and the last election, and basically how this new alignment between tech elites and MAGA came about.

[00:02:04] Ariella Markowitz: Jacob started working on this book a few years ago when he had a hunch that Elon Musk would become involved in the 2024 election.

[00:02:10] Jacob Silverman: Yeah. Seems like a huge understatement in retrospect.

[00:02:13] Ariella Markowitz: Should have bet on it.

[00:02:14] Jacob Silverman: Yeah. I don't know if Polymarket was open then or not.

[00:02:17] Ariella Markowitz: Jacob Silverman has been following texts foray into politics for years, and he says this is the moment when everything really changed.

[00:02:25] Donald Trump: I'm thrilled to be here and to become the first American president ever to address a Bitcoin event, anywhere in the world.

Immediately after a Boeing airplane suffered a mid-flight cabin breach, The Lever uncovered documents filed in federal court alleging that former employees at the company's subcontractor had repeatedly warned corporate officials about serious production issues and were told to falsify records. 

Our reporting received wall-to-wall coverage and helped lead to federal prosecutors levying additional sanctions against Boeing.

The Lever followed the money behind the architect of the conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, Leonard Leo — and uncovered that his operation had been supercharged by a record-breaking $1.6 billion secret tax-free donation from Chicago businessman Barre Seid. 

In the aftermath, President Biden highlighted the donation in a major speech urging Congress to pass a bill getting dark money out of politics.

In April 2025, The Lever released its investigation into how several firms in the tax industry donated more than $137,000 to Trump's nominee to lead the IRS—which conveniently absolved him of virtually that exact amount of debt from a failed 2022 senate race.

The next month, a group of senators released a letter demanding more information about the donations, repeatedly citing The Lever's original reporting in their demands.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin held near $88,000 early Thursday as Asian markets eased out of a hot streak in tech and investors shifted focus to earnings, central bank signals, and a fresh run higher in gold.

Shanghai rose 0.21% and DJ Shanghai gained 0.22%, and the SZSE Component slipped 0.10% and China A50 fell 0.20%. Hong Kong stood out as the Hang Seng jumped 1.22%.

Bitcoin: $88,527, down 0.7%

Ether: $2,990, down 0.6%

XRP: $1.89, down 0.1%

Total crypto market cap: $3.08 trillion, down 0.6%

Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM, said that markets are being pulled in two directions.

“On one hand, optimism around global equities and major tech earnings is supporting risk appetite. On the other, persistent trade uncertainty, sharp currency moves, and doubts around US fiscal and monetary policy are keeping investors on edge,” he said.

“With the dollar still vulnerable and big tech earnings accounting for a significant share of the S&P 500, the coming days could set the tone for risk sentiment well beyond this week.”

Gold and silver pushed to fresh all-time highs as investors stayed committed to physical assets, and oil hit a four-month top after President Donald Trump warned Iran of possible attacks if it did not make a deal on nuclear weapons.

In the US, the Federal Reserve kept rates on hold, and Chair Jerome Powell talked of a “clearly improving” economic outlook and broad support on the committee for a pause. Powell also sidestepped questions on whether he would remain as a governor after stepping down as chair in May as Trump presses for deeper cuts.

Traders then repriced the path ahead, with the chance of another easing by April pared back to 26% and June seen as the next likely window at 61%.

Earnings kept driving the equity story. Samsung Electronics reported a surge in operating profit as AI spending lifted chip prices, and markets also watched the split reaction to Microsoft and Meta, with investors turning next to Apple results.

Currency markets stayed unsettled as the dollar remained under pressure, even after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the administration's preference for a strong dollar, and European officials monitored the euro's rise as the European Central Bank flagged that a steep move could influence rate decisions.

For crypto, the mood stayed cautious. Thin spot ETF activity and softer derivatives positioning kept bitcoin trading in a tight range, with traders looking for a clearer catalyst from risk markets, earnings, and the next signals from policymakers.

Bitcoin fell more than 4% to around $85K as a broad risk-off move swept global markets, with the leading digital asset dropping alongside equities, tech stocks, and gold.

The S&P 500 declined over 1% while the Nasdaq slid more than 1.8%, with US equities opening sharply lower following a steep drop in Microsoft shares.

Microsoft fell about 11% after its earnings report, dragging the broader technology sector lower. Tesla dropped around 2%, Google slipped roughly 2.5%, and Nvidia fell about 1.5%.

The selloff extended beyond equities. Gold, which topped $5,500 on Wednesday at a record high, reversed sharply and fell nearly 5% to around $5,100 as investors cut exposure across asset classes.

The market turbulence triggered heavy liquidations in crypto. More than $360 million in positions were liquidated over the past hour, according to Coinglass data, driven overwhelmingly by long positions.

Of that total, roughly $350 million came from longs compared with about $10 million in short liquidations. Total liquidations over the past 24 hours approached $700 million.

Bitcoin's decline was mirrored across major tokens. Ether fell about 6% to near $2,800, Solana dropped roughly 5% to around $118, and XRP slid about 5% to near $1.80.

The U.S. Senate's Agriculture Committee is holding its first markup hearing on crypto market structure legislation, giving lawmakers a chance to debate and vote on amendments and possibly advance the actual legislation.

ND (11:30 a.m. ET): After less than an hour of debate and just a handful of amendments, the Senate Agriculture Committee voted to advance its market structure legislation to the full Senate on a party-line vote (12 lawmakers voted for it, 11 against). All eyes are now back on the Senate Banking Committee, which postponed its own markup hearing earlier this month and has yet to set a new date. 

ND (11:28 a.m. ET): Unmentioned so far in Thursday's hearing: The crypto markets themselves, which were down heavily between 4% and 7% over the past 24 hours of trading. Bitcoin hovered around $84,000 at press time.

JH (11:24 a.m. ET): We moved from Democrat amendments to a Republican one that's meant to block foreign adversaries of the U.S. from meddling in the U.S. crypto markets. Senator Tommy Tuberville pushed the amendment ""about ensuring our digital markets are not compromised by our enemies.""

But Tuberville agreed to withdraw his amendments with an understanding of ""what we're trying to accomplish today,"" he said. So he asked that the ideas can come up again later.

ND (11:22a.m. ET): More from Booker earlier:

""What I and so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle see is that we are standing on the cusp of extraordinary humanity, changing breakthroughs that could give Americans a financial system that is faster, cheaper and more inclusive,"" he said. ""I have seen in my own community that the system we have right now often screws customers, hurts their ability to access financial markets. There is a democratizing force, or at least potential that is moving across our country and across the world.""

Senator Adam Schiff of California likewise commented that Democrats had a working group to support crypto legislation, likening crypto to artificial intelligence: ""We want these jobs. We want this industry to stay in the United States, and that means that we need to have rules of the road where we're not essentially making decisions through litigation."" 

However, he expected that the bill will advance on party lines due to the partisan nature of the bill, he said. 

JH (11:17 a.m. ET): The opening Democratic amendments went down, as expected, in party-line votes, including the standout issue meant to target President Donald Trump's crypto business interests.

It's been a cordial disagreement so far today, with Democrats gently accusing that Republicans abandoned negotiations and Republicans gently suggesting that disagreements can be resolved later.

ND (11:14 a.m. ET): The second amendment offered, this time by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, would prohibit the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department from ""providing digital commodity intermediaries with a taxpayer-funded bailout"" in the event of banking failures, pointing to Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank. 

Boozman said that ""nothing in the bill would grant the CFTC authority"" to provide bankruptcy assistance, calling the amendment ""unnecessary."" 

The amendment failed 11-12 on party lines. 

ND (11:08 a.m. ET): The first amendment, offered by Senator Michael Bennett, a Colorado Democrat, addressed Democrats' concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's profiting off of his family's various crypto interests and businesses. 

""I think this issue strikes at the core of our democracy,"" Bennett said. ""This amendment is not about crypto or even particularly about President Trump. It's about returning to a system of government and ethics that that we thought the American people deserved.""

Boozman said he was opposed to the amendment as it reached ""way beyond"" the Agriculture Committee's jurisdiction.

The amendment failed 11-12 on party line votes.

ND (10:56 a.m. ET): The Thursday hearing will see lawmakers offer up amendments on the underlying text, which the committee published last week. While the Senators were working on bipartisan legislation, Committee Chairman John Boozman said in a statement last week that ""fundamental differences in policy"" remained and the members of the committee had not come to an agreement on the text that was published.

Senator Cory Booker, the Democrat leading negotiations on the bill, said in opening remarks that lawmakers were close to an agreement on key issues, pointing to U.S. President Donald Trump and his family's crypto ties as one outstanding area of concern, as well as the lack of a firm agreement on quorum at federal agencies. 

""In football parlance, we moved from our own goal line all the way down 70 yards. We're almost in the red zone on this bill, and that frustrates me, because I see a bipartisan glide path to land this plane, to punch through the end zone,"" Booker said. 

Boozman, in his own opening remarks, said lawmakers had made ""really significant progress"" in putting the bill together. 

""Advancing this bill is the first step, and there are many steps to come in achieving those goals,"" he said. ""I also encourage that the administration and Senate leadership to coordinate and ensure that the CFTC is fully constituted and adequately funded.""

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

What to know: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

The head of Russia's lower house of the country's parliament on Thursday said crypto market regulations will be ready by June of this year and come into force on July 1, 2027.

Anatoly Aksakov, head of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, said that qualified and unqualified investors will be allowed to purchase cryptocurrencies although under separate rules, according to the Duma's official news outlet.

A cap will be in place on retail investors' crypto purchases with the figure of 300,000 rubles ($4,000) being discussed, he added.

Qualified investors will also be required to undergo mandatory testing to ensure they understand the risks of cryptocurrency transactions, but they will be able to purchase any crypto assets in unlimited quantities, with the exception of anonymous ones.

Aksakov also said the crypto market framework will include penalties for illegal activities of intermediaries in the cryptocurrency that are similar to sanctions for illegal banking activities.

Russia's central bank laid out a proposed framework in December that would legalize and regulate cryptocurrency trading for both individuals and institutions, continuing its softening stance toward cryptocurrencies. However, it continues to caution that investing in crypto carries risks, including potential losses. The central bank also said digital currencies and stablecoins are recognized as monetary assets, but they cannot be used for domestic payments.

Aksakov said cryptocurrency miners will be allowed to “legalize themselves as much as possible. We plan to establish administrative, financial, and, quite possibly, criminal liability for illegal activity in this market in separate legislation.""

The parliamentary news outlet included comments from a lawyer saying the central bank will be tasked with compiling a list of top five to 10 cryptocurrencies permitted for trading. “These will definitely include BTC and ETH. They might also add SOL or TON, given their popularity in our country. The rest are only for qualified investors,"" the expert said.

""The Central Bank explicitly states: you cannot buy coins that conceal their intended recipients,"" such as “monero XMR$475.19, zcash ZEC$365.44, and dash. After all, if you can't construct a transaction graph and see where the money came from, such an asset won't pass AML (anti-money laundering) checks.""

Bitcoin BTC$88,336.23 tumbled Thursday to its weakest level since mid-December, shedding nearly $3,000 within hours as gold's massive rally abruptly turned.

Soaring above $5,600 per ounce at one point Thursday (gold prior to Sunday night had never been above $5,000), gold in the space of a few minutes in morning U.S. trade plunged nearly 10% to back below $5,200.

The price action in silver followed a similar path, with that metal falling from $121 per ounce to $108.

Adding fuel to the selloff was Microsoft (MSFT), whose shares collapsed more than 11% — potentially their worst day since March 2020 — after the company reported slowing growth in its cloud business. The tech giant's stumble dragged the Nasdaq lower by around 1.5%, deepening the risk-off tone. 

Crypto markets followed suit. Trading above $88,000 earlier in the session, bitcoin fell precipitously to $85,200, its lowest level in more than a month. The largest crypto was down 4.5% over the past 24 hours.

Ethereum's ether ETH$2,961.90, Solana SOL$118.07, DOGE$0.1222 and ADA$0.3510 lost 5%-6% during the same period as altcoins were hit harder in the sell-off.

Looking at crypto stocks, the largest corporate bitcoin holder, Strategy (MSTR), is down 8% on its worst day since Dec. 12, hitting 52-week lows and trading back to September 2024 levels. 

Other names posting big losses include Bullish (BLSH), Twenty One Capital (XXI). Circle (CRCL) and Coinbase (COIN) — all down 4%-8%.

The S&P 500 Volatility  Index has jumped more than 16% to 19, its second-highest level since the end of November, while the DXY index has rebounded to 96.6 from a Wednesday low of 95.5, also potentially putting renewed pressure on risk assets.

Robinhood (HOOD) is investing in Talos, an institutional trading technology provider for digital assets, in an extended Series B funding round that values the New York-based company at around $1.5 billion.

Talos originally raised $105 million in a Series B funding round in May 2022, valuing the firm at $1.25 billion. The new extension brings the firm's total amount raised in its Series B to $150 million, the company said in a press release on Thursday. 

""We extended our series B round to accommodate interest from strategic partners who recognize Talos's role in providing core institutional infrastructure for digital assets. At a time when traditional asset classes are increasingly migrating to digital rails, these partners wanted to be more closely aligned with our growth,"" said Anton Katz, CEO and co-founder of Talos, in emailed comments.

New strategic investors Robinhood Markets, Sony Innovation Fund, IMC, QCP, and Karatage joined the extended round, alongside returning backers a16z crypto, BNY and Fidelity Investments.

""Talos's flexibility and rapid adaptability allow us to deepen our liquidity and deliver even more advanced features to Robinhood Crypto customers,” said Johann Kerbrat, SVP and GM of Crypto at Robinhood, in the release. 

Robinhood has been expanding its reach in crypto and blockchain infrastructure as part of its broader expansion strategy. 

The company is developing its own blockchain network built on Arbitrum and has rolled out tokenized stock trading and other crypto products in Europe, alongside new staking and perpetual futures offerings, signaling a shift toward crypto-native finance. It has also seen strong growth in areas such as prediction markets, and recently reported increased trading volumes and product engagement amid these strategic investments.

Talos is a crypto trading technology firm that builds institutional-grade infrastructure to power the entire digital asset trading lifecycle for professional investors, brokers and banks. Its platform pools liquidity from exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) desks and prime brokers, and provides institutions with tools for trade execution, risk management and post-trade settlement through a single interface or API.

It counts hundreds of clients across roughly 35 countries, with traditional finance firms making up 60% to 70% of new customers over the past year. Asset managers using Talos' platform collectively represent about $21 trillion in assets under management, CEO Anton Katz told investment bank Jefferies in a client call in November.

The firm's Series B in 2022 was led by General Atlantic, with participation from firms including BNY, Citi (C), Wells Fargo Strategic Capital and DRW Venture Capital, alongside crypto-focused investors such as SCB 10x and LeadBlock Partners. Existing backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, PayPal Ventures, Fidelity Investments and Castle Island Ventures, also participated in the round.

Talos has been on a notable acquisition spree, most recently buying Coin Metrics for over $100 million, bringing in its onchain analytics, market data and benchmark indexes as its largest deal yet. Before that, it snapped up D3X Systems, Cloudwall, and Skolem as part of its broader expansion through M&A.

Exhaust gases from home furnaces, fireplaces, and industrial facilities release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the air, contributing to pollution. Scientists reporting in ACS Energy Letters have developed a new type of electrode designed to address this problem by capturing CO2 directly from the air and turning it into a useful chemical called formic acid. In testing, the system outperformed existing electrode technologies when exposed to simulated flue gas and when operating at CO2 levels similar to those found in the atmosphere.

""This work shows that carbon capture and conversion do not need to be treated as separate steps. By integrating both functions into a single electrode, we demonstrate a simpler pathway for CO2 utilization under realistic gas conditions,"" explains Wonyong Choi, a corresponding author on the study.

Why CO2 Conversion Has Been So Difficult

Pulling carbon dioxide out of the air may seem straightforward, especially since plants do it naturally. The greater challenge lies in transforming that captured gas into something useful, a step that is essential if carbon capture technologies are to be widely adopted. In real industrial exhaust, CO2 is usually mixed with other gases, including nitrogen and oxygen. Most existing conversion systems only work efficiently when carbon dioxide has already been separated and concentrated, which limits their practicality.

To overcome this obstacle, Donglai Pan, Myoung Hwan Oh, Wonyong Choi, and their colleagues set out to build a system that could operate under realistic conditions. Their goal was to create a device capable of handling flue gas as it is actually produced and converting even small amounts of captured CO2 into a valuable product.

Inside the Three Layer Electrode

The research team designed an electrode that allows gas to pass through it, trap carbon dioxide, and convert it at the same time. The device is made up of three layers: a material that captures CO2, a sheet of gas permeable carbon paper, and a catalytic layer of tin(IV) oxide. Together, these components enable the direct conversion of carbon dioxide gas into formic acid.

Formic acid is an important chemical used in a range of applications, including fuel cells and other industrial processes. Producing it directly from exhaust gases could make carbon reuse more practical and cost effective.

Strong Results Under Real World Conditions

When tested with pure CO2 gas, the new electrode showed about 40% higher efficiency than existing carbon conversion electrodes under similar laboratory conditions. The advantage became even clearer when researchers used a simulated flue gas containing 15% CO2, 8% oxygen gas, and 77% nitrogen gas. Under these conditions, the new system continued to generate substantial amounts of formic acid, while other technologies produced very little.

The electrode also proved capable of capturing carbon dioxide at concentrations similar to those found in the atmosphere, showing that it can function in ambient air. According to the researchers, this approach offers a promising path toward integrating carbon capture into real industrial applications. They also suggest that similar designs could eventually be adapted to capture and convert other greenhouse gases, including methane.

Helping to care for grandchildren may serve as a buffer against cognitive decline in older adults, according to research published by the American Psychological Association.

Helping to care for grandchildren may help protect older adults from cognitive decline, according to research published by the American Psychological Association. The findings suggest that staying involved in caregiving roles could support memory and thinking skills later in life.

“Many grandparents provide regular care for their grandchildren – care that supports families and society more broadly,” said lead researcher Flavia Chereches, MS, of Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “An open question, however, is whether caregiving for grandchildren may also benefit grandparents themselves. In this research, we wanted to see if providing grandchild care might benefit grandparents' health, potentially slowing down cognitive decline.”

The research was published in the journal Psychology and Aging.

Study Design and Participants

To explore this question, Chereches and her colleagues analyzed data from 2,887 grandparents who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. All participants were over age 50, with a mean age of 67. Each person completed surveys and cognitive assessments on three occasions between 2016 and 2022.

Participants were asked whether they had cared for a grandchild at any point during the previous year. The survey also collected detailed information about how often grandparents provided care and the types of activities involved.

Types of Care Included

Caregiving activities covered a wide range of responsibilities. These included watching grandchildren overnight, caring for sick grandchildren, playing or taking part in leisure activities, helping with homework, driving grandchildren to school or other activities, preparing meals, and similar forms of support.

When the researchers compared test results, grandparents who provided childcare scored higher on measures of memory and verbal fluency than those who did not. These differences remained even after accounting for age, overall health, and other relevant factors. The pattern was consistent regardless of how frequently grandparents provided care or which types of caregiving activities they performed.

Differences Observed Among Grandmothers

The study also showed that grandmothers who helped care for their grandchildren experienced less cognitive decline over time than grandmothers who did not provide care.

“What stood out most to us was that being a caregiving grandparent seemed to matter more for cognitive functioning than how often grandparents provided care or what exactly they did with their grandchildren,” said Chereches. “More research is needed to replicate these findings, yet, if there are benefits associated with caregiving for grandparents, they might not depend on how often care is provided, or on the specific activities done with grandchildren, but rather on the broader experience of being involved with caregiving.”

Why Family Environment May Matter

Chereches noted that additional research is needed to better understand how family dynamics and other factors influence these outcomes. The circumstances surrounding caregiving may play an important role.

“Providing care voluntarily, within a supportive family environment, may have different effects for grandparents than caregiving in a more stressful environment where they feel unsupported or feel that the caregiving is not voluntary or a burden.”

People who stop taking prescription weight loss medications often regain weight and lose many of the health improvements they achieved, according to a study published by The BMJ. The analysis found that benefits tied to heart and metabolic health, including improvements in cholesterol levels and blood pressure, tend to fade after treatment ends.

On average, individuals regained about 0.4 kilograms per month after stopping medication. Based on these trends, body weight and key risk markers for diabetes and heart disease were projected to return to pre-treatment levels in under two years.

The study also found that weight regain after stopping medication happened much faster than after weight loss achieved through diet and physical activity. In fact, the pace of regain was nearly four times higher, regardless of how much weight a person initially lost.

""This evidence suggests that despite their success in achieving initial weight loss, these drugs alone may not be sufficient for long term weight control,"" the researchers write.

GLP-1 Drugs Have Changed Obesity Treatment, But Many Stop Taking Them

Newer weight loss medications, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound), have significantly reshaped obesity treatment by helping many patients lose substantial amounts of weight.

However, about half of people with obesity stop using GLP-1 drugs within a year. That high discontinuation rate makes it especially important to understand what happens to weight and health risks related to diabetes and heart disease once treatment is discontinued.

How the Researchers Analyzed Weight Regain

To examine these outcomes, researchers from the University of Oxford reviewed clinical trials and observational studies involving adults who used medications approved for weight loss. These results were compared with outcomes from non-drug approaches such as behavioral weight management programs or placebo treatments.

Although the included studies varied in design and quality, the research team evaluated potential bias using established assessment tools to ensure consistency across the analysis.

In total, 37 studies published through February 2025 were included, covering 9,341 participants. On average, people received weight loss treatment for 39 weeks and were followed for about 32 weeks afterward.

Health Benefits Fade Within Years After Stopping Treatment

Across the studies, participants who stopped taking weight loss drugs regained an average of 0.4 kilograms per month. Based on this rate, researchers estimated that body weight would return to pre-treatment levels within about 1.7 years.

Cardiometabolic risk markers showed a similar pattern. Measures related to heart disease and metabolic health were projected to return to baseline within roughly 1.4 years after medication was discontinued.

Weight regain was also consistently faster following drug-based weight loss than after behavioral weight management programs, with an average difference of 0.3 kilograms per month. This pattern held true regardless of how much weight was lost during treatment.

Study Limitations and Strength of the Findings

The authors note several limitations. Only eight of the included studies examined newer GLP-1 medications, and none followed participants for more than 12 months after stopping treatment. In addition, relatively few studies were rated as having a low risk of bias.

Even so, the researchers emphasize that they used three different analytical approaches, all of which produced similar results. This consistency adds confidence to their overall conclusions.

Experts Urge Long-Term Strategies Beyond Medication

Based on the findings, the authors conclude: ""This evidence cautions against short term use of weight management medications, emphasizes the need for further research into cost effective strategies for long term weight control, and reinforces the importance of primary prevention.""

A US researcher echoed these concerns in a linked editorial, writing that ""The study findings cast doubt on the notion that GLP-1 receptor agonists are a perfect cure for obesity.""

""People taking GLP-1 receptor agonists should be aware of the high discontinuation rate and the consequences of cessation of medications,"" he adds. ""Healthy dietary and lifestyle practices should remain the foundation for obesity treatment and management, with medications such as GLP-1 receptor agonists used as adjuncts.""

""Such practices not only help prevent excess weight gain but can also lead to numerous health benefits that go beyond weight control,"" he concludes.

Quantum computers only work when they are kept extremely cold. The problem is that today's cooling systems also create noise, which can interfere with the fragile quantum information they are supposed to protect. Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden have now introduced a new type of minimal quantum ""refrigerator"" that turns this challenge into an advantage. Instead of fighting noise, the device partially relies on it to operate. The result is highly precise control over heat and energy flow, which could help make large scale quantum technology possible.

Quantum technology is widely expected to reshape major areas of society. Potential applications include drug discovery, artificial intelligence, logistics optimization, and secure communications. Despite this promise, serious technical barriers still stand in the way of real world use. One of the most difficult challenges is maintaining and controlling the delicate quantum states that make these systems work.

Why Quantum Computers Must Be Near Absolute Zero

Quantum computers built with superconducting circuits must be cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (around -- 273 °C). At these temperatures, materials become superconducting, allowing electrons to move without resistance. Only under these extreme conditions can stable quantum states form inside qubits, the basic units of quantum information.

These quantum states are extremely sensitive. Small changes in temperature, electromagnetic interference, or background noise can quickly erase stored information. This sensitivity makes quantum systems difficult to operate and even harder to expand.

As researchers attempt to scale up quantum computers to solve practical problems, heat and noise become harder to control. Larger and more complex systems create more opportunities for unwanted energy to spread and disrupt fragile quantum states.

""Many quantum devices are ultimately limited by how energy is transported and dissipated. Understanding these pathways and being able to measure them allows us to design quantum devices in which heat flows are predictable, controllable and even useful,"" says Simon Sundelin, doctoral student of quantum technology at Chalmers University of Technology and the study's lead author.

Using Noise as a Cooling Tool

In a study published in Nature Communications, the Chalmers team describes a fundamentally different kind of quantum refrigerator. Instead of trying to eliminate noise, the system uses it as the driving force behind cooling.

""Physicists have long speculated about a phenomenon called Brownian refrigeration; the idea that random thermal fluctuations could be harnessed to produce a cooling effect. Our work represents the closest realisation of this concept to date,"" says Simone Gasparinetti, associate professor at Chalmers and senior author of the study.

At the core of the refrigerator is a superconducting artificial molecule created in Chalmers' nanofabrication laboratory. It behaves much like a natural molecule, but instead of atoms, it is built from tiny superconducting electrical circuits.

The artificial molecule is connected to multiple microwave channels. By adding carefully controlled microwave noise in the form of random signal fluctuations within a narrow frequency range, the researchers can guide how heat and energy move through the system with remarkable precision.

""The two microwave channels serve as hot and cold reservoirs, but the key point is that they are only effectively connected when we inject controlled noise through a third port. This injected noise enables and drives heat transport between the reservoirs via the artificial molecule. We were able to measure extremely small heat currents, down to powers in the order of attowatts, or 10-18 watt. If such a small heat flow were used to warm a drop of water, it would take the age of the universe to see its temperature rise one degree Celsius,"" explains Sundelin.

New Paths Toward Scalable Quantum Technology

By carefully adjusting reservoir temperatures and tracking minuscule heat flows, the quantum refrigerator can operate in multiple ways. Depending on conditions, it can function as a refrigerator, act as a heat engine, or amplify thermal transport.

This level of control is especially important in larger quantum systems, where heat is produced locally during qubit operation and measurement. Managing that heat directly inside quantum circuits could improve stability and performance in ways conventional cooling systems cannot.

""We see this as an important step towards controlling heat directly inside quantum circuits, at a scale that conventional cooling systems can't reach. Being able to remove or redirect heat at this tiny scale opens the door to more reliable and robust quantum technologies,"" says Aamir Ali, a researcher in quantum technology at Chalmers and co-author of the study.

Research building on earlier work in type 2 diabetes suggests the experimental drug IC7Fc may also help protect against heart disease. A new study reports that the drug can lower cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation, two major contributors to cardiovascular problems.

An international research team led by Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, working with Monash University and other partners, published the preclinical findings in Science Advances. In the study, IC7Fc significantly reduced blood fats (triglycerides) and cholesterol in mice that are prone to developing heart disease.

Lower Cholesterol and Less Artery Damage

The researchers found that IC7Fc helped limit the buildup of fatty plaques inside blood vessels while also easing inflammation. Both processes play a central role in heart attacks and strokes, making them key targets for preventing cardiovascular disease.

Professor Mark Febbraio led the work for the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS) and has played a major role in the long-term development of IC7Fc as a potential treatment for metabolic conditions.

""Our earlier studies showed IC7Fc could help manage type 2 diabetes, a metabolic disease. This new research shows it can also reduce atherosclerosis, meaning it slows the 'clogging' of the arteries, where fatty deposits build up and restrict blood flow to the heart,"" Professor Febbraio said.

He added, ""Heart disease remains the world's biggest killer, driven largely by atherosclerosis. Even with common treatments that lower blood pressure and cholesterol, many people are still at risk, showing there's more work to do.""

Different Effects in Obese and Lean Mice

Previous research found that IC7Fc reduced appetite and body fat in obese mice. In contrast, the new study focused on lean mice that are genetically prone to high cholesterol and artery disease. In these animals, the drug did not affect body weight or food intake.

This difference suggests the drug's weight loss effects may be most relevant for obesity, while its cardiovascular benefits, such as lowering cholesterol buildup in arteries, could extend to people who are not overweight.

Potential for a Dual-Action Treatment

Overall, the findings point to IC7Fc as a flexible therapy that may address multiple health risks, while also highlighting the need for further testing in humans.

""These results suggest IC7Fc could offer a dual benefit -- helping reduce obesity in some, while protecting the heart in others,"" Professor Febbraio said.

""It's an exciting step towards a treatment that targets both metabolic and cardiovascular disease.""

Metrics details

Two decades of genetic studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have identified more than 100 genes harbouring rare risk mutations1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Despite this substantial heterogeneity, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses have identified convergent patterns of dysregulation across the ASD postmortem brain14,15,16,17. To identify shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD-linked mutations, we assembled a large patient collection of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells, consisting of 70 hiPS cell lines after stringent quality control representing 8 ASD-associated mutations, idiopathic ASD, and 20 lines from non-affected control individuals. Here we used these hiPS cell lines to generate human cortical organoids, profiling by RNA sequencing at four distinct time points up to 100 days after in vitro differentiation. Early time points harboured the largest mutation-specific changes, but different mutations converged on shared transcriptional changes as development progressed. We identified a shared RNA and protein interaction network, which was enriched in ASD risk genes and predicted to drive the observed downstream changes in gene expression. CRISPR–Cas9 screening of these candidate transcriptional regulators in induced human neural progenitors validated their downstream convergent molecular effects. These data illustrate how risk associated with genetically defined forms of ASD can propagate by means of transcriptional regulation to affect convergently dysregulated pathways, providing new insight into the convergent impact of ASD genetic risk on human neurodevelopment.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), with a childhood prevalence of close to 2%18. The last decade of genetic studies has yielded hundreds of risk genes, consistent with extraordinary aetiological heterogeneity1,2,3,4. More than 100 high-confidence mutations have been associated with ASD in genetic studies2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. These rare, usually de novo mutations with large effect sizes are expected to account for 10–15% of ASD cases19,20, whereas common genetic variation is predicted to explain at least 50% of genetic risk21,22,23. Overall, ASD shows a complex genetic architecture, with a substantial component derived from a collection of distinct, rare disorders with overlapping clinical features.

Despite its genetic heterogeneity, postmortem transcriptome analysis has revealed consistent changes in most individuals with idiopathic ASD, as well as individuals with a specific syndromic form of ASD, (dup)15q11–13 (refs. 14,15,16,17). However, the mechanisms by which distinct mutations can lead to convergent molecular pathology, and whether convergence occurs across rare forms of ASD remains unknown. Understanding how these processes develop is complicated by the fact that the expression of most ASD risk genes peaks during fetal development, yet gene expression studies in human brain are conducted after this critical developmental window has ended16,24,25,26,27. Several lines of evidence, including genetic28, genomic29,30, neuroimaging31 and neuropathology32, indicate that early neurodevelopment has an essential role in the development of ASD.

The advent of stem cell-based in vitro systems enables high-fidelity modelling of human brain development in NDDs33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41. Most studies have investigated relatively small numbers of lines from individuals with idiopathic ASD42, or focused on individual mutations, which have demonstrated the utility of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell-based systems to study the impact of ASD genetic risk on neurodevelopment43,44,45,46. In addition, recent work has highlighted the power of studying many genes in parallel, identifying evidence for molecular convergence using CRISPR-based perturbations of ASD risk genes on control genetic backgrounds47,48,49. However, studies of lines derived from affected individuals are a major gap in the field.

Here we profile a large cohort of hiPS cell lines, starting from 96 hiPS cell lines ascertained from individuals with 8 different mutations associated with ASD and 11 individuals with idiopathic ASD and 30 lines derived from 25 matched control participants. From each of these lines, we derived neural organoids using a guided differentiation approach to create human cortical organoids (hCOs)50,51. Using orthogonal analytic approaches, we find evidence for convergence during early neuronal differentiation in those with genetically defined forms, but no significant shared signal across the idiopathic cases. We identify and characterize a downregulated, chromatin and transcriptional network that contains several ASD risk genes, including members of the SWI–SNF complex. This network is predicted to drive the observed changes in downstream gene expression associated with these ASD susceptibility mutations. We use CRISPRi to validate the effects of many putative network drivers on downstream gene expression, which includes downregulation of important neurodevelopmental pathways including many ASD susceptibility genes.

We reprogrammed somatic cells (Methods) to generate hiPS cells from a cohort of individuals with eight different mutations associated with ASD: (1) 22q11.2 deletion, a 1.5–3-megabase (Mb) deletion that leads to a constellation of variably present symptoms including heart defects, craniofacial features, intellectual disability, ASD (roughly 20%) and psychosis (roughly 25%)52,53 (n = 18)44; (2) 22q13.3 deletion, known as Phelan–McDermid syndrome, a deletion spanning 130 kilobases (kb) to 9 Mb that includes SHANK3, among other genes and presents with developmental delay, hypotonia and impaired social interactions54 (n = 4); (3) 15q13.3 deletion, a 1.5-Mb deletion that presents variably with intellectual disability and epilepsy55 (n = 3); (4) 16p11.2 deletion, a roughly 600-kb deletion presenting variably with intellectual disability, motor impairments, communication deficits and ASD56 (n = 4); (5) 16p11.2 duplication, which can share intellectual disability and ASD phenotypes with the reciprocal deletion57 (n = 4); (6) Timothy syndrome, which is characterized by variants within the CACNA1C gene and presents with syndactyly, prolonged QT interval, ASD and intellectual disability58,59 (n = 2)45,60,61; (7) PCDH19-related disorder, which is associated with epilepsy and can also include intellectual disability and ASD62,63 (n = 2) and (8) the SHANK3 R522W mutation (n = 1), a point mutation associated with neurodevelopmental risk64; mutations in SHANK3 share behavioural phenotypes with the larger 22q13.3 deletion61,65,66. We also profiled individuals with idiopathic ASD with no known pathogenic variants (n = 11) and unaffected individuals (n = 25) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1) for a total of 74 individuals. For several individuals we used several hiPS cell lines to assess reproducibility, amounting to a total of 96 hiPS cell lines (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1).

The number of hiPS cell lines and individuals (in parentheses) for each form of ASD and controls is indicated. b, Schematic representation of hCO differentiations derived from each hiPS cell line for two forms of ASD (16p11.2 deletion and 22q13.3 deletion). The other forms of ASD can be found in Extended Data Fig. 1. c, Spearman's correlation of gene expression between samples from the same time point and form of ASD that were derived either from different lines (red) or from the same line (blue). The sample sizes for each group (number of differentiations) are as follows: day 25: control lines, n = 46; 15q13.3del, n = 7; 16p11.2del, n = 5; 16p11.2dup, n = 4; 22q11.2del, n = 13; 22q13.3del, n = 11; idiopathic, n = 12; PCDH19, n = 2; SHANK3, n = 2; and Timothy syndrome, n = 3.

Day 75: control lines, n = 54; 15q13.3del, n = 7; 16p11.2del, n = 6; 16p11.2dup, n = 4; 22q11.2del, n = 23; 22q13.3del, n = 12; idiopathic, n = 15; PCDH19, n = 2; SHANK3, n = 2; and Timothy syndrome, n = 2.

We differentiated hiPS cell lines into hCOs for 100 days51, which yields hCOs that contain developing radial glia and ultimately give rise to functional glutamatergic neurons in a process that closely resembles cerebral cortical development36,51. We performed 172 unique hCO differentiations of the 96 lines (replicates for 49% of lines; control n = 75, idiopathic ASD n = 21, 22q11.2 deletion n = 31, 22q13.3 deletion n = 15, 15q13.3 deletion n = 7, 16p11.2 deletion n = 9, 16p11.2 duplication n = 5, Timothy syndrome n = 3, PCDH19 mutation n = 4 and SHANK3 mutation n = 2). We performed whole-genome sequencing and removed any lines with large copy number variations (CNVs), viral integration or in which the mutation of interest was absent or further mutations were present, which yielded 70 verified lines from 55 individuals passing quality control for downstream functional genomic analyses (Methods, Extended Data Figs. 1–3 and Supplementary Table 2).

We next analysed the transcriptomes of pooled hCOs at days 25, 50, 75 and 100 of hCO differentiation (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1), which provides a quantitative, unbiased metric67,68. Day 25 corresponds to an early period in cortical development36,50, consisting primarily of cycling progenitors and radial glia50,69. As differentiation progresses, the cell composition evolves to consist of intermediate progenitors, deep layer postmitotic neurons and astroglial lineage cells44,50. After stringent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) quality control and outlier analysis to remove low-quality samples (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Figs. 1–3 and Methods), 464 samples from 55 individuals (70 lines) were retained (Supplementary Table 1).

We observed high reproducibility both between (overall mean Spearman correlation 0.96, range 0.88–0.99) and within (overall mean Spearman correlation 0.97, range 0.92–0.98) individuals, similar to published metrics36,44,51 (Fig. 1c and Methods). The largest driver of variation was stage of differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 4). Genes within the CNV boundaries were downregulated in the deletion carriers and upregulated in the duplication carriers as expected (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2). Although several of the genes affected by point mutations showed a trend towards downregulation (PCDH19, log fold change (logFC) of −0.77, false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.45; CACNA1C: logFC = −0.22, FDR = 0.78), these changes were not significant, as expected70,71,72 (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3).

We observed several reliable, distinct, gene-expression clusters across forms (Methods and Supplementary Table 3), with participants harbouring the 16p11.2 deletion clustering with those with PCDH19-related disorder, 16p11.2 duplication clustering with Timothy syndrome and 22q13.3 and SHANK3 mutation clustering together (Fig. 2a). We performed bootstrapping to show that these clusters were robust (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Methods). Despite the strong effect of differentiation day on transcriptional profiles, most samples from individual genetic mutations clustered together across time points, showing a consistent effect of mutation over developmental progression (Fig. 2a).

Next, we found that the largest changes in gene expression for individual forms were observed at early stages of hCO differentiation, with the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found at day 25 in four forms (16p11.2 deletion, 979 genes; 16p11.2 duplication, 1,556 genes; PCDH19, 514 genes and Timothy syndrome, 832 genes), or at day 50 in 2 of the remaining forms (15q13.3 deletion, 616 genes and 22q13.3 deletion, 373 genes; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 3). Significant similarity was seen between genes differentially expressed at day 25 in samples harbouring deletion and duplication of 16p11.2 (375 out of 2,160 genes, P < 10−16, hypergeometric test) (Fig. 2c). The intersecting genes were significantly enriched for chromatin remodelling related terms (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 4), which have previously been associated with ASD risk genes8,24,73. Overall, genes downregulated at 25 days in these four forms of ASD were enriched for known high-confidence ASD and NDD risk genes (16p11.2del: SFARI genes odds ratio (OR) 3.0, FDR = 3.8 × 10−9; 16p11.2dup: SFARI genes OR = 3.3, FDR = 1.4 × 10−13; PCDH19: SFARI genes OR = 3.1, FDR = 1.5 × 10−5; Timothy syndrome: SFARI genes OR = 2.0, FDR = 4.3 × 10−2; 16p11.2del: brain disorder genes OR = 2.4, FDR = 6.6 × 10−3; 16p11.2dup: brain disorder genes OR = 2.2, FDR = 1.2 × 10−2; PCDH19: brain disorder genes OR = 3.2, FDR = 2.2 × 10−3; Fisher's exact test, Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Methods). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) found downregulation of terms related to neural precursor proliferation (for example, ‘Beta catenin binding', ‘Neural precursor cell proliferation' and ‘Canonical WNT signalling pathway') in all 4 of these forms (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 5). We detected only two significantly differentially expressed genes in the individuals with idiopathic ASD (PRRC2C at day 50 and the long non-coding RNA RP11-114H21.2 at day 100; FDR < 0.05).

Although the largest mutation-specific changes were observed early, the shared differential expression signature of mutational effects increased with maturation. Examination of the correlation of log2FCs over time revealed that the correlations between hCO harbouring different genetic events were significantly stronger at day 100 (analysis of variance (ANOVA) F3,140 = 11, P = 1.6 × 10−6; Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD): day 100 to day 25 P = 2.7 × 10−5, day 100 to day 50 P = 8.0 × 10−6, day 100 to day 75 P = 7.0 × 10−4; Fig. 2f,g) suggesting that the changes in gene expression converge as cortical differentiation progressed in vitro, with distinct mutational forms showing more consistent differences from control participants and less mutational specificity. Meta-analysis across forms found the highest number of significant genes at day 100, more than 50% greater than at day 25 (day 25, 4,034; day 50, 2,606 genes; day 75, 3,957 genes and day 100, 6,680 genes; Fig. 2h). This increase in convergence of gene-expression changes could not be explained by alterations in variability in control participants or the distinct genetic forms across development (Extended Data Fig. 4, η2 = 0.04).

We observed that six different forms of ASD profiled were enriched for upregulated genes related to neuronal cell fate and protein translation-related terms by day 75 (ref. 74) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). We also observed broad downregulation of synapse and ion channel related terms such as ‘Synaptic membrane' and ‘Gated channel activity', across many time points and all the main mutational forms and in meta-analyses, particularly at day 75 and 100 (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 5). The early disruption in pathways related to neurogenesis, neural progenitors and WNT signalling described above (for example, Fig. 2), coupled to the later emergence (day 75 and 100) of enrichment in synaptic pathways, provides a potential link between early mutational effects on neurogenesis that converge on signalling and synaptic biology during cortical neurogenesis across different genetic forms of ASD.

To further explore the relationships of gene-expression changes to specific cell types, we deconvolved bulk RNA-seq into cell-type transcriptomes using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) from hCOs44 (Extended Data Fig. 7). Predicted changes in cell-type proportions were subtle and largely seen at one or two time points per form (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8). The least mature progenitors (CycPros) and more mature neuronal cell types (ExNeu-2) showed predicted reductions in 16p11.2del and 22q13.3del, suggesting changes in the timing of neuronal maturation (ExNeu-2 decreased at day 25 and CycPro decreased at day 75), consistent with recent observations in a 16p11.2 organoid model75. Intermediate progenitors showed changes in 15q13.3 deletion, 16p11.2 duplication and Timothy syndrome, suggesting convergent effects on this cell type during development (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8). Correlation of deconvoluted cell-type compositional shifts increased at day 100 compared with day 25, demonstrating convergence in cell-type changes, similar to what we observed with differential expression and changes in biological process (Extended Data Fig. 8). By day 100, although the correlation across forms increased, only InNeu showed any significant shifts from control participants in any given form (22q13.3del, 15q13.3del and PCDH19). This indicates that observed transcriptional convergence is probably related to both altered timing of differentiation of cell types and altered gene expression signatures within cell types, the latter appearing more prominent here.

We used an orthogonal method, independent components analysis to determine whether pathway changes were robustly identified; we observed high concordance between independent components analysis and expression-based clustering (Rand index 0.58, Extended Data Fig. 9). Upregulated independent components across 16p11.2 deletion and duplication were downregulated for processes involved in neuronal precursor renewal and differentiation, such as ‘Beta catenin-TCF complex assembly' and ‘Neuron fate specification'76 (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 6). The broad role of these pathways in ASD has previously been suggested42,43,77, highlighting their potential role as a point of convergence. Independent component 31 (IC31), enriched for synaptic terms, was downregulated in 16p11.2 duplication (IC31 beta = −0.13, FDR = 1.11 × 10−3) and Timothy syndrome (IC31 beta = −0.14, FDR = 2.9 × 10−3; Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 6), similar to what was observed in the differential expression analysis.

As transcripts do not act independently, but as part of highly regulated transcriptional networks78, we constructed co-expression networks using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)78,79,80. We tested whether modules derived from the day 25 samples changed in their association with individual forms and with all ASD-associated forms (diagnosis) compared with control participants over time (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 7). Notably, we observed that the 22 identified co-expression modules from day 25 data were preserved at all other time points, suggesting they represent robust, continuing biological processes over this 100-day period. Moreover, their conservation in vivo80 and in vitro81,82,83,84 (Extended Data Fig. 10) further demonstrates that these modules represent generalizable human neurodevelopmental processes. At the earliest time point, there were 22 modules that differentiated between any of the forms of ASD and control participants. However, no single module differentiated diagnosis broadly from control participants (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 8). Eleven of the modules were significantly associated with at least one form of ASD, and five were associated with several (Fig. 3c–e). By contrast, at day 100, which corresponds to early mid-gestation36,50,85 and contains a large pool of postmitotic neurons and remaining radial glia, we identified only six modules that were associated with specific forms of ASD (Methods and Fig. 3c,f). However, at day 100, significantly more modules differentiated those participants who were affected (diagnosis) broadly from control participants (6 at day 100 compared with 0 at day 25; Fisher test P = 0.02; Fig. 3f) and the association of the modules with diagnosis broadly was significantly higher compared with day 25 (day 25 = 0.03, day 100 = 0.11, Welch two sample t30.69 = −3.0, P = 5.0 × 10−3; Fig. 3g), again demonstrating that the different genetic forms become more similar as differentiation progresses (Fig. 2f–h).

We found that two modules, M5 and M19, were significantly enriched for ASD risk genes (Fig. 3d M5: OR = 3.6, FDR = 9.4 × 10−12; M19: OR = 4.1, FDR = 2.1 × 10−6). This indicates that known ASD risk genes are strongly co-expressed within networks affected by perturbation of neural development in several rare forms of ASD, similar to observations based on in vivo data17,24,25,29,86. Most notable in this regard is M5, which was significantly downregulated across several forms of ASD at day 25 (adjusted R = −0.76, FDR = 5.2 × 10−15; 16p11.2 deletion beta = −0.06, FDR = 2.3 × 10−6; 16p11.2 duplication beta = −0.05, FDR = 5.6 × 10−4; PCDH19 beta = −0.08, FDR = 1.7 × 10−5) (Fig. 3c) and across differentiation (16p11.2 deletion: t = −3.5, FDR = 2.0 × 10−3; 16p11.2 duplication: t = −3.6, FDR = 2.0 × 10−3; PCDH19 t = −2.6, FDR = 2.0 × 10−2; SHANK3 t = −2.3, FDR = 3.8 × 10−2; Methods and Extended Data Fig. 11) suggesting that it has a central role downstream of these four ASD-associated mutations. M5's relationship to in vivo human biology is supported by its significant overlap with two co-expression modules that peak during human fetal brain around mid-gestation that were previously identified as significantly enriched for rare ASD risk mutations24 (Fig. 3d: prenatal M2 OR = 5.8, FDR = 7.2 × 10−32; prenatal M3 OR = 2.0, FDR = 2.9 × 10−4). We observed that M5 was also enriched for genes co-expressed within a neuronal module that is downregulated in ASD postmortem cortex14 (Fig. 3d: ASD M4, OR = 3.5, FDR = 3.3 × 10−5), providing further evidence that it represents biological processes occurring in vivo in ASD. Functionally, M5 was enriched for terms related to regulation of gene expression such as ‘Histone modification' and ‘DNA-binding transcription factor binding' (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 8) and was enriched in developing cell types: early radial glia (RG-1; FC = 1.1, FDR = 4.5 × 10−6; Fig. 3d), intermediate progenitor cells (FC = 1.1, FDR = 4.5 × 10−6; Fig. 3d) and early cortical neurons (ExNeu-1; FC = 1.1, FDR = 3.0 × 10−5; Fig. 3d).

M19, the other module that was enriched for ASD risk genes, was downregulated across several ASD forms (day 25 adjusted R = −0.35, FDR = 0.01; Fig. 3c–e and Methods). M19 also overlapped with two later expressed, neuronal, human fetal cortical co-expression modules enriched for ASD risk24 (Prenatal M16 OR = 4.1, FDR = 1.7 × 10−5; Prenatal M17 OR = 2.7, FDR = 1.2 × 10−3; Fig. 3d). Functionally, M19 was enriched for terms related to synaptic function such as ‘Synapse organization' and ‘Neurotransmitter secretion', and neuronal cell types (ExNeu-1 FC = 1.5, FDR = 3.0 × 10−6; ExNeu-2 FC = 1.6, FDR = 3.0 × 10−6; InNeu FC = 1.5, FDR = 3.0 × 10−6; Fig. 3d,e).

As M5 met several criteria indicating it might be a factor in mediating convergence, including enrichment of early expressed ASD risk genes, significant differential expression across many forms, and enrichment for terms related to regulation of gene expression (Fig. 3c–e), we next tested the regulatory relationships between M5 and other modules associated with various forms of ASD (Fig. 4a and Methods). We determined the hierarchical regulatory relationships among modules (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 9, Methods and ref. 87), finding that M5 and M1 contained the highest levels of predicted upstream transcriptional regulators of other modules (Fig. 4b,c and Extended Data Fig. 10). Transcriptional targets of M5 were enriched in ten of the ASD-associated modules, among which was M19 (Figs. 3b and 4b). This highlighted M5's potential role as a causal driver of the changes seen in the genetically defined forms of ASD, which is consistent with its expression at the earliest stages (Extended Data Fig. 11 and ref. 24).

Several modules downstream of M5 were associated with various processes known to be dysregulated in NDDs (Figs. 3d and 4b,c). We observed a relationship between M5 downregulation and the upregulated expression of genes in its downstream putative target modules, suggesting that M5 may be negatively regulating these modules (Fig. 4d). As genes in a module can vary in their degree of module membership88, we next asked whether the transcriptional regulators within M5 followed the same downregulation pattern. Indeed 65% (17 out of 26) of the annotated transcriptional regulators (Methods) in M5 were significantly downregulated in at least one of the forms of ASD with most (8 out of 9) of the other regulators trending in the same direction (Fig. 4e).

To further elaborate the relationship between M5 regulatory targets and ASD, we asked whether genes regulated by M5 were enriched for ASD genetic risk factors. Indeed, even though the individual co-expression modules containing these genes were not enriched for ASD risk genes, we found that the M5 regulated genes within M5 regulated modules were enriched for ASD risk genes (OR = 2.0, P = 3.6 × 10−9). A total of 261 SFARI 1, 2 or S genes within enriched downstream modules were predicted to be regulated by at least one M5 regulator (Fig. 4f and Methods). Noticeably, these ASD risk genes were mostly (68%) negatively correlated with the M5 regulators (Fig. 4f). Consistent with their role as transcriptional regulators, the driver genes within M5 peak in expression earlier than the ASD genes they are regulating (Fig. 4g). These M5 regulated ASD risk genes included many high-confidence risk genes associated with synapse-related function, such as CNTNAP2 and NLGN1 (M16), forebrain neuron differentiation, such as FOXG1 and PAX6 (M15), and epigenetic remodellers including SET, DYRK1A, KMT2E and CHD2 (M2) (Fig. 4f), which are all processes previously related to ASD2,24,89. These genes also included PCDH19 (M15) and CACNA1C, the gene mutated in Timothy syndrome (M10) (Fig. 4f), further reflecting this transcriptional network's role as a point of convergence in ASD. Taken together, these findings suggest that a complex of transcriptional regulators orchestrates distinct biological pathways related to neurogenesis and neuronal maturation altered across genetically defined forms of ASD through regulatory relationships occurring during early stages of brain development.

To determine whether these transcriptional regulators represent known biological processes, we asked whether they interact at the protein level. We found that they are predicted to form a highly significant protein–protein interaction (PPI) network (Methods; P = 0.001; Fig. 4h) enriched for transcription factor regulation and chromatin binding related gene ontology terms (Supplementary Table 10). Further examination of this PPI network indicates significant enrichment in known ASD and NDD risk genes (direct PPI, SFARI 1, 2, S genes OR = 15, FDR = 2.0 × 10−4; NDD OR = 8.4, FDR = 3.7 × 10−4; ID OR = 9.7, FDR = 2.0 × 10−4; Indirect PPI, SFARI genes OR = 3.7, FDR = 4.6 × 10−11; ASD risk genes OR = 2.4, FDR = 3.0 × 10−2; NDD genes OR = 2.1, FDR = 1.7 × 10−7; intellectual disability genes OR = 2.4, FDR = 1.9 × 10−9; brain disorder genes OR = 2.4, FDR = 3.6 × 10−3; Fig. 4i and Methods). Moreover, similar to the transcriptome-based M5, the PPI network strongly overlapped with the early to mid-gestation brain co-expression networks that have previously been associated with ASD24 (Direct PPI, Prenatal M2: OR = 12.3, FDR = 2.5 × 10−4; Fig. 4i), including common variant-enriched modules29 (Direct PPI, Developing Yellow: OR = 43, FDR = 7.1 × 10−10; Fig. 4i).

We next tested whether the predicted PPI interactions among M5 genes based on public databases (Fig. 4h–i) were observed in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), given that protein interactions can be highly cell-type specific and most available data are not from neural cell-types90. We conducted immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP–MS) on proteins with reliable antibody signal (Fig. 5a,b, Extended Data Fig. 12, Supplementary Table 11 and Methods). We then examined connections between M5 proteins (Methods), observing that M5 regulators do indeed form a significant PPI with each other and with a subset of the predicted interactors (Fig. 5c–f), including SFARI genes (score 1, 2 and S combined and score S; Fig. 5c,e), NDD genes91 (Fig. 5c,f and Extended Data Fig. 12) and genes enriched in developmental delay as well as NDD broadly92, validating database predictions (Fig. 4i). Of the five M5 regulators that passed quality control (Methods), we found that most were connected to three out of four of their possible connections, except for POLR2A (Fig. 6d). This PPI includes members of the BAF complex, which has a critical role during neurogenesis and mammalian cortical development93,94,95,96,97, SMARCB1 (BAF47) and SMARCA4 (BRG1), EP300, an important coactivator known to interact with BAF complex members98 and preinitiation complex member, TBP. These findings show that M5 regulators interact with a network of genes essential for early neurodevelopment, both in terms of predicted transcriptional control and direct PPI in neural progenitors.

Having validated components of the PPI network in developing neurons, we next sought to experimentally validate the regulatory role of M5 transcription factors and chromatin regulators on their predicted downstream targets. We leveraged the ability to perform a pooled, CRISPR–Cas9 inhibition (CRISPRi) screen to assess downstream gene expression on a single-cell basis99 (Methods, Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 13). We applied this to neural cells derived by NGN2 induction in hiPS cells (hNPCs, Methods), targeting the promoters of 26 M5 putative transcriptional regulators using 3 guides per gene100 (Methods and Supplementary Tables 14 and 15). We achieved consistent downregulation (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 13), ranging from roughly 25% (POLR2A) to 90% decrease (MBTPS2) (Fig. 6b). hNPCs separated into mitotically active (NPCs showing consistent G2 mitosis markers (termed cycling NPCs or cNPCs), Extended Data Fig. 13), or those not expressing markers of active cell division (termed NPCs). For most targets, knockdown did not have a major impact on survival or proliferation, with 25 out of 26 knockdown targets showing no difference in proportion of cells compared to control gRNA-expressing cells, except for TP53, which showed increased proportions of cNPCs and NPCs (Extended Data Fig. 13), consistent with its well-known role as a tumour suppressor101.

We observed a wide spectrum of changes in gene expression following pooled CRISPRi, with RBBP5 knockdown leading to more than 1,250 downregulated and more than 500 upregulated genes in NPCs to genes such as RELA and BACH2 in which we observed no significant differential expression (Methods, Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 12). RBBP5 is part of the WRAD complex, which supports H3K4 methylation for SET-domain containing methyltransferases, many of which are NDD risk genes102. RBBP5 knockdown led to massive changes in gene expression, including SWI–SNFI member SMARCA1 and synapse genes DLGAP1, NRXN3 and CACNA1C, the gene mutated in Timothy syndrome. Not every M5 regulator showed strong evidence for recapitulating phenotypes seen in hCOs, but knockdown of many M5 members produced a transcriptional response that was correlated with changes seen in organoids (Extended Data Fig. 14). Overall, knockdown of 11 of the 26 M5 regulatory drivers showed significant differential expression enrichment of their predicted targets: 9 out of 26 in cNPC and 6 out of 26 in NPCs, confirming their regulatory relationships (Methods, Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 14). Parallel with the earlier bioinformatic predictions, we found that genes associated with NDDs and intellectual disability in addition to ASD risk genes2,8,91 (SFARI levels 1 and 2) were enriched in DEGs (Fig. 6e). Pathways downstream of several of the individual M5 regulators, including RBBP5, EP300 and SOX9 lead to disruptions of overlapping neurodevelopmental pathways (Extended Data Fig. 15 and Supplementary Table 13).

To determine the shared downstream effects of the M5 regulators, we performed a meta-analysis of single-cell differential expression from the pooled CRISPRi experiments. We observed that the genes significant in meta-analysis were enriched in several modules predicted to be regulated by M5 genes, including M2, M4 and M5 itself, suggesting regulation of other genes within the module by M5 regulators in NPCs (Extended Data Fig. 14). In summary, this examination of molecular responses to each M5 regulator perturbation, albeit in a single-cell type, was important to experimentally validate the bioinformatic predictions of regulatory relationships. These results indicate that further examination of these regulators in organoid models will help inform how changes in these genes alter cellular transitions during brain development.

We characterized the biological impact of several different genetic forms of ASD modelled in a large cohort of hCO, based on quantitative analyses rooted in genome-wide transcriptomic profiling. We identified robust clusters of different ASD forms spanning across stages of cortical development, suggesting several distinct developmental trajectories. Orthogonal analytic approaches showed that as time progressed these trajectories converged, consistent with canalization of development in which changes in the early stages of brain development are buffered as development progresses103. Overall, these trajectories converge on diminished neuronal maturation across time points, with most forms showing changing trajectories starting from day 25 and all, except for idiopathic ASD, showing changes by day 100. Although the alterations in maturation are convergent, the path to these changes seems to be distinct depending on different mutations, consistent with previous observations from a cohort of three other genetic forms of ASD43. Our findings suggest that convergence represents the impact of shared early developmental changes in co-expression networks enriched in ASD risk genes, whose downstream effects represent a form of developmental canalization on neuronal and synapse maturation. Our findings point towards known ASD risk genes associated with chromatin remodelling as a bridge linking early mutational specificity with convergence during cortical neurogenesis across different genetic forms of ASD.

We describe a core transcriptional network of driver genes acting at early stages and identified their downstream target biological processes. This core set of convergent genes is changed across several distinct genetic forms and is enriched in rare and common genetic risk for ASD. M5 dysregulation may not be limited to ASD, as it was also enriched for common variation associated with several psychiatric disorders104,105, and formed a PPI with neurodevelopmental risk genes broadly, reflecting the role of early neuronal differentiation in broad risk for psychiatric and NDDs. These gene regulatory relationships, which we show form interacting protein complexes, connect ASD risk genes across different pathways, including WNT signalling, translation and mTOR pathways, and synapse formation into a convergent network. It is also worth noting that we identified few consistent changes in lines from idiopathic ASD. This is probably due to the substantial polygenicity in ASD cases not harbouring major risk mutations106,107, and supports the need for much larger sample sizes in studies focused on idiopathic forms of ASD.

This work and other recent work43,47 demonstrates the utility of studying many mutations in parallel across developmental time to identify shared and distinct pathways in ASD. We note that the absence of effects in idiopathic ASD tempers our ability to identify broad, core ASD phenotypes that overlap across polygenic and major gene forms. Despite the comparatively large number of idiopathic lines profiled here, our data indicate that even larger samples will be needed to find robust shared phenotypes. However, the known overlap between genes associated with NDD and with ASD and our experimental strategy to examine several genetically defined forms of ASD in parallel, supports the relevance of these findings to ASD. By describing a core transcriptional network of driver genes, enriched in causal ASD genes and identifying their downstream targets, which are also enriched in ASD risk genes, these data connect ASD risk in genetically defined forms to convergent biological processes that occur during early cortical development.

Control hiPS cell lines in this study were reported and have been extensively characterized using standardized methods44,50,51. hiPS cell lines from 11 idiopathic ASD individuals were obtained from Coriell. The 22q11.2 deletion44, 22q13.3 deletion108 and Timothy syndrome45 hiPS cell lines were reported and characterized before. To confirm the various genetic mutations, whole-genome sequencing was performed. Cultures were regularly tested for mycoplasma and maintained mycoplasma free. Approval for reprogramming and differentiation of these cell lines was obtained from the Stanford Institutional Review Board panel, and informed consent was obtained from all individuals.

Human fibroblast cells were reprogrammed using the Sendai virus-based CytoTune iPS 2.0 kit (CytoTune 2.0, Invitrogen, A16517). Fibroblasts were plated in six-well plates 2 days before transduction to achieve a density of 2 × 105 to 3 × 105 cells per well. Cells were then transduced with the indicated set of Sendai vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 5–5–3 (KOS–Myc–Klf4) as we previously described in ref. 44. Virus was removed after 24 h and cells were cultured in fibroblast medium with 10% FBS (Gibco, 16000-044) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, 10569-010) for a total of 7 days, with media changes every other day. On day 7 after transduction, cells were collected with TrypLE (Gibco, 16563-029) and plated in the fibroblast medium onto truncated recombinant human vitronectin (VTN-N, Gibco, A14700)-coated plates. The following day, fibroblast medium was changed to Essential 8 medium (Gibco, A1517001) and cells were fed daily until days 20–22. For further culture, individual colonies were manually dissected and transferred to fresh vitronectin-coated dishes. Once hiPS cell clones were established, they were routinely cultured on vitronectin-coated dishes in Essential 8 medium, and cells were split every 4–5 days using 0.5 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, 15575-020). hiPS cell clones and lines were also generated using retroviruses or non-integrating episomal vectors from fibroblasts109. We did not observe any systematic differences between cells reprogrammed by the two methods. hiPS cells were cultured as previously described in ref. 51. Briefly, hiPS cells were cultured on six-well plates coated with recombinant human vitronectin (VTN-N, Gibco, A14700) in Essential 8 medium (Gibco, A1517001) and passaged with 0.5 mM EDTA (Gibco, 15575). To coat the six-well plates, 1 ml of vitronectin (diluted at a 1:100 ratio with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS); Gibco, 14190) was added per well and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. To passage hiPS cells with 80–90% confluency, cells were rinsed with 3–4 ml of DPBS per well, and then 1 ml of 0.5 mM EDTA (Gibco, 15575) was added and incubated for 7 min at room temperature. After the EDTA was removed, 2 ml of prewarmed complete Essential 8 medium was added to collect cells. The cell suspension was then diluted in Essential 8 medium (1:6–1:20 depending on the hiPS cell line) and distributed on vitronectin-coated wells.

For the generation of 3D spheroids, hiPS cells were incubated with Accutase (Innovate Cell Technologies, AT-104) at 37 °C for 7 min and dissociated into single cells. To obtain uniformly sized spheroids, we used AggreWell 800 plates (STEMCELL Technologies, 34811) containing 300 microwells. There were roughly 3 × 106 single cells per well in Essential 8 medium supplemented with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM, Selleckchem, S1049), centrifuged at 100g for 3 min to capture the cells in the microwells and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 24 h, day 0 of differentiation, spheroids were collected from each microwell by firmly pipetting (with a cut end of a P1000 tip) medium in the well up and down, and transferring it into ultra-low-attachment plastic dishes (Corning, 3262) in Essential 6 medium (Gibco, A1516401) supplemented with two SMAD pathway inhibitors: dorsomorphin (2.5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, P5499) and SB431542 (10 μM, Tocris, 1614) together with Wnt pathway inhibitor XAV939 (1.25 μM, Tocris, 3748). Media changes were performed daily, except for day 1. On the sixth day in suspension, neural spheroids were transferred to neural medium containing Neurobasal-A (Gibco, 10888), B-27 supplement without vitamin A (Gibco, 12587), GlutaMax (1:100, Gibco, 35050) and penicillin and streptomycin (1:100, Gibco, 15140). The neural medium was supplemented with epidermal growth factor (20 ng ml−1, R&D Systems, 236-EG) and basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng ml−1, R&D Systems, 233-FB) until day 24. From days 25 to 42, to promote differentiation of the neural progenitors into neurons, the neural medium was supplemented with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (20 ng ml−1, Peprotech, 450-02) and neurotrophin 3 (20 ng ml−1, Peprotech, 450-03), with medium changes every other day. From day 43 onwards, only neural medium without growth factors was used for medium changes every 4–5 days.

Sequencing libraries were prepared using TruSeq stranded RNA RiboZero Gold (Illumina) on ribosomal RNA-depleted (RiboZero Gold, Illumina) RNA. The libraries were sequenced with 100-base-pair paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. The reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38) with Gencode v.25 annotations using STAR (v.2.5.2b)110 and gene expression was quantified using RSEM (v.1.3.0)111. Genes that were expressed at very low levels (fewer than 10 reads in 30% of samples from a given day) were removed from the analysis. Samples with standardized sample network connectivity Z scores below −2 in each mutation were defined as outliers and removed112. To control for technical variation due to the sequencing and library prep we calculated the principal components of the Picard sequencing metrics (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) using the CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics, CollectRnaSeqMetrics and MarkDuplicates modules, and included them in our model. To infer genetic ancestry, we called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the aligned reads using the GATK (v.3.3) Haplotype caller113. Sites with more than 5% missing samples, with rare minor allele frequency (less than 0.05) and Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium (less than 1 × 10−6) were removed using plink (v.1.09)114. We then used the remaining high-quality SNPs to run MDS together with HapMap3.3 (hg38)115. The first two MDS values, referred to as genetic ancestry principal components 1 and 2 (PC1, PC2), were then included in our model. Sample identity was verified using the identity by descent algorithm from PLINK (v.1.09)114. Identity by descent was calculated for each pair of samples based on genotypes derived from RNA-seq analysis as well as for all pairs of RNA-seq and DNA sequencing samples. Samples with a \(\hat{\pi }\) < 0.8 from other samples derived from the same individual were removed. Sex was verified for each sample by detection of genes expressed by the Y chromosome.

Sample with high levels of duplication (Picard tools, PERCENT_DUPLICATION > 65), high levels of intergenic mapping (Picard tools, PCT_INTERGENIC_BASES > 60) or with low levels of messenger RNA (RNA) (Picard tools, PCT_MRNA_BASES < 0.5) were removed. All RNA-seq samples passing quality control are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Variance partitioning was performed using the variancePartition package (v.1.20.0) with default parameters. Gene-expression reproducibility was measured using Spearman's correlation between every pair of samples in a given time point and mutation both within and between individuals.

Libraries were prepared using TruSeq DNA PCR-Free (Illumina) and were sequenced with 150-base-pair paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Lines that underwent whole-genome sequencing are in Supplementary Table 2: further lines were quality controlled previously44. Sequencing data were processed as previously described in ref. 8.

The sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38) using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (bwa-mem, v.0.7.17)116. The resulting BAM files were merged using bamtools (v.2.5.1)117 resulting in a single BAM file per sample. Duplicate reads were marked using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool (v.2.5.0). Reads around indels were locally realigned using GATK's IndelRealigner (v.3.3). Base quality score was recalibrated using GATK113. Variant and non-variant bases in the genome were identified using GATK's HaplotypeCaller (v.3.3). Resulting variant cal formats were combined using GATK's combineGVCFs (v.3.3) and variants were called per chromosome using GATK's GenotypeGVCFs (v.3.3). Well-calibrated quality scores were generated using GATK's Variant Quality Score Recalibration (v.3.3). Large chromosomal changes, resulting from iPS cell chromosomal instability, were identified using DELLY (v.0.8.7)118. Lines with large indels (more than 750 kb) that were confirmed using allele frequency in the RNA-seq data were removed from the analysis. This included five individuals in whom all lines were dropped (four because of incorrect or absent mutations, one that did not pass quality control). Twenty-six lines in total (19 individuals) were dropped due to quality control failures. These include seven lines that were dropped due to failure to confirm mutation (four individuals), nine lines dropped due to large CNVs (seven individuals), two lines dropped due to leftover Sendai virus (two individuals), four due to further or improper deletions (four individuals) and four that were not fully characterized or did not pass quality control (two individuals). Point mutations in SHANK3, PCDH19 and CACNA1C were visually confirmed using Integrative Genomics Viewer (v.2.9.4)119. Sequencing depth was calculated using Samtools depth command (v.1.9)120. All whole-genome sequencing samples are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Gene counts were normalized using trimmed mean of M values121 as implemented in the calcNormFactors function from the edgeR package (v.3.26.8)122. The mixed linear model used included differentiation day, sex, batch, the first 2 principal components calculated for genetic ancestry and 15 sequencing principal components (SeqPCs) as fixed effects, and accounted for many samples coming from the same individual, hiPS cell line and differentiation, and for samples that were sequenced several times as random effects. The model was implemented using the dream function from the variancePartition package (v.1.20.0)123. Genes with FDR < 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed. To conduct meta-analyses on mutational differential gene expression, we used the metafor (v.4.6.0) package by fitting a fixed-effect model with the rma function for each time point124. FDR < 0.05 genes were considered to be differentially expressed. GSEA was run on metafor analysis output to determine enriched pathways using the fgsea package (v.1.3.0).

Independent component analysis was performed using the JADE algorithm as implemented in the MineICA package (v.1.30.0)125. The number of components was set to 36 with 10,000 maximum iterations. Association of the independent component with the forms of ASD was tested using a mixed linear model. The model was implemented using the lme function from the nlme package (v.3.1.152). Contrasts were used to compare each form of ASD at each time point to the control at the same time point using the glht function from the multcomp package (v.1.4.18). Like other component analyses, independent component directions are random and so enrichment was performed for both positively and negatively contributing genes. Unlike principal components, independent components are not inherently ordered and were therefore ordered by the amount of kurtosis in each independent component.

GSEA was performed using the fgsea package (v.1.10.1)126 on all genes with 1,000,000 permutations and a set size ranging from 30 to 500. Gene ontology gene sets (v.7.0) were downloaded from http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/. For differential expression genes were ranked by log2FC and for independent component analysed genes were ranked by the projection values of the genes on each component. Enrichment for high-confidence ASD genes (gene score of two or less, or syndromic genes) from the SFARI database (https://gene.sfari.org/database/gene-scoring/), from large scale ASD sequencing studies2,8, and risk genes for NDDs, intellectual disability and brain disorders91 was performed using Fisher's exact test.

Gene counts were normalized using conditional quantile normalization (v.1.36.0)127 and the covariates sex, tissue of origin, genetic ancestry PC1 and PC2 and the first 15 technical sequencing principal components were regressed out. The network was constructed using the WGCNA package (v.1.70.3)88 using a signed network for each time point separately. A modified version of robust WGCNA was used to reduce the influence of potential outlier samples on network architecture26. Samples were resampled from within each form of ASD ensuring that each iteration contained at least four samples from each form. In total, 100 networks were constructed followed by consensus network analysis that takes the median of the topological overlap dissimilarity matrix across the 100 networks88. Soft-threshold powers of 13, 9, 13 and 14 were used for days 25, 50, 75 and 100, respectively, to achieve approximate scale-free topology (R2 > 0.8). Modules were constructed using a minimal module size of 160, deep split of 4, cut height for creation of modules of 0.9999 and cut height for merging modules of 0.1. Each module eigengene (first principal component of the module) was tested for association with the different forms of ASD as well as for association with ASD overall using linear models. Module gene-ontology term enrichment was performed using clusterProfiler (v.4.0.5)128 with default parameters. Enrichment for common variation associated with ASD21, schizophrenia129, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder130, major depressive disorder131 and bipolar disorder132 was calculated using a stratified LDscore regression (v.1.0.0)133. SNPs with 10 kb of a gene were assigned to that gene and the enrichment was calculated as the proportion of SNP heritability accounted for by the genes in the module divided by the proportion of total SNPs within the module. Cell-type enrichment was performed using the bootstrap enrichment method from the EWCE package (v.1.0.1)134 using control samples from previously published single-cell data from a human cortical spheroids set44 with 100,000 permutations. As the background gene set, all genes expressed in both the current dataset and the single-cell dataset were used. Enrichment for high-confidence ASD genes (gene score of two or less or syndromic genes) from the SFARI database (https://gene.sfari.org/database/gene-scoring/) and ASD postmortem modules14 was performed using Fisher's exact test. Module trajectories were modelled using polynomial splines with two degrees of freedom and two degrees of the piecewise polynomial and tested for significant differences using a linear model. Module preservation was performed using the modulePreservation function from the WGCNA package with 100 permutations. Preservation was tested (1) at other time points within the current data set (2) in cortical samples from early developmental stages (8–16 weeks postconception) from the BrainSpan in vivo data set and (3) in other stem cell-based neuronal models81,82,83,84. To test the association of each ASD form with WGCNA modules, we ran a linear regression comparing the module eigengene of each module by form (as factor variable with control participants as the base level) or by diagnosis (affected versus control) using the lm() function. Adjusted R values of the regression are multiplied by the sign of the sum of model coefficients to determine direction of effect. Estimates for individual forms were derived from the model coefficients. We show FDR-corrected P values in the figures.

The different conditions (ASD form/differentiation day) were clustered based on the Spearman correlation of log2FC of all expressed genes using the Ward.D2 clustering method on Euclidean distances as implemented in the ComplexHeatmap package (v.2.9.3)135. Cluster significance was tested using multiscale bootstrap resampling as implemented in the pvclust function in the pvclust package (v.2.2.0)136 using the Ward.D2 clustering method on Euclidean distances with 10,000 bootstraps. The bootstrap probability measure is the frequency that a cluster appears in the bootstrap replicates. To test for clustering similarity across clustering methods, clustering was performed using the Ward.D, Ward.D2, complete, average and Mcquitty methods on each of the Euclidean, maximum, Manhattan and Minkowski distances. For each pair of clustering and distance methods the cophenetic correlation was measured using the cor.dendlist function from the dendextend package (v.1.14.0)137. Cophenetic correlation is a measure of how well the pair-wise distances of the unmodeled data are preserved in the dendrogram138. In addition, the Rand index was measured for each combination of these pairs using the rand.index function from the fossil package (v.0.4.0)139. Rand index is a measure of the similarity between two trials of clustering using the same data140. To verify that the clusters were not driven by a small subset of genes, we subset the genes used for clustering to 10,000, 5,000 or 2,000 random genes 100 times. The resulting genes were correlated using Spearman correlation and clustered using the Ward.D2 clustering method on the basis of Euclidean distances. Cophenetic correlation and Rand indexes were calculated as above.

Bulk RNA-seq counts were deconvolved using the control cell profiles from previously published single-cell data44 from day 75–85 organoids to deconvolve day 50, 75 and 100 time points, and new single-cell libraries were created with standard 10X methods from day 25 organoids to deconvolve the day 25 time point. Single-cell datasets were processed and integrated separately using standard Seurat v.5 workflows. The reference-based decomposition was performed using the ReferenceBasedDecomposition function from the BisqueRNA package (v.1.0.5)141. Changes in cell-type proportion were tested using a logit mixed linear model. The logit transformation was performed using the logit function from the car package (v.3.0.11) with a 0.001 adjustment. The model was implemented using the lme function from the nlme package (v.3.1.152). Contrasts were used to compare each form of ASD at each time point to the control at the same time point using the glht function from the multicomp package (v.1.4.18).

To identify transcription factor binding motifs over-represented in each module we used RcisTarget (v.1.6.0)142. The transcription factor data base used was hg38 and included 10 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start site (version 9; hg38__refseq-r80__10kb_up_and_down_tss.mc9nr). Only high-confidence annotated transcription factors were used for downstream analysis. The regulatory relationship between modules was calculated as a kME (which is the correlation of each gene in the module with the module eigengene) weighted proportion of the number of genes regulated by the upstream module in the downstream module such that: \(\mathrm{score}=\frac{\sum k\mathrm{ME}\,\mathrm{of}\,\mathrm{regulated}\,\mathrm{genes}\,\mathrm{in}\,\mathrm{the}\,\mathrm{module}}{\mathrm{Total}\,\mathrm{number}\,\mathrm{of}\,\mathrm{genes}\,\mathrm{in}\,\mathrm{the}\,\mathrm{module}}\). This weighted proportion puts larger weight on genes that are highly connected within the module. A module was considered to be highly regulated by another module if the phosphastaseME weighted score was above 1 standard deviation above the mean (which corresponded to a weighted score of 0.341).

PPIs were mapped using the Dapple143 module (v.0.19) in GenePattern (http://genepattern.broadinstitute.org) using the hg19 genome build with 1,000 permutations.

To validate predicted PPIs, we generated mass spectrometry data from key regulator proteins predicted to form a PPI. We tested antibodies against RELA (Active motif 40916), TP53 (Abcam ab26), CNOT6 (CST no. 13415), TBP (CST no. 8515), POLR2A (PTG 20655-1-AP), SOX9 (CST no. 82630), SMARCB1 (CST no. 91735), SMARCA4 (Abcam ab110641) and EP300 (Abcam ab275378). All antibodies were run at 1:1,000 concentrations. Antibodies that generated western blot bands at the appropriate size were selected for continued mass spectrometry analysis (run once; Fig. 5a). For western blot analysis of the proteins of interest, cell lysates were diluted in 6× SMASH buffer (5 mM Tis HCL pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.02% bromophenol blue and 1% beta-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min at 95 °C. Samples were then separated on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Life Technologies, 100 V, 2 h). Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) (0.1% Tween) with 5% BioRad Blotting-grade Blocker and then incubated overnight with antibodies listed above at 4 °C. After 3× 10-min washes in TBST, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min and again washed three times in TBST. The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked (NA9310V, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked (GENA934, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 1:5,000. Western blots were imaged using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Western blots were considered successful if the band was visualized at the expected molecular weight (Fig. 5a). For the 6 proteins that showed successful western blots, 1–2 mg of protein extract was incubated with primary antibody (1–2 µg) at 4 °C overnight (1 µg of primary antibody to 1 mg of protein). Following primary antibody incubation 100 µl of Protein A/G beads (Pierce) were added and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by 1 wash with lysis buffer (Pierce) with added Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific), 2 washes with PBS and then resuspended in PBS for mass spectrometry.

Samples were processed and quantified for mass spectrometry as in ref. 90 for the 6 proteins (TBP, POLR2A, SOX9, SMARCB1, SMARCA4 and EP300) with a western blot signal in NGN2-derived NPCs at day 4 (refs. 90,144,145). Briefly, NPCs were collected at day 4 following NGN2 expression and dual SMAD/WNT inhibition in the presence of doxycycline (rtTA, tetON-NGN2). Cells were pelleted, washed with PBS and resuspended in 10× packed cell volume immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) with added Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then centrifuged (16,200g, 20 min, 4 °C and resuspended in 3× packed cell volume. Samples were quantified using the Thermo BCA protein assay. Immunoprecipitations were eluted using SDS and subject to electrophoresis for gel extraction. Bands were excised and cut into roughly 1 mm3 pieces. Gel pieces were then subjected to a modified in-gel trypsin digestion procedure, washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 min, followed by removal of acetonitrile. Pieces were then completely dried in a speed-vac. Rehydration of the gel pieces was with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng µl−1 modified sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) at 4 °C. After 45 min, the excess trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution to just cover the gel pieces. Samples were then placed in a 37 °C room overnight. Peptides were later extracted by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution, followed by 1 wash with a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid. The extracts were then dried in a speed-vacuum (roughly 1 h). The samples were then stored at 4 °C until analysis.

On the day of analysis, the samples were reconstituted in 5–10 µl of high-performance liquid chromatography solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A nano-scale reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography capillary column was created by packing 2.6-µm C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary (100 µm inner diameter by roughly 30 cm in length) with a flame-drawn tip. After equilibrating the column each sample was loaded by using a Famos auto sampler (LC Packings) onto the column. A gradient was formed, and peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). As peptides eluted, they were subjected to electrospray ionization and then entered an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were detected, isolated and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide. For all IP–MS experiments, the following isotype control antibodies were used: rabbit IgG monoclonal (EPR25A) (Abcam, no. ab172730), rabbit IgG polyclonal (Abcam, no. ab37415) and mouse IgG1 κ monoclonal [MOPC-21] (Abcam, no. ab18443). Mass spectrometry experiments that yielded significance for the protein bait over IgG control samples were then included in analyses (all proteins except SOX9).

Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching the UniProt human protein database (release 2023_01) with the acquired fragmentation pattern using Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific)146. The database included a reversed version of all the sequences and the data were filtered to between 1% and 2% peptide FDR. Protein quantification was performed using GFY Core Version 3.8 (Harvard University). IP–MS data analysis is described in ref. 90.

To determine whether the M5 proteins formed a significant interaction network, we compared the logFCs between each ‘bait' and the other interactors predicted to be in the M5 network and found as a protein in any of the mass spectrometry experiments (943 unique proteins identified across all IP–MS experiments). If the interactors were not pulled down by the bait, the logFC was considered 0. We used the mean logFC across baits as a measure of average connectedness of the network. To assess the statistical significance of these networks, we ran 10,000 permutations by randomly selecting proteins of the same size as the network from the remaining set of 943 uniquely identified proteins. We compared the average logFC of each of these randomly generated networks to create a population curve. We then examined the z-scored connectedness of the network. Gene lists used to compare networks were SFARI genes (levels 1, 2, S), ASD risk genes2,8, intellectual disability risk genes91, NDD risk genes91 and developmental disorder enriched, ASD enriched and NDD non-specific92.

Three genomic RNAs (gRNAs) per target as well as 18 total non-targeting controls (NTC) were designed using the CRISPick database (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public) (Supplementary Table 15). NTCs were both gRNAs with no sequence in the human genome as well as gRNAs targeting random intergenic sequences. Sequences were designed as follows: a 5′ overhang (ATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACC) and a 3′ overhang (GTTTAAGAGCTATGCTGGAAACAGCATAGCAAGT) that is compatible with the CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) vector were added on the outside of the gRNA sequence. A G nucleotide was also incorporated between the 5′ overhang and the gRNA sequence. All oligos were ordered as a pool (Integrated DNA Technologies). The CROP-seq-opti-dsRed vector backbone was obtained from Addgene (Addgene no. 201999) and digested using New England Biolabs' (NEB) BsmBI enzyme. The oligo pool was diluted at a concentration of 100 µM, PCR amplified, (Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix) gel extracted, and cleaned. The vector and the pooled oligo insert was then assembled (NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Reaction). To validate the insertion was present post assembly, a PCR amplification using the U6 outer forward primer (TTTCCCATGATTCCTTCATATTTGC) and gRNA end reverse primer (AGTACAAGCAAAAAGCAGTGTCTCAA) was run and visualized. All gRNA sequences used for M5 targets and control samples are supplied in Supplementary Tables 14 (targets) and 15 (control samples). The pooled vectors were then transformed into NEB Stable Competent E. coli (High Efficiency), and plated at various dilutions on Luria-Bertani medium:ampicillin 1:1,000 plates overnight at 30 °C. Colonies were picked and PCR amplification of the insert was done to insure its presence. All bacterial colonies were then scraped from the plate and grown using 200 ml of 2.5% Luria-Bertani medium + 1:1,000 ampicillin. The broth containing colonies was then shaken at 170 rpm at 30 °C and this was complete once the optical density reached 2.0 nm. DNA was then isolated by use of the Qiagen Maxi Plasmid Kit.

Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (lines CRL-3216 and TIB-202) were expanded in DMEM, 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (HEK medium). Then 5 × 106 HEK293T were plated onto each of 2 poly-ornithine (5 µg ml−1) coated 10-cm plates for 24 h. Media from both plates was replaced with Opti-MEM before cells from 1 10-cm plate were transduced with a lentiviral vector (pLV-KRAB-dCas9 (Addgene no. 71236) or CROP-seq-opti-dsRed (Addgene no. 201999)) while the other plate of cells was transfected with 15 µg of the pooled plasmid library, 15 µg of psPAX2 and 1.5 µg of VSV-G with lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer's instructions. After 16 h, the Opti-MEM media was replaced with 10 ml of HEK medium, which was collected and replaced every 24 h twice. The HEK medium was then spun down with 12.5 ml of lenti-X concentrator (Takara Bio) and centrifuged at 1,500g for 45 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 400 µl of PBS, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

We derived NGN2-induced hNPCs according to ref. 100. A six-well plate was coated with Matrigel (1:50 in Knockout DMEM) for 2 h at 37 °C. A dox-inducible NGN2 iPS cell line, WTC11 (from L. Gan, Weill Cornell, available at Coriell), was seeded at 75,000 cells per cm2 in MTeSR+ supplemented with 10 µM of Y-27632. After 24 h, cells were subjected to induction medium (1:100 glutamax, 1:66.7 20% glucose in DMEM:F12, N2 supplement 1:100, doxycycline 2 µg ml−1, LDN-193189 200 nM, SB431542 10 µM, XAV939 2 µM). Day 2 involved the induction and selection using the following media: 1:100 glutamax, 1:66.7 20% glucose in DMEM:F12, N2 supplement 1:100, doxycycline 2 µg ml−1, LDN-193189 100 nM, SB431542 5 µM, XAV939 1 µM and puromycin 5 µg ml−1. Then 24 h postselection, the media was changed fully with NES complete and selection media (DMEM:F12, glutamax 1:50, penicillin and streptomycin 1:100, MEM NEAA 1:100, B-27 without vitamin A 1:50, N2 supplement 1:100, epidermal growth factor 10 ng ml−1, basic fibroblast growth factor 10 ng ml−1, puromycin 5 µg ml−1 and Y-27632 1:1,000). One day later and for the duration of the culture, cells were put on NES complete medium, which is the same as listed above apart from the use of Y-27632 and puromycin. Once hNPCs were generated, 500,000 hNPCs were seeded in every well of a six-well plate with NPC maintenance media (n = 6 replicates). To each well, GFP-KRAB-dCas9 (40 µl per well of a six-well plate) plasmid and CROP-dsRed-gRNA (33 µl per well of a six-well plate) were added. Media was replaced daily for 7 days before cells were collected for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS was done with BD FACSAria, Software FACS Diva v.8.0.2. For FACS, hNPCs were washed with PBS, dissociated into single-cell suspension using Accutase and resuspended in 500 µl of FACS buffer per replicate (7.5% BSA, 0.5 M EDTA, RNase inhibitor 1:200, DAPI 0.5 mg ml−1). A population of NPCs that were not transfected with plasmid were used as a negative control to establish FACS gating. Double positive GFP/TdTomato (dCAS9–single-guide RNA double expressing) cells were sorted for downstream single-cell analyses (roughly 30,000 cells per replicate after FACS, roughly 20% of live cell fraction).

Sorted cells then underwent scRNA extraction using the 10X genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v.3.1 (PN-1000121). The 10X protocol for library prep was adapted from ref. 147. gRNA libraries were sequenced separately from scRNA (GEX) libraries. scRNA and gRNA libraries were aligned to the human genome (GRCh38) with CellRanger (v.7.0.1). Roughly 10,000 aligned cells were recovered per replicate. Cells were filtered to include cells with more than 200 features and percentage of mitochondria less than 10%. Doublets were then removed using DoubletFinder (8,406 doublets, 13.2%). After quality control and doublet filtering before selecting uniquely gRNA positive cells, the median nCounts per cell was 17,071 and the median nGenes was 4,675, from 55,216 singlets (Extended Data Fig. 13c). Single-cell data were then processed using standard best practices for Seurat v.5. Briefly, we log-normalized counts and performed integration using SCTransform followed by clustering. Canonical markers were used to determine cell-type classification including NPC markers SOX2, NES, VIM and HES1 and cNPCs expressing G2 mitotic markers TOP2A, HMGB2, CDK1 and NUSAP1 (Extended Data Fig. 13e). We then assigned gRNAs to cells and filtered cells as follows. BAM files generated from gRNA libraries were analysed as in ref. 148 (GitHub, https://github.com/shendurelab/single-cell-ko-screens). In short, a text file of gRNA sequences was supplied as well as the common sequence appearing before the gRNA sequence, and each of these reads was counted from the BAM file and paired to the cells within the scRNA libraries through cell unique molecular identifier matching. Only cells containing gRNA barcodes with a unique molecular identifier count of at least ten were kept in the downstream analysis (Extended Data Fig. 13d). This left a total of 23,672 high-quality singlet cells that had 1 and only 1 gRNA-target assigned (Extended Data Fig. 13d,f). This cut-off has also been previously used148 and was determined to be sufficient for significant decrease in expression of the target. All differential analysis was performed on cells that expressed the gRNA of a single target. A standard pseudobulk differential expression using the edgeR (v.3.40.2) Quasi-Likelihood F test was performed using the libra package (v.1.0.0) function, run_de(). All differential gene expression compared all cells expressing any control gRNAs with all cells expressing any target gRNAs, above the unique 10 unique-molecular-identifier cut-off (3,163 total cells considered as control cells). The range of cells containing each gene target was 171–2,423, median 775. The proportion of cells containing each unique barcode (summarized by gene target) per replicate is shown in Extended Data Fig. 13g. Each replicate sample, taken from different plate wells was considered one sample for psuedobulking.

Posts on social-media platform X that are critical of scientific research can act as early warning signs of problematic articles, according to two large studies. The findings reflect how post-publication commentary can help to identify errors or fraudulent results, say scientists.

Previous research has shown that potentially problematic articles get substantial attention on social media before being formally retracted1, and receive more attention than do similar articles that do not get retracted2. Er-Te Zheng, a PhD student studying computational social science at the University of Sheffield, UK, wanted to find out whether social-media platforms such as X could be used to identify integrity issues in articles.

Zheng and his colleagues examined3 thousands of tweets that referenced articles that went on to be retracted and articles that didn't. Of the 604 studies that went on to be retracted, the researchers found that 8.3% had at least one critical post on X before retraction, compared with only 1.5% of articles that were not retracted. Zheng and his colleagues defined critical tweets as posts that contained sarcasm, criticism, accusations or doubt about the article. They say that nearly 1 in 12 of the retracted articles could have been flagged to publishers for greater scrutiny on the basis of the social-media posts.

Another analysis4 looked at whether the sentiment of tweets or inclusion of retraction-related terms influenced how quickly a paper was retracted. Hajar Sotudeh, who studies academic publishing at Shiraz University in Iran, and her colleagues analysed 1,200 retracted papers that were published between 2019 and 2022, and 16,500 posts on X about those papers. The researchers found that negative sentiment in tweets and the inclusion of any of 95 ‘red flag' words — such as fraud, retract, hoax or flawed — were associated with an increased risk that the paper would be retracted.

Sotudeh and her team found that tweets containing red-flag words were associated with papers being retracted faster than those that had posts without these terms. Longer tweets were also associated with a faster retraction time than were shorter posts, but less so if red-flag words were also present. The team noted, however, that they could not show causality between negative X posts and retractions. Existing studies have not shown a causal relationship between criticism on social media and publishers' decisions to retract or not.

These studies shows that social media platforms are an important place for post-publication commentary, says Virginia Barbour, co-chair of the Declaration on Research Assessment initiative, which aims to reform how scientific outputs are evaluated, and a researcher in academic publishing at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. Post-publication commentary is needed because conventional peer review can miss errors or fraud, says Barbour. 

Sotudeh says researchers and publishers are paying more attention to commentary online. But there is no guidance yet for how publishers can translate social media critiques into evidence-based editorial decisions. This can raise issues because posts calling for retractions can reflect a person's biases rather than a scientific justification, she says. “If publishers are to give more weight to such discourse, they will need systems for screening, verifying, and contextualizing claims before taking action,” Sotudeh adds.

China's brain-computer interface industry is growing fast, and the newest company to emerge from the country is aiming to access the brain without the use of invasive implants.

Gestala, newly founded in Chengdu with offices in Shanghai and Hong Kong, plans to use ultrasound technology to stimulate—and eventually read from—the brain, according to CEO and cofounder Phoenix Peng.

It's the second company to launch in recent weeks with the aim of tapping into the brain with ultrasound. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced a major investment in brain-computer interface startup Merge Labs, cofounded by its CEO, Sam Altman, along with other tech executives and members of Forest Neurotech, a California-based nonprofit research organization.

Best known as a type of medical test, ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs and to visualize blood flow. One of the most common uses of ultrasound is to monitor the development of a fetus during pregnancy. But researchers have also been interested in ultrasound's potential to treat diseases, not just diagnose them.

Depending on the intensity of the ultrasound, it can be used to destroy abnormal tissue such as blood clots or cancer, or modulate neural activity without the need for surgery. Focused ultrasound treatments are already approved for Parkinson's disease, uterine fibroids, and certain tumors.

Initially, Gestala wants to build a device that delivers focused ultrasound to the brain to treat chronic pain. Pilot studies have shown that stimulating the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region involved in the emotional component of pain, can reduce pain intensity in people for up to a week.

Peng says Gestala's first-generation device will be a stationary benchtop machine. Patients would need to come into a clinic to receive the treatment. The company is in discussion with some hospitals in China that are interested in testing the technology, Peng says.

Gestala's second-generation device will be a wearable helmet that will allow patients to use it at home under the guidance of a physician. Beyond chronic pain, Gestala wants to gradually expand to other indications, including depression and other mental illnesses, as well as stroke rehabilitation, Alzheimer's disease, and sleep disorders.

Like Altman's Merge Labs, Gestala ultimately wants to use ultrasound to read the brain as well. Ideally, a device would detect brain states associated with chronic pain or depression, for instance, and deliver therapeutic stimulation to the precise area of the brain with abnormal activity. Peng says the goal is not “enhancement” of humans but healthier neural functions.

Most brain-computer interfaces, including Neuralink's, work by picking up electrical signals generated by neurons. An ultrasound-based interface would instead measure changes in the brain's blood flow.

Previously, Peng was the CEO and cofounder of Shanghai-based NeuroXess, which is developing a brain implant that reads electrical signals from neurons. NeuroXess is aiming to allow paralyzed individuals to control digital devices and produce synthesized speech with their thoughts. Peng left NeuroXess last year to work on Gestala.

“The electrical brain-computer interface only records from a part of the brain; for instance, the motor cortex,” Peng says. “Ultrasound, it seems like, can provide us with the capability to access the whole brain.”

Gestala's other cofounder is Tianqiao Chen, founder of the online gaming company Shanda Interactive Entertainment. Chen also established the California-based nonprofit Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute, which supports neuroscience research.

The company's name comes from Gestalt psychology, a German school of thought associated with the adage “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”

Maximilian Riesenhuber, a professor of neuroscience and codirector of the Center for Neuroengineering at Georgetown University, says extracting information from the brain with ultrasound is much more ambitious than delivering targeted ultrasound to a particular part of it. The skull weakens and distorts ultrasound signals, and so far, researchers have been able to interpret neural activity with ultrasound only by removing a portion of the skull to create a “window” into the brain.

“The best people have been able to do so far is reading out neural activity in humans with cranial implants that are more translucent to ultrasound than bone. So, the readout part is a bit of an engineering challenge,” Riesenhuber says.

Another issue is that changes in blood flow are more sluggish than neural activity, which may not make it ideal for certain applications, such as translating speech.

Merge Labs has not said what applications it will focus on, but its website mentions the potential to “restore lost abilities, support healthier brain states, deepen our connection with each other, and expand what we can imagine and create alongside advanced AI.”

Some of those applications are likely many years away. “I don't expect people to be interfacing with ChatGPT based on functional ultrasound neuroimaging anytime soon,” Riesenhuber says.

Data centers have caused the demand for gas-fired power in the US to explode over the past two years, according to new research released Wednesday. More than a third of this new demand, the research found, is explicitly linked to gas projects that will power data centers—the equivalent of energy that would power tens of millions of US homes.

The findings from Global Energy Monitor, a San Francisco–based nonprofit that tracks oil and gas developments, come as the Trump administration is both encouraging data center build-out and doing away with pollution regulations on power plants and oil and gas extraction. They will also almost certainly mean an increase in US greenhouse gas emissions, even if some of the projects tracked by Global Energy Monitor never get built.

“The implications are huge when you're talking about this size of a build-out,” says Jonathan Banks, a senior climate adviser at Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit that works to reduce emissions. (Clean Air Task Force was not involved in the Global Energy Monitor research.)

Building all the gas-fired power infrastructure that was in development at the end of last year could increase the US gas fleet by nearly 50 percent, according to Global Energy Monitor's findings. The US currently has around 565 gigawatts of gas-fired power on the grid. If all the projects in the development pipeline are built, it would add almost 252 gigawatts of gas power to the US fleet. (Estimates vary, but 1 gigawatt can power up to a million homes, depending on the energy use of the region.)

Data centers have helped to nearly triple the demand for gas-fired power in the US over the past two years. When Global Energy Monitor last released its tracker, in early 2024, it logged around 85 gigawatts of gas-fired power in the development pipeline in the US. Just over 4 gigawatts of that development were explicitly earmarked for data centers. But in 2025, more than 97 gigawatts of demand tracked were from projects that will be used to power data centers—almost 25 times higher than the 2024 figures.

“About a year and a half ago, we started to see this increase in proposals for data centers specifically,” says Jenny Martos, a research analyst at Global Energy Monitor who worked on the report.

To put together the research, Global Energy Monitor reviewed publicly available sources of data on gas power build-outs in the pipeline. These include state-level regulatory filings, air quality permits, and public announcements from companies. (Martos says that the group compared its findings with industry-held data as a benchmark.)

As the data center build-out continues across the country, developers are scrambling to secure power from any and all sources—and utilities are racing to meet the projected demand. This has meant that dirtier power sources are getting a second shot at staying online: coal-fired power plants around the country have recently been given extensions on their retirement dates, boosted by coal-friendly policies from the Trump administration.

Natural gas is a much cleaner power option than coal-fired power, but gas plants do release CO2 emissions. About 35 percent of US energy-related CO2 emissions in 2022 came from burning natural gas.

“Gas is cleaner when burnt than coal, but when you're talking about this much gas, you're talking about a lot of CO2 associated with it, too,” says Banks.

A larger concern with natural gas is methane leaks during the extraction process. Methane stays for a shorter period of time in the atmosphere than CO2, but it is 80 times more potent over a 20 year period. Climate scientists say that decreasing methane emissions over the shorter term is crucial to controlling climate change in the long run. It's estimated that oil and gas production accounts for a third of all global methane leaks; the US is the largest producer of natural gas in the world.

“If you zero out the methane, and you have a very efficient natural-gas-fired power plant, it is dramatically cleaner than a coal-fired power plant,” says Banks. “But when you layer on the methane emissions, that's when you see those gaps begin to close between coal and natural gas.”

A well-regulated oil and gas industry that does its best to stop leaks could go a long way in stopping methane emissions. But this new demand for natural gas from data centers is coming right as the Trump administration is rolling back regulations on the industry. This includes extending the deadline for a major regulation that would require oil and gas operators to take several steps to show that they are tracking and stopping methane leaks.

The figures collected by Global Energy Monitor include potential gas units added to a larger grid in order to bolster electricity supply in regions seeing increased demand from data centers. But they also include on-site gas turbines that will solely be used to power data centers. Building power sources on-site, like gas turbines or solar arrays, is becoming increasingly popular for data center developers, who, in some places, are facing yearslong waits to connect to the larger power grid.

It's unlikely that all of the projects tracked by Global Energy Monitor will actually be built. Many data center developers shop around for power with multiple utilities, which helps to inflate overall demand; simply because a data center project has been announced does not mean that it will eventually be built. Efficiency improvements in both data center construction and in AI training will likely decrease some of the projected demand for energy over the next couple of years. A worldwide shortage of gas turbines also will play a big role in determining what actually gets built on time: Two-thirds of the projects tracked worldwide by the Global Energy Monitor do not yet have turbine manufacturers attached to them.

“We're in that phase where we're seeing the explosion in proposals,” Martos says. “What materializes is yet to be determined.”

Even just a partial build-out of these facilities would be significant. The number of projects under construction—those most likely to be completed—tracked by Global Energy Monitor would add just under 30 gigawatts of gas-fired power to the grid. An additional 159 gigawatts are in the preconstruction phase—not being currently built, but involved in planning and financing processes.

“AI is not going away—we know that,” says Banks. “It's really a question of what can we do to diminish the impact of these facilities.”

Last year, the Trump administration and members of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) forcibly took over the US Institute of Peace (USIP), an independent nonprofit. Since then, the organization's fired board and employees have been fighting to regain control of the USIP building in Washington, DC and for the reinstatement of their jobs in a drawn-out court battle.

Now, in a letter sent to the Department of Justice (DOJ), representatives on behalf of the USIP's fired board and president allege that the administration is violating a court-issued stay by making physical changes to the building and, as the letter claims, moving ahead with new agreements. Specifically, the letter asks for information on whether the State Department has signed an agreement to use the building for the “Board of Peace,” a new international organization under the personal lifetime control of President Donald Trump that seeks to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza.

“They're acting under the stay as though they have a license to use the building, to use money, to treat the building any way they want,” says George Foote, counsel for former USIP leadership and staff. “A stay is not permission for the loser of a case to hijack the property of the winning party.”

On March 17, 2025 members of DOGE arrived at USIP and forced their way into the $500 million building; shortly after, the Trump administration fired most of the organization's board. USIP, though created and funded by Congress, is an independent entity, not a federal agency. This did not stop Trump from issuing an executive order purporting to essentially close USIP.

In May, a court held that the administration's takeover of USIP's building and firing of its staff were unlawful; the next month, an appeals court issued a stay on that ruling. This returned the building to the administration's control while a federal appeals case is ongoing.

In December, the Trump administration renamed the building the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, even affixing the president's name to its edifice. But this, apparently, was only the beginning.

According to the letter, “USIP's current acting president has recently signed a ten-year

memorandum of understanding (‘MOU') with the State Department, under which hundreds of State Department employees will move into USIP's building.” The letter alleges that under the terms of this agreement, USIP will be responsible for the building's upkeep and security costs, and the State Department will be indemnified against responsibility for damage to USIP property. To accommodate an influx of new people, the letter alleges, “construction is already underway to modify working spaces in the USIP building.” These renovations, the letter argues, could “impose substantial, expensive, and unwarranted obstacles” should USIP ultimately win back control of the building in the final court case.

Which State Department staff would be housed at the USIP building is unclear, but a presentation given at the World Economic Forum by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner has raised alarms on the part of USIP's former staff and board. Kushner, who does have not a formal role in the administration, used a slide deck to outline the plans for the new “Board of Peace” and the redevelopment of Gaza; an image of the USIP building was the final slide. The letter asks the government to “confirm whether the Administration has plans to house the ‘Board of Peace' at the USIP headquarters building.”

""The government does not have a license to rename the USIP headquarters building or lease it out for 10 years. It certainly has no right to open the building to a new international organization like the proposed Board of Peace,” says Foote.

The letter also asks for confirmation of the funds that are in USIP's endowment, which Foote says he is concerned may be used “to remodel the building for purposes of that State Department lease, therefore using our donor money for the benefit of the State Department.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Arkero, a Seattle-area startup focused on using AI to help manage the day-to-day operations of sports organizations, raised $6 million in pre-seed funding.

Founded by Shivaas Gulati, co-founder of Remitly, and two other veterans of the Seattle digital remittance company, Arkero launched last fall. The startup has secured early partnerships across three pro soccer leagues, including with the Seattle Sounders FC, Seattle Reign FC, San Diego FC and Bolton Wanderers FC.

Arkero's AI works with existing systems and tools including data warehouses, Slack, email, ticketing, and more. It learns from past procedures to inform new decisions around programs, activations, partnerships, and fan-engagement strategies and help teams make more money with faster, data-driven decisions.

Initial deployments of Arkero's platform are focused on integrating AI into matchday planning and season-ticket renewals.

“I own a football club. I've sat in the meetings, lived the chaos, and felt the cost of running a business on Excel and email. The opportunity exists because this is broken from the inside,” said Gulati, Arkero's CEO, who is part of the ownership group of Southend United, which plays in the fifth tier of English football.

Gulati has also served as a technical advisor to the Sounders, helping the Major League Soccer club with its AI and tech strategy.

Sounders majority owner Adrian Hanauer is among Arkero's investors. The funding round was led by Roger Ehrenberg of Game Changers Ventures, with participation from Alexis Ohanian (776), David Tisch (BoxGroup), Garuda Ventures, Founders' Co-op, and others.

“On and off the pitch, our business is about constantly looking ahead to identify what we can do better and how we can use technology and the right partners to gain a competitive edge,” Hanauer said in a statement. “Our investment in Arkero is aligned with this approach, accounting for not just where we are as an organization today, but where we need to be going forward.”

Arkero said the Sounders and Reign project over 50% improvement in “efficiency savings” around matchday planning in 2026, driven by AI's ability to reduce manual work and make faster decisions and fewer operational errors.

Gulati helped co-found Remitly in 2011, the company went public in 2021 and he left in 2022. He spent years at the company alongside his Arkero co-founders — Vamsi Narla, who leads product and engineering, and Daniel Shi, who oversees business operations.

Last year, Gulati told GeekWire that Seattle is “a great place to build a company, and we're going to double down on that and build another big company here.”

For landowners, it's devastating to lose acres of forest to a wildfire — and then there's the challenge of what comes next. 

Mast Reforestation has an answer that helps restore the charred landscape and prevents the release of additional planet-warming carbon while also generating revenue: it's called biomass burial. 

The Seattle startup has engineered a solution that permanently disposes of the burned trees, locking away their carbon and methane that could otherwise be released into the atmosphere. The company announced today that its first tree burial has performed as designed and it has sold 80% of the carbon credits that were produced as a result. 

Under normal conditions, “the remediation of that land is really expensive,” Maria Huyer, Mast's head of product, told GeekWire. “And this is just such a simple solution to carbon dioxide removal that has the ability to fund such a huge challenge.” 

After a wilderness burns, landowners have limited strategies for clearing the torched vegetation and replanting. They can finish burning the dead trees, sell them for firewood, seek a mill that will take the damaged timber, or turn it into environmentally friendly biochar — but that requires special machinery and is difficult to do with mobile units.

Because of its remote location, landowners of a destroyed forest in southern Montana only had the option of burning the remaining wood. Then came the partnership with Mast. 

The project yielded more than 4,500 metric tons of biomass that was buried in a clay-lined vault that prevents the wood from getting wet, decomposing and releasing gases. The pit is carefully capped with a layer of clay, a geoengineered textile, gravel and organic matter. Native grasses are planted on top.

Sensors inside the vault monitor for changes in temperature and humidity that indicate decomposition, allowing the team to take action and stop the process. Above-ground sensors operate continually and can detect elevated levels of carbon dioxide and methane that are remotely tracked.  

The startup has committed resources to continue the monitoring for 100 years.

Some of the revenue generated from the sale of the carbon credits are paying for the reforestation of the Montana forestland, which was scorched in the 2021 Poverty Flats Fire. That work will begin this spring. 

Companies, organizations and institutions purchase carbon credits to offset their own climate impacts. Buyers of the Montana-based credits include the Royal Bank of Canada, the carbon credit marketplace CNaught, and Muir AI, a Seattle startup addressing supply chain costs. 

The project generated 4,277 carbon removal credits that were independently verified and registered with an organization called Puro.earth. Huyer didn't disclose what they cost, but said they were more expensive than nature-based credits created through forest conservation and roughly on par with biochar costs. 

There are other biomass burial efforts, including Graphyte, which turns crop and timber waste into bricks that are disposed in lined pits, and Maryland-based Carbon Lockdown, which uses a strategy akin to Mast's, among others.

The use of wood vaults for capturing carbon is gaining interest, according to experts. But there are concerns about ensuring it's the best use of woody debris. Depending on the situation, biomass can be used for the production of sustainable aviation fuels and other applications. Huyer said the company takes these alternatives into consideration when evaluating a project. 

Mast initially launched in 2015 as Droneseed, which used drones to map and replant burned areas. It has expanded and shifted focus since then. It now owns Silvaseed, the largest private seed supplier west of Colorado; seedling provider Cal Forest Nurseries; and seed supplier and processor Siskiyou Seed. 

The company, which raised $25 million from investors a year ago, still performs drone-assisted reforestation, but does the planting by hand for improved tree survival.

Mast's goal is to scale up its burnt-tree burials to contain about 20,000 metric tons of biomass. It aims to build a pipeline of projects that total 150,000 tons each year. There's no shortage or material to dispose of.  

“In Montana alone there's 2.8 million tons of burned biomass,” Huyer said. “And so this is a challenge that is wide and extensive.”

A cloud hanging over Seattle is usually a good thing, if you're here for the rain, or if you work in that aspect of the tech industry. But the cloud of economic uncertainty is a less welcome occurrence.

The tech boom is showing more signs of tech gloom this week following layoffs at some of the region's biggest employers.

Is Seattle facing a tech recession? That was the question on KUOW's “Booming” podcast that sounded more like dooming this week as it dug into Amazon's “right-sizing,” elimination of pandemic-fueled corporate “bloat,” and what role AI is playing in the company's largest-ever reduction in force. It's a trend being seen across U.S. corporations — UPS will cut 30,000 more jobs this year — as The Wall Street Journal reported.

KUOW also reported that the Seattle region had a net loss of 13,000 jobs last year, noting that in a normal year, Seattle has a net gain of about 40,000 jobs. Which years were (way) worse? The pandemic (2020), the Great Recession (2009) and the Dot-Com bust (2001).

“I am very nervous about what's happening,” Joe Nguyen, the new president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, told KIRO 7 in a report about job losses. Jeff Shulman, the chair of the University of Washington's Marketing and International Business Department added: “This is kind of the scariest time economically for the Seattle region since the Great Recession in 2009.”

For those now facing the prospect of job hunting, the outlook may remain scary. Not only is the market being flooded with thousands of laid off tech workers, tech-related job postings remain stuck well below pre-pandemic levels in Seattle, as GeekWire reported in December.

At least one official always manages to find the silver lining in cloudy Seattle.

“We hope this pain is short-term,” Downtown Seattle President and CEO Jon Scholes said this week. “It would be unwise to bet against Seattle in the long run — the talent pool and fundamental assets are in our favor.”

Sound Games, a new Seattle startup developing video games that work across multiple platforms with a single purchase, announced $6.5 million in seed funding. 

The startup is betting on a “pay once, play anywhere” model — players buy a game one time and can play it across PC, console, and mobile devices. The company says its goal is to focus on high-quality, re-playable games without heavy in-game purchases or monetization mechanics.

Sound Games' first title, Go Ape Ship!, is scheduled to launch Feb. 18. The game is designed as an early example of the company's cross-platform approach, allowing players to move between devices without buying the game repeatedly.

The 12-person company was co-founded by Mike Schmid, who previously was head of publishing at Seattle startup Rec Room. Schmid was most recently vice president of growth at mobile gaming startup Backbone, and also spent four years at Apple. His co-founders include Jacobo Abril and Sergio Abril, who previously started and led video game development company nada studio. 

The seed round was led by Point72 Ventures, with participation from Timeless, Daybreak, WOCstar, Hustle Fund, ZVC, and other investors. Sound Games said the funding will be used to ship multiple original titles, build cross-platform technology, and expand its development team.

Sound Games was previously featured in GeekWire's Startup Radar.

After launching a messaging feature last August, Spotify is now rolling out group chats. The company announced this week that users can now share the podcasts, playlists, and audiobooks they're listening to with up to 10 people.

You can only start a chat with someone you've previously shared content with. For example, if you have a collaborative playlist with someone or have joined a Jam or a Blend together, you can start a conversation with them. 

The move comes as Spotify continues to invest in making its streaming app more social. Over the years, the company has gradually added social elements, including features such as comments on podcasts and the ability to follow someone and see what they listen to.

Spotify previously noted that users should continue sharing content outside the app, as its messaging feature is meant to complement that. 

Messages are encrypted at rest and in transit. However, they are not protected by end-to-end encryption.

Google announced on Thursday that Google Maps users can now access Gemini hands-free while walking and cycling. The update comes a few months after Google Maps rolled out its Gemini-powered hands-free, conversational driving experience.

The announcement marks Google's ongoing efforts to plug Gemini into more parts of people's everyday lives, while shifting Google Maps from static directions to real-time, conversational navigation.

When you're walking around and navigating with Maps, you can now ask Gemini questions like “Tell me more about the neighborhood I'm in,” “What are some must-see attractions?” or “Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?”

Google says that walking and typing can be hard, which is why it's rolling out the ability for users to ask questions without breaking their stride or leaving Maps' navigation screen.

If you're cycling, you can ask Gemini questions while remaining focused on the road, Google says. You can ask questions like “What's my ETA?” or “When's my next meeting?” Plus, you could ask Gemini to “Text Emily I'm 10 minutes behind” so you can communicate with others while keeping your grip on the handlebars. 

The feature lets you ask multiple questions in a conversation. For example, you could ask: “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What's parking like there?”

The update is now available worldwide on iOS wherever Gemini is available, and rolling out on Android.

The move comes as Google recently updated Maps with new features, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tips sections that surfaces important information about places you're interested in. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, reveal secret menu items, suggest the best place to park, and more.

Additionally, the navigation app also added an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature. The updated Explore tab makes it easier and faster to find trending spots near you, while the EV charger feature allows users to see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination.

Thursday's announcement comes a day after Google updated Chrome with enhanced Gemini integration and agentic features for autonomous tasks, as it looks to compete with AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company. The tech giant also launched a persistent Gemini sidebar and a new “auto-browse” feature that can navigate websites on your behalf.

A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica on January 23, according to the company. Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.

The NHTSA has opened an investigation into the accident, and Waymo said in a blog post that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.”

Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at six miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle's path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”

“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.

News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a probe into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the National Transportation Safety Board opened its own investigation last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.

According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”

The NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”

Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.

A new security feature rolled out to select models of the latest iPhones and iPads this week will make it more difficult for law enforcement, spies, and malicious hackers to obtain a person's precise location data from their phone provider.

According to Apple, the new feature, when enabled, limits the precision of location data that iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads share with the customer's cell carrier. Sharing a less-precise location, such as the general neighborhood rather than a street address, will help to protect the device owner's privacy, the company claims. 

Apple said switching on the feature does not affect the precision of location data shared with apps, or shared with first responders during an emergency call. 

The limit precise location feature is supported on iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular, running iOS 26.3, and is available on a handful of global carriers including Telekom in Germany, AIS and True Thailand, EE and BT in the United Kingdom, and Boost Mobile in United States. 

The company did not give a reason for introducing the new feature, and a spokesperson for Apple would not comment on the record when reached by email. 

The new feature lands at a time when law enforcement agencies are increasingly tapping cell carriers to access the location data of individuals for tracking them in real time, or examining where they have traveled over a period of time.

Hackers also frequently target cell carriers for the sensitive data that they collect on their customers. Over the past year, several U.S. phone giants, including AT&T and Verizon, have confirmed persistent intrusions by China-backed hackers, dubbed Salt Typhoon, seeking phone call logs and messages of senior American officials. 

Recent threats aside, long-known vulnerabilities in global cellular networks have allowed surveillance vendors to snoop on the location data of individuals anywhere in the world.

While telecom operators can determine the approximate location of a person's phone, the person's device itself plays a part in providing accurate location data back to the carrier, said Gary Miller, a mobile security expert who serves as a Citizen Lab researcher and senior director of network intelligence at iVerify.

“Most people aren't aware that devices can send location data outside of just apps,” said Miller. “While [the devices] can limit GPS disclosure at the app level, they haven't been able to lock down precise location disclosure to the network.”

“Apple's feature, while limited to very few operator networks, is a step in the right direction in providing users with greater privacy controls,” he said.

As AI races into classrooms worldwide, Google is finding that the toughest lessons on how the tech can actually scale are emerging not from Silicon Valley, but from India's schools.

India has become a proving ground for Google's education AI amid intensifying competition from rivals, including OpenAI and Microsoft. With more than a billion internet users, the country now accounts for the highest global usage of Gemini for learning, according to Chris Phillips, Google's vice president and general manager for education, within an education system shaped by state-level curricula, strong government involvement, and uneven access to devices and connectivity.

Phillips was speaking on the sidelines of Google's AI for Learning Forum in New Delhi this week, where he met with industry stakeholders, including K-12 school administrators and education officials, to gather feedback on how AI tools are being used in classrooms.

The scale of India's education system helps explain why the country has become such a consequential testing ground. The country's school education system serves about 247 million students across nearly 1.47 million schools, per the Indian government's Economic Survey 2025-26, supported by 10.1 million teachers. Its higher education system is among the world's largest as well, with more than 43 million students enrolled in 2021-22 — a 26.5% increase from 2014-15 — complicating efforts to introduce AI tools across systems that are vast, decentralized, and unevenly resourced.

One of the clearest lessons for Google has been that AI in education cannot be rolled out as a single, centrally defined product. In India, where curriculum decisions sit at the state level and ministries play an active role, Phillips said Google has had to design its education AI so that schools and administrators — not the company — decide how and where it is used. That marks a shift for Google, which, like most Silicon Valley firms, has traditionally built products to scale globally rather than bending to the preferences of individual institutions.

“We are not delivering a one-size-fits-all,” Phillips told TechCrunch. “It's a very diverse environment around the world.”

Beyond governance, that diversity is also reshaping how Google thinks about AI-driven learning itself. The company is seeing faster adoption of multimodal learning in India, said Phillips, combining video, audio, and images alongside text — reflecting the need to reach students across different languages, learning styles, and levels of access, particularly in classrooms that are not built around text-heavy instruction.

A related shift has been Google's decision to design its AI for education around teachers, rather than students, as the primary point of control. The company has focused on tools that assist educators with planning, assessment, and classroom management, Phillips noted, rather than bypassing them with direct-to-student AI experiences.

“The teacher-student relationship is critical,” he said. “We're here to help that grow and flourish, not replace it.”

In parts of India, AI in education is being introduced in classrooms that have never had one device per student or reliable internet access. Google is encountering schools where devices are shared, connectivity is inconsistent, or learning jumps directly from pen and paper to AI tools, Phillips said. 

“Access is universally critical, but how and when it happens is very different,” he added, pointing to environments where schools rely on shared or teacher-led devices rather than one-to-one access.

Meanwhile, Google is translating its early learnings from India into deployments, including AI-powered JEE Main preparation through Gemini, a nationwide teacher training program covering 40,000 Kendriya Vidyalaya educators, and partnerships with government institutions on vocational and higher education, including India's first AI-enabled state university.

For Google, India's experience is serving as a preview of challenges likely to surface elsewhere as AI moves deeper into public education systems. The company expects issues around control, access, and localization — now obvious in India — to increasingly shape how AI in education scales globally.

Google's push also reflects a broader shift in how people are using GenAI. Entertainment had dominated AI use cases last year, said Phillips, who added that learning has now emerged as one of the most common ways people engage with the technology, particularly among younger users. As students increasingly turn to AI for studying, exam preparation, and skill-building, education has become a more immediate — and consequential — arena for Google.

India's complex education system is also drawing increasing attention from Google's rivals. OpenAI has begun building a local leadership presence focused on education, hiring former Coursera APAC managing director Raghav Gupta as its India and APAC education head and launching a Learning Accelerator program last year. Microsoft, meanwhile, has expanded partnerships with Indian institutions, government bodies, and edtech players, including Physics Wallah, to support AI-based learning and teacher training, highlighting how education is becoming a key battleground as AI companies seek to embed their tools into public systems.

At the same time, India's latest Economic Survey flags risks to students from uncritical AI use, including over-reliance on automated tools and potential impacts on learning outcomes. Citing studies by MIT and Microsoft, the survey noted that “dependence on AI for creative work and writing tasks is contributing to cognitive atrophy and a deterioration of critical thinking capabilities.” This serves as a reminder that the race to enter classrooms is unfolding amid growing concerns over how AI shapes learning itself.

Whether Google's India playbook becomes a model for AI in education elsewhere remains an open question. However, as GenAI moves deeper into public education systems, the pressures now visible in India are likely to surface in other countries as well, making the lessons Google is learning there difficult for the industry to ignore.

Last year, Deezer introduced an AI-detection tool that automatically tags fully AI-generated music for listeners and removes it from algorithmic and editorial recommendations.

The company announced on Thursday that it's now making the tool available to other streaming platforms in an effort to help address the rise of AI and fraudulent streams, as well as promote transparency within the music industry and make sure human artists still get the recognition they deserve.

Alongside the move, Deezer reported that 85% of streams from fully AI-generated tracks are deemed fraudulent. Notably, the service now receives 60,000 AI tracks per day, totaling 13.4 million AI-detected songs. By contrast, in June of last year, fully AI-generated music made up 18% of daily uploads, surpassing 20,000 tracks.

​Deezer claims its AI music detection tool can identify every AI-generated track from major generative models like Suno and Udio. In addition to excluding AI-generated tracks from recommendations, Deezer's tool demonetizes them and excludes them from the royalty pool, as the company aims to fairly compensate musicians and songwriters. 

The tool's accuracy is 99.8%, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

​Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier says there has been “great interest” in the tool, and several companies have “already performed successful tests.” One such company is Sacem, the French management company that represents over 300,000 music creators and publishers, including David Guetta and DJ Snake.

​The company didn't provide pricing information or disclose which additional companies are interested in adopting the tool. A spokesperson told us that the cost varies based on the type of deal.

​There is increasing concern about AI companies using copyrighted material to train their models, as well as about methods being used to manipulate streaming systems and commit fraud. 

One instance of music streaming fraud occurred in 2024, when a North Carolina musician was charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with creating AI-generated songs and using bots to stream them billions of times, resulting in more than $10 million in stolen streaming royalties. Additionally, AI bands like The Velvet Sundown has gained millions of streams.

​Bandcamp recently got fed up and banned AI-generated music altogether, while Spotify has updated its policy to address the rise of AI tracks, clarifying when AI is used in music production, reducing spam, and explicitly stating that unauthorized voice clones are prohibited on the platform.

By contrast, major record labels have resolved lawsuits with Suno and Udio, appearing to embrace AI-generated music. Last fall, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group struck deals with these AI startups to license their music catalogs, ensuring artists and songwriters are compensated when their work is used to train AI models.

​In recent years, Deezer has taken significant steps to address concerns about AI-generated music. In 2024, it became the first music streaming platform to sign the global statement on AI training, joining actors Kate McKinnon, Kevin Bacon, Kit Harington, Rosie O'Donnell, and other notable creatives. 

​Hopefully, Deezer's latest decision to sell its detection tool will set a precedent for other music-streaming platforms to take similar actions to defend human artists and fight fraud.

This is 100% on point! For the past three years all of my in-office work was done on a ChromeBox running ChromeOS, I work in a contact center, but my specific project does not focus on customers but other stuff.At first I thought they did this because Chrome-anything is usually cheap, but the devices they give us are all around or above $1000, so now I think we use them only because the client wants us to use them, since on some other projects they do use Windows, but with this client we have A LOT of project and A LOT of work, so it's not like we're the exception.I think with the advent of SteamOS, ChromeOS and Android merging, we could legit see a serious move away from Windows, even in corporate worlds, but who knows, my vision could just be clouded, I'm not a genius or some smart person like a bunch of people here on HN, I work for basically a minimum salary (Portugal), live in a room, that the company that hires me, rents to me, and read HN mostly for entertainment.

Nope. The experience was just rubbish. Out of the box, the machine was incredibly slow. It would get warm to the touch while sitting idle, and the battery would die in about 45 minutes. I quickly figured out there was some HP audio process running all the time to do noise cancellation on input from the microphone. For some reason it was active all the time, and it needed about 30% of a core to do its thing. So I got rid of that. But windows explorer was still slow... of course, it was some HP antivirus rootkit program preinstalled doing who knows what. I spent hours clearing crap off that machine. Anything with HP in the name, to start. It probably would have been faster to reinstall windows completely, but I didn't want to do that from a hotel room over wifi.By the time I was done, it was ... ok. The machine still lagged when you opened programs for some reason. But the battery life went up to 3-4 hours, and it was fast enough I could get work done.I think about that laptop a lot. Imagine all the people who buy those laptops. What % will spend the hours it took to clear the crapware off them? I can easily imagine my mother buying a laptop like that and just assuming that's how fast computers are.I think this might be the #1 benefit for regular people to buying a mac.

When I saw it was still absolutely crap and unusable, I considered putting Linux on it, but didn't want to end up as support, so...Long story short, a clean install of Windws 11 was functional. Updates took forever and a day. The computer itself takes about 6-8 minutes to become usable on boot, but once everything is cached into RAM, it's usable.More usable initially than my work issued Dell (when I actually worked at Dell) that within a week I cloned and installed an SSD on, probably breaking all kinds of terminable policies. So,story time:I did some silly things in those 4 years there to bypass bureaucracy: Cloned my entire laptop into a VM to have a secondary method of accessing work stuff. Created an entire test lab using unauthorized disk cloning into VMs for remote access. Disabled auto updates by management software so PCs wouldn't be kicked off the network. Probably set off all kinds of alarms. Would occasionally reenable to keep VM authorized.The kicker is that I was recognized company-wide for creating something useful out of basically nothing but my time and curiosity. Got a bonus for it, on top of it.To your point, my 96GB DDR5 24-core desktop-replacement ""gaming"" laptop, when used regularly, with a decent amount of startup apps, still struggles to be responsive on boot.

The computer itself takes about 6-8 minutes to become usable on boot, but once everything is cached into RAM, it's usable.More usable initially than my work issued Dell (when I actually worked at Dell) that within a week I cloned and installed an SSD on, probably breaking all kinds of terminable policies. So,story time:I did some silly things in those 4 years there to bypass bureaucracy: Cloned my entire laptop into a VM to have a secondary method of accessing work stuff. Created an entire test lab using unauthorized disk cloning into VMs for remote access. Disabled auto updates by management software so PCs wouldn't be kicked off the network. Probably set off all kinds of alarms. Would occasionally reenable to keep VM authorized.The kicker is that I was recognized company-wide for creating something useful out of basically nothing but my time and curiosity. Got a bonus for it, on top of it.To your point, my 96GB DDR5 24-core desktop-replacement ""gaming"" laptop, when used regularly, with a decent amount of startup apps, still struggles to be responsive on boot.

Also, if I'm going to have to adjust anything to use an operating system, I might as well use Linux. The only value prop for me to use Windows was gaming, but at this point I'm just completely ripping the band-aid off because it doesn't seem like Microsoft is going in a better direction.

I disagree.

I've since changed jobs, and I've seen a decay in the baseline of the OS over the last 6 years.

I know you're getting hammered on this, but this is also an indicting statement. If your brand-new OS requires you to have endpoint management that locks it down so much that it affects how long it takes to open files, that's on the OS, not the endpoint management.Okay, it's on both... endpoint management as a rule is horribly written software, which is shocking knowing how intrusive it is into the system.  But, if the OS has so many vulnerabilities that you're required to have endpoint management, that's not a good look on the OS.My current and former $JOB both required endpoint management on Macs (and a limited amount for folks who used Linux), so it's not a blanket statement. But the impact of the endpoint software on Mac and Linux were still much lower. That is, once I figured out that a certain (redundant) enterprise firewall was crashing my work Mac anytime I plugged in a USB network adapter.

Unrealengine taking 40 extra gigs because of underutilization on small files is one rampant case.Large python project disk ballooning is another.That it's file copy move is also dramatically bad at handling such scenarios compounds this further as can be seen by shuffling the same lot with teracopy vs explorer and windows default behavior irrespective of drive formatting.

A lot of my beef, personally, can be chalked up to Windows' aggressively long animation times. It's serviceable with them turned off. But even with animations turned off on an aggressively debloated consumer PC there is either a notable delay or a perception thereof in context menus and file explorer that did not exist with Windows 10, or on my Linux machines.

reply

I turned on hiding the taskbar the other day. I don't think they've changed it since Windows 95. I have a modern gaming laptop, and the animation is purely linear, no acceleration. It feels so weirdly unnatural. Even worse, it's not smoothly animated! I have a 120Hz monitor but it seems to be animated at 5fps.Nobody on the Windows team seems to give a single shit at all.

So I wouldn't assume they've only used Windows. FWIW I also primarily use Windows 11 currently, but have also used other OS'es. I've experienced frustrations with all of them. Just because it's fast for you doesn't mean it's fast for everyone, and vice-versa. I could certainly buy that more people are having problems with 11 than they did with 10, though it hasn't been my personal experience. Just saying we shouldn't assume our own experiences are universal.

I had the same issue with a loan machine from a client, super responsive onsite, but once I connected through a VPN from an external network, all the basic functionality in the file manager was brought to a halt. Even something as simple as right click on a folder to show a context menu would take several seconds.The files were all local (also with Onedrive sync disabled) so I am almost positive it was whatever they were using for endpoint protection (Can't recall 100% but probably something from CrowdStrike).

What I've seen as an older-than-average developer is that the Agile movement has made it increasingly difficult to make time for paying attention to some of the more subtle aspects of user experience such as performance. Because I can't predict how much work it will be accurately enough to assign story points to the task, and that means that this kind of work frequently results in a black spot on our team performance metrics.CD makes it even harder because this kind of work really does need some time to bake. Fast iterations don't leave much time to verify that performance-oriented changes have the intended effect and no adverse side effects prior to release.

Started a new job about a year and a half ago and got a powerful laptop with a really top of the line CPU and GPU, 64 GB of RAM (Now upgraded to 96GB, needed for my work, even with these specs compile times are longer than I'd like...), and it was a terrible experience, coming from someone who's used to Linux having used it for a bit (started in 2013 with Ubuntu with a dual boot. Moved all-in to Arch in 2016, distro-hopped or played with different desktop enviroments/wms after that (Recently switched to niri), but all of which are leagues ahead of Windows 11 IMO. Only occasionally ran Windows on a spare device or a VM on the rare occasion I needed to, eg for work / school.)Tons of issues, slow in some operations, weird bugs (in the explorer like you, or with my Bluetooth headphones, or other issues), and even occasional blue screens! It's not just my setup too, my coworkers have similar issues. Plus, it just isn't a nice environment to use.At first, I tried to set up a nicer environment (as much as IT would allow). I installed PowerToys for QOL improvements, GlazeWM to emulate a tiling window manager setup, I tried debloating as much as I can, I installed Wezterm for my terminal (Why is Windows Terminal so hyped up? It seems like an extremely basic terminal emulator to me...), oh-my-posh theming for my shell, and several other things.But every convenience program I added just noticeably slowed down my laptop, to the point I just gave up some of the niceties and lived with it. Why is such basic functionality able to be run so smoothly on a much weaker device on Linux, but struggle on Windows on a much more powerful device? I can only think of one reason...

At work we use clownstrike for our driving-around-with-the-handbrake-on needs, which I have installed on both Linux and Windows, and the former flies while the latter lags all the time (I dual boot, so it's the same exact hardware). Doing something which is fully equivalent, like installing an IntelliJ update takes around a minute on Linux and many more on Windows.The fan also comes on much more often on Windows than Linux, even though most of my job is done on remote servers via SSH. Under Linux I only hear the fan when I compile something. This morning I booted windows and the fan was running constantly while I was just catching up with a few mails in outlook.

Task manager takes 10 seconds to load the list of processes.  
Right-click on the desktop takes about 1.5-2 seconds to show the 'new' context menu.  
Start menu is actually fast to start drawing but has a stupid animation that takes about half a second to fully load.I sort of understand how the anti-consumer 'features' (ads) get added to a piece of software.

Video decoding has always been a brutal workload, but that isn't Microsoft's fault. I had to replace my Thinkpad X220 with an X270 for no reason at all except h.265. It's a ULV i5 too, so the perf is almost identical to the old laptop's... until you watch video on it.

Some of the Windows 11 features are laughably, hilariously slow. If I enter anything in the taskbar search, it will take a solid 6-7 seconds for the app to appear in the result. The result window will just be blank. If I press enter after having typed in, the app will start - but still, it is so, so laggy.And some weird flicker when running certain applications. It was like that out of the box, and I feared I had gotten a defective screen - nope, only certain apps.

If you wife would be OK with ChromeOS, basically all she needs is a browser. I just installed Linux on the computer my wife is using. For a while she was on Ubuntu and then once she got used to it, I replaced Ubuntu with Debian (because I use Debian everywhere: NUCs, laptop, dekstops, servers, hypervisor (Proxmox, which is debian), etc.). It's easier for me to just slap Debian everywhere but YMMV.People have no idea the amount of people who nowadays only need a browser (and working sound/microphone: but that nowadays Just Works [TM] on Linux).It's never been easier to switch people to Linux than it is today.

The machine I had before this one had 2 GB of RAM and I ran Windows 7 on it. It had a Core 2 Duo E6420 CPU and GeForce 9800 GTX+. I remember things being mostly ok for playing a bunch of games back then but struggled when I tried to run VMs which makes sense given 2 GB of RAM.It was that machine that taught me not to skimp on RAM. The last few years of that machine's life started to get pressured pretty hard with memory requirements and having 4 GB would have solved all of those problems. That's why when I built this machine I went with 16 GB, back in 2014 still running Windows 7.

Otherwise, double clicking zip opens the explorer.exe.

I purchased a Surface Pro at one point, with the intention of using it for sketches and using Windows on it, thinking it'll be better because the hardware and OS is from the same organization. Nope! Slow out of the box, horrible thermal management and software bugs galore. Installed Arch with Gnome on it, ran better in most aspects. However, pen usage and touchscreen even after I tried my best to adjust it was worse than Windows, I guess they won there.I didn't use to hate Windows, because at least it wasn't utterly broken, just stupid, but they're really in a deep decline lately. Maybe it's time for one of those ""stop the press"" type of moments where they have to stop, take a serious look and fix what they have as it currently feels impossible to use reliably.

So much this. People like to moan about ""oh game XYZ doesn't run so it's not reasonable for gaming"". More games run on GNU / Linux than any gaming console. There are simply too many games that do run to give a second thought about the ones that don't, and it's been that way for years.

  > It was because it was fun

I agree. But I think there are a lot of fun games. Plenty of them on Linux.  > it was part of the cultural zeitgeist

This is the harder part, but we are in an age where there are a lot of games. I think you'll be surprised to see the games that do work on Linux[0]. Looking at the most played multiplayer games on Steam[1] (in order): (1) Counterstrike, (2) Dota 2, (3) Arc Raiders, (5) Terraria, (8) Grand Theft Auto, and (9) Marvel Rivals all have good proton support. What doesn't work in the top 10 are (4) PUBG, (6) Bongo Cat, and (10) EA Sports FC 26. (7) Rust supposedly works, but only on Linux supported servers (smaller user base).  > it's popular,

The point I'm making here is that while you may not get to be part of every cultural zeitgeist, you can still participate in the 3 most popular ones and more than half of the top 10. Frankly, most people won't be able to participate in every zeitgeist for any number of reasons (cost, hardware, restrictions, etc). But I think considering this you don't have to fear being left out.Maybe you're obsessed with PUBG or Battlefield and then yeah, Linux isn't going to work for you. That's okay! But looking at the numbers, for most people, they can still be a part of all the cultural excitement. It's not going to work for everyone, and that's okay! If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you. But I want to make sure we can distinguish real blockers from ones Microslop and EA want you to believe in.  > the community is fun

I think this is less of a blocker than you might think. Honestly, in my experience smaller communities tend to be more fun. They develop their own close knit culture. You've been on HN a long time and seen it grow. Isn't that a similar reason you come here?  > You can't really replace something like that with just ""another game,"" no matter how fun the other game is.

You're right, but again, I think there are fewer blockers than you think. I can't tell you if those blockers are real or not because what is a blocker comes down to you and your personal interpretations of all those variables. But if you're frustrated with Windows and the system, why not give it a try? You don't even have to switch to Linux to pressure the studios to change.

  > it's popular,

The point I'm making here is that while you may not get to be part of every cultural zeitgeist, you can still participate in the 3 most popular ones and more than half of the top 10. Frankly, most people won't be able to participate in every zeitgeist for any number of reasons (cost, hardware, restrictions, etc). But I think considering this you don't have to fear being left out.Maybe you're obsessed with PUBG or Battlefield and then yeah, Linux isn't going to work for you. That's okay! But looking at the numbers, for most people, they can still be a part of all the cultural excitement. It's not going to work for everyone, and that's okay! If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you. But I want to make sure we can distinguish real blockers from ones Microslop and EA want you to believe in.  > the community is fun

I think this is less of a blocker than you might think. Honestly, in my experience smaller communities tend to be more fun. They develop their own close knit culture. You've been on HN a long time and seen it grow. Isn't that a similar reason you come here?  > You can't really replace something like that with just ""another game,"" no matter how fun the other game is.

You're right, but again, I think there are fewer blockers than you think. I can't tell you if those blockers are real or not because what is a blocker comes down to you and your personal interpretations of all those variables. But if you're frustrated with Windows and the system, why not give it a try? You don't even have to switch to Linux to pressure the studios to change. Just spending more time playing games like Counterstrike or Arc Raiders than games like PUBG or Battlefield. And if you play more games like the former you make it easier for others that are thinking about making the jump. But hey, if PUBG or Battlefield is your jam and you don't want to try anything else, then no worries. You do you.There's one more important thing I want to bring up.

Note that this is skipping over some extremely popular games which aren't on Steam. Notably Fortnite, Roblox, League of Legends, Valorant, and everything else from Riot Games, none of which work on Linux. From the Steam examples there's also some grey areas, GTA5 singleplayer works but multiplayer does not, and Counterstrike works on official servers but not on Faceit servers, where a lot of serious competitive play happens.

The costs of switching can only be answered at the individual level. No one can answer for you. But people can state their experiences and help you understand the costs and benefits.Let's make sure we can accurately understand the costs and benefits and differentiate from imaginary ones.I also said that you can take a stand without switching to Linux. Maybe the costs are too high for you right now. But maybe the costs of meeting up with your friends to play Dota rather than League is easy. At the end of the day the costs are due to the network effects. You can reduce those costs slowly and make it easier for others to jump ship without you needing to, which makes it easier for you to jump ship in the future if things change. The same is true for social media. Maybe you can't break from Instagram as you have too many contacts where that's your only way to communicate with them. But you can still encourage others to text you, Signal message you, or whatever. This still reduces the power of that network.Here's the thing: the less sticky platforms are the better it is for everyone. I'm not going to tell you that you aren't going to have to put in more effort, but I will criticize you if you think that effort is insurmountable. I will also say that this is also part of our social duty. If something like using Signal instead of Instagram to communicate with your friend because they want to is ""too hard"" for you, then I envy the life you have where such trivial actions are your biggest concerns. If trying new games with friends who want to try new games is ""too much"" for you, then I think you should question if you're an addict.I'm not saying you have to switch. I'm not saying you have to play certain games and not others. But you do have to be open to changing things and recognize that if you don't then you're creating a doomed self-fulfilling prophecy. If you're unwilling to have the slightest inconveniences then the enshitification and dystopia is on you. If you are unwilling to have the slightest inconveniences then you have no right to complain as you are the one preventing that change. But also, if you don't have any of those concerns of enshitification and tech dystopia then you have every right to stand your ground and not be inconvenienced. But I want to make the conditions clear. We live in a society. The society has a duty to you and you have a duty to the society. You don't just get to take and give nothing back.

> It's unfortunate but at the same time if enough people switch to Linux then they'll be forced to change their ways.The whole point of this subthread is that companies are not going to make Linux compatible games as long as there are customers OK with installing root kits on their companies to play their games. And most gamers are ok with that line being crossed. It sucks for the rest of us, but capitalism gonna capitalism.

Indeed! i have some online and irl buddies who aren't on linux that i've got playing games like veloren with me, simply because they are good games. i've got loads of hours in games like veloren, luanti, xonotic, pokeMMO, and osu! for example lol and encourage everyone to check those games out if they're up their alley. :)

So this ends up being easier said than done. I've had success, but that's my friend group out of however many.Try to find a shooter with a playerbase that doesn't use EAC/etc. - it's a crapshoot, unfortunately. You've got Valve's stuff and one or two outliers, but if those don't meet your group's genre needs, you're whomped.

Besides, more likely is that I leave to do my own thing, 0-1 peers joins me for a bit, then we all kinda drift away. Friendships in this era are much more ephemeral.

reply

Honestly, I'm disheartened to hear this. Frankly, those don't sound like friends, or at least close friends. If a friendship can evaporate by the simple act of wanting to try another game, then it barely seems like a friendship and it seems like those will evaporate as soon as the next popular game comes about. I don't want to tell you to abandon your existing friends but I would encourage you to find friends you can have stronger bonds with. To have closer relationships. Hard truth is you need to put in work to make this happen. It doesn't matter what games you play or on what platform: everyone deserves to have deep human relationships. I really do hope you can find some friends. I hope the friendships you do have are stronger than you have conveyed because frankly, as humans, we all need close friends.

I've had long conversations with some former guild mates yet can't point you to a name or face. I know quite a few never even lived in my country.  But things loosen up once the game shuts down or one of us needs to move on. It's neat in some ways, hollow in others.On the larger scale, it's why local community is also weaker than ever. No one really puts and effort to come down to community events,  or they may come once or twice and never again. Those gatherings are also less frequent than ever, often once a month. You can't really form a deep bond meeting once a month. So meetups end up frustrating in their own way (at least, the tech meetup.  Maybe a run club would be different).I've even heard notions that it's easier to find a mate than a close friend these days. I can completely believe it.

The other thing is recognize where friendships came from. Most of it was just being physically near people. Sitting in the same classrooms day to day. If work doesn't create that space (or isn't good enough or you want to distance from work) you need something else that does the same thing. Join a club. Set up weekly beers with your friends. Or literally anything that puts you in the same physical space with the same people, routinely. A friend of mine gets together with his gamer friends once a year and they socialize off the game too.The convenience of social media is also its weakness. The ease of connecting makes it just as easy to disconnect.Real friendships require work. That's true of any relationship. I'll tell you my friends can be annoying and exhausting, but I love them and I'll gladly put up with their shit to keep them around. After all, who else is going to put up with my bullshit? lol

indeed. Perhaps that is part of my frustration. Friendships can also be a 2 way street, and it can feel like I'm putting in a lot more effort than the other party when it comes to trying to form them. I don't expect 50/50 effort, but when it's 95/5, are they a friend or simply a familiar guest?Maybe I need to accept that the tech circles here aren't going to have that deep bond and expand. But I'll admit that the job hunt also slowed down my efforts to  break out of my comfort zone.

What works for me is finding communities. I participate in Toastmasters, which meets every week (one meets twice a month), and it's a good way to make connections with people and get to know them better. It's also fun because there's people of many walks of life. Retirees, college students, business owners, executives, everyone in between. It's a great way to meet people I probably wouldn't have otherwise met in tech circles.

i only do this for those couple of games i play with friends that won't support linux because of the aforementioned rootkit it wants to run on windows machines. console for those games, and all my other games run happily either through steam+proton or natively on linux, and there are a fair few FOSS games with amazing multiplayer. i love luanti, xonotic, openarena, veloren, etc, and play them frequently with some friends. :)

  > but requires custom Proton, some tweaked settings, launch options, etc

I was not shocked that that top comment mentioned they used Claude because the config line is dumb.The line is  PROTON_DISABLE_D3D12=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=1 %command% -force-d3d11

Here's what they mean  PROTON_DISABLE_D3D12: Disables DirectX12
    There are also D3D11, D3D10, D3D9 options too 
  PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=1: Tells the game you have an AMD GPU instead of Nvidia
    The default setting is that Proton hides the GPU, so this option here is superfluous. 
  -force-d3d11: forces usage of DirectX11
    This is already going to happen because you disabled DirectX12

Here is the sane equivalent line  PROTON_DISABLE_D3D12=1 %command%
      Alternatively
  %command% -force-d3d11

It's more that there's no sensible way they could do it even if they wanted to. Emulating the Windows kernel internals is well beyond the scope of what WINE is trying to do, and even if they did do it, there would be no way for the anticheat vendors to tell the difference between the AC module being sandboxed for compatibility versus sandboxed as a bypass technique. Trying to subvert the AC in any way is just begging to get banned, even if it's for beingn reasons.

reply

There seems to be too many layers and variables to ever get to the bottom of it. Is it the distro itself? Is it a Wayland vs. X11 thing? Is it the driver? The Proton version? Some G-SYNC thing? Some specific tweak that games based on this game engine needs?

I'm sure that it must be possible to replicate whatever optimisations SteamOS has on other distros, but unfortunately I am not sure what those are exactly.

Yes, most likely. Without a compositor I get lots of stuttering on x11, whereas KDE and GNOME's wayland sessions are both buttery smooth out of the box.Might be my Nvidia GPU, but I've never gotten x11 to work flawlessly for gaming.

Might be my Nvidia GPU, but I've never gotten x11 to work flawlessly for gaming.

reply

Weird. I don't use KDE's compositor, and -AFAIK- WindowMaker doesn't have one. When in either KDE or in WindowMaker I don't have stuttering with either fullscreen, borderless ""fullscreen"", or windowed games... everything is as smooth as it is in Windows. Having said that, I do know that -when using KDE- some fullscreen games get jittery as all shit if a notification pops up and remain that way until the notification disappears. I expect that that performance problem would go away if I was using the compositor... but I don't want to spend the VRAM on it.I use AMD graphics cards, so it might be an Nvidia thing that you're seeing. It also might be a ""Your Linux distro simply stopped shipping good xorg installs"" thing. I'm running Gentoo Linux which continues to ship updated versions of xorg and supporting software. [0][0] I've heard people running Debian and Debian-derived distros report X11 behavior that absolutely does not match what I've been seeing for years... so some percentage of the ""X11 can't do $THING"" when it really, really can must be coming from distros that ship either dramatically out-of-date or severely crippled xorg installs.

I switched my Gentoo box from X11 to Wayland three years ago at this point.It's shocking that people still install X11 as a default in 2026 except with very old hardware.

Yea these are security updates but the eco system requires a lot of desktop manager scaffolding in user space. That has basically stopped. It's baffling why you would run X11 today. The X11 emulation layer for Wayland works great too by the way.Just as one example when you screen share from discord or zoom or Google meets there's now a pop-up that asks you to select the screen or window you wish to latch on to for streaming. This provides some security. With X11 anything can just take a screenshot at any time. Sure that's convenient but so many apps don't even support X11 anymore. As someone that made the switch three years ago I get how you might think the old system is better but in reality you haven't tried the new one so you don't really have a way to compare. I noticed so many quality of life fixes that I can't even imagine running X11 anymore.

> Sure that's convenient but so many apps don't even support X11 anymore.Really? If true, I don't seem to run any of them. I've certainly not noticed anything I've been running over the past couple of decades suddenly stop working on X11. Given that QT, GTK, FTLK, and other cross-platform GUI toolkits support X11, these must be particularly special programs.> Just as one example[, screensharing...]Sure, it is a bit nicer to be able to control which windows which other programs can see. I've been watching the slow-moving, many-years-long shitstorm that has been ""actually get screensharing that works the way ordinary people need it to"". It's been quite a show.Thing is, I do know that the X Access Control Extension was standardized in ~2006 and updated through 2009 with the aim to make additional fine-grained access control modules [0] easy. I don't know how long it would have taken to use what existed (or even write something new) and update the major Desktop Environments with tooling to manage it... but I suspect it would have taken far less than seventeen years.> I noticed so many quality of life fixes...I'm sure that were I 16, I'd believe that I cared very much about that. Now, -mumble decades later- the fanciest things I want are OpenGL and Vulkan support with performance at least on par with what you get from Windows, a window manager that lets me Alt+mouse-button to move or resize a window, functioning global hotkeys that I can command to run arbitrary programs (and that I can permit any arbitrary program to hook into... permanently), and functioning screen-sharing (that can I can permit any arbitrary program to hook into... permanently). And it's so, so silly for me to feel the need to mention anything other than Alt+mouse-button. You'd think that the rest would be ""table stakes"", but the Wayland development process has demonstrated that many folks disagree.[0] Ones that could -for instance- prevent undesired keyloggers and screenshot tools

Just basic stuff wayland has that X11 will never have:- No screen tearing by default
- Proper vsync
- Lower latency for input → display
- Per-monitor refresh rates (144Hz + 60Hz works correctly)
- Fractional scaling is actually correct (no blurry hacks)Seriously, move on.

I mean, several of the major anticheats can be configured to work just fine on Linux. [0] It's up to the game dev whether or not it's permitted. So, yeah, unless the game is one where its dev makes huge blog posts about how ""advanced"" its anti-cheat is (like Valorant or the very latest CoD/Battlefield games) it's quite likely that multiplayer games will work just fine on Linux.And if they don't, and the faulty game is a new purchase on Steam, then ask for a refund and tell them that the game doesn't work with your OS. Easy, peasy.[0] I have 100% solid, personal knowledge that Easy Anti Cheat can work on Linux. On Linux, I play THE FINALS, Elden Ring, and a couple of other EAC-""protected"" games without any troubles. I have perhaps-unreliable memories that at least one of the games I play uses Denuvo, which is only sometimes used as anti-cheat but does use many of the same techniques as kernel-mode anticheat.

That's no secret, but the catch is that the Linux version is much, much easier to bypass. That's why some developers choose not to enable it, or in the case of Apex Legends, enabled it but later backtracked and disabled it again.

That's an excuse. It's mostly incompetence or more often than not the company doesn't think it's worth the effort. With more Linux users, the balance will eventually shift from ""fuck them"" to ""we have to figure out a way"".

This. The corollary is also that people take the such quips way too literally.I, personally, don't play that many games, and those that I do play tend to run faster on Linux (with an AMD GPU, which I bought specifically to avoid nvidia headaches).But I still game on Windows. Why? Because I still have a Windows box, ""because Linux is not reasonable for photo editing"". I actually daily drive Linux, but I can't be assed to move from Lightroom and photoshop, so I still keep a windows pc under my desk. I just play games on it because it's much beefier than my 5 yo ryzen U laptop, and since I don't interact with that box all that much, I didn't feel like partitioning my smallish drive for no tangible benefit. My laptop is more than enough for all my other needs.

In many ways, moving to Linux is like starting to live on your own. Your mommy might be a better cook than you, but is that a good enough reason to keep living in your parents' basement?

Win insists on bootlocker/secure boot, meanwhile most of the Linux doesn't boot with it or you have to go though hell and back to install unsigned drivers (nvidia, gentle-yall).I'd all say that Linux is like living in a car with 0 euros and saving up for a house. Simple user can scrape by, but mowing dev work life to Linux is much harder than to Mac. VPNs, inconsistent distro support for weird work stuff and such will make you spend days to weeks of unpaid overtime to get comfortable

Can you elaborate on this?For example, it was convoluted getting StarCraft 2 to run. Then it did eventually work, though it felt ever so slightly laggy.Anno 1800 ran though it occasionally slowed way down, occasionally crashed, and multiplayer never worked.Hogwart's Legacy ran but crashed, and ran massively slower / lower quality settings than on the same hardware but in Windows.All of those were not binary ""runs / doesn't"".

How do you fix this? I dont know - most of these are the developers refusing support because of anticheat or just support overload, but it's insane to suggest that linux works for gaming when the most played games in the world straight up do not work.

I have an Nvidia card and use mostly Ubuntu (mate), also for gaming. It's even a problem now, because I would benefit from a hard divide between the gaming and working\studying system (I have a gaming user in backlog).
On Linux it's mostly KSP, Factorio, but sometimes DeepRockGalactic, Valheim, Euro Truck Sim or Warhammer: Total War1\2\3. These games work flawlessly or with <10%fps hit.There are games that kind of work - Ancestors: Humankind Odyssey, Cyberpunk, Hunt: Showdown. But you lose comfort and I'd rather just play them on Windows, than suffer decreased functionality on Linux. I know that some of it (definitely Cyberpunk) is only because of NVIDIA.When buying games I usually don't buy Windows only games unless there is a very good reason. And I quit League of Legends and WRC rally because of anti cheat scam. I feel scammed after putting lot of money in a game and suddenly losing the ability to play it.

Comeon. If a customer bought a game that says it runs on linux, they should be able to play it on linux well, not just launch it and quit within 5 mins.I get you have the ideology up in your head, but don't lie and embellish linux to this degree. The attitude just turns people off.

None of those games say they run on Linux.  - Starcraft 2 is available for windows/mac: https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/

The fact that you can play most games on Linux these days is due to the Wine developers, Valve, and CodeWeavers. But those efforts are completely unrelated to the developers of those three games. Buying Starcraft 2 is not, in any way, purchasing a Linux game or transferring money to anyone working on Linux support.Every game I've purchased that actually says it runs on Linux, has worked beautifully on Linux (stellaris and factorio come to mind). Most windows games work beautifully on Linux too, but Blizzard isn't lifting any fingers to make it that way.

Though any kind of documentation is like Linux, scattered and inconsistent. And I'm ""OK"" with that, as in I think the way that Linux came to be and is maintained, and provides user choice is also the reason why it's not ""user-friendly"" in every scenario. You can choose your distribution, and a lot of other things. And then look in a wide variety of places for bug reports, user questions, etc. You'll get a variety of answers from ""it just works for me"" to ""change your distribution that you chose"" to ""even though some guides say to use Lutris, it's easier to just put it in Steam's external program launcher and choose Proton version x.yz.""Even then, not everything will work because it wasn't written to work (for Linux). It was written to work for Windows, and then some smart people rolled up their sleeves and found ways to make a great many things work for Linux, and it's all amazing. And I find using Linux (mostly) quite pleasant. But when things don't work... there's going to be friction. It will take user effort to find a solution, or a solution might not be found.And for me personally, being someone who really likes to poke and customize and do things my way, Linux is a blessing and a curse, because I can guarantee I'll hit ""weird edge cases"" like trying to use the online multiplayer part of a game instead of just single player, or try to use my laptop's brightness controls, but they don't work, or I'll want fractional scaling to work, but it won't. And maybe there's a fix out there, or maybe not. Fixes like ""it works for me"" or ""change your distribution"", though, are non-fixes. They just frustrate people. If changing my distribution fixes an issue, how many new issues does it create for me?

It's so weird to me that people just allow this, or even defend it. Game companies should be legally obligated to scale human moderation and curation of multiplayer games, and if you're paying for service that gets moderated and curated, there should be some legal expectation of process - a requirement that the service provider lay out a specific ""due process"" framework, even if it ends up mediated, that gives a customer legal recourse. Instead, they try to automate everything, which has notoriously indiscriminate collateral damage with no recourse.If you pour significant chunk of your private time and money into a game, you should be entitled to not arbitrarily lose an account or gameplay progress because some poorly configured naive Bayes classifier decided you did something wrong, without corresponding evidence or recourse to undo bad bans.For some reason companies are entitled to infinitely expand their reach without concurrently expanding their responsibilities in providing service to individuals. Must be nice.

Then (if you were going about this the legal way) you'd have to call the microsoft number to register your install, but be on hold for another 30 minutes. Then it was multiple hours of install your favorite video player, reboot. Install video codecs, reboot. Install firefox, reboot. Apply all of your registry tweaks, reboot. Install all your games from CD-ROM, more rebooting. And multiple hours of that.I moved to linux back in 2006 or so and never looked back.

This seems to be a relatively consistent discussion surrounding AUR helper development; for example, adding UX to incentivise users to read PKGBUILDs, lest the AUR becomes an attractive vector for skids.No one wants the AUR to become NPM, and the thing that will incentivise that is uneducated users. Having the small barrier of not having helpers in the main repos is an effective way of accomplishing that.

reply

AUR helpers like yay are not supported officially. The other commenter sheds some light as to why.

reply

If users mental model is mostly ""yay is like pacman but can also install packages from AUR the same way"" wihout thinking deeper about the difference then I think it using it is very risky and that you should just stick to pacman + git/makepkg. Only consider helpers once that's become second nature and routine. Telling people to ""just yay install"" is doing them a disservice. An upgrade breaking the system isn't even that bad compared to getting infected with malware due to an old package you were using being orphaned and hijacked to spread malware or getting a bad copycat version due to a typo.I think EndeavourOS is doing users a disservice if they provide sth like yay preinstalled and ready to use out of the box. It isn't installing packages from a shared repo: It's downloading code from arbitrary locations and running it on your machine in order to produce a package. Being able to read and understand shell script (PKGBUILD) is kind of a prerequisite to using it safely.

Regarding why Arch doesn't ""invest"" in a graphical installer, it's worth mentioning that Arch's installation image has a different design philosophy than most installation media.The image is a fully functional arch environment that copies the entirety of its contents to RAM on boot, giving you special installation opportunities such as the ability to install Arch to the same flash drive that booted the installer. Having no graphical dependencies lets this image remain small enough to pull this off, as well as allowing for fully remote installations over SSH out of the box, since archinstall is a TUI.

I don't have a way to quickly around to check, but I thought the arch install media used squashfs? In which case I wouldn't have thought it was safe to blow away the backing store.

I'd direct them to something like Bazzite (Immutable), or CachyOS for staying arch-based but providing a GUI installer and tools, Endeavor OS, even Fedora, etc.

  > idk why Arch doesn't invest in whats standard in every other major distro

Because its supposed to be stripped down. To serve as a base to create things like Endeavour, Manjaro, or Cachy.There's still a lot of utility to doing things the hard way. I do suggest people that want to actually learn Linux install Arch and live in the terminal. You learn a lot very fast because you're forced to. But it's not for everyone and that's totally okay too. That's the beauty of Linux after all. That's the beauty of computing. You can't build a product for everyone but you can build an environment that can become what anyone needs.But I'll second your point. I've been on Endeavour on my main machine for about 3-4 years now and only had one problem where I just got a mismatch in a new kernel and new Nvidia driver so I couldn't load the desktop. Easy rollback (from the cache) and a day or two later the issue was solved so I could upgrade without a problem. Took no more than 10 minutes to solve and that's the worst problem I've had the entire time. I will also give the advice that if you have an Nvidia card give your boot partition like 5GB instead of 1GB

I think this is an important thing to recognize. It's exactly why I tell people that want to learn Linux to do it (but not people who want to use Linux). The struggle is real, but the struggle is part of the learning process. The truth is that distros are not that different from one another. The main difference is in the package manager and the release schedule of their package databases.I'd also like to tell any Linux newbies, the Arch Wiki is your best friend. It doesn't matter if you're using Ubuntu, Mint, or whatever. The Arch Wiki is still usually the second place I go to for when I need help. The first is the man pages (while there's some bad documentation out there it is quite surprising how well most man pages are written. Linux really has shown me the power and importance of writing good documentation)

I actually tried Fedora first (thinking dev-first workflows) but ended up switching to Ubuntu w/x11 for gaming. A lot of that had to do with Fedora's release schedule (rather than Ubuntu's 2-year LTS) breaking working GOG/steam/wine-based apps on a rotating basis. Since switching to a defaults lifestyle / Ubuntu with x11 I deal with NVIDIA driver compatibility issues every 6 months or so instead of once/month. The 22 -> 24 upgrade was better than I expected and I didn't lose more than a couple of hours of life to appease the shell gods.In any case Fedora and a once/month problem would still beat the Windows update nonsense, which I am still supporting since my spouse hasn't switched yet :/

Trust me it was far more involved of a process 10 years ago, and that's why people liked it.The modern install process is paired down to something like 10 steps. Start the ISO, configure your partitions, mount your root and boot, and use the delightful arch-chroot tool to enter and install in those partitions. Set up your user, configure your boot manager, exit the chroot, reboot, remove the install media, and boot into your bare bones system.The install ISO has all the networking drivers and other tools you may need to bootstrap your new install, you just need to remember to do it. It's obviously not for total newbies but it's no gentoo, lfs, or even old arch.

I had bad experiences with Arch before because of Manjaro, but in hindsight, I think the main issues I had were more to do with how Pacman can get insanely nuanced. When you update packages you have to know what you're doing, it will update all weird, its not like Debian or Ubuntu upgrades where it installs / uninstalls what you do and don't need unless you tell it to be that nuanced.

From my own experience: 15 years ago, when (except for academia), Linux was very nisje, it was hard to use it. Random rare errors would pop up. On Windows you would know someone who knew what to do, but with Linux? So I chose Ubuntu, because it had the most support. Solution to any error could be found on askubuntu (?) forums. But if you had a friend, you would choose his system and get help from him. I once had university admins very happy to help me with something and even give me some tips.Nowadays it really doesn't matter that much, other than extra easy (with an LLM everything is already easy) installation of drivers (POP os?)/initial programs you used on Windows (on Mate it takes 10min due to a special GUI appstore).BUT there are reasons to switch. Like Ubuntu's pushing of very annoying snaps, making it very hard to get Firefox without a snap. Snaps are annoying, because they don't have a cleaning mechanism and old versions just clog your hard drive. They take forever to launch and it's just not a good idea for a browser. Don't mind snaps for other things.
There is also Desktop Environment support and support for hidpi monitors and such.Other than that, there is a little of philosophy. Like super FOSS and idealistic like Debian (i guess? Pls correct me if I'm wrong). Or more business aligned, like Redhat/Fedora.

Simplicity, among other reasons. Installers force the users hand and need maintenance. Having no installer but rather a detailed installation guide offers unlimited freedom to users. Installation isn't difficult either, you just pacstrap a root filesystem and configure the bootloader, mounts and locale.ArchLinux does now have an installer called archinstall, but it's described more as a library than a tool. It allows you to automate the installation using profiles.

Nowadays, there are so many ways to partition the drive (lvm, luks, either one on top of the other; zfs with native encryption or through dm-crypt), having the efi boot directly a unified kernel image or fiddle with some bootloader (among a plethora of options)...One of the principal reasons why I love Arch is being able to have a say in some of these base matters, and would hate to have to fight the installer to attain my goals. I remember when Ubuntu supported root on zfs but the installer didn't it was rather involved to get the install going. All it takes with Arch is to spend a few minutes reading the wiki and you're off to the races. The actual installation part is trivial.But then again, if you have no idea what you want to do, staring at the freshly-booted install disk prompt can be daunting. Bonus points for it requiring internet for installation. I would have to look up the correct incantation to get the wifi connected on a newer PC with no wired ethernet, and I've been using the thing for a very long time.

If you have a modified config file, it puts the new default one in a .pacnew file for you to compare, which seems strictly better to just deleting the new default one.

reply

Anyway I think the discussion boils down to semantics. ArchLinux is not ""unstable"" in the sense that it is prone to breaking. But it also delivers none of the stability promises that stable release distros or rolling release distros with snapshotting and testing like OpenSUSE Tumbleweed deliver. To call ArchLinux stable would make every distribution stable, and the word would lose all meaning.Most distributions promise that an upgrade always results in a working system. Instead moving the manual maintenance to major release upgrades.

This is just nonsense, pacman doesn't do this. If you'd modified a config file, it will create a .pacnew version instead of replacing it. Otherwise you'll get the default config synced with the version of the software you've installed, which is desirable.It's pretty rare to modify any config files outside of ~/.config these days anyway. What few modifications I have at the system level are for things like mkinitcpio, locale, etc and they never change.

reply

Can you elaborate on the chain of thought here? The small changes at high frequency means that something is nearly constantly in a <CHANGED> state, quite opposite from stable. Rolling release typically means that updates are not really snapshotted, therefore unless one does pull updates constantly they risk pulling a set of incompatible updates. Again, quite different from stable.

reply

I think there are advantages to both, but I will say that I've found modern Arch to be quite good. The other huge benefit of Arch is the general skill level present in the user base and openness of the forums; when something breaks it's usually easy to google ""arch + package name broken"" and immediately find a forum thread with a real fix.I don't think I'd use Arch for a corporate production server for change management reasons alone, but for a home desktop and my home server, it's actually the distribution that's required me to do the _least_ ""Linux crap"" to keep it going.

I thought you were talking about Windows there. There are 4 (5?) different UI paradigms within Windows, and doing one thing sometimes requires you to interact with each of them.At least on Linux, with GTK/KDE, you can pick a camp and have a somewhat consistent experience, with a few outliers. Plus many apps now just use CSD and fully integrate their designs to the window, so it's hopeless to have every window styling be consistent.I never had to mind X vs Wayland when starting user applications tho.

Yes, there are many UI implementations in Windows but they are almost totally transparent to the user (no pun intended), and they can all run on the same system at once.

reply

Just like Linux. You can run most if not all apps in any DE. Yes gnome will look ugly, but that's gnome's way of doing things. If you pick a decent DE, you will have most basic apps using the same styling, and the rest have CSD anyway.Each GUI toolkit has its own specialties, but you'll use at most two of them, and they will be kept in separate apps. (Apart from flatpak portals which use gtk instead of the system's).Windows has 3-5 different UI/UX layers within the same application ... And the rest have CSD anyway, so they look the same no matter the OS.

Linux user for decades, but headless since the early aughts.

No. It fails silently launching from the shortcut after the install. Run it from the command line, and, nope, it's a window manager issue. Mint Cinnamon uses X11, not Wayland, and Waydroid apparently needs... Wayland support.OK, I log out, log into Mint with Wayland support, then re-launch Waydroid. My screen goes into a fugue state where it randomly alternates between black and the desktop. Try a variety of things, and I guess this is just how it is. Google and try any number of fixes, end up giving up.Yes, that's my old pal Linux on the Desktop. Older, faster and wiser, but still flaky in precisely the same ways.

Likewise you cannot run Wayland programs on X11 without a wayland compositor like Cage (a wayland kiosk) or Weston. Both run as a window on X11 inside of which Waydroid works just fine.It's an odd complaint that incompatible software is incompatible.

I mean this is a solved problem on linux using modern distributions like NixOS or even 'normal' distros with flatpak, appimage, etc. I haven't had to deal with anything like this in years.The windows UIs are way more different than linux was. There was a time in the 90s where UIs were expected to follow platform specifics. These days, most UIs don't and they're almost kind of like the branding. Thus, this is not as big a deal as you're making it out to be. If anything, things like the gnome apps and gtk4 are more consistent than any windows app.

If there's something I hate about Linux, it's CSD (Client-Side Decorations, in case people don't know what it is).If I wanted all my apps to look different from each other, I'd use macOS. I want a clean desktop environment, with predictable window frames that are customizable and they all look the same. CSD destroys that.

I think Windows is the only other one which really does this properly, macOS also does the hack where they simulate fractional scales by rendering with an integer scale at a non-native resolution then scaling it down.

reply

Windows is the only one that does this properly.Windows handles high pixel density on a per-application, per-display basis. This is the most fine-grained. It's pretty easy to opt in on reasonably modern frameworks, too; just add in the necessary key in the resource manifest; done. [1]Linux + Xorg has a global pixel density scale factor. KDE/Qt handles this OK; GNOME/GTK break when the scaling factor is not an integer multiple of 96 and cause raster scaling.Linux + Wayland has per-display scaling factors, but Chromium, GNOME, and GTK break the same way as the Xorg setup. KDE/Qt are a bit better, but I'm quite certain the taskbar icons are sharper on Xorg than they are on Wayland. I think this boils down to subpixel rendering not being enabled.And of course, every application on Linux in theory can handle high pixel density, but there is a zoo of environment variables and command-line arguments that need to be passed for the ideal result.On macOS, if the pixel density of the target display is at least some Apple-blessed number that they consider 'Retina', then the 'Retina' resolutions are enabled. At resolutions that are not integer multiples of the physical resolution, the framebuffer is four times the resolution of the displayed values (twice in each dimension), and then the final result is raster-scaled with some sinc/Lanczos algorithm back down to the physical resolution. This shows up as ringing artifacts, which are very obvious with high-contrast, thin regions like text.On non-retina resolutions, there is zero concept of 'scaling factor' whatsoever; you can choose another resolution, but it will be raster-scaled (usually up) with some bi/trilinear filtering, and the entire screen is blurry. The last time Windows had such brute-force rendering was in Windows XP, 25 years ago.[1]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/hidpi/settin...

This is not our [0] experience. macOS handles things on a per-section-of-window, per-application, per-display basis.

No, it does not. If you have two displays with different physical pixel densities, and especially if they are sufficiently different that Apple will consider one 'Retina' and 'not Retina' (this is usually the case if, for instance, you have your MacBook's display—which probably is 'Retina'—beneath a 2560 × 1440, 336 × 597 mm monitor, which is 'not Retina'), then the part of the window on the non-Retina display will be raster-scaled to account for the difference. This is how KDE Plasma on Wayland handles it, too.In my opinion, any raster-scaling of vector/text UI is a deal-breaker.

Actually, the default in MacOS is that the window is only on one monitor, and its the monitor where the cursor was when you last moved the window, so you might have a window appearing invisible because you dragged it near the corner and some sliver ended on another monitor.Look at this complicated tinkering MacOS makes you do for something as simple as spanning windows across monitors! https://www.arzopa.com/blogs/guide/how-to-make-a-window-span...

I think Android does it properly too because they have to handle an entire zoo of screen sizes and resolutions there. Although they don't have the issue of dealing with subpixel rendering.

reply

I don't think this is true. I use non-integer scaling on my Mac since I like the UX to be just a little bit bigger, and have never observed any kind of ringing or any specific artifacts at all around text, nor have I ever heard this as a complaint before. I assume it's just bilinear or bicubic unless you have evidence otherwise? The only complaint people tend to make is ever-so-slight additional blurriness, which barely matters at Retina resolution.

Like I said, absolutely nothing like that happens on my display. I see the ringing in the first link. That doesn't happen to me. Not even a hint of it.I get you don't like the scaling, but like I said, the very slight blurriness just isn't really noticeable in practice, especially given how Macs antialias text to begin with. Of all my complaints about Macs, this particular one is close to the bottom.

So I took my Mac Mini, hooked up to a 4K monitor, verified there were no DSC artifacts at native resolution, set it to ""2560x1440"" and sure enough the same artifacts appeared for me too, but still no telltale signs of DSC. So yeah, I gotta say, this is on Apple. Between this and dropping subpixel antialiasing support for text, it's pretty clear that their only properly supported configuration is 2x scaling on high-DPI displays.

reply

OK, I just grabbed my loupe to make sure I'm not missing anything, and pulled up an app in dark mode (so ringing should be more visible) on my MBA M4. I'm using its built-in display. I've cycled through all 4 available resolution settings in Display, and absolutely zero artifacts or ringing. Then tried connecting to my LG UltraFine 4K which connects over Thunderbolt, that gives 5 resolution settings instead of 4, and zero artifacts/ringing on any of those either.So I have no idea what's going on. I don't doubt that you're seeing it, and it's there in that Reddit photo. But maybe it's something specific to external monitors over a certain connection type or something? Seems very strange that Apple would use a different downsampling algorithm under different circumstances though.I'd normally assume the most likely culprit would be some kind of sharpening setting on a monitor, as that can absolutely cause the type of ringing seen in that Reddit photo. But on the other hand, if you're testing it right now and not seeing it at native 2x, then that would seem to be ruled out, at least in your case. Maybe it's some kind of resolution negotiation mismatch where it's actually the monitor applying a second scaling that has ringing, since monitors can accept signals that don't match their native hardware resolution?

* = You have to go click ""Advanced..."", enable ""Show resolutions as list"", then when back on the main Displays page, enable ""Show all resolutions"", to get this and many other options -- but this is only necessary on the internal display, the external display offers ""2560x1440"" as a non-advanced choice

This happens on the native displays of MacBooks and iMacs, too. Try any of the 'looks larger'/'looks smaller' settings and it'll show up.

For the record, this isn't just visual. Rasterising to a framebuffer that is considerably larger than the physical resolution and then scaling produces a tangible effect on battery life. Not that it matters much with the impressive efficiency of the M-series SoCs, but it is there nonetheless.

reply

You seem to be fundamentally misunderstanding. Yes, raster scaling is how it works. I haven't disputed that anywhere.I'm saying the ringing artifact specifically that you're complaining about is not happening on my setup, nor does it seem to be widespread. You were complaining about the specific Lanczos algorithm due to its noticeable ringing, I'm saying that therefore doesn't seem to be the algorithm being used on mine, nor is there any documentation that's the algorithm Apple uses. Your criticism seems to be based on partially wrong information, even if something like it seems to happen on certain external displays -- whatever it is, it's not a universal problem.If you somehow missed my other comment, please read it:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46801536

Is this more of an aspirational thing, like Windows supports ""doing it right"", and with time and effort by the right people, more and more applications may be able to be drawn correctly?[edit] I guess so, I see your comment about setting registry keys to make stuff work in Microsoft's own programs. That aligns more closely with my experience.

To be fair, UXGA was a thing 20 years ago. I don't think it makes sense for Apple to care all that much about low DPI monitors. They don't sell any, and they wouldn't be acceptable to most Apple people, who have had crisp displays available for > 10 years now. I wouldn't be surprised if the number of Apple users on low dpi is single digit percentage.

How can you say this when applications render either minuscule or gigantic, either way with contents totally out of proportion, seemingly at random?I don't have to pull out a magnifying glass to notice those issues.

I'd blame Linux as a very small percentage of the problem here. This is on NVIDIA ensuring their hardware doesn't last to long and forcing you to throw it away eventually. Open source can make the monitor 'work' but really aren't efficient, and really can never be efficient because NVIDIA doesn't release the needed information and directly competes with their proprietary driver.

I'm on a very large OLED 3440x1440 display and haven't had too many issues... some apps seem to just drop out, I'm not sure if they are on a different workspace or something as I tend to just stick to single screen, single display.  I need to take the time to tweak my hotkeys for window pinning.  I'll usually have my browser to half the screen and my editor and terminal on the other half... sometimes stretching the editor to 2/3 covering part of the browser.  I'm usually zoomed in 25-30% in my editor and browser... I'd scale the UI 25% directly, like on windows or mac, but you're right it's worse.For webcams, I don't use anything too advanced, but the Nexigo cams I've been using lately have been working very well... they're the least painful part of my setup, and even though I tend to use a BT headset, I use the webcam mic as switching in and out of stereo/mono mode for the headset mic doesn't always work right in Linux.On audio filtering, I can only imagine... though would assume it's finally starting to get better with whatever the current standard is (pipewire?), which from what I understand is closer to what mac's interfaces are.  I know a few audio guys and they hate Windows and mostly are shy to even consider Linux.

On SteamOS, my 5.1 stereo just works.On Windows, apparently there was some software package called DTS Live (and/or Dolby Live) needed to wrap the audio stream in a container that the stereo understands.  There was a time when there was a patent pool on the AC-3 codec (or something like that - I'm handwaving because I don't know all the details).  So Microsoft stopped licensing the patent, and now you just can't use AC-3 on Windows.  I spent an evening installing something called Virtual CABLE and trying to use it to juryrig my own Dolby Live encoder with ffmpeg… Never got it to work.It's easy to fall deep into the tinkerhole on Linux, which has kept me away for a long time, but as mainstream platforms get more locked down, or stop supporting things they decide should be obsolete, it's nice to have a refuge where you're still in control, and things still work.(Insert meme about the Windows API in Proton being a more stable target than actual Windows.)

Since the introduction of the XSETTINGS protocol in like 2003 or 2005 or so to provide a common cross-toolkit mechanism to communicate system settings, the absence of ""non-integer"" scaling support has always been the fault of the GUI toolkits.> I think your experience comes from GNOME which lacks behind in this regard.When doesn't GNOME lag behind? Honestly, most of Wayland's problems have been because a project that expects protocol implementers and extenders to cooperate in order to make the project work set those expectations while knowing that GNOME was going to be one of those parties whose cooperation was required.

No, it is. Maybe you're using an ancient (or misconfigured) Xorg? Or maybe you've never used a GTK program? One prereq is that you have a daemon running that speaks the ~20 year old XSETTINGS protocol (such as 'xsettingsd'). Another prereq is that you have a DE and GUI toolkit new enough to know how to react to scaling changes.

Based on my investigation, this is a deficiency in how QT and FLTK react to the information they're being provided with.At least on my system, the KDE settings dialog that lets you adjust screen scaling only exposes a single slider that applies to the entire screen. However, I've bothered to look at (and play with) what's actually going on under the hood, and the underlying systems totally expose per-display scaling factors... but for some reason the KDE control widget doesn't bother to let you use them.

I did look a bit into this at one point, but I've found that it's mostly QT apps which work fine with different scaling (telegram comes to mind). GTK apps never did, but I admit I never went too deep in the rabbit hole. Didn't know there was supposed to be some kind of daemon handling this. I do run xsettingsd, but for unrelated reasons.

If you want essentially perfect high-DPI support out of the box and can afford higher end displays, use macOS. It just works. I see the comments above about scaling, and to that, I say: most people will never notice. However, a Win32 app being the wrong scale? They'll notice that.But the real display weak point of Linux right now vs Windows is HDR for gaming. That's a real shitshow and it tends to just work on Windows.

I had setup a dual boot when I swapped my old GTX 1080 for an RX 5700XT, figuring the ""open source"" drivers would give me a good Linux experience... it didn't.  Every other update was a blank/black screen and me without a good remote config to try to recover it.  After about 6 months it was actually stable, but I'd since gone ahead and paid too much for an RTX 3080, and gone back to my windows drive...I still used WSL almost all day, relying mostly on VS Code and a Browser open, terminal commands through WSL remoting in Code and results etc. on the browser.Then, one day, I clicked the trusty super/win menu and started typing in the name of he installed program I wanted to run... a freaking ad.  In the start menu search results.  I mean, it was a beta channel of windows, but the fact that anyone thought this was a good idea and it got implemented, I was out.I rebooted my personal desktop back to Linux... ran all the updates and it's run smoothly since.  My current RX 9070XT better still, couldn't be happier.  And it does everything I want it to do, and there's enough games in Steam through Proton that I can play what I want, when I want.  Even the last half year on Pop Coxmic pre-release versions was overall less painful than a lot of my Windows experiences the past few years.  Still not perfect, but at least it's fast and doesn't fail in ways that Windows now seems to regularly.Whoever is steering Windows development at Microsoft is clearly drunk at the wheel over something that should be the most ""done"" and polished product on the planet and it just keeps getting worse.

The problem isn't that ads can be disabled. The problem is that a paid operating system ships with ads in the first place. Full stop. There's no universe where that's acceptable product design, and the fact that you can disable them (for now, at least) doesn't make it less offensive.I don't understand why you're going to bat for a trillion-dollar corporation here. Your settings work now. Great. They won't after the next feature update, this is a well-documented pattern. Windows updates routinely re-enable telemetry, Bing integration, and promotional content that users explicitly disabled. You're not configuring your OS, you're fighting it.The TPM2 requirement is pure planned obsolescence. Millions of perfectly good machines binned because Microsoft decided hardware from 2016 is suddenly ""insecure""... whilst the actual benefit is DRM enforcement and remote attestation.It's a corporate compliance tool, not a security feature.The Insiders build being referenced had actual web advertisements in search results. That's where this is headed. If you're comfortable defending that trajectory, carry on flipping those settings.

The TPM2 requirement (and kind of by extension the IOMMU requirement, which is the one itself that bit most people) has significantly more benefits than ""DRM"" or ""planned obsolescence"". For one, did you know that TPM1.2 didn't include SHA2? Would you be okay relying on SHA1 hashing in 2026 to be used for digital signing? Of course you wouldn't. If I told you today to go generate an X.509 certificate with SHA1 you're going to look at me funny. Did you know it also didn't include ECC? Also much more useful in this day and age for cryptographic speed. There are many other features I don't feel like digging into at the moment, but you get the point.I would counter that the downstream requirement for the IOMMU (useful for Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity), in which Windows itself is broken up into ""Virtual Trust Levels"" (VTL0, VTL1, and I think there are some newer ones now as well); is extremely useful for securing early parts of the platform boot.Or did we collectively forget about the early rootkit era of Windows XP from 2005-2010 when running with legacy/MBR boot mechanisms?Establishing a trust boundary as early as possible to force possible attackers into userspace as much as possible (where it can be more easily removed and remediated) is significantly important in modern operating system security--and this goes for any platform: MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS, or Linux.Apple, Google, and Microsoft have some form of integrity control over their platforms along with dedicated security chips. Short of some exploits, the most common vector to get into Windows' early boot process is to steal or abuse code IHV kernel driver signing certificates; or in some cases, be maliciously issued one from Microsoft (lol, now THAT is indeed a problem, but a tough one).This is just part of modern platform security at this point so I don't really see the issue.In addition, TPM2 offers significantly more storage and

And even if it were free, which it isn't, that still wouldn't justify ads. Android is free. Linux is free.

The ads exist because they can get away with it, not because they need to.

I appreciate manufacturers who make this obvious. For example, when I bought the Framework laptop I'm using now, the OS choices were preinstalled Windows 11 (default selection), preinstalled Linux (-$150), none/I'll install my own (-$150). Made it clear exactly what I would have been paying for the Windows license if I had chosen Windows.

I am betting that somebody is going to get scared at MS and we then get a better W12 again.

The problem is, what does Linux Desktop offer me more, then a few annoyances that i can remove after a fresh install? Often a lot more trouble with the need to use the terminal for things, that are ancient in Windows. That is the problem ... With Apple, you can get insane good M-CPU hardware (yes, mem/storage is insane), for the os/desktop switch.I noticed that often the people who switch to Linux, are more likely to send more time into finetuning their OS, tinkering around, etc... aka people with more time on their hands. But when you get a bit older, you simply want something that works and gives you no trouble. I can literally upgrade my PC here from a NVidia to AMD or visa versa, and it will simply work with the correct full performance drivers. Its that convenience that is the draw to keep using (even ifs a older) Windows.For now 25 years every few years, i look at upgrading to Linux permanently, install a few distro's and go back. Linus Desktop does not feel like you gain a massive benefit, if that makes sense? Especially not if your like me, who simply rides out Microsoft their bad OS releases.

As a power user, there's no point trying out OSes occasionally, unless that's your hobby. Think of it as switching between flying Boeings or Airbuses as a pilot; there's going to be a learning curve that you're going to have to commit to if you want the full benefits. I use the analogy to illustrate the point; OSes as users are definitely not nearly as complex to drive.That said, the unstable experiences you're describing are odd. Maybe you're running into some odd edge case because that unstable experience hasn't been the case for mainstream Linux users for a couple of decades.Neither is there a need to tinker with the big mainstream distros either. Most are install-and-forget these days and have been so for a while.

I do use a Macbook M1 Air for my personal laptop and have used them for work off and on over the years... I'm currently using a very locked down windows laptop assigned from work.  Not having WSL and Docker have held me back a lot though.In the end, I do most of my work in Linux anyway... it's where what I work on tends to get deployed and I don't really do much that doesn't work on Linux without issue at this point.  Windows, specifically since Win11 has continued to piss me off and I jumped when I saw something that was just too much for me to consider dealing with.  I ran insiders for years to get the latest WSL integrations and features.  This bit me a few times, but was largely worth it, until it wasn't anymore.C# work is paying the bills... would I rather work on Rust or TS, sure... but I am where I am.  I'm similar to you in that I looked at Linux every few years, kicked the tires, ran it for a month or a couple weeks and always went back.  This time a couple years ago... it stuck.  Ironically, my grandmother used Linux much longer than I ever did on her computer that I maintained for her.  For her, it just worked, and she didn't need much beyond the browser.

Everything works out of the box, including bluetooth and gaming (surprisingly well given only has an integrated GPU). Same experience with two of my wifes laptops.Now I did have issues with my desktop due to running bleeding edge hardware, but those all got resolved within months on its own and a clean install is now no hassle at all.In short, I'm now older and don't have time to tinker with my PCs.

This was never acceptable, but we tolerated it because it subsidised the cost of the laptop, OEMs decided the trade-off and you could vote with your wallet for cleaner experiences (often with the same manufacturer).Show me the ThinkPad T or X series (or EliteBook, or Precision/Latitude) that shipped with ads and I'll take it as a valid point. Otherwise, it's not valid.

Microsoft implemented, in its Beta Windows Insider Channel in 2024, ads in the ""Recommended"" section of the Start Menu.

You read some internet headline and start screeching about it on social media as if it doesn't take 2 seconds to literally turn off.

It's not a feature that should EVER exist at an OS level... I didn't even mind the adjacent product ads or the Recommended section you mention that much... but it's emphatically not what I'm fucking talking about.The fact that this was even something that was implemented and tested means that I'm not someone who will buy or choose Microsoft Windows at all from here forward.  I have over 3 decades of development experience on/for/with software that runs on Windows.An even then... It doesn't matter if I can shut it off, it shouldn't have existed in the first place.

But I like data. And that's what I'm going to stick with. Your experience is not my experience.That said, I distinctly remember back in the Windows 98 days (inarguably one of the most highly regarded versions of Windows ever released which had extreme staying power throughout the Windows XP era); they used to automatically include the Channel Bar to the right on the ""Active Desktop"". This bar included links to Disney, AOL, MSN, MSNBC, among other items. No doubt Disney paid good money to be default installed and opened on every Windows PC of the time.So it's not like including some level of advertising hasn't been a precedent for 30 or so years.

I know this is splitting hairs, but I like data and not emotional driven decisions. When I tap ""Start"" and search for ""World of Warcraft"", which is installed on my PC, the very first item is the shortcut to WoW on my PC.In terms of Start Menu Zones (as I'm calling them), on the Left is the ""best Match"", which links to WoW on my PC. The next zone beneath that is ""Apps"", which are the multiple permutations of WoW on my PC, and beneath that is ""Search the Web"", which offers a few search terms related to WoW. Beneath that is a ""Store"" link to WoW, which links to the Microsoft Store. The right zone of the Start Menu offers a menu of what I want to do with the app: Open, Run as Administrator, Open File Location, Pin to Start, Pin to Taskbar, or Uninstall.This is the same behavior on all programs I have installed on the PC: I can type ""Steam"", same behavior. Discord, same behavior, Signal, same behavior, Battle.Net, same behavior, etc.Now, for items that are not installed on my PC, for example, Half Life. Since I don't have it on my PC, it immediately wants to only search the web. On the right zone, which on installed apps shows a menu of options, this now shows a mini Bing search window which basically has sponsored content at the top with ebay links to Half Life editions (also holy crap those are expensive).So for applications not installed on my PC? Yeah, it's showing me some search bing ads. For every application installed on my PC? It's not showing any ads.From what I'm reading, it seems many people have a workflow that leverages the start menu pretty heavily. My workflow since the early days of XP has never included the start menu. In Windows XP, I used the Quick Launch Bar and always had a 2nd row of icons above my taskbar for which I used to open apps. When Microsoft changed this, I simply pin everything to the taskbar instead and use that. The only time I use the start menu to search and load something is usually if I want to CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to run whatever that is as Administrator. And that workflow has never once ""tricked"" me into loading any ads, websites, bing searches, or anything. It has always, for over a decade including on Windows 11 25H2 done exactly what I was expecting every single time.So perhaps our workflows differ for which this is an annoyance for you, but I cannot replicate your specific problem that you mentioned.

But don't get bent out of shape - you can disable it in settings. Takes 10 seconds.

Probably.Why would you buy a different car? It's so easy to turn off. What, you want to use a BMW? Be a BMW-user? A sheep? All your tools already integrate with our car anyway. There's no real choice, is there - unless you want to be a try-hard. And maybe it doesn't even work properly. You don't want that hassle, do you? Just accept the Ass-Fucker 3000.

There are plenty of easily identifiable issues with performance in windows 11.  There should be people in the windows team dedicated to eliminating ""jank"".

So I installed Fedora on that machine, I learned the process, I went through the hurdles. It wasn't seamless. But, Fedora never said “I can't”. When it was over, it was fine.Only if Microsoft had just let me install Windows 11 and suffer whatever the perf problem my CPU would bring. Then I could consider a hardware upgrade then, maybe.But, “you can't install unless you upgrade your CPU” forced me to adopt Linux. More importantly, it gave me a story to tell.There is a marketing lesson there somewhere, like Torvalds' famous “you don't break userspace”, something along the lines of “you don't break the upgrade path”.

So to Fedora I went! So far, I've been pleasantly surprised. All of the software I want to use installed easily and works, via Flatpak. All of my hardware works fine, and there are actually fewer weird hardware quirks than under Windows. I also appreciate that there are options to turn off behaviors I found annoying in Windows.It's a bit sad to have to switch due to Microsoft trashing their own OS rather than Linux becoming superlatively awesome, but what can you do.

The other big difference I notice between NixOS and e.g. Debian is that on NixOS I only have to specify the changes from the defaults.  On e.g. Debian I usually have to change config files that already exist.  Then when the package updates its default config I end up having to review all the changes to the config, even when they have nothing to do with what I've explicitly configured.

Hold up, I'm no expert on Secure Boot, but LUKS allows you to have multiple entry keys to the same drive.This means you can have one key of random gobbledegook which is kept and auto-used by the magic motherboard, and also a passphrase that you can memorize or write down, and either one is totally sufficient on its own.You don't even need to set them up at the same time, you can start with one and then add the other as an option later.

TPM 2.0 is something else. It's typically soldered onto the motherboard as a physical device and the key can be generated and then used to encrypt the disk. The private key can not be extracted. Only the signature and you can ask the TPM to sign a binary blob with the private key while providing you the public key to verify. This protects you against physical access to your device. No one can take your disk and decrypt it.

reply

Right, you can't recover or copy that specific key, but you also don't have to for accessing your data, if you set up some redundancy before disaster struck.AFAIK: 99% of your storage is encrypted by a giant fixed unchanging master-key, and that is itself encrypted again with a non-master key/LS or passphrase, which is stored in the remaining ""LUKS header"". There's room to store multiple copies of the same master-key encrypted with different non-master options.In that model, the TPM is simply providing (in a convoluted way) its own passphrase for one of those co-equal slots, so having one or more alternates prepared is sufficient to protect your drive from motherboard failure.

Microsoft even evolved it all to adapt to and compete with new ideas from rivals, such as COM+ as alternative to CORBA, ASP.Net as alternative to JSP, etc.Then Microsoft did the unthinkable. It inexplicably threw away all these IT dependencies away, that it had spent decades to build across the worlr.Microsoft unleashed .Net on an unsuspecting IT world.And M$ arrogantly expected the world to also throw all their years of efforts of building applications and databases revolving around VB/VC++.To save their careers, millions of VB/VC++ programmers tried hard to scramble and learn these new technologies, but Microsoft just kept updating and upgrading the .Net landscape with increasing frequency and leading to more chaos and confusions. And as the learning curve steeper and the .Net scope became too hard for sane people to master in a short time, it became apparent that to the entire IT world (except Microsoft) that it had become too difficult and cumbersome to build applications for corporations using Microsoft's new-age tools. Thus, the interest and ambitions of the programmers and corporations quickly waned towards Microsoft tools, especially when they realised that .Net was a mess for installations, and it called expensive licenses to build and ship.So programmers and SOHO/medium-scale companies, pivoted to alternatives to Microsoft imposed nightmares. Python, PHP, MySQL, Linux, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, JSP, etc. took centre stage, even as the IT world moved away from .Net.The worldwide chaos caused by Windows Vista and Windows 8, did nothing to improve upon IT people's disdain for all things Microsoft.And Microsoft's rivals pounced at such golden opportunities, and they slowly ate away at Microsoft's dominance in corporate world.Yes, there is indeed some lessons for Micro$oft to be learnt from these debacles.""Hubris calls for nemesis, and in one form or another it's going to get it, not as a punishment from outside but as the completion of a pattern already started.""

Remote Attestation of Immutable Operating Systems built on systemdIts the ""remote"" thing that has no place in personal computing, or rather, computing that is to extend one's own autonomy, or agency. 
Its no one's damn business whether my system is attested or not! I mean, sure theres certainly benefits for me knowing if its attested, but the other road is one of ruin, and will basically be the chains of the future.

Most of that fear is not all that rational. It's not unlike kidnap victims falling in love with their captors. Your mind just tries to make the most of what fundamentally is a really messed up situation. You'll tell yourself it isn't that bad or that the next update will fix it or that you can get some magic software thingy that makes it go faster. Whatever.Once you realize you are being abused, you can make some choices and do something about it. Most tools can be replaced if you look around a bit and do a bit of research. And virtual machines on Linux can run Windows just fine if you have one or two things that just really need it (been there done that). There's also wine and proton which aren't half bad these days. And they work for lots of things other than games. You can dual boot. Etc. Try it and find out. The absolute worst case is that you have to go back to being a lame abuse victim here. You'll feel extra bad because now you know. The best case gets you out of that abusive relation ship for the rest of your life. Life is too short to get subjected to this kind of abuse.

But the talk of abuse is also heavy-handed.I've spent months testing and trying out RAW photo editors, and months trying out Linux gaming.Linux is incredible, but my experience with Windows is still better. As many that still use it can attest, you can disable almost any annoyance. It's extremely stable. Things just work including brightness controls, fractional scaling, high refresh rates and high FPS gaming, and my favorite RAW photo editing. I could switch to a less enjoyable experience with Linux but I choose not to after extensive evaluation. I don't spend any money on Microsoft services, no Office or OneDrive subscription.But my decision isn't permanent. My hobbies, software use, gaming selection, etc. can change over time, and Linux is getting better while Windows is getting worse. If it's ever ""abuse"" and I can have a better experience with Linux, I won't hesitate to change. But it's also a lot of effort to try out alternatives, and dual booting is slow and annoying. Plus when I dual boot to Linux Mint the kernel fails to boot every other time and I have to select an older one, reboot, select a newer one, reboot. It's a huge waste of time. A bad experience and I have chosen to avoid it and try again in another year or two.

We've been hearing this for decades and yet the home Linux userbase is microscopic and somehow even smaller than ever.  Unless we're going to count Google's Android and Chrome OS.  Those are the only Linux-based distributions that have ever gained market share over desktop Windows.

On the other hand I am also a realist and I don't think that Linux will take over the Desktop, but it will certainly have its biggest growth year ever in 2026.

I _love_ Linux, but I agree with this as well. I don't think Linux will ever be easy enough that I could recommend it to an elderly neighbor. I hope to be proven wrong, though.What frustrates me about this particular moment is that at the same time Windows is getting worse, I feel that OS X is _also_ getting worse. This _is_ an opportunity for Apple to put a big dent in Windows market share.

> governments around the world are loudly thinking about how to reduce dependence on US techI am definitely sympathetic, after all, I worked for a major Linux company for quite a few years, started using Linux RH) in 1994, and even wrote some network related kernel modules.However, this switch to Linux is not going to happen (apart from where it is already used heavily, from servers to many non-PC systems).I have been in projects for large companies but also government on and off. Now, I manage the IT of a small (<50 employees) non-IT business with people in several countries.People who actually comment in these discussions seem to be entirely focused on the OS itself. But that is what matters the least in business. Office is another, and even there most people who don't deal with it at scale are way too focused on some use case where individuals write documents and do some spreadsheeting. It's almost always about a very small setup, or even just a single PC.However, the Microsoft stack is sooooo much more. ID management. Device management. Uncountable number of little helpers in form of software and scripts that you cannot port to a Linux based stack without significant effort. Entire mail domains are managed by Office 265 - you own the domain and the DNS records, you get licenses for Office365 from MS, you point the DNS records to Microsoft, you are done.Sure, MS tools and the various admin websites are a mess, duplicating many things, making others hard to find. But nobody in the world would be able to provide soooo much stuff while doing a better job. The truth is, they keep continuously innovating and I can see it, little things just conveniently showing up, like that I now have a Teams button to create an AI script of my conversations, or that if more than one person opens an Office document that is stored in OneDrive we can see each other inside the document, cursor positions, and who has it open.Nobody in their right mind will switch their entir4e org to Linux unless they have some really good reasons, a lot of resources to spare, and a lot of experience. Most businesses, for whom IT is not the be-all-end-all but just a tool will not switch.But something can be done.The EU could, for example, start requiring other stacks for new special cases. They cannot tell the whole economy to switch, not even a fraction of it, but they could start with new government software. Maybe - depends on how it has to fit into the existing mostly Microsoft infrastructure.They could also require more apps to be web-only. I once wrote some code for some government agency to manage business registrations, and it was web software.The focus would have to be to start creating strong niches for local business to start making money using other stacks, and to take the long road, slowly replace US based stacks over the next two or three decades. At the same time, enact policies that let local business grow using alternative stacks, providing a safe cache-flow that does not have to compete with US based ones.The EU also needs some better scaling. The nice thing about the MS stack is that I can use it everywhere, in almost all countries. The alternative cannot be that a business would have to use a different local company in  each country.I read a month ago that EU travel to the US is down - by only ~3%. Just like with any calls for boycott of this and that, the truth is that those commenting are a very tiny fraction. The vast majority of people and businesses are not commenting in these threads (or at all), and their focus is on their own business and domain problems first of all.

Office is another, and even there most people who don't deal with it at scale are way too focused on some use case where individuals write documents and do some spreadsheeting. It's almost always about a very small setup, or even just a single PC.However, the Microsoft stack is sooooo much more. ID management. Device management. Uncountable number of little helpers in form of software and scripts that you cannot port to a Linux based stack without significant effort. Entire mail domains are managed by Office 265 - you own the domain and the DNS records, you get licenses for Office365 from MS, you point the DNS records to Microsoft, you are done.Sure, MS tools and the various admin websites are a mess, duplicating many things, making others hard to find. But nobody in the world would be able to provide soooo much stuff while doing a better job. The truth is, they keep continuously innovating and I can see it, little things just conveniently showing up, like that I now have a Teams button to create an AI script of my conversations, or that if more than one person opens an Office document that is stored in OneDrive we can see each other inside the document, cursor positions, and who has it open.Nobody in their right mind will switch their entir4e org to Linux unless they have some really good reasons, a lot of resources to spare, and a lot of experience. Most businesses, for whom IT is not the be-all-end-all but just a tool will not switch.But something can be done.The EU could, for example, start requiring other stacks for new special cases. They cannot tell the whole economy to switch, not even a fraction of it, but they could start with new government software. Maybe - depends on how it has to fit into the existing mostly Microsoft infrastructure.They could also require more apps to be web-only. I once wrote some code for some government agency to manage business registrations, and it was web software.The focus would have to be to start creating strong niches for local business to start making money using other stacks, and to take the long road, slowly replace US based stacks over the next two or three decades. At the same time, enact policies that let local business grow using alternative stacks, providing a safe cache-flow that does not have to compete with US based ones.The EU also needs some better scaling. The nice thing about the MS stack is that I can use it everywhere, in almost all countries. The alternative cannot be that a business would have to use a different local company in  each country.I read a month ago that EU travel to the US is down - by only ~3%.

Is there any bit of this that is not web based or does not support Linux nowadays? Office 365 runs on a browser, and even Intune supports some enterprise oriented distributions, like RH, so device management shouldn't be a problem. But even if none of that was true, there is certainly competition in the IT management space. Defaulting to Microsoft just because of a Windows based fleet doesn't sound like a great idea.> The truth is, they keep continuously innovating and I can see it, little things just conveniently showing up, like that I now have a Teams button to create an AI script of my conversations, or that if more than one person opens an Office document that is stored in OneDrive we can see each other inside the document, cursor positions, and who has it open.This is stuff other vendors have been offering for ages now.

Oh and thanks for ignoring everything I wrote I guess. Not that I expected anything different, it is always the same in these threads after all. Why bother with arguments, especially those of the person you respond to?But you see, this ""laziness"" actually supports my point. Not even you want to do the hard thing and bother with what somebody else thinks when there is a much easier path. But you expect others to care about the things that you care about, without spending much effort even merely understanding their position.

The state of gaming has improved drastically since I started doing it that way, though, and I'm considering ditching the VM entirely. Multiplayer games seem to be getting the hint about anticheat exclusion on Linux. ARC Raiders, for example, is a competitive game and runs flawlessly directly on Linux.

The real number is closer to 2.5% somewhere. What is still growth but nowhere the ""year of the Linux desktop"".You tend to see a rather vocal minority that makes you feel like there is some major switch but looking here in the comments, people that switched 8 years, 12 year, 20 years ago are people that are part of the old statistics. There are some new converts but not what you expect to see despite Linux now also being more gaming compatible.It still has minor issues (beyond anti-cheat), that involve people fixing things, less then the past. But its still not the often click and play, works under every resolution, has no graphic issue etc etc. That is the part people often do not tell you, because a lot of people are more thinkers, so a issue pops up, they fix it and forget about it.Ironically, MacOS just dominates as the real alternative to Windows in so many aspects. If Apple actually got their act together about gaming, it can trigger a actual strong contender to Windows.

This is what a computer should be doing: helping the user to get their work done, without the user having to worry about insignificant details about saving files. E.g. does Google Docs ever ask where to save a file before closing the browser or shutting down the computer? No you just get an untitled document that is automatically saved. If I want to rename it or save it in a different location, I am free to do so. But as long as I don't, it doesn't get in the way and just persists stuff automatically.

For me the biggest thing is control, with Windows there are some things like updates that you have zero control over. It's the same issue with MacOS, you have more control than Windows but you're still at the whims of Apple's design choices every year when they decide to release a new OS update.Linux, for all it's issues, give you absolute control over your system and as a developer I've found this one feature outweighs pretty much all the issues and negatives about the OS. Updates don't run unless I tell them to run, OS doesn't upgrade unless I  tell it to. Even when it comes to bugs at least you have the power to fix them instead of waiting on an update hoping it will resolve that issue. Granted in reality I wait for updates to fix various small issues but for bigger ones that impact my workflow I will go through the trouble of fixing it.I don't see regular users adopting Linux anytime soon but I'm quickly seeing adoption pickup among the more technical community. Previously only a subset of technical folks actually ran Linux because Windows/MacOS just worked but I see more and more of them jumping ship with how awful Windows and MacOS have become.

One recent example I experienced is jumping through hoops to get virtualization enabled in Fedora… it takes several steps that are not obvious at all. I understand not having it enabled by default since many won't need it, but there's no reason that can't just be a single CLI command that does it all.

These are things that don't happen in Linux. Doing what you want to do might be difficult (depending on how unusual it is), but there's no one actively trying to stop you from doing it for their own purposes (except systemd.)Also, as an aside, a reason that Windows and Macs might have easy virtualization (I have no idea if they do) is because of how often they're running Linux VMs.

reply

For macOS in particular, most trouble that more tinker-y users might encounter disappears if guardrails (immutable system image, etc) are disabled. Virtualization generally ""just works"" by way of the stock Virtualization.framework and Hypervisor.framework, which virtualization apps like QEMU can then use, but bespoke virtualization like that QEMU also ships with or that built into VirtualBox and VMWare works fine too. No toggles or terminal commands necessary. Linux does get virtualized a lot, but people frequently virtualize Windows and macOS as well.

'Similar to Windows' System Restore and macOS's Time Machine', the Linux 'Timeshift' tool can be used to do make periodic saves of your OS files & settings. (They can be saved elsewhere.) Restoration is a cinch.Mint program 'Backup Tool' allows users to save and restore files within their home directory (incl. config folder and separately installed apps).

Gentoo is great for learning what all the individual components are. You install it by booting a kernel from a USB stick then chrooting into your newly installed system to start installing and configuring everything. Just knowing the existence of individual components helps a lot. Plus Gentoo gives you more control than almost any other distro (much more than Arch, for example).

IBM is a corporation and they already screwed up CentOS and is eventually going to screw up Fedora someday because that's what corporations do, and I'm not interesting in going through that.You have your fun running Fedora for now but know you're going to get burned someday.

> For the remainder of 2026, Microsoft is cooking up a big one: replacing more and more native apps with React Native. But don't let the name fool you, there's nothing ""native"" about it. These are projects designed to be easily ported across any machine and architecture, because underneath it all, it's just JavaScript. And each one spawns its own Chromium process, gobbling up your RAM so you can enjoy the privilege of opening the Settings app.I'm a little tired of people junking on react native when they have no clue what they talked about (And I'm not even react native dev but iOS dev). React Native doesn't spawn any chromium process. This is not electron. React Native doesn't even use v8 engine. All UI views and widgets are native. Platform SDK is native,  Yoga Layout is native C++ and even faster than UIKit layout. Majority of RN code is Native - go have a look at github at languages section. JS is only 19% of codebase, everything else is C++, Obj-C, Obj-C++, Kotlin, Java.The problem AFAIK with startup being laggy was making http requests to downloads those ads.

15 minutes to deactivate an entire branch of notification pathways, 20 minutes to (mostly) restore the Right-Ctrl key they hijacked into a CoPilot key. 10 minutes to restore Win10 functionality to the Win11 taskbar with the wonderful ExplorerPatcher. $5 spent on Start11 to sidestep the whole start menu train wreck. And little 3 to 5 minute fixes with WindHawk (an amazing store-like platform to discover, install and manage open source Windows GUI patches).I'm the stupid frog who didn't leap from the gradually heating pot. I acclimated to the boiling. And it's... okay. At least for now. But I know someday soon, the thousand faceless product managers at MSFT will break something unfixable. Somehow exceed the considerable abilities of the large community finding clever hacks and patches to keep the harsh Win wasteland livable for hardy souls.While I greatly appreciate Linux philosophically and deeply respect it architecturally, I still really liked what Windows got so close to being - right before MSFT shifted biz models, simultaneously de-investing and turning it into a promotional platform for their other business. When that day comes, it'll suck to leave behind the wonderful third-party tools like Everything search, Ditto clipboard and AHK automation that streamline my day.The thing I don't understand is why MSFT refuses to just make a version of Windows that's a Product again. I'd gladly pay them $100/yr for an upgraded ""Windows Ti Super+"" that just wants to be a good operating system for advanced users, instead of a strategic moat or monetization flywheel.

I recently had to install Windows 11 to play a video game that runs janky on Linux, and I am encountering all the annoying problems people are describing in this thread (forced updates, full-screen ads, etc). It does not bother me too much, since I effectively use Windows only to play that one game. But maybe I can tune Windows 11 into something less obtrusive with the custom hacks. Thanks.

Of course some of the notes become stale or irrelevant as things evolve but it's still invaluable insurance if this Windows install eventually gets crufty and needs to be hosed out for a fresh start (which eventually happens even with diligent hygiene). Also, don't forget ExplorerPatcher which restores some essential Win10 taskbar and explorer functionality MSFT removed from Win11 (promising to eventually replace with new code but now, years later, obviously never will). It's clear at this point MSFT isn't devoting any serious effort toward re-implementing previous functionality or creating new features for power users.AFAICT, the only things getting meaningful funding now are fixing critical 0days / bugs, reworking the interface to create ""more exposure vectors to support corporate initiatives"" and a couple under-resourced teams clearing only the most critical technical debt threatening the whole edifice. Meanwhile, every PM or UX designer who suggests ""Hey, it'd be easier to just decide that new feature or unrestored functionality will just confuse 'our average user'"" gets promoted. I just feel sorry for the engineers still there who joined the Windows team wanting to build toward a state-of-the-art operating system supporting a powerful, flexible, extensible, customizable user interface. Now it's ""If it ain't broken, there's no funding to fix it"" and ""If it just broke, see if we can just remove it instead of fixing it"", ""if it's there but incomplete, remove what's there, patch over the hole and we'll pretend it was never there.""

Years ago MS depended on Windows.  It was the profit center.  Everything MS did was a moat to sell more seats.  Even MS-Exchange was just a ploy to force enterprises to stop deploying any other operating system.That all changed with Azure.MS realized they could make billions in Windows or trillions with Azure.They changed the org structure. Now Azure is at the top and everything else is a moat or a way to draw people to Azure. They changed the sales commission (your multiplier doesn't kick in unless you've sold enough cloud services).Windows is no longer a profit center. It's a cost center.Anything that scares people away from using Windows is a benefit.Let those other suckers spend money developing operating systems.  As long as it runs on a VM in Azure, Microsoft will profit.Windows being worse and worse isn't a bug.  It's a feature.

I hear this from a lot of people when they get their first Mac. When they get specific about what their issues are, it tends to be that macOS doesn't do a thing how they are used to doing it, which is more of a learning curve issue, or rigid thinking. Apple software can be quite opinionated, those who fight against those opinions tend to have a hard time. This is true of any opinionated software.

I don't want to globally swap Ctrl and Cmd. For some apps, the keys are identical to that on Windows. For others, it isn't. I need to be able to do it on a per app basis.

macOS uses Command instead of Control for a lot of things, but they didn't change how the shell works.

Btw search ""modifier keys"" in Mac sysprefs if you want to rebind command to control. I'm also sick of using separate shortcuts at work, but the other way around, gonna rebind Ubuntu.

Packages are not done well compared to linux. Brew is a poor replacement. It feels like the terminal and everything involved is constantly out of date.The OS just has a lot of weird things, like the ribbon at the bottom taking up so much space. When I made is smaller and hidden except on mouse over it was incredibly rough.Window management is decades behind windows or linux. It doesn't like maximizing windows and doesn't make partitioning screen space easy. I had to download a third party app to make it better, which was still worse than windows even in windows 7, and miles worse than linux with i3.Mac has a lot of rough spots. I have two external monitors and occasionally after updates one monitor would be fuzzy or different resolutions, and it wouldn't go back until the next update.

You can run nix on macOS now. You can also drag windows into corners or edges to tile them, it is almost exactly like Windows 7 or 10. You can even have tiling window managers on macOS that emulate i3.Your complaints with the dock seem like a personal choice... I like the dock behavior but if you don't, probably not a lot that will fix that, it will always suck.Sad to report that external monitor support is still terrible.

Linux/Windows (historically) were straightforawrd, each tool did exactly what it said it would do, and it was up to you to learn how to use the tools available.On linux/windows, if a button was ""capture image"", it would just capture the image on the screen.  On a mac a ""capture image"" button could do anything from displaying the image on the screen, to saving it in a photos folder, to saving and syncing it to an iCloud account.  Whatever the apple PM decided the most common use case was, and god help you if you want to do something different.If you've been in the mac ecosystem for a while, you've grown used to this and don't notice any longer.

With Linux/Windows you're supplied with a toolbox and from that toolbox you're expected to cobble together a workflow that works for you and maintain it.I spent a significant amount of time trying to learn Tasks inside of Outlook and come up with a system that would make it remotely useful. I failed repeatedly. They eventually bought Wunderlist and replaced it with that, which still has some rough edges (last I tried) due to the legacy Outlook Tasks integration.Apple, more often than not, is looking to identify a problem and give an opinionated solution on how to handle it. If you're ok with their solution, great, problem solved. If you're not, you end up either fighting with the Apple tools or finding a 3rd party toolbox style app that lets you cobble together a workflow. I found just going with the opinionated solution removes a lot of needless stress from my life. There are some places I do go 3rd party, but I reevaluate often to ask if I really need these things and if they're worth the trouble.It ends up being a question of what my goals are with the computer. Am I looking to work on the operating system and apps to tune them to exactly what I want, or am I just looking for the system to fade into the background so I can do other things. When I was younger, I found tweaking and playing with everything to be a bit of a hobby. These days, I just want to do what I need to get done and move on with my life.

Cmd-Tab switching between applications instead of windows is utterly stupid. (Yes I know there is some magic keystroke that will do it, but who even wants the standard behavior? Like why even do that?)If there is a window under another window, and you click on something in it, the OS will ignore the click, it will just activate the window.So now you have to click twice, except what if it's actually active? So now you have to always check if a window is active - which is harder than necessary because of how Macs have the toolbar on top, not near the actual window. (This is especially bad when you have two monitors.)The toolbar is far from the window, leading to extra mouse movements.There is no maximize button, instead it's a full screen button.If you manage to get a window off-screen, there's almost no way to get it back (you have to pick tile windows or something like that to make the mac move it). If you do show all windows, and click on it, nothing obvious happens.I'm trying to add the screenshot app to the launch bar - I can't, I click on Launchpad and find it, but you can't right click on any of the icons in there to do anything with them.The finder is an utter disaster - I can not for the life of me figure out how to go up one level in a directory. It's like finder is trying very hard to pretend there's no such thing as directories.If you have two monitors you can't have an app halfway across both of them, it's always on one of the order.If I move an app to the bottom right corner the OS will ""helpfully"" move it back up, even though I moved it down. (This is especially funny when you realize it frequently manages to place windows off screen - why can't it be helpful then?)When you drag a window sometimes you get this white outline that will resize the window for your screen - I have yet to figure out when this activates and when it doesn't.When you drag a window from a larger monitor to a small one, it will resize it - sometime. But despite that it manages to place the window offset - so it's the right size, but like 40 pixels to the left.Every single time I reboot, if I have to unplug my external monitor, and keyboard, login, then plug them back in. Otherwise it refuses to talk to them.

I also like the first click in a window to not be passed through. I don't want to have to make sure I'm not clicking on some active part which will immediately have an unwanted effect.

HOLY SHIT, my work Mac does this all the time and my personal Mac does not, I cannot for the life of me figure out why, nobody I have talked to understands it, it drives me absolutely insane.Everything else in your post is either a personal preference and/or not a problem for my workflow

macOS tends to use the arrow keys for this, with various modifiers. Command + the arrow moves to the start or end of things (documents or lines), Option will be at the word or line level.

The reason for this dates back to the original design of the Lisa. Bill Atkinson explains it in this video. It's a trade off between having issues with menus when windows are small, and having to move more. I believe this is why they added mouse acceleration, so no matter where you were, you could get up to the menus fairly quickly.https://youtu.be/Qg0mHFcB510?si=yc0uCunQiMufGc75&t=416> There is no maximize button, instead it's a full screen button.They're starting to get better on this.

I usually show the Path Bar whenever I get a new Mac. In Finder, View > Show Path Bar. This shows your path at the bottom of the Finder window. You can click on any parent directory to go to it.If you don't want to do that, or want another way, right-click the folder name at the top of the Finder window.

E.g. it keeps opening Music app whenever I connect bluetooth earbuds. I can't delete Music app, it just keeps popping up with imbecile message about ""user is not logged in"" or something. I run a script that monitors that Music.app is running and kills-9 it.Or blinking desktop background issue, that's been there for years, accumulated many support threads, and still not fixed.Random services like coreaudiod that suddenly start consuming 100% CPU for no apparent reason.Macbook throttling (thanks God, gone with M cpu's)I can keep going but my point is macos has legit problems that can't be simply shrugged off with ""they just hold it the wrong way"".Like any other mass product tbh, except rare ideal products like Factorio game or sqlite.

Not sure about other people, but in my case I spend 99% of the time using software made by 3rd parties so my exposure to the OS is very limited.Latest OS is making life miserable though, compared to all the previous releases.

And then:    - Butterfly keyboard

    - M-series CPUs, which, while technically awesome, did not allow for Linux VMs.

So I switched to System76/Linux (Pop OS) and that has been wonderful, not to mention, much cheaper.

Most of my personal development these days is done on my home server - 9995wx, 768GB, rtx 6000 pro blackwell GPU in headless mode. My work development happens in a cloud workstation with 64 cores and 128GB of ram but builds are distributed and I can dial up the box size on demand for heavier development.I use laptops practically entirely as network client devices. Browser, terminal window, perhaps a VS Code based IDE with a remote connection to my code.

Apple is disabling downgrading across all of iOS, and starting to do the same with MacOS. So you need to keep old hardware to run older MacOS versions, and it's only a matter of a few years before Tahoe is the latest OS you can run on your Mac.

reply

I must have taken some shrooms before I downgraded from Tahoe to Sequoia a few hours ago then.

reply

What you did is a downgrade in what's called the supported OS.However, if you decide to downgrade to Catalina on an M1 Mac, it's not possible — Big Sur is the earliest version that runs on Apple Silicon.Anyway, you cannot downgrade to a macOS version older than what your Mac originally came with. So if you buy a Mac now, Tahoe will be the minimum option.

First modern PC (dos/win3.1) I had a 12mhz 286, 1 meg of ram, AT keyboard, 40MB hard drive. This progressed via a 486/sx33/4m/170mb and at one point a pentium2 600 with (eventually) 96mb of ram, 2g hard drive, then a p3 of some sort, but after that it's just ""whatever"".

First decent computer I built was an AMD 5x86 133mhz with the larger cache module and a whopping 64mb ram that I'd traded for some ANSi work.  The irony is for some things it ran circles around the Pentiums that friends had, for others it just slogged.  Ran OS/2 warp like a beast though.  Ever since then, I've mostly maxed out the ram in my systems... I wend from 128gb down to 96GB for my AM5 build though since the most I've ever used is around 75gb, and I wanted to stick to a single pair at a higher speed.

At one point I had a Sound Blaster as well, which was nice. The floppy drive and the hard drive each have their own controller cards so there's almost no more room for expansion! The motherboard also has the keyboard and cassette (!!!) port. I get an error code about the cassette port so I doubt it would work but I never had the equipment to try it out anyway.

This does have downsides, and the author lists many. It also has some marginal upsides. For example running multiple distros for testing is trivial, and while the Windows file Explorer might be a shitshow that reached its peak over two decades ago it somehow seems to still be leagues ahead of the options in linux gui land. And of course the situation in gaming and content creation used to be way worse just a couple years ago, so for many switching only became viable relatively recently

Instead, get Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Debian, Zorin (the last one specifically for Windows users), or one of many other beginner-friendly distros, and drive it for a bit.

Because forcing updates down people's throat creates this, and boy do I hate Microsoft's insistence on doing this for drivers, where you get such fun things like Microsoft installing a different AMD GPU driver than the one that AMD gives out (this to be fair is partially to be blamed on AMD for not having just 1 versioning system) so then you have to go into safe mode, DDU, disconnect the internet, install the drivers, turn off automatic driver update in an obscure setting.Meanwhile on Linux it's literally 1 version that exists in the kernel.Ever since Wayland added support for changing mouse scroll speed & changing/customizing middle click behavior that is a lot more consistent, I've used Linux to daily drive, especially with immutable distros ensuring even IF an update breaks my system I can rollback.

I've moved to Kubuntu and haven't looked back. Proton support is amazing, and Claude Code fixes the doc-diving problem that used to plague Linux. In fact, with Claude, I was able to get such a buttery smooth setup on Kubuntu - Wezterm auto-saving and restorable sessions (even with multiple windows), a working fading background switcher with history, automounting drives and vhdx images on startup - and these are all relatively simple things, but they were near-frictionless to set up and they don't break on a random Tuesday.

Win11 really annoyed many users though. That's actually interesting, since Microsoft committed to it yet it gets harder for Microsoft to retain the people. Linux is unfortunately way too complex to really break the desktop system (and no, Wayland, GNOME, KDE, are not going to change any of that either), but if it were, Microsoft would probably have lost its de-facto monopoly already. Either way it is interesting how much people hate Win11. Microsoft really committed to driving down the cliff here.

The only thing that's caused any issue is power management, I'm fairly sure it's not optimal, but it's still better than Win11. That's purely down to lack of effort on my part, and basically setting it for max performance because it's not important to me for a desktop machine. Everything (and I mean everything - sound, video, wifi, bluetooth) else is 100% out of the box working on mid-range commodity hardware, albeit with excessive RAM for my needs. Some of it is a bit clumsy looking in places, but it did look weird on Windows too with some of the apps.When I did have trouble, it was not like I could get support from Microsoft as the community forum is a joke, but with Linux at least I stand a fighting chance of working around any potential problems.Is there anything on Windows I miss?

In all honesty, it was easy for me to switch to Linux because I was always more interested in the computer itself rather than what useful things I could do with it, so I actually never missed a particular application.

Can't seem to run any commands to recover either.Bricking Mint is annoying, but I was much more astonished that I saw so many people hold up Mint as this beacon of user friendly Linux distros, but to do even the most basic things, I had to start running commands on the shell.

Currently using https://getaurora.dev which is basically fedora + kde but curated by people that actually care. So codecs are preinstalled, and other sensible defaults out of the box which makes sense as its in the same family as bazzite (without the gaming focus).

The codec issues are caused by the companies that make them, not a free operating system.  Next time download an open codec movie or install from the “store” GUI.

reply

The problem is that when doing an extremely basic operation that works on every system I've used before, it doesn't work, and the most readily available advice on how to resolve the issue tells me to run commands. Regardless of the reasons why it is that way, it just simply isn't user friendly.

reply

Having to install codecs once every few years is a tiny inconvenience compared to the dystopia offered elsewhere.  
I also run commands on Win and Mac all the time to fix things.  For example Windows wastes tens of gigabytes of space unless you run a couple of inscrutable commands to free it.

Be cautious with running commands or making package changes based on suggestions from AI tools.

If you mess up and expose a Postgres container it will get hacked, but not escape the container, whereas if you install Postgres as a system package and make that same mistake you will be fully owned.

I know that some things are not as nice on Linux (ie you need to do MS365 in a browser for example, and MS365 files from a NAS in OnlyOffice is not great, etc). But other than that, I just love living in Gnome. What more do you need that just a clean desktop with some tiling, some virtual desktops, a clock, battery indicator and windows with your stuff? I don't even know. I like that I can set up Linux in 10 min.I recently set up a Windows 11 machine for a neighbor, it took so long! And it offered dozens of things I didn't want, to the point that I began feeling a bit nervous towards my neighbor (no you don't need that, no not that, no that's just tracking, no why would you want your desktop in the cloud?). Then when finished... it wasn't finished, I need printer drivers, an HP package with drivers and stuff for the BIOS etc etc etc. So much time.

There's an aphorism that I like to use every time someone tells me that Windows is the easy choice: Windows makes accomplishing easy tasks easy, and hard tasks impossible.To this day and for the past 20 years, every time I go back to my parents' house, it's Windows tech support time. Every time, I have to go through the same routine of cleaning up all sorts of crap that make their computer slow to a crawl, even when I purposely created non privileged accounts for them. Every time, the same ritual: diagnose why the printer stopped working, why apps look pixelated, why some sites stopped working.So, it works for my parents, and possibly works for the vast majority of people, because it has created this ecosystem where these users either depend on folks like me, or have to pay up at the repair shop. And somehow, something as simple as not breaking a critical component during an update, or prevent users from installing harmful stuff, has not been addressed properly. And that's without mentioning what Microsoft does that's very much anti-consumer, like stuffing the consumer versions of the OS with ads.

Every time, the same ritual: diagnose why the printer stopped working, why apps look pixelated, why some sites stopped working.So, it works for my parents, and possibly works for the vast majority of people, because it has created this ecosystem where these users either depend on folks like me, or have to pay up at the repair shop. And somehow, something as simple as not breaking a critical component during an update, or prevent users from installing harmful stuff, has not been addressed properly. And that's without mentioning what Microsoft does that's very much anti-consumer, like stuffing the consumer versions of the OS with ads.

Only to see this article today. lolI guess at this point, whatever works for you and your situation is what you should use and ignore all the static. I use Linux for the majority of my dev work, but have the inability to move off Adobe products for the photo and video processing work I do. Something I've found that Linux doesn't compete very well with MS and Apple. I would love to finally get off of one or the other, but I have one foot in each because they both excel in different areas.

I guess Adobe doesn't exactly have much to win by Windows failing, but their inaction does mean the open source alternatives will continue to get better, and that will hurt them.

I'm paraphrasing here but its something along the lines of:
""Linux users are open source people and expect everything for free. They'll never pay for our products, so we see no need to port them for Linux users because so few of them would be willing to pay for our products.""A lot of other comments are cheeky ones like, ""Adobe is already on a Linux OS, its called MacOS."" - rolls eyes-And you are correct, the OSS alternatives are getting better and closing the gap, but they're just not there yet - but I hold out hope they will be one day.

This tends to be better overall anyway, if you are really looking to switch. Dual booting is enough of a hassle that I've always ended up staying in whatever OS I felt required me to think I needed to dual boot, and the other aspirational OS gets forgotten.Going all-in requires that you figure out new workflows, find new software, or in some cases change what you use the computer for and accept it.I tried building a gaming PC, but I hated PC gaming. It felt like it was half sys admin work, half gaming... if the sys admin work went well that day. I dual booted it for a while, then ran straight Linux on it, and eventually sold it. I liked the idea of one box that did everything, but the reality of it wasn't so great. I now have computers I don't care about gaming on, and have consoles that require 0 effort and let me play games when I feel like playing games.

What mattered most at the beginning was good installation documentation, and both Arch and Slackware delivered on that front. Slackware, however, had an additional appeal: it was intentionally simple, largely because it was created and maintained by a single person at the time. That simplicity made it feel conceivable that the system could be fundamentally understood by a single human mind.Whether a newcomer appreciates the Slackware/Arch approach depends heavily on learning style and goals. You can click through a GUI installer and end up with a working distro, but then what? From a beginner's perspective, you've just installed something somehow—and it looks like a crippled Windows machine with fewer buttons.Starting with Slackware gave me a completely different starting reference point. Installing the system piece by piece was genuinely exciting, because every step involved learning what each component was and how it fit into the whole. The realization that Linux is essentially a set of Lego bricks—and that I might actually master the entire structure, or even build my own pieces—was deeply motivating.That mindset was strongly shaped by how Slackware and similar distros present themselves. Even the lack of automatic dependency management acted as an early nudge toward thinking seriously about complexity, trade-offs, and minimalism, which stayed with me forever.

Now, I still hold this belief in most regards. But I do see the appeal, especially if your friends and peers are gamers and actively play these sorts of games, and you feel that you're missing out on socialising or making new friends in that aspect. But there are plenty of other games and consoles, if you could just convince them to switch...

I don't like it personally but I do understand why they do it. It just means I can't play those games on Linux, and some studios just don't care.It's a shame that they don't care, though supporting such a minuscule percentage of the gaming market doesn't make a lot of sense unless out of principle/just do to it.

You absolutely can design a non-intrusive anticheat that doesn't hook into the kernel layer, and many games do exactly that. They do checks server-side, without hooking into your system. Or design their game to make it harder, eg if a player is behind a wall and can't be seen, don't even send the packets saying there's a player there.Even with invasive anticheat, any dedicated actor can (and usually eventually do) find ways around it, and it becomes a game of cat and mouse. I feel a similar way about DRM in general.Imo the tradeoff and danger is not worth it for consumers, but most are just not aware of the risk. Game developers take advantage of this and also do it because it's easier than actually designing their game in a way to minimise cheating (be it through code, or game mechanics)On a tangent, even though it's for the wrong reasons (Even if I were a full-time user and a fan of Windows,  I would not want to install games with invasive anticheat and pollute my system, out of principle), I'm glad that there is at least some pressure and pushback on invasive anticheat by gamers that usually run Windows, just for the reason so that it can run on something like a Steam Deck.

Some games do choose to go the route of server-side authority, only showing what the client should be able to see, though I understand that's super compute heavy. Final Fantasy XIV does something akin to this, but players still develop client-side plugins to make their lives easier (higher-than-allowed camera zoom-out, displaying hidden boss mechanics when the client receives them, etc)Cheats are also financially supported, specially in higher-profile games like Fortnite, Valorant, League of Legends, or similar, so the incentive to produce higher quality cheats exists.People have been caught by pretending to play but actually screensharing the view of a pro player on their account, so I suppose that won't cover this :P

Curiously, Office apps have auto-save, so does IntelliJ, VSCode, and even Notepad nowadays.. ""restore my work environment after a reboot"" almost works, but some things do disappear (e.g. unsaved web input forms) that it's aggravating enough. I wonder if they'll make it mandatory for apps to persist more across restarts.Ok, that requires them to be competent, if they're competent we won't even have what we have now.

This is kind of true. It depends on whether you're doing Serious Stuff on MICROS~1 365 and probably other similar services, because if you for example want to do a download of email or files or whatever from an account in the compliance portal, then they force you to use Edge on Windows. There's a browser module that can only run in that context, probably due to some deep and obscene integration between Edge for Windows and the operating system, plus they get users.Other than that I agree with the article. Windows has been way suckier than mainstream Linux distributions for a long, long time. Yes, there might be some driver or configuration issues sometimes, but it doesn't crash, it doesn't force system upgrade reboots, and Windows still has driver issues.Once set up a Linux system tends to just tick along for years, unless you do something weird, which is more likely under Linux because you'll probably let curiosity bring you around more than it easily can under Windows and you'll learn to do stuff that carries more risk than what a regular user can under Windows.And the nice part is that it is very rare that you actually, terminally brick your Linux. There is almost always some forum thread that tells you the steps to bring it back up again, whereas MICROS~1 support threads commonly consist of 'hello, did you try to reboot? if it didn't work, try reinstalling'.

No, my friend. It is not the reason. I have over 50 apps installed, many of which are corporate applications, such as Teams and other Microsoft products. VMwaresing VMWare and WSL foLinux distributionsnux distros. The other things that Linux is missing are ShareX (has flameshot I know), no WhatsApp (PWA might work, but it is a hack). Google Drive that I use to share my KeePass databases (no GDrive on Linux afaik). And gaming is not 100% with linux becuase of anti-cheat (author mentions it).The only thing stopping me from switching to Linux entirely is that I must find a way to port all of these without compromises. Reinstalling Windows is one thing; changing OS types is another. We all want to be Mr. Robots, but reality is different. It is like moving to a new house. Exciting but sucks.

Exploring popular options and finding what works for you is easier than it has ever been, and fun too. The difference between Linux today and the Linux of old is that for most setups, all the pieces you choose can fit together nicely and ""just work."" Despite all the different flavors and variations and distributions and desktop environments and window managers and the like, pretty much every popular distro uses a recent or near recent version of the monolithic Linux kernel + system-d, so all the important stuff is more or less the same (with tweaks here or there.)

Microsoft had a chance make even better OS than XP and 7 and convince millions of users to use Windows.Okay maybe with Office products the ocean was already red, but still, instead of disgusting its millions of users, they could make them happy.I am not a firm believer that GNU/Linux distributions are a drop-in replacement for Windows.

Right now and for the foreseeable near term (3 years or so?) it seems like the focus on GPU advancements isn't aimed at gaming so will be a period of stability, but I wonder if/when focus does come back to gaming, when there's a new round of consoles, when a company wants a new feature set to distinguish a new generation (like geforce 20 series versus 10 and earlier), what can be done to make sure linux users aren't second class citizens. I'd also wonder about development tools, to use the most popular engine as an example, what could change with unreal engine to make sure it builds software that plays nice with the linux ecosystem even if the tooling works best under windows.

That's a decent enough reason for a linux user to buy an AMD GPU but it isn't a good reason not switch to linux from a closed source OS.

In supporting a piece of cloud software with a lot of microservices I think this is a more generalized problem for humans. The app I work with demanded some logging requirements like the library to use. But that was it, different parts by different teams ended up with all kinds of different behaviors.As for the AI side, this is something where I see our limited context sizes causing issues when developing architecture across multiple products.

Context size isn't the issue. You cannot effectively leverage an infinite context if you had one anyways. The general solution is to recursively decompose the problem into smaller ones and solve them independently of each other, returning the results back up the stack. Recursion being the key here. A bunch of parallel agents on separate call stacks that don't block on their logical callees is a slop factory.

I've had to work in systems where events didn't share correlation IDs, I had to go in and filter entries down to microseconds to get a small enough number of entries that I could trace what actually happened between a set of services.From what I've seen in the enterprise software side of the world is a lot of companies are particularly bad at SRE and there isn't a great amount of standardization.

reply

Enterprise app observability is purely a responsibility of each individual application/project manager. There is virtually no standardization or even shared infra, a team just stuffing plaintext logs into an unconfigured elasticsearch instance is probably above median already. There is no visibility for anything across departments and more often that not, not even across apps in a department.

reply

These aren't challenging things to do for an experienced human at all. But it's such a huge pain point for these models! It's hard for me to wrap my head around how these models can write surprisingly excellent code but fail down in these sorts of relatively simple troubleshooting paths.

reply

Very few people start their careers as SREs, it's generally something they migrate into after enjoying it and showing aptitude for it.With that said, I wouldn't expect this wall to hold up for too long. There has been a lot of low hanging fruit teaching models how to code. When that is saturated, the frontier companies will likely turn their attention to honing training environments for SRE style debug.

When we ask it to generate an image, any image will do it. We couldn't care less. Try to sculpt it, try to rotate it 45 degrees and all hell breaks loose. The image would be rotated but the hair color could change as well. Pure vibes!When you ask it to refactor your code, any pattern would do it. You could rearrange the code in infinite ways, rename variables in infinite ways without fundamentally breaking logic. You could make as many arbitrary bullshit abstraction and call it good, as people have done it for years with OOP. It does not matter at all, any result would do it in this cases.When you want to hit an specific gRPC endpoint, you need an specific address and the method expects an specific contract to be honored. This either matches or it doesn't. 
When you wish the llms could implement a solution that captures specifics syscalls from specifics hosts and send traces to an specific platform, using an specific protocol, consolidating records on a specific bucket...you have one state that satisfy your needs and 100 requirement that needs to necessarily be fulfilled. It either meet all the requirements or it's no good.It truly is different from Vibing and llms will never be able to do in this. Maybe agents will, depending on the harnesses, on the systems in place, but one model just generate words words words with no care about nothing else

In general for those tasks though the question is more ""How would a human do it"". If it's impossible for a human because your tooling is so bad you can't even get the logs across services for a single ID, that seems like a pretty serious design issue.In general looking at the prompt though, this is also not very representative. You don't have an SOP that you can share with your agent? How do you expect new hires to onboard?

Eg. Facebook (i've worked at Meta and Google amongst others so a good way to compare extremes) is entirely a monolith. You type a line of code, hit refresh and you see it, running fully in the context of everything else your dev server does. It's still statically typed so a type error is seen quickly in the full context of everything that the server can do and in general there's just no impetus to move to microservices since the deployment of the monolith takes no time. Every server running Facebook runs the exact same image. That's not to say Hack is a perfect language or anything. It's basically PHP made to look and act like Java which isn't great, but the fact is you never ever think of how the code runs and interacts in context of the microservice environment. You don't need to. Everyone who's worked at Meta and Google has the opinion that Meta moves faster and this is part of the reason.Some companies have architectures that can't deploy like this. This is the reason you move to microservices. It's not at all a developer velocity win. It's just needed if you have frameworks that don't allow you to run and deploy ""all the code ever written in the company"" in a reasonable way. You need to break it up in modular pieces that have defined boundaries so that you only run the parts you need as you develop (defined boundaries are a dev win sure but that can be done without microservices).Google has gotten to the point where things are getting really fined grained and honesty chaotic. Moving to a portion of code to its own microservice is basically a promo bait 6 month project, often done without justification other than ""everything should be its own microservice"". In my time at Google i never heard ""what benefit do we get if this is a microservice?"" it's just assumed to always be a good thing. 50 interacting microservices to go through in a trace is at the point where the only place I've seen such a thing is Google.

First of all, familiarity with open telemetry apis is not knowledge, they are arbitrary constructs.We are implying that conforming to a standard is the only way, the right way. I would challenge that.Assuming models were good at this tasks, we could only conclude that this tasks were trivial AND sufficiently documented.
Assuming they were good at this type of tasks (they can be trained to be good cheaply, we know that based on similar acquired capabilities) making a benchmark out of it would be less useful.But I am sure nobody really cares and the author just had to SEO a little bit regardless of reality

I think you would see similar results if tasking an AI to e.g. write GRPC/Protobuf systems using only the builtin/official protobuf codegen languages.Where I think the benchmark is quite fair is in the solutions. It looks like for each of the languages (at least the ones I'm familiar with), the ""better"" options were chosen, e.g. using `tracing-opentelemtry` rather than `opentelemetry-sdk` directly in Rust.However the one-shot nature of the benchmark also isn't that reflective of the actual utility. In my experience, if you have the initial framework setup done in your repo + a handful of examples, they do a great job of applying OTEL tracing to the majority of your project.

This almost always correlates with customers having similar issues in getting things working.This has lead us to rewrite a lot of documentation to be more consistent and clear. In addition we set out series of examples from simple to complex. This shows as less tickets later, and more complex implementations being setup by customers without the need for support.

Cheap money amplified this cycle, but this isn't a tech specific ""failure"", it's just how forecasting under uncertainty work.It's incredible how some engineers assume they understand economics, then proceed to fail on some of its most basic premises. This tends to happen when engineering-style certainty is applied to systems that are driven by incentives and uncertainty.

But factory workers usually require specialized machinery, tooling, and physical capacity, which makes overhiring slower, harder and more constrained. 
Those investments force more deliberate planning.By contrast, engineers mostly require a laptop and company hoodie... 
That low marginal cost makes it far easier to hire aggressively on expectations and unwind just as aggressively when those expectations change.

Lines with specialty equipment and tooling can also often be sped up. That can allow for other jobs to be added to all the functions that support the processes involved before and after the specialty equipment.New employees also often require training and some apprenticeship time, meaning they can get hired ahead of actual demand.

in tech cost of hiring is lower which makes headcount a much easier speculative bet and layoffs a much easier reset when the bet fails.

My experience with seeing new shifts added is initially with only specific processes, and even with those it is with journeyman level technicians running a small crew to support relieving a bottleneck in production.Alternatively, manufacturers can outsource until they have enough volume to add a shift, but across the economy the net is just transferring production from one facility to another.

>  That low marginal costNot true. That's how everything falls apart. Scaling software teams isn't simple. There's lots to account for. Do you just assume everyone commit to the same file and let it crash?The more people, the more work is required to standardize, organize, document and fix gaps. You can say you're already at scale and things ""should"" be done but they never are. You hire a team into a specific area to find it was a giant hack supported by a part-timer and as you try to fix it the problems keep escalating.

Does anyone know what the typical tool cost is for a factory worker?(And the tool cost for a factory worker can be zero if you're hiring for a second shift - they would use the same tools as the first shift, just at different times.  In contrast, I don't think there are very many places that ask programmers to use the same laptop in shifts.)

So, eventually they recoup the equipment costs, wouldn't get surprised if they even make a profit out of it sometimes.First thing they do, they write off VAT (20-23% of laptop price). Then at the EOL, they just set the EPP price to the higher market value. And return the cost.

Software engineers are stupid, often because they think they are very smart (which breeds arrogance). And on top of that, they often have many biases that they often fail to account for (e.g. a preference for neat-and tidy-systems, leading them to get seduced by oversimple neat-and-tidy explanations, e.g. Econ 101).

The current crop of tech companies cutting staff is going to lead to a large number of dead giants. The staff who services the layoffs will be risk averse, and defensible in a job cut situation. You see this in legacy firms where it takes 10 people to make a change because each person has a small slice of permissions required to effect the change. This pattern is by design as laying of any of the ten people on different teams would kill dozens of critical business processes.This is not how you make high growth firms.

Manufacturers can't hire beyond the places in production that someone can stand and do something. There needs to be some kind of equipment or process for worker to contribute in some meaningful way, even if it is merely for a projection of increased production (e.g., hiring a second shift for a facility currently running one shift).What I wonder is if in tech, the ""equipment"" is a computer that supports everything a developer needs. From there, new things can be added to the existing product.Manufacturing equipment is generally substantially more expensive than a computer and supporting software, though not always. Might this contribute to the differences, especially for manufacturing that normally runs 24-hour shifts?

The deeper problem is poorly qualified workers and hard to identify talent. It's easy to over hire, and then fire, when everyone generally sucks and doesn't matter. If the average employed developer is excellent at what they deliver these people would be easy to identify and tough to fire like engineers, doctors, and lawyers.

Stellar developers are one step better.  Yes, they too delivery excellent products, but they also produce things of value that nobody asked for.  Business examples include Teflon, Postit Notes, antibiotics, linux, git, and much more.The US Army changed leadership methodologies about 20 years ago to account for this.  The current leadership philosophy is called Mission Command.  In the fewest possible words a leader provides a stated intent and then steps back to monitor while subordinate leaders exercise their own creative initiative to meet that intent.  The philosophy before that was called Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).  MDMP required leadership buy in for each step of a process from among a set of discussed courses of action.  MDMP is now largely relegated to small personnel teams.

For example no company I ever worked for (maybe 7 over 20 years) needed publishing academics. Is the fact that you published a book about some DB architecture 10 years ago going to make you a better team member and deliver things faster? Maybe, or maybe not, how could hiring folks know? You measure and judge what you can, ignore the rest since it can be + or - and you have no clue, not even about probability spread.Doctors with many licenses may be better, or maybe they like studying more than actually working with patients and thus be possibly even worse than average, how do you want to measure that? A stellar doctor may simply have no time to do anything beyond her/his current work due to also dedicating time to their family and raising children. Quality of a doctor, especially surgeons is mostly function of work already performed (knowing closely tens of doctors from all branches they themselves often claim this), not some extra papers. And so on and on.

The actual problem is that developers are made into a commodity because they are an unvalued cost center. Developers do not make money. They only take money. So, the goal is to not train them and replace them as conveniently as possible.The result is to not look for talent but instead equate the requirements to a lowest common denominator. That minimizes personnel management friction at cost to everything else. We all know this.  The real concern for developers is why that is allowed to occur in software but not other professions.

We have been able to move our ""low cost"" work out of India to eastern Europe, Vietnam and the Philippines; pay per worker more, but we need half as many (and can actually train them).Although our business process was already tolerant of low cost regions producing a large amount of crap; seperate teams doing testing and documentation...It's been more of a mixed bag in the ""high skill"" regions, we have been getting more pushback against training, people wanting to be on senior+ teams only, due to the llm code produced by juniors.

LLM's are at least a 10x speed up on the 'producing code' portion of the job, but that's often only a fraction of the overall job.  There's lots of time spent planning and in meetings, doing research, corporate red tape, etc.For writing code and unit tests, generating deployment yaml and terraform, for me it's easily a 30x speed up.  I can do in 1 or 2 hours what would have previously taken a week.

And to that end, having the abiliy to pump out small, focused apps can be really beneficial.

Also from what I've seen is big city hospitals use a mix of all three. Which I believe actually creates an opening as it shows a willingness to use different walled gardens.However I think there are a lot of opportunities to just build on top of these systems rather than wholesale replace. Because they're one size fits all and the people who work on them haven't a single designer bone in their body the interfaces are terribly clunky and slow. Macros exist but seemingly no one is aware of them. It's rife to build better interfaces tied into macros behind the scenes.

The behemoths exist especially, but not exclusively, in that space because regulations (correctly) are steep. In the case of hospital systems you're talking both the management and protection of both employee and patient data. That's not to say of course that the behemoth's are particularly good at that, it's merely that if the hospital rolls it's own solution, as you suggest, they then take on the liability should that system go wrong. On the other side, if Epic has a data breach, every hospital shrugs it's shoulders. It isn't their problem. And, even more fundamentally, if Epic as a product sucks ass... well. The employees didn't choose it, neither did the patients, leadership did.You see these relationships (or lack thereof) all over the place in our modern world, where the people doing the work with these absurdly terrible tools are not given any decision-making power with regard to which tools to use. Hell, at my workplace, we actually have some in that leadership asks if we're happy with our various HR softwares and things, but fundamentally, they all pretty much suck and we're currently sitting at the least shitty one we could find, which is far from a solid fit for our smaller company. But it's the best we can do because none of these suites are designed to be good for people to use, they're designed to check a set of legal and feature checkboxes for the companies they sell to.Honestly I don't know how you fix this, short of barring B2B SAAS as an entire industry. Time was, when you wanted to run a sales company, you had to run your own solution to keeping track of internal data. Salesforce didn't exist. You had rows upon rows of file cabinets, if there was a fire data was a lost, if a disgruntled worker stole your sales list and sold it to a competitor, that was it's own issue to deal with. Now crooks can crack the locks off of NetSuite and steal your whole fucking business without even knowing where the hell your HQ even is or caring for that matter, and our business universe if you will is bifurcated all to hell as a result. Companies are engaged in constant games of ""pin the legal responsibility on someone else"" because to compete, they need internet and software based sales and data management systems, but building those systems is a pain in the ass, and then you're responsible if they go wrong.

  2. Craftsmanship revival - Companies learn that the ""disposable workforce"" model ships garbage, and there's renewed appreciation for experienced engineers who stick around                 
  3. Consulting/contractor becomes default - Full-time employment becomes rare; most devs work project-to-project like other creative industries                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                              
The article argues AI isn't the cause, but it seems like it could accelerate whatever trend is already in motion.

#2 there will always be craftsmanship companies, but they will always be small companies, or a small team within a big organization. Craftsmanship doesn't scale; engineering does.#3 contracting won't become the default. Many places have experimental or well-contained projects, or not enough ongoing work for full-time, but anywhere that custom-built software is important to the business will always need changes and maintenance. The problem with using contractors is that after their contract is over, they go find another contract, so they may not be available when you would like to re-use them, and then you've got to start over with a new one.

I'm in the tech industry and have been doing this for 12+ years now. In the beginning, it was because I wanted to live overseas for a few years, without a break in my career.Now, it's about survival. I buy my own health insurance (me and my family) in the marketplace every year (so I'm not tied to an employer), work with multiple clients (I never really have to worry about getting laid off), and make much more than a FTE.While all my friends in tech are getting laid off or constantly in fear of getting laid off, I don't have to worry.I also find that because I touch so many different technologies, I have to turn down work. I turned down a company last year, that wanted me in-house and one this year that would have been too demanding on my schedule.It's also flexible and always remote.

Those were also iterative processes: first tires and mud houses, then horse carriages and brick houses, and eventually cars and buildings.In that sense, it's not fundamentally different from engineering today. Working on core engineering functionality of a company is essentially the same kind of process.The difference lies in whether you're working on core functionality, or on some iterative experiment that nobody knows will succeed.

Software developers are doing R&D, you create new stuff that continues to exist forever. This is unlike most jobs, in which you produce goods and services that are consumed and then you have to produce them again.What if we are getting to the point where all of the low-hanging stuff is invented? For example, every bank has an app which works and rarely needs to be changed. Or take a social network like Facebook, going from zero to a product with 1B users took a lot of development but since then, it's been mostly static, why employ thousands of developers dedicated to Facebook? Etc.

Before ai, all we had was compilers and interpreters to take instructions and turn them into machine code and byte codeA lot of political painstaking went into which compilers and even with “better options” there's only really a couple big fish of workflows to take an orgs ideas to production.What passes as a compiler and what passes for a programming language exploded.I'm very interested in “the final compile target” of these systems AND the output of that still being human readable and influenceable.

In a well-functioning competitive market, no company should be able to rest on its laurels. The problem is industries have consolidated and trustbusters are nowhere to be found.Notice when tech is new (the web, smart phones, AI) there's an initial burst of competitive companies? That's because the market hasn't consolidated yet. Ask yourself how many dot-com millionaires would realistically be able to duplicate their success in 2026, given the same product but launching today.Aside from consolidation, discoverability is a huge problem, especially in the era of AI slop. Building a superior product is easy, getting it noticed and building traction is hard.

This is interesting, in my experience its seemed to be the opposite.In manufacturing, its must easier to come up with a specific number of employees you need for a given project or contract.If the contract is expected to sign you may hire early to get ahead of it.If the contract falls through, or an existing contract is cancelled, you know exactly how many people you need to cut to balance labor with your current commitments.

If you are starting a dry cleaning business, you have a cost of the equipment, rent and other well known factors.  Starting a tech company in a new and unproven area has different expenses and a different risk/reward profile.Malinvestment can come in a lot of flavors. Cheap capital will result in too many dry cleaners and also too many startups that probably shouldn't have gotten funding.The downside comes in various forms. 1) existing dry cleaning businesses are less profitable because of increased competition, and 2) startups hire scarce engineers and drive up wages, which drive up costs for everyone.Cheap capital is justified bc the goal is growth, but it is a blunt instrument that creates hot spots and neglected areas simultaneously.  Compare the approach used in the US with the approach taken by China. Chinese firms face significantly more competition than firms in the capitalist US, but overall China's policies are crafted with a more deliberate eye toward their distributional consequences and notions of the greater good are much more subject to sharp critique and pressure across social and industrial strata.What we are seeing in the US is that policymakers have come to believe that the growth-focused approach is an escape hatch that can be used to reduce the effects of other bad decisions, but at some point the size of the inflated economy gets big enough that it takes on a political life of its own -- post-911 defense contractors have dramatically more lobbying and policy-influencing power than they had prior.  Today, systemically risky financial industry participants have significantly more political clout than they had before the 2008 correction.In other words, the fabric of (political) reality shifts and it becomes hard to identify what normal would look like or feel like.  In my view, AI adds fuel to the existing fire -- it rapidly shifts demand away from software engineers and onto strategists -- give the team a strategy and now with AI the team will have it done in a few weeks. If not, a competitor will do it without poaching anyone from your team.And market forces include both creative and destructive forces. Firm failure is a feature, not a bug.

This then causes the market to dry up again and if the interest rate hasn't dropped even further then a lot of companies that need follow up investment will now get killed off.

Meanwhile in China, the approach is fundamentally different. Capital isn't just cheap; it's strategically directed by the state with goals beyond financial return. The aim is ""new quality productive forces"" -- slow-burn, systemic growth that reinforces social stability and industrial upgrade, not a boom-bust race for unicorns.The current AI boom is our real-time experiment to see if this is the ""better way."" The U.S. model, as you note, is driven by massive private investment (over $109B in 2024) and is prone to hype cycles. China's model is state-planned, focusing on the ""AI Plus"" integration of technology across its industrial base, despite investing less ($9.3B) and facing constraints like advanced semiconductor access.We're watching two competing logics: one seeking market-defining breakthroughs through volatile, capital-intensive competition, and another pursuing broad-based, stability-oriented technological integration. The results of this test will show which system better transforms capital into lasting, system-wide advantage.

2. Central banks rotating into gold to de-risk from USD combined with their usual slow bureaucratic processes. By the time they've decided that gold needs to be bought, the price has already run up by 50% and it's no longer a good idea to buy, but they still need to execute on their decisions anyway.The USD isn't going anywhere for the simple reason that the USA can simply counterfeit any non-USD currency and there's nothing the issuer can do about it, whereas if anyone tries to counterfeit USD, they should expect a nice little missile to land inside their room no matter where they are in the world. ""Reserve currency"" status is entirely based on how effective the issuing entity is at taking care of counterfeiting.

It's a values problem, not an opportunity problem. Tech industry management is locked in a death spiral because it lacks the ethics or the vision to create real value, as opposed to extractive predatory value.This applies equally to consumer relationships and employee relationships. The default value is ""How can I screw these people over to get more of what I want?""And that is - ironically - a failure of brain chemistry and emotional regulation.Because making number go up is a catastrophic addiction in its own right.

Perhaps a bit of a hot take but I'd be inclined to disagree. The boom in big tech is I think almost exclusive driven by dopamine, brain rot and ad tech either directly or indirectly. Meta and Google - almost entirely ad funded. Netflix - binge watching and they're trying hard to force more ads in. Apple makes the black rectangle to watch the content and ads - without the iPhone 1 doomscrolling wouldn't be a thing. Amazon runs an ad empire, produces video content for binge watching and has a store designed to maximise consumerism and retail therapy.Even the portions that are more infra like AWS - I'd bet a large portion of that fulfilling demand by things that are part of the attention/dopamine economy. All those TikTok dances aren't served off a raspberry pi.Don't get me wrong not trying to discount tech as not having genuine ethical value or opportunities not existing. But the explosive growth seen in tech over past 20 years specifically is I think almost exclusively driven by adtech and attention economy.And if that reaches saturation either this changes tracks to similar on AI or the growth plateaus. Other value creation certainly exists and is valid but I don't see it filling the shoes of adtech.Google and meta indirectly acknowledged the problem years ago already with their balloons over Africa to connect more eyeballs to the internet plan. If you can't force feed more ads to current user base then you need more users. It's telling I think that a wild plan like balloons in Africa was the plan selected, rather than going for the countless other valuable opportunities as you say. Speaks to the relative profitability

Firing people in most of Europe is still not as easy as it is in the US.The opposite is also true, it's not that easy to leave your employer and you have to give 1/3/6 months notice before leaving, depending on your role/seniority/contract.Sometimes companies even make you sign 12 months notice contracts clause where they pay you a fixed monthly bonus but you can't leave without giving a 12 months notice, my SO has signed one.

Down sizing is a perfectly legal reason to fire people in Europe, and it happens all the time when big companies do mass firings. The difficult part is getting to choose which individuals to fire.

2. American companies find every time that doing layoffs is very hard for them in Europe. Most recently Amazon, which, unable to lay off their people in Milan went through secondary tactics like demanding Return To Office (from people that signed hybrid or fully remote contracts) and other tactics involving mobbing or generous severance packages (up to 1 year in salary). Still, if the worker said no it was no.

Tech changed a lot from 2010 to 2020. Prior to 2010 almost everything built required a huge amount of development effort, and in 2010 there was still a huge amount of useful stuff to be built.Remember – prior to 2010 a lot of major companies didn't even have basic e-commerce stores because the internet was still a desktop thing, and because of this it really only appealed to a subsection of the population who were computer literate.Post 2010 and post iPhone the internet broadened massively. Suddenly everyone was online and companies now had to have an e-commerce store just to survive. Only problem was that there wasn't a Shopify or even npm to build from... So these companies had to hire armies of engineers.Similarly there was no Uber, online banking was barely a thing, there was no real online streaming services, etc, etc, etc...During this time almost everything had to built by hand, and almost everything being built was a good investment because it was so obviously useful.Around 2015 I realised that e-commerce was close to being a solved problem. Both in how most major companies had built out fairly good e-commerce stores, and also in how it was becoming relatively easy for someone to create an e-commerce store with almost no tech skills with solutions like Shopify.I'd argue somewhere between 2010 and 2020 the tech industry fundamentally changed. It become less about building useful stuff like search engines, social media sites, booking systems, e-commerce stores, etc – these were the obvious use cases for tech. Instead the tech industry started to transition to building what can only be described as ""hype products"" in which CEOs would promise similar profits and societal disruption as the stuff built before, except this time the market demand was much less clear.Around this time I noticed both I and people I knew in tech stopped building useful stuff and were building increasingly more abstract stuff which was difficult to communicate to non-technical folks. If you asked someone what they did in tech around this time they might tell you that their company are disrupting some industry with the blockchain or that they're using machine learning pick birthday cards using data sourced from Twitter.I used to bring this up to people in tech but so many people in tech at this time had convinced themselves that the money was rolling in because they were just so intelligent and solving really hard problems.In reality the money was rolling in because of two back to back revolutions – the internet and the smart phone. These demanded almost all industries made a significant investment in technology, and for a decade or so those investments were extremely profitable. Anyone working in tech profited from those no-brainer technical investments.Post-2015 the huge amount of capital in tech and the cheap money allowed people to spend recklessly on the ""next big thing"" for many years. 2015 to 2020 was such an amazing time to be in tech because people were basically throwing money at you to build literally anything.But time's up now. Companies are realising that a lot of the money they invested in tech in recent years isn't profitable and isn't even that useful. So now they're focusing in on delivering value and building up profit margins.The tech market isn't broken, it's coming back down to reality. Like railway workers post the boom we must face that most of the core infrastructure has now been built. A few of us will stick around making the odd improvement and maintaining what's already there, but that boom isn't coming back. Many of us will need to seek new professions.

Big product companies with big products are solved problems in their respective fields. Building an Amazon or a Facebook is quite a lot of work. Maintaining it is much less work.For a while the industry has done a thing where you do e.g. infrastructure in five different ways across ten different teams across three departments. It created a lot of “work” but it didn't create much additional value.Another instance of this was myriad “internal products” with the idea that some of them will be blockbusters because Paul Buchheit built Gmail as a 20% project in days of yore. That didn't go so well, either.You get the feeling that all this merry but ultimately futile kerfuffle was done to fuel the hype of growth but the actual job positions were completely uncoupled from revenue growth. For a time this was hard to see while global expansion was happening. Revenue was growing rapidly and so was headcount. It seemed to check out, arithmetically, but it's not sensible. It doesn't take twice as many workers to service twice as many employees in this industry.When the global expansion didn't have anywhere else to expand to and revenue stopped growing,  the workforce-sustaining illusion fell apart. Now those companies are unloading everyone but the skeleton crew it takes to maintain the products. That's a lot of people.

For a time this was hard to see while global expansion was happening. Revenue was growing rapidly and so was headcount. It seemed to check out, arithmetically, but it's not sensible. It doesn't take twice as many workers to service twice as many employees in this industry.When the global expansion didn't have anywhere else to expand to and revenue stopped growing,  the workforce-sustaining illusion fell apart. Now those companies are unloading everyone but the skeleton crew it takes to maintain the products. That's a lot of people.

You and your good reasoning, but it means nothing to me.Many of us will seek new a profession indeed: AI engineer. AI engineers mostly write code, but they are superior to software engineers...from the eyes of investors.AI engineers mainly build abstract stuff: SaaS. They kill who the investors currently love the most: managers. 90% all managers will be replaced. 100 managers can be replaced with 10 managers and 10 security guards.Then they kill 70% of the doctors, lawyers, and salesmen.Then they kill 50% of the software engineers.Then white becomes blue, and the eyes shift towards energy, transportation, and construction. The AI engineer, writes code like an AI, and notices these giant companies are sick. They can lobby all they want but the AI engineer and the AI lawyer will win.Everybody who laughs now about software engineers being replaced has become serious, for the AI engineer has replaced the software engineer.Let's see who is right in 2035.

“Efficiency” is a damned lie. Enterprise IT is one of the most inefficient spaces out there, full of decades of band-aids layered atop one another in the form of fad products, fancy buzzwords, and “defining leadership” projects. The reason you cannot get shit done at work quickly isn't because of bureaucracy or management layers standing in the way so much as it's the vested interest in weakening IT and Ops teams so that those higher-ups can retain more of the profit pie for themselves.My entire job is to make technology become so efficient that it fades into the background as a force amplifier for your actual work, and I've only spent ~1/3rd of my 15+ year career actually doing that in some form. I should be the one making sure documentation is maintained so that new hires onboard in days, not months. I should be the owner of the network and/or compute infrastructure the business needs to operate, not some MSP in another country whose contract you'll replace with a lower bidder next year. I should be the one driving improvements to the enterprise technology stack in areas we could benefit from, not some overpriced consultant justifying whatever the CIO has a hard-on for from his recent country club outing.Consultants, outsourcing, and fad-chasing aren't efficient. They do not better the business, overwhelmingly. AI won't magically fix broken pipelines, bad datasets, or undocumented processes, because it is only ever aware of what it is told to be aware of, and none of those groups have any interest or incentive in actually fixing broken things.The tech industry is woefully and powerfully inefficient. It hoards engineers and then blocks them from solving actual problems in favor of prestige projects. It squanders entire datacenters on prompt ingestion and token prediction instead of paying a handful of basically competent engineers a livable salary to buy a home near the office and fucking fix shit. Its leaders demand awards and recognition for existing, not for actually contributing positively back to society - which leads to stupid and short-sighted decision-making processes and outcomes.And all of this, as OP points out, is built on a history of government bailouts for failures and cheap debt for rampant speculation. There's no incentive to actually be efficient or run efficient businesses, and this is the resultant mess.

Software companies have much higher profit margins than companies that ship physical products. There really aren't many industries that do better margins than software.To sell software, you don't need a production facility, warehouse, nor do you even need an office building if you don't want one.https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile...

The point of my comment is that a subjective anecdote from a very limited perspective isn't telling a good story about why the industry is the way it is. You said these businesses aren't efficient but they have extremely high profit margins, which objectively paints a different picture: they are sufficiently efficient. They are more efficient than most other businesses.All this financial risk in the industry where employees are over-hired and low interest rate VC funds are thrown around haphazardly is accepted because even a modestly successful software business has high profit margins.The investors that funded less than $10 million to Airbnb's series A ended up a significant shareholder of a company that has the same market cap as PNC Financial Services in less than 20 years. PNC spent 180 years getting to that size.Software-driven products have huge profit potential and they can grow fast.If you think I'm being some kind of pedantic loser, fine, so be it. You can put the blindfolds on and ignore a data-supported viewpoint.

As far as I'm concerned, the main purpose of IT is to automate work. Tech companies make these systems of automation and provide them to other industries, so they can automate.Making a program or an IT system is something you only do once. So once it is completed, it is expected that a lot of people who helped make it have to go. It's like building a skyscraper. Massive amounts of work to build it, and when it's finished, most workers have to move on.Of course an IT company can continue to expand into perpetuity, but what if they don't have the leadership talent or resources to create a new giant project after one has been finished? Then the sensible thing is to down-size.""Well don't hire too many people in the first place to rush your project into completion"" - Then you get left behind.

And it describes why states in Nigeria have such a strong incentive to fake their population numbers, that it's impossible to achieve an accurate national total.I do think the headline exaggerates, I doubt ""a lot"" are fake, but some do seem to be.

No it doesn't. It says the UN came up with a different estimate, which the UN wound up not adopting. There is no evidence that the UN estimate actually used better methods.> I do think the headline exaggerates, I doubt ""a lot"" are fake, but some do seem to be.I am strictly arguing against ""a lot"" being fake, and specifically that an isolated example is not evidence of ""a lot.""

If you pick any country and look at proxies that have significant cost associated with them, at relative population levels of verified locations, the population of the world differs pretty radically from the claims most countries put out.If you don't have independent verification free from censorial pressures and legal repercussions, then you get propaganda. This is human nature, whether it stems from abuse of power or wanting to tell a story that's aspirational or from blatant incompetence or corruption.Population numbers fall under the ""lies, damned lies, and statistics"" umbrella.

“entire countries” of population spans a range from single-digit hundreds to over a billion, so this could describe anything from an imperceptible error to an enormous one in China's case.

I'm sure the various high-end intelligence agencies have a much better view on this than the public does. All kinds of ways of cross-checking the numbers, all by doing things they'll be doing in their normal course of events.A normal person could probably do a decent job with an AI that isn't too biased in the direction of ""trust gov numbers above all else"" and tracking down and correlating some statistics too obscure and too difficult to fake. (Example: Using statistical population sampling methodology on some popular internet service or something.) The main problem there being literally no matter what they do and how careful they are, they'd never be able to convince anyone of their numbers.

That's not scientific. There's no verification or validation of data.Your default assumption should be to question authority, especially if authority claims sole dominion over claims of fact, like ""this is our population, because we say so.""They are humans with power, therefore they lie. If you don't have accountability feedback, you can never, ever check those lies, so you rely on proxies and legitimate models.I highly recommend researching proxies you understand and can trust, and developing an understanding of the models that exist, and how to estimate confidence over a bounded range of values.I don't think China has only 500 million people - that's a little silly. But I also don't think they have 1.4 billion, either, especially since one of their main justifications for that is ""hey, we have this many phone accounts!"" - their population control policies, their population decline, their cultural preference for male children and infant femicide, and so on don't jive with simple models of population growth based on human population growth constraints. If there's a deviation between properly error bounded models of populations over time in the hundreds of millions over the highest reasonably bounded value, something is suspicious.You can take your reasonably bounded model and correlate with proxies - if the verifiable evidence supports the model over the claims, you can be more confident in the model than the claims.Reliable proxies that can't be faked are difficult, and better models are going to be needed in the future as we get into AI slopageddon territory, where you can trivially fabricate entire identities and histories for billions of nonexistent people, even establishing social webs and histories for all of them, statistically indistinguishable from real people.To perform a census, you need models constructed from verifiable data and first principles reasoning, with Bayesian certainty attached to each and every contributing factor, and then you need to set probabilistic bounds based on known levels of variability in things like population growth rates. Once you have an upper and lower bound, you can assign a certainty measure to the official claims - something like ""this has a .01% chance of being true"" - that's a good indication that reality diverges from those claims.

Fake simply means not genuine. It doesn't require the people reporting it to have a real estimate. It simply requires the people reporting it to just not try finding the real number.

reply

I'm trying to think of a definition, and the best I can come up with is this: fake means the number was modified at some point without an auditable trail. For example, if I see 1 deer on a sq km and I extrapolate linearly to a 100 sq km area that there are 100 deer in that area, then the number is fake if I don't disclose the extrapolation -- and this is true even if the actual number is in fact 100 in reality.Actually, I don't even think this covers all the bases, because it assumes there was an initially factual measurement. For example, if it that one observed deer was in fact a statue, the numbers are all fake even if everyone documented everything and acted in good faith and accidentally came up with true correct number at the end...

That sounds a very strange expectation. Most of my life post university I realized most of questions have complex answers, it is never as simple as you expect.If the author would check how things biology and medicine work currently, I think he will have even more surprises than the fact that counting populations is an approximate endeavor.

>But it's good to be reminded that we know a lot less about the world than we think. Much of our thinking about the world runs on a statistical edifice of extraordinary complexity, in which raw numbers—like population counts, but also many others—are only the most basic inputs. Thinking about the actual construction of these numbers is important, because it encourages us to have a healthy degree of epistemic humility about the world: we really know much less than we think.

What's missing more often than not, across fields of study as well as levels of education, is the overall commitment to conceputal integrity. From this we observe people's habitual inability or unwillingness to be definite about what their words mean - and their consequent fear of abstraction.If one is in the habit of using one's set of concepts in the manner of bludgeons, one will find many ways and many reasons to bludgeon another with them - such as if a person turned out to be using concepts as something more akin to clockwork.

Reality is such that, without integrity, you can prove almost anything you want. As long as your bar for ""prove"" is at the very bottom.

That's one source of bias that is present at a specific time. Mostly you would have competing incentives. There is usually more than one agency that runs does the counting. Vital records registration, voter rolls and tax payers lists, for example are separate agencies in some countries. Not every tax payer is a voter and not everyone who was born still lives in the country. The sources are sometimes cross-referenced too. Then there is usually a place that needs to do macroeconomic forecasting and needs to have some numbers to do it's job.

While I agree that the claim that world population is under 1 billion is bonkers, I also think he grossly underestimates how frequent and large the fraud is.Take Venezuela for example, the UN and several NGO's have confirmed a diaspora caused by chavismo of well over 7 million people. This is not recognized by the venezuelan government and is not reflected in any of the stats pages you can find.That's a 20-30% difference in the real vs reported population of the country.And yes. They do fake the elections.

I worked at an NGO in the region and made several duty travel trips to PNG.  The office building I was working in had a platoon of security guards and metal detectors in the lobbies of every floor.  A local employee kept an M-16 and ammunition locked in the server room.  We had to have security escorts to travel anywhere outside of downtown Port Moresby.  Coworkers shared stories of being carjacked like you or I might relate losing a phone.

It's true that westerners visiting nations like PNG for work are often cloistered behind elaborate security. This is in part because the organization has legal responsibility for sending those workers, and the deterrent security measures are way less expensive than the legal and PR headache of an incident. In addition, well-funded and highly organized foreign businesses attract local ire in ways that random individuals do not.In any one of those countries at any given time there are also foreigners passing through on travel or less organized work (e.g. academia) who experience the country without that thick security layer… and are perfectly fine.

And like the article suggests it can be deliberate too. Am extremely skeptical of population figures in some parts of former Soviet Union. The official demographic loss figures in WW2 had tripled since 1945 but post-war census figures were never revised. That could easily account for the ""demographic collapse"" of 1990s.

If you're the neighbor of some country that has a number of natural resources you'd like to get a hold of then you want to do things like formulate battle plans. If you have to make a plan to conquer 10 million people, it's going to be a bit different than one for 5 million people. The 10 million one is going to take longer. And then when you figure out that country is using deception to bolster its population numbers you have to figure where they lied about these numbers. Is it everywhere, is it in the place you want to invade. Is the population actually higher where you want to invade but lower in the rest of the country. Now you have to invest in doing your own general population and capability counts to make sure you don't step 10 feet deep in a 2 foot deep pool.

Look at the size of the country (around 1/3 of USA) and the number of people living there (112M according to wikipedia), also 1/3 of USA. So the density should be about the same but when you look at satellite photos it's one giant city (18M), several smaller cities and the endless forest. Can it support other 90M people?

Even if I take your numbers at face value, it is absolutely possible for this math to math. To simplify massively, if the average person dies at 80 years old, the population growth today depends on the number of births 80 years ago, compared to today. Not 30 years ago. The population may have grown massively between 30 and 80 years ago, so that the absolute number of births remains high, despite a low birth rate.

reply

And this fits for China where the standard of living has massively increased. What would throw off most Americans is that in 1962 the average life expectancy in China was only 50 years old, and has increased to roughly 78 today. 28 additional years of life is huge and it was so rapid that it would create a massive increase in population.This also reverses causality on the one child population rule. They didn't add the rule because their population was huge at the time, it was added because increased life expectancy with nothing else would have increased their population now to something like 1.7 to 2 billion.

What we consider developing nations can quite often just go without these items. Economies in these countries can have rapid swings that cause massive changes in consumption. Shortages of medicines in one year can massively increase child deaths in the first year, where as the next 5 years don't have an issue with that.With the last one, maybe there is a tik-tok trend that makes beans popular for a year, and then it dies out and half as many beans are consumed. This also isn't counting the average calorie consumption in a country. 10 cans of beans in the US might feed 20-30 people in another country when supplemented from locally grown items.Shit's hard, yo.

There are some forms of depression that you cannot think or act your way out of. If you haven't experienced that, I promise that you do not understand what it is like. You cannot really understand unless you have experienced it. Your opinion on it is irrelevant, and frequently offensive.The same is true for people that say that antidepressants are mostly placebo.

B: When people say that antidepressants saved their life, they aren't joking or exaggerating in the least.Are placebos unable to save lives?Not claiming antidepressants are or are not mostly placebo, and don't mean to minimize the pain of depression in anyway. I just don't think whether or not they saved a person's life is an indication either way. The placebo effect is real, right? As in the subject actually gets better after taking it.> Keep your pet theories to yourself if you are not a subject matter expert or someone who has experienced it first hand.This is the internet, friend. I wish you the best, but maybe don't put too much hope into that one. I think you'll have better luck cultivating the ability to be comfortable having your own beliefs while others have different (possibly wrong!) ones.

It's like if we took sleeping pills every time we had trouble sleeping. Having said that, I just realised I have the impression that's exactly what people do in the USA?

reply

Luckily, sertraline was an almost instant cure.I can come off it for periods, but it tends to reoccur after a while. So, it does mean I have to take a drug indefinitely, but is that really a problem? It turns my life into one worth living.The reason we can't take sleeping pills daily is because they stop working in fairly short order. But if, like antidepressants (typically), they didn't lose their effectiveness over time, would there even be a problem with using sleeping pills if you had trouble sleeping?

They also give you low quality sleep, because they just knock you out. It's not a natural kind of sleep.At least that's how it was a while ago. Maybe the situation has improved.

Why buy 1mg pill when you can buy 100mg pill?

reply

There actually is a condition that calls for extremely high (100mg+ doses), but it is a very rare thing, no one should ever consider that much without instruction from a doctor. But you'll find it right next to the normal <=5mg doses without any explanation.

Chemistry trumps psychology. Good enough chemistry enables cognitive treatments. But to fix the wrong chemistry you need chemistry.

reply

To nitpick: The mind is applied biochemistry. Psychology intervenes in the chemistry, like many other activities do. The goal of that is to solve the root cause so that your future levels will be maintained at the right level, instead of just forcing the level by sourcing the respective chemicals externally.A good rule of thumb in biology and particular any kind of hormone production and balance is ""use it or lose it"" - if you start regularly receiving something externally, internal production will scale back and atrophy in response, in many cases permanently.

reply

We don't really know how SSRIs work, but there's some evidence that it's through desensitizing serotonin receptors, not directly addressing the lack of serotonin. If so, ""use it or lose it"" doesn't apply; long-term adaptation is the point, and SOMETIMES does persist after quitting.

reply

There are ways to ""hack it"".For example, ~6 months ago I started trt (testosterone replacement). It was the best decision health wise ever. I feel way better psychologically, first time in my life I managed to stick with cardio training for so long (before 3 months was the most). There are other benefits too.So what about the ""loose it"" part? Well there is a hormone called HCG one can take a twice a week to trick one's balls into producing some natural testosterone. Its use prevents atrophy and infertility.

When looking at the same reality one persons sees the situation as OK and another as a an endless and hopeless disaster it is hard to tell who is right. A depressed person would tell that most people around him are wrong and are optimistic only because they don't understand how bad all is.

reply

I'm incredibly optimistic and am content with my position in life. My default state is being mindful of the present and I don't think about things too far into the future. I very rarely ever feel stressed out over things in life.However, none of that changes the fact that I feel completely empty and find no joy in things. Interests are nearly non-existent, emotions dialed to 1, and the only thing I'm motivated to do is lay in bed staring at the ceiling... unless I'm on sertraline.Admittedly that's just anecdotal, but I worked in a clinical neuroscience lab researching treatments for severe treatment-resistant depression (read: people who tried so many options including CBT that they even tried electroshock therapy). The only thing that helped those subjects was a regimen of personalized neuroimaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation for 10 minutes every hour for 10 hours every day for a week. Even then, it wasn't permanent. Some saw improvement for months, others only weeks.For some people, it's not just a matter of ""perspective"".

Maybe the idea that we should find joy and feel full is wrong?We are on a random planet circling a random star in an unfathomable Universe.STOP looking for meaning and you are liberated. The quest for meaning by itself might be exhausting and makes you feel depressed.

It's not as liberating as you might think. A joyless existence is either suffering or nothingness. A life without meaning, either internal or external, is one where nothing is meaningful with no motivation thus one of crippling catatonia til death.All I can say is just that it doesn't feel good and if you can't feel good about anything, your calculus of your life inevitably leads to the conclusion that existence isn't worth it.

Go somewhere where you need to work physically you az off to afford daily food. You will be so exhausted eventually that: 
1 you will not have any energy left for thoughts. 
2 If you have any energy left, you will give it to angriness which will lead to other circumstances which are none related to find the meaning of life.Ignorance may lead to happiness and friends :)

reply

I didn't have anxiety, just depression. I rarely thought. I existed on autopilot. I was physically exhausted on a daily basis as a division 1 athlete in college. Often went days without eating either because I simply forgot to eat or forgot to make time for it between classes and training. Didn't change anything.I think something people are forgetting is that motivation is either driving you toward something you want or driving you away from things you specifically don't want. A complete lack of motivation means I wasn't motivated to do anything to get something, but also I wasn't motivated to anything to avoid something either. I wasn't motivated to eat to avoid hunger pangs. I wasn't motivated to quit my sport to avoid routine physical exhaustion. Instead, my empty autopilot existence just freely acted on the expectations of those around me as a proxy for motivation.

Or because of a legitimate chemical imbalance or some other cognitive issue they can't control alone. Right?

A few HN submissions recently are in the style ""thinking about doing the thing is not doing the thing. Planning the thing is not doing the thing. <etc etc>. Only doing the thing is doing the thing"". Comparing a brain to a large software project with bugs hiding in it, in that vein giving the computer 11 hours of 'sleep' each night is not debugging the code; overclocking or undervolting the CPU is not debugging the code; installing the latest updates and patches is not debugging the code. 'knowing there is nothing to worry about' is not debugging the code. Only debugging the code is debugging the code. Reading a badly explained idea on an internet comment and dismissing it with a mocking ""thanks I'm cured"" isn't debugging the code. Saying ""I've tried everything"" isn't debugging the code.A more specific example, if you are going on a rollercoaster and you are experiencing physical and mental symptoms of worry - nervous, anxious, angry at the person pushing you to ride, twitching and trying to back away, eyes looking around searching for an exit, coming up with excuses to do something else instead, nervous shaking, dread tightness in the chest, affected breathing, perspiring, gritted teeth, etc. etc. then washing over all that with ""I know there is nothing to worry about so this must be a problem of brain chemistry"" seems a clearly incorrect conclusion.Such a person clearly has a worry. Quite likely one that's out of proportion (e.g. ""rollercoasters kill thousands of people every day!""). Possibly one that's completely incorrect (e.g. ""going more than 10mph makes people's insides fall out!""). Quite likely a less clear and less obvious one - which could be anything, e.g. they saw a documentary about a rollercoaster which behaded a child and that's their only thought about rollercoasters; they saw a show about fighter pilots pulling high-G maneouvres and passing out and think that will happen to them on a big rollercoaster; they see the rollercoaster track and support flexing and don't understand that a some flexibility doesn't mean weakness; they went to a theme park as a child and older children bullied them into riding a scary ride and they wet themselves and figuratively died of shame and buried the memory; they were pushed into learning to drive at 15 by their wicked stepfather and this is pattern matching to the same kind of experience; etc. etc.Saying ""there is nothing to worry about, rollercoasters are safe enough and you know it, so your brain chemistry must be broken"" isn't debugging the problem. It isn't even explaining the problem. Why would broken brain chemistry particularly affect them at a theme park, or in Winter, and not the rest of the time?

Ha, of course it can be! Our brain chemistry is not stable through our life! Many children are born with epilepsy, but some people develop it later in life. epilepsy, like all neurological disorders are nature AND nurture, genes AND the environment.Using your roller coaster analogy, there very well may be genes that control; how much fear someone experiences when riding a roller coaster. The problem society has is telling people that they all should be able to not have feear riding a roller coaster and if youa re too afraid to ride a roller coaster you should take xanax.

Citation requested. Because, y'know, it's not like your leg muscles suddenly don't work from age 40-50 and then start working again and we say it's because of unstable ""leg chemistry"". It's not like your stomach, liver, kidneys, <organs> suddenly stop working after you lose your job or your life partner and we say it's both inexplicable and because of a deficit of ""body chemicals"" and nod agreement with each other that ""body chemistry isn't stable"" through a lifetime.These are just unsatisfyingly crappy non-explanations.And quick attempts to assume that Doctors, Neuroscientists, Psychiatrists, Psychologists must have a better detailed knowledge of brain chemistry and I'm just falling for nonsense seems to find that they actually don't, and they don't agree that ""brain chemistry"" is a good explanation, and it can't be measured in a patient, and the idea isn't strongly supported by evidence, and even the mechanism of action of ""drugs which correct brain chemistry"" isn't agreed on, and when given to people to ""correct brain chemistry"" it often doesn't make the problem that was blamed on brain chemistry go away.> ""there very well may be genes that control; how much fear someone experiences when riding a roller coaster.""I will lump ""genetics"" in as another pet-hate unsatisfyingly crappy non-explanation that people tag onto whatever they want so they can stop thinking about it further. There probably are many genes which affect how much fat bodies store, or burn, or food cravings, or what constitutes hunger, or production of various leptins and grehlins and insulins and stomach acids, but that doesn't mean ""I'm obese because of my genetics"" is any kind of explanation at all. Or ""I have this personality because my parents and grandparents had it, it's genetic"" is an explanation. Downe's Syndrome is a good use for genetics as an explanation.

Ohhh, leg chemistry, good choice! You know that leg ""chemistry"" is control by neurotransmitter release, yes? So you must have never heard of Familial Periodic Paralysis then. Let me tell you what happens with that, because it happened to me while taking Seroquel. Familial Periodic Paralysis is also called Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and is due to mutations in the gene that encodes the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle sodium channel (SCN4A).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1338/""The paralytic attacks are characterized by decreased muscle tone (flaccidity) more marked proximally than distally with normal to decreased deep tendon reflexes. The episodes develop over minutes to hours and last several minutes to several days with spontaneous recovery.Some individuals have only one episode in a lifetime; more commonly, crises occur repeatedly: daily, weekly, monthly, or less often. The major triggering factors are cessation of effort following strenuous exercise and carbohydrate-rich evening meals. ""Look at that! Their muscles stopped and stared working again!And yes, this happened to me while taking seroquel because it lowered my potassium so much it affected my nervous system.Any good psychiatrist will tell you that they have no idea what is going on. But that does not mean neurotransmitters cannot be changed and that they do not effect behavior.> I will lump ""genetics"" in as another pet-hate unsatisfyingly crappy non-explanation that people tag onto whatever they want so they can stop thinking about it further.As someone who, as an armature geneticist, helped design a genetic study for Stanford, can I say that I put more energy into thinking about these things over the last 45 years than you can even imagine?>Or ""I have this personality because my parents and grandparents had it, it's genetic"" is an explanation.I have my hair color, height, skin color, all the physical traits from my parents, so why do you think the brain is not physical as well? Or or adrenal system? The brain is effected by genetics, this is true as has been shown clearly as a risk for schizophrenia. I have no idea why people think our mood, which is dictated by our thoughts which are created and sensed by our brain, which is a physical organ, does not have anything to do with genetics and neurotransmitters.and then you go on to talk about epigenetics, like that matters by genes don't? Do you know that genes control the epigentic response? Genes like DNMT1? So people with differences in DNMT1 will have different epigenetic responses?> I agree with this. Society likes assuming everyone is the same.So how are we different? nature AND nurture. Genes AND environment. I agree the solution to these problems are wrong, but your solution are just as bad as the ones your are prescribing.Listen, there are times when our neurtranmitters are supposed to be different, like when we are in pain or when some one dies. But some people, like me, have these changes regardless of the situation and we can like them to other environmental factors like diet, sunlight, weather, etc.I could tell you whey and why I think am so sensitive to the world but I doubt you would listen, because no one listens, because everyone knows.

Your second paragraph reveals a biased motive behind your opinion.I'm really tired of reading anti-medicine testimonials from people who had anecdotal bad results. Yes, penicillin won't stop antibiotic-resistant strains of some germs, and in fact may kill people like me if we take heavy doses. That's worse than what you're describing for SSRIs; does that mean doctors shouldn't prescribe it?

Doctors of all countries have been under a lot of pressure by patients and health administrators to ""fix the issue and quick"". The last thing that your doctor wants is giving you pills so you go away, but that's what the context very strongly incentivize. You want doctors to stop abusing pills, stop asking them for immediate fix. Give them less patients, more time and more resources to deal with the health of the population. Also, prevention.

Not that my personal experience is actually a statistically significant sample, but I don't know anybody who takes sleeping pills. Or maybe I do, but they haven't told me. I've also never heard heavy sleeping pill use is one of the stereotypes about Americans. There are an estimated 342 million people in the United States, so impressions aren't always meaningful.

I can't speak for USA but in parts of Europe a lot of people have PTSD that prevents normal sleep, so they end up on these pills, and then they end up with PTSD and worse insomnia caused by long term use of sleep meds.I think it's just incentives. Easier to take a pill than to deal with horrible trauma. And that probably stays true forever.

I wish people would stop saying this.Our understanding of the brain is not sufficiently sophisticated to allow us to identify the ""root cause"" (whatever that means) of depression in most people.  Indeed we have no reason to believe that there even is a root cause to most people's depression.If you take antidepressants, go to therapy (or meditate or exercise or whatever), then go off them and still feel good, that's great.And if you take antidepressants indefinitely because doing so improves your life, that's also great!  Your life is improved!  This isn't an ""abuse"" of the drugs.No psychiatrist is making you do anything.  They're advising you based on their clinical judgement and experience, but ultimately it's your decision to take the pills or not.  If your goal is to go on antidepressants temporarily, any decent psychiatrist will support you in that (because, again, they understand that they can't make you take the pills one day longer than you want to).I've been on Lexapro and done evidence-based therapy for years.  They both have been helpful, but if I had to pick one, I'd immediately pick Lexapro.  For me it is a miracle drug.  And the miracle is, I can choose how I feel.(I also added a small dose of Buspar to help with the sexual side-effects.)If you're on the fence about trying an antidepressant, I really encourage you to talk to a psychiatrist.  If you try it and hate it, then you can stop.  But a lot of people try it and love it.  And I think a lot more people would be willing to try it if the notion that this is somehow ""wrong"" were gone.For further reading I recommend https://lorienpsych.com/2021/06/05/depression/.

Frankly, I see this as similar to telling diabetics that they should use just enough insulin to get them to learn to stop being diabetic. That's possible for a few type 2 diabetics who could make lifestyle changes that got them back into good ranges. It's completely useless for type 1 diabetics, or type 2 who can no longer go back.I'm neither diabetic nor depressed. I don't have a dog in this hunt. I'm just always astonished at “have you tried not being depressed?” Some people can “snap out of it”. Many times that number of people cannot.

I know this road leads to SSRIs at the very least, so I always reply in the negative.The parent comment hints to me that this might be a mistake. I do not want to become accustomed to an antidepressant, so perhaps my course of action was correct.I was measured low on Vitamin D, which I've hopefully corrected, and I haven't always eaten fish regularly. Perhaps I should pay more attention to that.

Seems odd. Your doctor can't force you to take anything. If they say ""do you want to try X?"" just say ""No"". Not giving your doctor full medical context seems like a mistake - for example, maybe depression would be indicative of another issue, or maybe people who are depressed really shouldn't take a specific medication.To each their own, and perhaps you have other reasons, but this seems like a less than ideal solution to a very trivial problem if the goal is just to not take an SSRI.

She then proceeded to say ""well I'll just write you the prescription anyway and you can do your research later and decide to fill it or not"".I was actually shocked by this interaction, and think about it often. She's a regular family doctor with the local hospital system, and this was just a regular checkup. I answered one question with a ""yes, but it's manageable and I think I can handle it with lifestyle change"" and then said no twice to medication and ended up with a prescription, which I ignored but don't appreciate having on my record, since it's a false indicator for future prescribing physicians.

How would you have formed that impression? Whatever media and culture you're consuming, or how you are interpreting it, is leading you to incorrect conclusions.  You should examine that.We all live in a cultural bubble but any time you find yourself thinking that millions of people somewhere else do something crazy, you should probably talk to someone from there.Sleeping meds might be prescribed at a higher rate in the US, that wouldn't surprise me due to the specific incentives in our health care system.

I don't know how rampant that problem actually is, but I don't think you should discount the impact of social stigma when it comes to mental health. It is only in the past 10 to 15 years, at least in the US, that mental health has entered the public dialogue in any meaningful sense. Historically it has been a source of massive shame with people expressing embarrassment at their loved ones suffering from mental health crises. And now we have a whole generation of influencers and politicians  who are trying to tell people to pour out all their medications, reject doctors wholesale, take their specific brand of colloidal silver, and be free.I just think this is a lot more complicated than “psychiatrists abuse the diagnosis.”

It's actually like statins. Ideally, a doctor will recommend diet changes in addition to the pills. However, relying on lifestyle interventions almost never is effective, And the more we learn about it, the more we realize that cholesterol is mostly genetic based rather than diet based anyway. So the most effective thing they can do is say ""here, take these indefinitely"". And thank God they do because it saves thousands of lives annually.For many people with depression, a neurochemical imbalance is the root cause. Just like with statins, addressing it means taking some pills.

Well that but also they have poorly understood long term effects even after being discontinued (in some people, not others) and they don't work for everyone. The latter is probably most of the reason they get hated on. I don't recall the source but a given antidepressant only works for something like 1/3 or less of the population. So take a person not in a great place emotionally, who is also statistically not in a great place in life overall, subject them to an insufferable bureaucratic process, give them a drug that doesn't end up working for them, add in some pretty wild side effects, sprinkle on a few long term effects that persist after they discontinue the thing that didn't work to begin with, and of course you end up with a bad reputation.The tl;dr is that our understanding of the brain and mood disorders kind of sucks.

Only true for some. Inarguably, well-proven false for others.Likewise, placebos and aspirin are comparable at relieving those headaches where aspirin doesn't really solve the source, but that doesn't mean aspirin's well-documented effects are meaningless in general.

From reading internet comments you'd think so, but your experience is more typical than anything.Depression is deceptively common. As a consequence, SSRI use over a lifetime is also more common than most would assume. Any drug will come with negative side effects for some portion of its users. Multiply that by the high number of people who have ever taken an SSRI and it starts to become obvious why there are so many Internet anecdotes about SSRIs not working.Meanwhile, most people who take SSRIs successfully aren't going around and advertising the fact that they're on psychiatric medications. There is less stigma now than there was in the past, but it's still not something most people like to broadcast to the world. For patients on long term SSRIs in stable states, the SSRI is just a routine thing they take in the background and don't really think about. There's no reason for it to come up in conversation.

I didn't even know I had it, but when I was diagnosed, my psychiatrist was very concerned and made a point of encouraging me to keep in touch, making sure I worked through things and engaged with the problem. I initially thought something like ""I'm fine, just a little down here and there, I wonder if this person is inventing work for themselves?""Same with anxiety. I would have told you something like ""I'm not an anxious person at all. I don't even know what that's like, though I can sympathize with people who suffer with it"". As it turned out, I was suffering pretty severe anxiety. In retrospect it's as clear as day, but at the time it was just... The way life was.The thing is, all of my assessments remarked that I demonstrated relatively high self awareness and openness. My experience being diagnosed with ADHD and depression made me seriously concerned for people who 1) can't afford this process and support, and 2) will just continue to grind like I was, living half-dead without knowing it can be any other way.I suspect there are a ton of these people—I think I notice them quite often—and I was arguably accidentally pulled from that stupor and would likely still be there, unaware, if it weren't for a chance encounter that caused me to think slightly differently about the possibility of having ADHD.

I have started taking SSRI after a harder-than-usual body collapse, and after no matter what I did my mood hasn't improved for a month. Regular running, meditating, writing, crafting, coding etc were my antidote to my mood swings but this time it didn't work. Started taking SSRI and continue doing all this things, and I was reborn.My therapist said that a big chunk of why i am feeling better is also because I kept doing things that are good for me. That she sees with a lot of her patients that they think a pill will magically change the situation. It doesn't work on itself, you need to show up and do things that release serotonin in your body.But seriously, unbelievable, years of frustration and friction in my life disappeared and I have never felt better.

I did mention the following at the end of the ""antidepressants"" section, but reading your comment convinced me to move it further up. The intro now reads:> The ""standardised effect size"" of antidepressants on depression, vs placebo, is around 0.4. (On average; some people respond much better or much worse.)Also, I wasn't expecting my article to do well on Hacker News; thank you everyone for the comments & critiques! I'll edit the blog post as I go along, to refine it in response to your comments.

Don't take it as criticism, more of a personal take on figuring out what antidepressants do for me. Furthermore, since posting that parent comment I've converted my vit. D dose to IUs and I realised i'm only taking 800 IUs daily. So a thank you for clueing me in on that, and who knows what happens if I up that. Maybe you were right all along and all i DID need was a heroic dose of vitamin D. (... thats what she said)

About a week ago, there was a reddit post claiming it's actually geographically impossible for anyone where I live to produce enough Vitamin D naturally from the sun alone, due to the shorter days and lower angles throughout the day. I had no idea.

reply

I can't find a rigorous academic source right now, but the top web results all say we need at least UV Index 3 for our skin to be able to make enough Vitamin D. I guess summer may work for us, in the Montreal/New England area, but other than that, yeah, you and I will need to get Vitamin D from diet and/or supplements. And fish is expensive, so supplements it is.

I had an old gf receive two different drugs each with terrible side effects. To me it looked as poison.I decided that I would rather hurt myself myself than fuck with my brain chemistry this way.During the dark northern Winters I lack vitamin D (your doctor can measure this using a blood test). The symptoms are some physical issues and probably something that can be described as light depression which goes away if I remember to take the vitamins.We are all different. Some people might need anti-depressants. I just need some vitamins.

I finally went and got diagnosed at age 46 for what had been an childhood-onset issue in retrospect. All the signs were there: inability to start work until enough challenge or novelty or a state of crisis had come about, etc. When I spoke to friends about considering treatment, they said they thought of me as a hyperfocus kind of person. But they didn't see how many support systems I had put in place to function normally, how I saw others around me just doing things while I had to work myself up to start and then keep checking and double-checking for the silly inattentive mistakes I knew from experience I would keep making.I've had a meditation practice for a long time and it has helped with anxiety but it hasn't really helped with getting started on tasks, especially those perceived as boring. I even had to psych myself up to sit down and start meditating, even though I knew I would enjoy it.I didn't know until a year or two ago that non-stimulant medication existed to treat ADHD. I always thought it was only Adderall and the like, and I couldn't risk anything that would ramp my anxiety up, or take additional treatment for the anxiety with SSRIs because I have severe hemophilia and any additional risk of bleeding from SSRIs was an untenable proposition.After sitting on the idea for some time and just hoping that I could fix it with more meditation, I finally decided to see a psychiatrist. The doctor suggested Atomoxetine, but said it doesn't work for most people and even then takes 3-4 weeks to take full effect. I started on the absurdly low dose of 10mg/day for the first month to be sure it wouldn't cause additional bleeds. By day 3 I could see a huge improvement in my working memory and ability to perform tasks. It gave me insomnia for a bit but I would wake up at 3 AM, sit down happily to work and write the best code I've written in years. I could not believe the difference it made. There were quite a few side effects initially but I was willing to put up with them because of how smoothly my brain was functioning. I became a nicer person to deal with. I felt this sense of possibility and freedom that I haven't felt since my 20s. My only regret is not having done this sooner.So yeah, please don't avoid medication based on internet reading.

More recently I was on a vacation where I took mushrooms and had a nice trip. Two days later at work I felt very relaxed driving in and sat at my desk BUT something was wrong, my head was dead quiet (the GP explained this exactly like I would.) So quiet that for a second I had a bit of panic as I thought something was wrong. Then something wonderful happened: I realized I was able to just do my work. There was no stress, no worry, no nothing. Just a calm quiet confidence to get the job done. Best day of my life.After that I called a mental health center and connected with an ADHD specialist who has been working with me. I am also on Atomoxetine myself and while it has not brought me back to that zen head space it brings me close enough. My only gripe is at a higher dose it gives me sensations in my head. However, I learned that eating a proper breakfast helps a lot as I was taking it on a near empty stomach. Overall my life has been slowly improving and I feel more confident at work.> So yeah, please don't avoid medication based on internet reading.This - 100%

Did you, as well as the other people seconding this, have any libido left in the first place?

When I hear people say ""it killed my libido"" I always think about the fact that hyper-sexuality can be a trauma response, and if your body is healing the hyper-sexuality is most likely also reduced.It's like when you have a disease and then read the side effects of a medication and notice that a lot of the side effects are basically also something that can happen when your overall condition is improving but still some people report them as adverse effects and then these are added as side effects to the package label.For example you take antibiotics but bacteria can have toxins in their body, and when the bacteria disintegrate you get more sick from the released toxins. It's called the Herxheimer effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarisch%E2%80%93Herxheimer_rea...When I started methyl-B12 supplementation I also had inflammation in sinuses for weeks but it was just from my immune system starting up again and being able to attack long-standing inflammation. Someone else would've put ""fever"", ""headache"" and ""stuffed nose"" onto the side effects medication label of methyl-B12.

The situation is PersonA has determined they need an anti-depressant. So one thing is 'wrong.' It stands to reason that they may be using sex as a painkilling mechanism. After all, sex feels great. When the anti-depressant kicks in, the body may determine it doesn't have to use that painkilling method anymore, hence, the decreased libido. It doesn't mean having a libido is bad, it means that the person potentially was overdriving it.

I do wonder if being highly functional and feeling capable is normal though, like as a species it seems almost dysfunctional to happily plow through 8 hour workdays and bills and appointments and all the little bureaucracies we have to navigate. Sometimes a little voice screams ""Run to the woods!"" when I sit down and look at a long todo list for the day, but with Adderall I can generate some semblance of enjoyment from ticking off the boxes.Granted our world is what it is, and we are mostly helpless to enact large changes. Finding some kind of peace with reality is probably better than bashing your head against why you don't fit into it well.

I'm sure they have their problems too on occasion, but for me the decision to start taking Escitalopram was one of the best things I've ever done.The side effects were totally negligible compared to the benefits.I've stopped taking it a year ago or so and... it's basically cured me.I'm not saying antidepressant are a literal pharmaceutical cure for depression, but in my case it simply put me in a position mentally to change habits and patterns of thinking in a sustainable way.My only regret is not doing this 10 years earlier; the poor reputation contributed to that.

To cherry-pick a quote from a review of SSRI studies:>the magnitude of symptom reduction was about 40% with antidepressants and about 30% with placebo.That tells me that antidepressants have some effectiveness, but placebos work shockingly well.

""Do not rely too much on your own judgment. [...] if you are an expert user of LLMs and you tag 10 pages as being AI-generated, you've probably falsely accused one editor.""Never accuse people of LLM writing based on short comments, your false positive rate is invariably going to be way too high to be acceptable given the very limited material.It's just not worth it: Even if you correctly accuse 9/10 times, you are being toxic to that false positive case for basically no gain.

Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor, but saw 4 seasons of dr. House. Moreover, few hours of Huberman Lab on sleep and light and most importantly, this episode of Additude Mag Podcast on curing SAD and ADHD day-rhytm shifting with light glasses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu4mLgkNc6IWhat happens in the seasonal affective disorder season is the sunlight pattern diverges from 6-18 that we evolved with. Without daily reminder of getting enough sun (or sun-like) light at the 6 o'clock⁰, your body clock will drift.It can start by feeling groggy instead of refreshed in the morning, even if you've slept enough. And can escalate into loosing the will to do anything or even live.No wonder. You're still an animal. You need to be fed, put to bed, etc. at a specific time. If you try to make your body sleep during the day, and eat and work during what body expects to be night, you won't really sleep and won't really live/work. Enough of not really sleeping and not really living - you mess up your body, your gut biome, your hormonal balance and your brain chemistry. You kind of should get depressed when you do it.You can steer your body clock with light. Most of us do it, by exposing ourselves to strong (strong enough it won't matter if it includes blue wavelength or not).But you can do it consciously (and in a way good for you) by putting on light therapy glasses (I'm using Lumiere 3¹, and they are not the only ones, find your own) at 6⁰ everyday, or right after you wake up if you're trying to readjust your rhythm. Or if you have time and want to save $200, use a stationary lamp and just sit in front of it doing nothing. I don't have the time. When readjusting, small doses of melatonin (0.5mg) 1h before sleep will accelerate body clock shift.But don't listen to me, if you have SAD, you should really listen to that ADHD experts episode.I feel for you, struggling with that stuff for a long time. Vit D, fish oil (lot of). All lights at home set to reduce intensity after 18. Strict going to bed routine. Still sleep poorly once in a while, but can do things in winter again. Hope it will help :)0: choose whatever suits you. With small doses of melatonin and discipline in using light glasses you can even flip day and night. Just stay consistent, good farmer always feeds his cows at the same time.1: at the time of buying ( fall '25 ) they were cheapest and best overall in norway. Solid build, ok battery, can have them on during yoga using attached rubbers and kind of can have them over glasses. Mine are very large and have blue light filter, but I manage 20min without eyeglasses. Medical certificate. Few leds, holo strip, battery and some plastic - my inner Scrooge says it's not worth $285, but everything else was worse and more expensive.

No wonder. You're still an animal. You need to be fed, put to bed, etc. at a specific time. If you try to make your body sleep during the day, and eat and work during what body expects to be night, you won't really sleep and won't really live/work.

Pause for a moment and consider the mere plausibility of the claims in the first few paragraphs: The effect size for antidepressants is 0.4, but the effect size for Vitamin D is 1.8? Are we to believe that Vitamin D supplements have an effect size 4.5X larger than antidepressant drugs, and nobody noticed this massive discrepancy until now?Effect size is also a favorite metric in this vein of supplement-over-pharma writing because it's so commonly misunderstood and it's so easy to find small supplement studies that have outlier effect sizes.To put it in context, even common OTC pain meds can have effect sizes lower than 0.4 depending on the study. Have you ever taken Tylenol or Ibuprofen and had a headache or other pain reduced? Well you've experience what a drug with a small effect size on paper can do for you.Please be very careful when someone tries to tell you that supplements are miraculous and pharmaceutical drugs don't work at all. I know too many people who delayed trialing SSRIs for years due to internet driven fears and lost many years of their lives to depression based on content like this. People with cabinets full of dozens of supplement bottles that were chosen based on studies, too. Then they finally decided to try real antidepressant medications and wished they'd done it sooner.As much as I wish we could all just cure depression by taking a simple Vitamin D supplement that has 4.5X higher effect size than antidepressant drugs, this claim just isn't passable.

Hiking has the biggest effect though.I think maybe the problem is that therapists are diagnosing people, and psychiatrists are prescribing pills based on those diagnoses, but neither are ordering bloodwork to check for deficiencies.  Which leads to a lot of people suffering from lack of basic health, and treating the symptoms with SSRIs that have withdrawl symptoms a million times worse than most of the problems they treat.Now to your point, I seriously doubt that vitamin D will hold up against anti-depressants and therapy if we control for other health and quality of life issues.  I just think there is a ton of misdiagnosis, and lack of root cause analysis in the mental health field, and health care in general.

Keeping the mind busy with beautiful things and being  physically exhausted can heal a lot of things.Its like surfing on a big day - you are just too tired to be depressive afterwards. It feels like a weight blanket.

I remember reading that pine trees give off a chemical that is a natural human bronchodilator.One thought of why people love hiking, especially in piney woods, is that the chemical allows humans to process more oxygen which in turn helps them feel more ""energized"".I point this out for two reasons:1. It's a fascinating bit of trivie2. It highlights that there are MANY confounding variables so it will always be tough to figure out the isolated impact.

> Please be very careful when someone tries to tell you that supplements are miraculous and pharmaceutical drugs don't work at all.I'll concede I unintentionally gave the tone that one should replace antidepressants with supplements, even though the conclusion specifically writes: ""(Don't quit your existing antidepressants if they're net-positive for you!) you may also want to ask your doctor about Amitriptyline, or those other best-effect-size antidepressants.""I have now edited the intro to more explicitly say ""you can take these supplements alongside traditional antidepressants!

From the linked Ghaemi et al 2024 meta-analysis ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11650176/ ):> Several meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have suggested a positive relationship between vitamin D deficiency and risk of developing depression (Anglin et al., 2013; Ju, Lee, & Jeong, 2013).> Although some review studies have presented suggestions of a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms (Anglin et al., 2013; Cheng, Huang, & Huang, 2020; Mikola et al., 2023; Shaffer et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2022), none of these reviews have examined the potential dose-dependent effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms to determine the optimum dose of intervention. Some of the available reviews, owing to the limited number of trials and methodological biases, were of low quality (Anglin et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2014; Shaffer et al., 2014). Considering these uncertainties, we aimed to fill this gap by conducting a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to determine the optimum dose and shape of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults regardless of their health status.===> even common OTC pain meds can have effect sizes lower than 0.4 depending on the study. Have you ever taken Tylenol or Ibuprofen and had a headache or other pain reduced? Well you've experience what a drug with a small effect size on paper can do for you.I must push back: that's an effect of 0.4 plus placebo effect and time.There's now RCTs of open-label placebos (where subjects are told it's placebo), which show even open-label placebos are still powerful for pain management. So, I stand by 0.4 being a small effect; even if you took a placebo you know to be placebo, you'd feel a noticeable reduction in pain/headache.EDIT: Here's a systematic review of Open-Label Placebos, published in Nature in 2021: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83148-6.pdf> We found a significant overall effect (standardized mean difference = 0.72, 95% Cl 0.39–1.05, p < 0.0001, I2 = 76%)

You're cherry picking papers. Others have already shared other studies showing no significant effects of Vitamin D intervention.For any popular supplement you can find someone publishing papers with miraculous results, showing huge effect sizes and significant outcomes. This has been going on for decades.With Omega-3s the larger the trial size, the smaller the outcome. The largest trials have shown very little to no detectable effect.I think a lot of people are skeptical about pharmaceuticals because they see the profit motive, but they let their guard down when researchers and supplement pushers who have their own motives start pushing flawed studies and cherry picked results.> In other words, if the effect on antidepressants vs placebo is ~0.4, and the effect of a placebo vs no placebo (just time) is ~0.7, that means the majority of the effect of antidepressants & OTC pain meds is due to placebo.You keep getting closer to understanding why these effect size studies are so popular with alternative medicine and supplement sellers: They're so easy to misinterpret or to take out of context.According your numbers, taking Tylenol would be worse than placebo alone! 0.4 vs 0.7Does this make any sense to you? It should make you pause and think that maybe this is more complicated than picking singular numbers and comparing them.In this domain of cherry picking studies and comparing effect sizes, you've reached a conclusion where Vitamin D is far and away more effective than anything, placebo is better than OTC pain medicines, and OTC pain meds are worse than placebo.It's time for a reality check that maybe this methodology isn't actually representative of reality. You're writing at length as if these studies you picked are definitive and your numeric comparisons tell the whole story, but I don't think you've stopped to consider if this is even realistic.

I just picked the most recent meta-analysis I could find, which also specifically estimates the dose-response curve. (Since averaging the effect at 400 IU and 4000 IU doesn't make sense.)> Others have already shared other studies showing no significant effects of Vitamin D intervention.Yes, and the Ghaemi et al 2024 meta-analysis addresses the methodological problems in those earlier meta-analyses. (For example, they average the effects at vastly varying doses from 400 IU and 4000 IU)> According your numbers, taking Tylenol would be worse than placebo alone! 0.4 vs 0.7No, I understand this fine. Taking Tylenol would give you active medication + placebo + time, which is 0.4 + 0.7 + X > *1.1.* Taking open-label placebo is just placebo + time = *0.7* + X.(Edit: Also, these aren't ""my"" numbers. They're from a major peer-reviewed study published in Nature, the highest-impact journal. I don't like ""hey look at the credentials here"", but I bring it up to note I'm not anti-science, see below paragraph)===Stepping back, I suspect the broader concern you have is you (correctly!) see that supplement/nutrition research is sketchy & full of grifters. And at the current moment, it seems to play into the hands of anti-establishment anti-science types. I agree, and I'll try to edit the tone of the article to avoid that.That said, there still is some good science (among the crap), and I think the better evidence is accumulating (at least for Vitamin D) that it's on par with traditional antidepressants, possibly more. I agree that much larger trials are required.

Do be aware that not all vitamin E supplements actually contain the dosage that they are labeled at, and that inclues both no-name brands and some big name brands.  I'm having trouble finding a good reference on google due to AI and SEO pollution.  But I recall Nature Made was labelled accurately and that is what I buy.My wife on the other hand has struggled with life-long anxiety/depression even when living in Atlanta.  For her a fairly low dose of lexapro enables her to live her life like a normal person.  We wish we could get her mother to give it a shot for a few weeks, as she now can see a lot of similarities in both their personality traits that were affected by a life of untreated anxiety.We also have cat that would probably have been put down for fear-biting of people and attacking our mild and mellow dog until we got his aggression under control with kitty prozac.  I kid you not, it's a transdermal fluoxetine cream we put in his ear each day.  Without the constant anxiety stimulus in the way, his real personality came through and he is actually very sweet.  To me at least.  Still bites my wife, but not hard anymore, just enough to keep her alert.

For D3, it is 25mcg / 1000 IU / 125%After splitting in half it's 12.5 mcg / 500 IU / 62.5%.I take with some fat-containing food to allow ir to absorb which is usually breakfast (yogurt, some nuts, some kind of fruit, oats), and it's a night and day difference in my mood (how easily I can control my temper if already agitated, how easily I brush off annoying stuff, takes the intensity off of my reactions and mood during conversations).I did a blood test before starting, and if normal is between 30 - 70, I was at 10. Dr prescribed megadose of D2, followed by daily D3, but I skipped on the megadose and went straight to D3 -- makes me wonder if a megadose would build up my stores since D is fat-soluble and make it so I could miss a day and not notice.All of the above is anecdotal from me, a self-professed cave dweller, but it's been a couple of years now, and I still notice the difference. Also, what I heard from people in Boston is that 90% of them are on a vitamin D supplement. My friend from there laughed at me when I was raving about it, saying ""yeah, literally everyone here is on it"".

Edit: for clarity I am not saying it is impossible to overdose on oral tablets, but rather that with most tablets 400 IU to 1000 IU and the safe limit so much higher than these, it seems like it would be extremely unlikely for someone to be taking 30+ tablets daily. Not impossible, but not easy either.

reply

First: the RDA and the safety limit are not the same, and an RDA in a country being too low does not mean that the maximum safe dose is wrong.And it certainly does not mean that there is a higher risk in under-dosing than overdosing when taking the RDA (which already includes recommendations for supplementing if you spend most of your time indoors).I'm not a scientist, so I only know what physicians told me and what's explained in news publications or by consumer advocacy non-profits.Here are a study (which I didn't read) and the NHS's advise on Vitamin D toxicity:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557876/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-...The study says:> Most cases of vitamin D toxicity resolve without serious complications or sequelae. However, in some instances, severe hypercalcemia can lead to acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Cases of permanent renal damage due to vitamin D toxicity are rare.Which sounds good, but I don't think it supports that there is no risk of oral Vitamin D overdose.

> A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L.

But also here is something to think about: your body will produce more D3 than that by being in the sun for just several minutes. So if you consider such a low dose of D3 an overdose then you better steer clear of the sun!

reply

This is another superficial statement, that displays shallow-at-best understanding. Staying in the sun and producing via the skin, and intake via food are 2 separate pathways. You cannot just make wild assumptions about one of those pathways from stuff you know about the other pathway.And actually: Yes, you shouldn't stay in the sun for too long without proper protection. Having the sun shine on your skin is not some inherently healthy thing. It too comes with acceptable dosage and overdose. Symptoms of overdose are commonly known as getting a sunburn.

> McCullough et al 2019 gave over thousands of patients 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day, for seven years, and there were zero cases of serious side effects. This is in line with Billington et al 2020, a 3-year-long double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where they found ""the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU/day."" (though ""mild hypercalcemia"" increased from 3% to 9%. IMHO, that's a small cost for reducing the risk of major depression & suicide.)So why then does Mayoclinic, etc, all say 4000 IU is the limit? I think because policy is decades behind science (this happened with trans fats), and also policymakers are much more risk-averse. (this is why in California, thanks to Prop 65, up until ~2018, there used to be a warning in every coffeehouse that coffee causes cancer.)But thanks to your comment, I will edit the intro to note what the official max safe dose is, and that more recent peer-reviewed research shows it's too low!

1) There are lots of studies that correlate Vitamin D production with sunlight exposure. For example, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20398766/ this one lands on 1/4 of a MED = 1000 IU. Of course now we have a MED definition problem, but we're roughly talking single digit numbers for a white person in midday sun in NYC to reach 1/4 of a MED.2) If you also supplement with Magnesium, a lot of your side effects go away. Vitamin D3 depletes Magnesium absorption.

I'm usually able to reason or force my way through depression and the like, but have had a few deep bouts in my life.  The medications have ranged from ineffective to building a tolerance quickly, to just plain worse than the symptoms being treated.  Nothing like missing your highway exit multiple times back and forth because you get lost ""in"" the drive on medication, or having 140 browser tabs open and losing 5 hours of work time.Everyone is different.  I am amazed at how much western society has so many hormonal issues that come down to the lack of quality or appropriate fatty acid intake and a lack of something as simple as more outdoor/sun time.  I think the ""low fat/cholesterol"" advice for most of the past half century combined with the increase in snacking and junk foods have been massive disservices to humanity as a whole.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the effects are multi-generational in the making either.

I know first-hand that low energy-levels and lacking energy production mechanically lead to depression.Also, look at how people (children also) experience the world and their relationships and their stresses when they are tired (or even just hungry) compared to when they are fit...Fix those, and the depression might be gone.This is not bashing against anti-depressants, they play their role to. But in some cases, energy-management is key.

The technical details are beyond my understanding but I've heard from a PhD in the field that Masterjohn's understanding of metabolism is second to none. Whether his protocols work or not is certainly a case by case matter (like any health protocol), but he always appears to substantiate it with well-cited lines of argument, and is willing to engage with interlocutors.As for spending years with changing protocols without getting anywhere besides spending lots of money, well that can be said for people with complex issues who go the institutionally approved route as well. It isn't discrediting in its own right that a protocol didn't work for some.

You're more depressed so you also don't do your dishes, when you do get out of bed you are depressed you feel like a slob and you're squishy, so you get more depressed...Whereas adding anti-depressants, and other virtuous cycle things like vitD/O3, exercise et al. Give the boost necessary to _make your life less depressing_ ...So if you know someone who's depressed, it might be helpful to help them make their life less depressing too.

Disclaimer, not saying vegans should stop being vegans, just make sure you find a good supplement, and make sure you understand the difference between EPA/DHA Omega 3.

Fortunately today's vegan communities are much more aware of this so I started taking these supplements right up front and all my blood markers improved dramatically since when I consumed meat/dairy.It's annoying to hear some push back against this when it's as simple as taking relatively safe supplements (just make sure you talk to a doctor, and not a social media influencer, about how much you should take, and if you get a chance to regularly check your bloodwork don't miss out).

I would bet that 95% of that improvement or more was due to the exercise.Your anecdote is common: People start taking Vitamin D or fish oil as part of a bigger plan to have a healthier lifestyle and then they attribute success to the pills, not the lifestyle changes.

I see your disclaimer, but just for more context, vegans can get Omega 3 without taking pills per se. Flax seeds are an excellent source. I often add a spoonful to a bowl of oatmeal or as a pancake topping along with fruit sauce and granola.

from https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-maga... :  Eating ground flax seeds gives you more benefits than whole seeds, as whole seeds remain undigested and pass through the system.

from https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/must-you-grind-flax...  Most people can't chew flaxseeds effectively, so they grind them first or swallow them whole. (They are tiny.) Nutrition experts do recommend grinding them first to release the fiber and the beneficial fatty acids. Flaxseeds are helpful for constipation and may lower cholesterol as well.

  Ground flaxseed goes rancid easily, however, so it should be kept in the freezer until you are ready to use it. If you buy it ground, you wouldn't have to use the blender or coffee grinder to break those seeds up before you have breakfast.

If you (or your close ones) don't suffer from depression, then I guess it's best to ignore it until scientific consensus has formed. That will for sure show up on wikipedia. As far as I can see as a layperson there is a lot of correlation with Vitamin D that breaks down in interventions and Vitamin D is recommended mostly for babies and elderly people. On the other hand I see Vitamin D pushed as a miracle drug not unlike Vitamin C used to some decades ago and regular reports of overdosing of supplements leading to organ failure.If you're suffering from depression, you should talk to your doctor. They will be able to help you to weigh potential benefits with risks

You might be depressed because you life objectively sucks. Then you symptoms are good and healthy and a signal to make changes in your circumstances.You might actually have a good life but still feel depressed because there is a chemical imbalance in your brain. (Very simplified). That is when drugs come in.It might be just a seasonal thing and you need to go outside more and take some supplements.You might have some other undiagnosed issue. You might have ADHD, autism and other things that cause you to struggle and develop depression as a side effect.So find out what works and what doesn't work for you.

We tell ourselves that we must have ""better lives"" than say a native american in the year 1000AD, but there's no reason to think that.I think odds are that maybe the native american was happier -- having a small group that you spend time with outdoors every day, getting extensive exercise, having a clear sense of purpose, eating healthy fresh food every day, never once thinking about politics or bills or global warming. I bet they liked their life more than a depressed divorced accountant in our modern society, even if we have more material wealth or health access.

On a sidenote, I know that knowing that it is ""just your depression talking"" is also a pretty hard pill to swallow and not always helpful. Personally I have a lot of fears that I know are irrational but that doesn't make them any less real.And even if your problems are external, sometimes you need to focus and your inner self first, find some strength and help so you can tackle the external problems later. But for other people ""working on yourself"" can be avoiding the actual problems they need to work on.And yes happiness is always relative.

The problem with this that to a bad situation different people react differently - some trying to do what they can to improve the situation or at least don't make it worse and some give up and let situation to slip and become worse and worse (becoming a self fulfilling prophesy). It's not a choose one makes I think (it's likely a biological predisposition) but the difference is still exists.People prone to depression genuinely believe the main (only) reason for a depression that the life sucks and as a result they avoid medical help and don't do anything which could help them.

And each of those things can be caused by physiological issues as well. You might feel stressed because you don't sleep well. You might sleep poorly because you suffer from e.g. sleep Apnea. Which in turn might be because of a mix of physiological and other reasons (diet, weight, alcohol abuse, etc.).Or you might be working too hard, which makes you stressed and causes you to lose a lot of sleep. Different causes that have similar results. Including long term physiological results. Your brain can actually get damaged if you chronically abuse it or neglect it. Many ""between the ears"" type problems are actually physiological.Root causing your issues enables you to deal with them properly instead of fighting the symptoms.Anyway, I take vitamin D and a few other things. Getting yourself checked out regularly once you hit middle age is a good idea. There's a lot of stuff that is long term lethal that a checkup can detect early. And some of it is fixable. I have the usual cardio vascular challenges that many people struggle with because of a combination of genetics, age, and life style. And indeed a vitamin D deficit.I was also recommended to consume more omega-3 as well. Eat salmon. Work some flax/chia seeds in your breakfast. I put flax seeds in my yogurt and use it as a thickener in sauces as well. You have to grind it to dust for it to get absorbed properly. Dirt cheap and it doesn't mess with flavor/texture too much. I keep a jar of ground flax seeds in my fridge. Takes 2 minutes to top it up every 1-2 weeks or so with some freshly ground seeds.But I'm also aware that me being a stressed startup founder has health consequences that a few pills and suplements won't fix for me. I need to actively make sure I get my rest and sleep. I deal a lot better with stressful situations when I'm well rested. And I seem to be better at avoiding getting in to those as well. And I feel happier. Sometimes the best thing I can do for my company is having a proper weekend or going to bed early enough that I can get my 8 hours of sleep. You can survive on 4 hours (been there done that), for a while. But most people are not at their peak performance if they do that. And it's not good for you to work yourself to exhaustion all the time.

Pinpointing problems in your life as the cause of your depression is a trap.

reply

For example: if your life objectively sucks, why aren't you doing anything about it? Some people whose lives suck fix their lives, and other people get depressed and do nothing; what's the difference? And: all of us know somebody who appears to have a good life and therefore their depression is presumably a chemical imbalance thing but if you're being honest the vibes in their life are a bit off, actually, like you can tell they're not really getting everything they need out of it, that they're clearly good at masking (for example people who are clearly not thriving in their relationships) .... in which case sure medication could help but you can't shake the feeling that facing the reality of their life would help a lot more.However! Questioning this stuff becomes a bit of a moral minefield. ""Believing"" in the chemical imbalance theory is part of why it's medically helpful. If your life has sucked for years and you could find no way of fixing it and then SSRIs helped, then you basically need to believe that it really was a chemical imbalance, because believing that it might not be threatens to take away the thing that's making your life work. So much so that I would bet at this point there are already readers of this comment who are ready to angrily reply to my preceding paragraphs, because the model I just described threatens their existence. (If so, wait a sec and read the rest...)On the flip side, for some people not believing in the chemical imbalance model for some particular case might be important. Maybe they want to feel responsible for their life being bad, so they will be motivated to do something about it, and being happy due to drugs would make them feel complacent and okay with years passing by at a shitty job or something. Or picture someone whose parent has gone their whole life unable to take them seriously as an adult, which as a result means the child and parent have a bad relationship, and then picture the parent complaining about depression and taking medication for it. This can be really infuriating: the child thinks about the parent, ""your life sucks because of the tension created by not treating people around you with respect, and you're so incapable of recognizing this even when it's told to your face regularly that you're taking drugs to feel better despite not fixing the problem"". Now ascribing depression to medical problems seems like avoidance, and having people write off your frustrations and say that you're just depressed and need to take a drug for it is frustrating.Just saying: the two narratives really get tangled up. I don't really know what to do about it, but I do think that some harm is done by harping on the concept of a ""chemical imbalance"". A lot of the issue is avoided if you just think of the drugs as helpful but don't choose any model (with its moral implications) for what exactly it is they're helping with. Just treat them as a tool for making you feel better.Also, I suspect that people who have an intuitive aversion to mental health drugs are probably way overindexing on that intuition. I definitely did this for a long time, as did some friends I knew growing up. Turns out whatever your issues you can sometimes just deal with them sooner than later if you accept that doctors might be onto something. (Actually I think the reason people get stuck avoiding medication for so long is precisely that they feel like they're not allowed to be skeptical of them... which makes them kinda plant their feet in the ground and refuse to be open to it. That's kinda why I'm typing this long comment, to tell anyone reading that it is a reasonable thing to feel. And now that you know that maybe try them anyway..?)

I'm not sure my overall focus over time is higher with caffeine, but it does allow me to nudge more of it into the useful part of my day. However I'm a fast metaboliser of caffeine, and it doesn't impact my sleep at all, so could be that there's a genetic component to one's experience here.

Those are two different things. Cutting out caffeine can help with anxiety but not ADHD. It's the opposite for ADHD, stimulates help significantly.

reply

Also there's a growing trend of diagnosing every focus problem as ADHD when many patients might have focus problems secondary to another condition like anxiety. It's sadly all too common to find someone who believes they have ADHD due to TikTok self diagnosis or even a lazy doctor's diagnosis but their core problem is actually anxiety. For these people, stimulants of any kind can actually worsen focus even if then provide a short term perception of helping due to the energy boost.

reply

I'd add that my ability to sleep naturally was negatively affected as side effect of medication. I tried a various combos to induce sleep and found the best solution to just be... exercise.No caffeine, exercise, sleep lead to a significantly reduced anxiety and more.

You can absolutely get high doses of caffeine from tea if you really want to.

There's definitely something special, just poorly studied: typical ""how much caffeine is in X?"" tables show tea having caffeine levels similar to coffee, but I never feel the same effects.> Caffeine pills generally have really high dosages, FYI.I use 200 mg tablets split into quarters for doses of 50–100 mg. Yet, they produce a much milder curve than coffee (which I no longer drink) and, as a side effect, cause no gastrointestinal side effects!

I have never seen a caffeine comparison table that shows tea and coffee at the same level.It's common knowledge that typical coffee brews are in the range of 2-5X higher in caffeine content than typical tea brews.Tea is widely used as a lower caffeine alternative to coffee.

I briefly quit caffeine once but it as well before any realization of anxiety. So, hard to extrapolate forward from that experience.What feels different to me (compared to you) is this: sometimes I'll drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning and be awake but useless. Sometimes totally productive. Caffeine in some form is there - recently sometimes substituting coffee for a Celsius.

The main problem with ALA is that to have the good effects attributed to omega-3s, it must be converted by a limited supply of enzymes into EPA and DHA. As a result, only a small fraction of it has omega-3's effects — 10%–15%, maybe less. The remaining 85%–90% gets burned up as energy or metabolized in other ways. So in terms of omega-3 ""power,"" a tablespoon of flaxseed oil is worth about 700 milligrams (mg) of EPA and DHA. That's still more than the 300 mg of EPA and DHA in many 1-gram fish oil capsules, but far less than what the 7 grams listed on the label might imply.https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-not-flaxseed...Also, beware of omega 6 fats. Seed oils (corn, soy, canola) used in commercial food products are incredibly omega 6 dominant in terms of polyunsaturated fat content. Consequently, the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 fats we consume has plummeted as food production has industrialized. Omega 3 fats are precursors to generally anti-inflammatory signaling compounds, whereas omega 6 fats are precursors to pro-inflammatory signaling compounds. The bias in fat intake leads to more pro-inflammatory signaling in the body, and a lot of alt health types have alleged this is a major causative factor in the obesity epidemic.This is important for depression, because chronic brain inflammation as a cause of depression was one of the going hypotheses at least a decade ago when I last looked into all of this. Upping omega 3 intake is an intervention that can address chronic inflammation, which is potentially why it improves some cases of depression.Pretty much nobody in the west needs more omega 6s these days. I hear even farmed salmon eat primarily corn and soy based feeds these days, meaning their fat ratio is skewed much more heavily toward omega 6 than wild salmon and fish.

First, when taking omega 3 supplements, you generally care about increasing the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6. Hemp hearts have much more omega 6 than omega 3, so they're not very effective for improving the ratio.Second, hemp hearts contain ALA, while what you generally want to improve is EPA and DHA (this is also covered in TFA). The body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA, but it's not efficient.So all in all, if Omega 3 for the article's stated benefits is what you want, this is not the way. I recommend looking into eating more fish, or if you want a vegan route, algae-based supplements.

Too much Vitamin D3 can be toxic, so doctors are reluctant to tell you to go over published guidelines.  but if you don't have other issues, and stick to what you can get OTC from a normal vitamin brand and follow the instructions, you're probably safe.  There was a story a while ago about a woman who died from too much D3, but it turned out she was taking a whole bottle's worth every day for years.

Taking 10K per day is a bad idea. I went into the excess Vitamin D range with half that dose even in winter with an indoor job.More is not always better.

They argue we need a revolution—and more and more influential scientists, funders, and politicians are taking them seriously.

“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?” 

Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity's number one priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.

“If you believe that life is good and there's inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.” 

Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible moral duty for all of us to get involved in.”

It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They'd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.

No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that's deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution. 

Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists' commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”

“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal the driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.

“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.

To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don't yet exist. But that's sort of the point: They believe they could exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities. 

For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they've formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there's a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won't publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.

Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.

All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I've been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I've seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That's not the case for the Vitalists.  

Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism's founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events. 

I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay. Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn't make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what's doable,” he told me. “But that's part of the [longevity] movement—there's freedom for people to say whatever they want.” 

Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.

The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity's top concern. 

This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren't destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight. 

Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It's not just wrong for some people. It's wrong for all people.”

When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke. 

I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day's events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world's most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you're curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.) 

The key to Vitalism has always been that “death is humanity's core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.” 

But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn't want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”

Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who's “good at virality.” He's been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.

As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He's known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he's “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.) 

In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)

“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I'm kind of like, why would I not want to live?”

A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through The Big Short.”

Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he'd obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn't want to die. He didn't want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.

So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)

The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.

After all, Gries reasons, that's how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications. 

“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.” 

Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:

While it's not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested. 

Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.

Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?

It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that's all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside. 

The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.

This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.” 

Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event's organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.

I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don't die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!” 

But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I'd later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn't quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng. 

Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He's the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.” 

His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he's found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug' thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn't call himself a Vitalist, partly because he's “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he'd like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: Yes, please murder me at this time?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don't need anybody's help.”) 

But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn't as straightforward as they'd hoped it might be.

Not because he can't find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn't enough consumer appetite for that product, he says. 

The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don't reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says. 

The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they'd “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration. 

Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he's steadfast about: building influence.

To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me. 

That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don't invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won't reveal the names of anyone he's having conversations with. 

These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.

A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies. 

There's also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies. 

One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells. 

Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey's 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It's my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I'm using that to keep myself focused.” 

Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.

“You don't have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. Though “kind of a terrible example,” he notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn't want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company's serious molecular biology. Shift's head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed. 

Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)

During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn't doing too badly commercially. “We've had a lot of demand,” he said. “We've got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”

Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don't see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.

Vitalism, though, isn't just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It's a philosophy that's easy to get behind.”

In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay. 

Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert's brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.

Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn't agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H's press office, which didn't respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.

Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we'd love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We're starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.” 

Hamalainen supports Gries's plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don't have to convince the mainstream,” he says. Though “kind of a terrible example,” Hamalainen notes, Stalinism started small. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He's now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he's seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it's useful to have a new term.”

Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I've asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won't reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.

Even some of the founders of Vitalism don't want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia's Ion, and ARPA-H's Hamalainen. Gries won't reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don't like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That's certainly what I've found when I've asked members of the longevity community if they're Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn't want the label.

Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won't do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.

For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won't call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.

And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won't describe himself as a Vitalist either.

Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that's a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn't want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society's revealed preference.”)

Still, because Kendziorra agrees with almost everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It's to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.) 

“There's a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you'll get people who'll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don't want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”

Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist label as long as the ideas break through. “It's pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don't have to be public about it.” He says he's spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it's been going pretty well. 

Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.” 

And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don't openly identify as Vitalists. 

For Gries, this includes Jim O'Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s number two. (More recently, O'Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

O'Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman's Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O'Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O'Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O'Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)

O'Neill's views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.

The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia's Anzinger spoke about the success he'd had in Próspera, and ARPA-H's Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)

But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism's growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn't want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”

“There's a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you'll get people who'll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”

Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)

And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged. 

Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.” 

Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.

Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start. 

Then there's the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life. 

Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society. 

Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it's part of human nature.”

Imparato's family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It's the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”  

Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms. 

He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity's core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.” 

But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don't think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.

But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year's Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger's new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.

“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”

There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries's positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you're excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.

Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?

The great green “X” that brought us joy over 27 years of gaming history is once again suffering from poor hardware sales and declining revenue from its cloud-based subscriptions. This is only another note in Xbox's depressing financial diary, though this may be one of the most significant periods of loss yet.

Microsoft's personal computing business, which accounts for Windows OS, its Surface PCs, and Xbox, was down 3% compared to the same time last year. Microsoft said Xbox was what brought down the total. At the same time, the Windows OEM (original equipment manufacturer) business—namely, those businesses that partner with Microsoft to sell Windows PCs—saw revenue stay effectively flat at just 1% gains (mostly because of declines in Surface revenue) compared to the same holiday period last year. PC shipments were up year over year according to recent data, but Microsoft's hardware brands took such a licking last year that it offset any gains.

Xbox hardware revenues have not had a consistently positive number since 2023. In this past quarter ending Dec. 31, 2025, Xbox hardware declined 32%. Last year, Xbox blamed tariffs while it hiked the price of all its gaming hardware. An Xbox Series X console now costs $600 if you get a digital edition with 1TB of storage. It's no wonder the console did not sell well over the holidays.

See Xbox Series X and S at Amazon

These dour financial forecasts for Xbox don't mean Microsoft is having a bad time. On the contrary, it's making bank off its services—specifically anything that's based around AI. In its second quarterly earnings report for its 2026 fiscal year, Microsoft's total revenue was up 17% while its net income had shot up by another 23%. Its total of $81.3 billion in revenue isn't indicative of a healthy state of its consumer-end hardware.

In a thread on X, CEO Satya Nadella proclaimed his company's cloud revenue had finally hit $51.5 billion, up 26% from last year. And you can guess where the real money was. Microsoft's intelligent cloud services made up the lion's share of the profit, with its Azure and other cloud service products revenue up 39%.

Xbox content and services revenue was also down another 5%. That shouldn't be a shock, as last October Microsoft increased the price of its Game Pass Ultimate from $20 to $30 a month. In his earnings call on Wednesday, Nadella revered the “record PC players and paid streaming hours on Xbox.” That's consistent with what Xbox boss Phil Spencer recently touted in a post on LinkedIn, with Game Pass cloud hours up 45% year-over-year.

You could blame select video games for Xbox's decline. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 didn't sell nearly as well as Black Ops 6. Late last year, GamesIndustry.biz quoted data from Alinea Analytics, which said the latest Call of Duty sold just 401,000 copies on Steam close to a month after launch compared to the nearly 2.3 million of last year's rendition. Xbox had many other games released last year. Some of them were pretty good, such as The Outer Worlds 2 and Ninja Gaiden 4. There were even more remakes of Xbox 360-era classics like Gears of War: Reloaded. Even selling cross-platform, they didn't make enough money to overcome Xbox's waning hardware sales or drive more players to get a costlier Game Pass subscription.

This month, Xbox touted several new games from its portfolio we should get excited for. Two games—the open-world racing game Forza Horizon 6 and the return of the action fantasy RPG Fable—seem promising. Both of these games will also be available on PlayStation 5. The Halo remake, Halo: Campaign Evolved, and Gears of War: E-Day should also be out on Xbox services and PlayStation 5 in 2026. Plus, we'll have indie games like Double Fine's pottery brawler Kiln and likely a few surprises before Grand Theft Auto VI steals the thunder.

There's enough here for gamers to sink their teeth into, but is any of it enough to enforce more Game Pass subscriptions? They certainly won't be buying a new Xbox console for the sake of these titles, especially when the Series X without a disc drive and 1TB of storage costs $600.

Microsoft has never made most of its money on hardware. It's long been a software company first and foremost. Nadella was happy to announce Windows 11 had reached 1 billion users, a near 45% jump year over year. A big part of that metric is thanks to the company sunsetting Windows 10 and forcing users to make the switch.

Xbox is dragging down Microsoft's numbers, and that should pose a red flag for anybody who remains a fan of the brand. Nadella's recent statements have shown he wants Microsoft to become the world's true AI behemoth, and the company is spending boatloads to the tune of $37.5 billion to achieve it. Either Microsoft will continue to make record-high revenues on its software stack (while ignoring expenses), or the company will take a massive hit once the world realizes the AI buildout won't happen anytime soon. In any case, Xbox is the outlier that is dampening Microsoft's positive outlook. We can only expect more firings, more studio closures, and a harder sell for any future Xbox hardware.

In its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, tech giant Microsoft reported $37.5 billion in capital expenditures, exceeding market estimates by more than a billion. The spending was up 66% from a year earlier, and roughly two-thirds of it was primarily spent on GPUs and CPUs, Microsoft executives said in an investor call.

A few months ago, a report like this would have sent (and did send) Microsoft stock soaring. But on Wednesday, it had the opposite effect, and the stock went down 7%.

As worries over an AI bubble simmer, the market is more desperate than ever to see tangible revenue returns that can reignite belief in the great financial promises of the technology, rather than just another huge spending commitment.

But accompanying Microsoft's record spending was slowing cloud growth.

Revenue from Microsoft's cloud services grew by 39% this quarter, down from 40% growth in the first quarter. During the investor call, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood attributed this discrepancy between capital expenditure and cloud growth at least partially to Microsoft allocating GPUs and cloud capacity to internal teams as well. Customer demand for cloud is still outpacing supply, Hood said.

But even if the slowing cloud growth can be explained away, what also got investors anxious was Microsoft's reliance on AI giant OpenAI. 45% of Microsoft's remaining cloud commitments are solely from OpenAI.

Although OpenAI used to be the silver bullet for finance, growing uncertainty over the startup's road to profitability and the risks associated with its ability to pay for towering, ambitious dealmaking has made some start to view any dependence on the AI darling as a potential burden.

OpenAI has signed trillions of dollars worth of deals this past year, despite its $20 billion annualized revenue. Lately, the market has started questioning these overcommitments, as concerns over a potential AI bubble mount.

If it continues to take too long for AI investments to start translating to actual gains or if somehow it turns out OpenAI cannot pay for its piling commitments, it could lead to a sharp market correction and spell trouble for the U.S. economy, which it seems is currently held up by AI investment.

Six months into its big AI turnaround, Meta believes 2026 will be the year it starts reaping the benefits.

The tech giant has spent billions upon billions on Meta Superintelligence Labs, poaching top talent from the likes of OpenAI, Apple, and more in the hopes of revitalizing its failing AI initiatives.

The company is hoping to prove that it's finally eating the fruits of that commitment with a bunch of new AI models and products it will ship out over the coming months, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. But maybe don't expect anything groundbreaking.

“I think this is going to be a long-term effort,” Zuckerberg said. “This is a journey that we're on, and the first set of things that we put out, I think, are going to be more about showing the trajectory that we're on rather than being a single moment in time.”

Going beyond just model and product announcements, Meta is hoping that 2026 is the year it can use AI to make its existing offerings even more hyper-tailored to you. For the average user, it's going to look like an Instagram feed of eerily targeted content, thanks to an LLM-enhanced recommendation system that can understand “people's unique personal goals” and tailor ads and feeds accordingly.

“Today, our apps feel like algorithms that recommend content,” Zuckerberg said. “Soon, you'll open our apps, and you'll have an AI that understands you and also happens to be able to show you great content or even generate great personalized content for you.”

These recommendation models will leverage the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to make better guesses of what content you would like. Meta CFO Susan Li said that it will especially help with more recently posted content that has less engagement data to base recommendations on.

As of last month, the company has officially started using AI chat history to inform hyper-targeted ads and posts across platforms, except for in the European Union, where it is forced to roll out less personalized ads due to strict consumer protections.

Besides advancing the algorithm, AI is already “driving incremental time spent on Instagram,” Li said, through AI-dubbed videos into local languages.

“Hundreds of millions of people are watching AI-translated videos every day,” Li said.

This personalization effort will also translate to Meta AI offerings. The more personalized the responses are, the more the user engages with AI, Li said. But that might not always be a good thing.

OpenAI spent the past few months under intense scrutiny and some legal repercussions after it turned out that addictive AI chatbot designs inherently came with risks, especially for the mental health of vulnerable users like kids and teens.

Meta already doesn't have a good track record when it comes to AI safety guardrails for vulnerable populations, and especially for children. The company has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny after a Reuters report from the summer found that Meta allowed its chatbots to engage in “sensual” conversations with minors.

On the earnings call, Meta executives said the company might experience material loss this year due to “scrutiny on youth-related issues.”

The AI-enhanced feed is just a continuation of Zuckerberg's longstanding vision for a more “immersive and interactive” digital experience. It's the same vision that drove his huge investment and corporate shift to the Metaverse, a venture that has now amassed roughly $80 billion in total operating losses.

According to Zuckerberg, we have seen online content evolve from text to photo to video, but it has not reached its final frontier.

“Soon, we'll see an explosion of new media formats that are more immersive and interactive and only possible because of advances in AI,” Zuckerberg said in the call. “Our feeds will become more interactive overall.”

While he previously believed that virtual reality office spaces were the way this would materialize, it seems Zuckerberg has now changed his focus to artificial intelligence and wearables.

Earlier this month, Meta laid off 1,500 people in its Metaverse division as part of an initiative to shift investment from VR to wearables, like smart glasses.

“Glasses are the ultimate incarnation of this vision. They're going to be able to see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you, and help you as you go about your day,” Zuckerberg said. He even compared smart glasses to smartphones.

“I think that we're at a moment similar to when smartphones arrived, and it was clearly only a matter of time until all those flip phones became smartphones,” Zuckerberg said. “It's hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren't AI glasses.”

They Can't Find Them","https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-made-tesla-fans-think-unsupervised-robotaxis-had-arrived-they-cant-find-them-2000715299","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 10:30:26 GMT","

“Just started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car,” Elon Musk wrote on X last Thursday. That post embedded a second post from the Tesla enthusiast account @TSLA99T saying “I am in a robotaxi without safety monitor,” with a video showing the interior of a Tesla stopped at a red light. No one was in the driver's seat, and the video was taken from the back seat. The video seemed to prove that what Elon Musk was saying was true: Tesla robotaxis are truly driverless now, like Waymo rides.

Tesla's vice president of Software, Ashok Elluswamy, also posted on January 22 that Tesla was “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader Robotaxi fleet with Safety Monitors.”Since that day, small fish Tesla fans have posted on X about hoping to find unsupervised Tesla robotaxis. And it's possible unsupervised rides for paying customers are happening anonymously, but it looks more like the company is providing preview rides to extremely loyal Tesla influencers, and perhaps only with a human-driven Tesla right behind the robotaxi every step of the way.For instance, since unsupervised rides were announced, Tesla influencer David Moss, notable for claiming (with some actual evidence) that he took a coast-to-coast trip in a Tesla without touching the steering wheel, has been hard at work trying to find one.

42 Tesla Robotaxi Rides 42 L's 1 goal of finding an unsupervised Model YIt's tough to get a ride on the app & every ride I take one I see legitimately 4-5 cars mapping the area that could be on the appThis was also my 5th ride in a row with the supervisor in the drivers… pic.twitter.com/fxAvY4dWrx— David Moss (@DavidMoss) January 28, 2026

According to an X post on Tuesday—five days after Musk's announcement—Moss had taken 42 Tesla robotaxi rides, which is more than eight per day, and all of them had supervisors not just up front, but behind the wheel. Tesla moved these handlers from the passenger seat to the driver seat back in September. It's not clear if TSLA99T was claiming to have received an unsupervised Tesla robotaxi ride as a paying customer. On the same day as TSLA99T's ride, Joe Tegtmeyer—a noted Tesla super-obsessive—also rode in one of these “unsupervised” Teslas, but revealed that it was actually supervised by a chase car. This would certainly be an unwieldy way to run an app-based robotaxi operation.

According to Electrek (who first reported on this story) Tesla stock climbed 4% on the news of unsupervised robotaxis. Some headlines have seemingly also taken the bait, giving the impression that truly driverless rides are available to the public.But, as Gizmodo wrote the day after Musk's announcement, it appears that the rare “chase car” version of a theoretically unsupervised robotaxi may be the only version of an unsupervised Tesla robotaxi currently on the road, but paying customers can't even seem to access those anyway. 

As of this writing on Wednesday night, Moss was claiming to have unsuccessfully taken 54 robotaxi rides in pursuit of one unsupervised one. 

54 was not my magic number as I had to get one more ride in a Tesla Robotaxi before bed lol pic.twitter.com/rgEMIXRbig— David Moss (@DavidMoss) January 29, 2026

54 was not my magic number as I had to get one more ride in a Tesla Robotaxi before bed lol pic.twitter.com/rgEMIXRbig

 

On the Tesla earnings call that happened while Moss was still on his quest, Elon Musk mentioned unsupervised driving, saying testing is occurring in multiple cities, and that he and his company are “actually just being paranoid about safety.”

Gizmodo reached out to Tesla for information about whether or not any unsupervised rides have been given to paying customers, and whether or not any such rides involved a chase car. We will update if we hear back.

The various non-truck models of Tesla aren't known for looking super distinct from one another. If you're like me, when you see a Tesla on the road you sort of have to squint to tell the Tesla Models S and X from the more common—and cheaper—Models Y and 3. This irksome game may have just gotten easier, because Models S and X are being killed off. Eagle-eyed Tesla watchers may have noticed that Models S and X looked like they were in trouble last summer when Tesla stopped taking orders in Europe. Then on an earnings call on Wednesday, Musk confirmed our suspicions, announcing the end of production for both product families. The soon-to-be-discontinued Model S is the oldest model actively produced, having been around since 2012. It was more or less the replacement for the Roadster, the car that you probably just identified as “oh look a Tesla” when it was new. The doomed X, a luxury crossover SUV, came along three years later to serve the American taste for cars that are tall. The X is also the one with doors like the Back to the Future car. The remaining non-Cybertruck models are the Model 3, also known as “the cheapest one,” and the Model Y, also known as “the cheaper crossover SUV.” “We expect to wind down S and X production next quarter and basically stop production,” said Musk on the Wednesday earnings call, “That is slightly sad, but it's time to bring the S and X programs to an end, and it's part of our overall shift to an autonomous future.” As my colleague Zac Estrada noted, part of the purpose behind the discontinuations is, ostensibly, Tesla's plan to build robots. The company needs to free up space in its Fremont, California plant for mass production of Tesla Optimus bots—millions of them. Telsa has no choice but to take some big swings like this as it attempts to fulfill Elon Musk's outlandish promises made in recent years, pivoting from being a car company to an automation company. Never mind that automation is more of a vague concept than a product—encompassing software, robotic factories, self-driving equipment, data, and that sort of thing. Musk is essentially telling investors not to be sentimental about outmoded ideas such as Tesla being a car company. He says his robots are the future of medical care, and that in fact they are going to literally make everyone rich. No seriously, he claims his humanoid robot is going to “eliminate poverty and provide universal high income for all.”

So who needs a couple dumb old “cars” that can “make money for his company” when he's selling a dream, and he's not selling it to customers, but to investors. What's more, Wall Street is, somehow, continuing to gobble that dream right up.

Part of LA's goal to become a zero-waste city.

Most printers, laser or inkjet, are powered by cartridges that are single-use by design; you have to buy a new one when the old one runs out. This is exacerbated by the DRM-infested curfews manufacturers often put on these things, so you usually can't just refill them yourself. Thankfully, the city of Los Angeles is looking to put an end to the reign of archaic printing norms.The City Council has voted to create an ordinance that will ban single-use printer cartridges that can't be refilled or that don't have a take-back program offered by the vendor. This includes basically any ink or toner module that's bound to end up in landfill — unable to be properly recycled and therefore in the way of Los Angeles' zero-waste ambitions. Printer cartridges are usually built with a combination of plastic, metal, and chemicals that makes them hard to easily dispose. They can be treated as hazardous waste by the city, but even then it would take them hundreds of years to actually disintegrate at a waste site. Since they're designed to be thrown away in the first place, the real solution is to target the root of the issue — hence the ban.To be clear, the LA City Council isn't trying to solve the printer ink crisis or even address affordability — most people only take into account the upfront shelf cost of a printer. The angle is environmental, tied closely to reducing unnecessary loops in the distribution pipeline. Even if the vendor is supposed to collect the empty cartridge from you, there's no point if it's being discarded on your behalf.

 




Another aspect is the sheer number of options available, as one can find duplicate or counterfeit cartridges in the market that hurt production. These dupes aren't designed to be refilled either: They're just cheaper, so their existence hurts manufacturing, which the government doesn't like very much. The new law, therefore, targets single-use cartridges that violate copyright laws or infringe on IP as well. All those stories you've heard about companies blocking third-party ink or toner through firmware... those likely aren't going away. This ordinance is solely about controlling unnecessary waste caused by printer cartridges that you're forced to throw away with no recycling or remanufacturing programs in place. It still needs to be fully approved before it becomes a law and goes into effect, however.

""I'm hoping that the Chinese government would allow Nvidia to sell the H200""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


After days of back and forth and lots of unofficial information swirling, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has finally issued an ""official"" update on the H200 saga in China. Speaking to the press during a visit to Taiwan on Thursday, he confirmed that Beijing hasn't yet decided whether or not to allow imports of the chip into the country, Bloomberg reports. Understandably, the company has also not received any orders while China's stance on the matter remains unclear.

""I'm hoping that the Chinese government would allow Nvidia to sell the H200,"" Huang reportedly said. ""It's up to the Chinese government now but they are still deciding, and we are waiting patiently.”

Bloomberg says that Huang confirmed meetings with both customers and government officials had taken place during a recent trip to China, but that the CEO confirmed ""no new orders for the H200 chips were placed."" As the report notes, Chinese officials had reportedly told firms like Alibaba that they could prepare to order the chips, hinting at an imminent decision to allow at least some imports.

However, it has also been reported in previous days and weeks that Beijing has limited H200 purchases and told its customers officers to block H200 imports. The picture is anything but clear, and Huang's statement of clarification, while not a definitive resolution, is the first real official update we've had on the matter in some time.

Naturally, Huang was bullish on the merits of Nvidia's H200 offering, saying the chip is ""very good"" for the Chinese market and stating there is customer demand. Indeed, it was recently reported that some Chinese companies were considering acquiring H200 chips on the black market due to holdups.

H200 imports to China would be something of a boon to Nvidia. While the company isn't exactly strapped for cash, its market share in the country is predicted to fall drastically from 66% to just 8%. With China prioritizing homegrown silicon, and Nvidia precluded from shipping its most advanced chips to the nation, it seems unlikely that those fortunes will turn around. But H200 imports to China would give the company revenue, and more importantly, keep itself relevant with CUDA while China explores other options.

It's time to update the trial copy of WinRAR on your PC.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A WinRAR exploit that has been discovered and patched in July 2025 remains widely used by threat actors — many of them government-backed — where a malicious archive delivers its hidden payload to a critical directory like the Windows Startup folder. According to the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), attackers take advantage of the CVE-2025-8088 critical vulnerability, which has since been addressed with the latest release of WinRAR, version 7.13. However, it seems that users are slow to update their software, as GTIG says that it is still a popular vector used by attackers linked to both China and Russia.

CVE-2025-8088 describes a path traversal vulnerability in earlier versions of WinRAR, in which malicious actors create archives that have a hidden payload. When the victim opens it, the payload is then surreptitiously delivered to a critical path. The Windows Startup folder is often one of the default destinations, ensuring that the delivered malware is executed the next time the user opens or restarts their computer.

Despite the ubiquity of fast internet and cloud storage, archiving apps like WinRAR, WinZip, and 7-Zip remain popular among some users. That's because they allow you to package multiple files and folders into one clean file and allow for encryption and password protection. Aside from that, they also compress the file size, reducing the amount of data needed to download them and helping save on data costs.

More importantly, this particular archiving app is quite popular because of how the company enforces its license. Although WinRAR comes with a 40-day trial period, you're supposed to pay for it once that has expired. However, most people just close that window without reading it and continue using the app normally without spending a single cent, and you can do this for life. Because of this, they might have also missed the security warning that RARLAB, the company behind WinRAR, added to the bottom of the expired trial notification window.

According to GITG, Ukrainian military units and government entities are often targeted by this exploit, mostly for espionage. However, commercial entities are also prone to this attack, with victims recorded in Indonesia, LATAM, and Brazil. So, if you have WinRAR installed on your system, it's best that you upgrade it to the latest version to avoid becoming victimized through this attack vector.

The TeamGroup NV5000 feels like a drive from a different time period, which makes total sense as the SSD market is starting to feel like a return to a time of higher storage prices. SSDs used to be a luxury but now it feels almost impossible to live without one. The enhanced responsiveness offered over HDDs is just too good to pass up. The real questions become, which SSD offers the best value? What's the least I can get away with? Do I really need the newest and best?

The NV5000 ignores all these questions and simply offers a PCIe 3.0 SSD experience, even though it is a PCIe 4.0 drive, while still being fast enough for a PS5.

PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSDs were the first to offer an experience that improved upon SATA SSDs in terms of bandwidth and, to some degree, responsiveness. We also began to see real competition for Samsung with drives like the HP EX920 and the first competitive use of QLC with the Intel 660p. For many people, this is when NVMe SSDs got “good enough” to be a real option, and everything that came after only offered higher numbers on a box. We don't fully agree with that analysis, but it's impossible to deny that even very basic SSDs can vastly improve your desktop experience.

In fact, the demand for simple PCIe 3.0 SSDs has led to a situation where drives like the NV5000 – and even some actual PCIe 3.0 drives – have come to market recently, in part as a reaction to unparalleled memory demand for AI. While it was always possible to roll the die on a mystery SSD from AliExpress, some manufacturers are attempting to back it with a real name. This is essentially the idea behind Kingston's NV series of drives, but also applies to some budget favorites like TeamGroup's own MP44L. Some of these drives have good hardware at launch, but become randomized down the line because newer flash is more likely to be paired with faster controllers. As a result, the budget drives will tap into older flash stock,s which can help reduce or maintain cost.

It may seem odd that we're reviewing a drive like this in 2026. In fact, it's valuable to have information about drives like this so that you can be a more discerning buyer if you're on a budget. You can make more educated guesses about unknown drives by understanding how to recognize and gauge the hardware. In most cases, people care more about reliability than performance, so a thorough reading of the hardware can also reduce uncertainty in a purchase. TeamGroup is a brand that's known well enough, and the NV5000 is an interesting alternative to the popular MP44L. It's not going to be the fastest or most efficient drive out there, but do you really need all of that for a games drive? We have the numbers, but that part is up to you.

The TeamGroup NV5000 is only found at the most popular capacities of 1TB and 2TB. At the time of review, these were going for $145.99 and $232.99, which are probably too high for what this drive offers. It needs to be below $200 at 2TB – at the time of review – to be worth a look, but prices are changing daily. You should expect it to be the least expensive PCIe 4.0 drive at the time of purchase in order for it to be worth your time, so reassess the price as you go.

The drive is capable of reaching up to 5,000 / 3,000 MB/s, with no random IOPS specifications given. From similar drives, like the Klevv CRAS C910, we would expect the drive to top out at 600,000 IOPS.

This drive is warrantied for up to 320TB of writes per TB of capacity over three years. While this is on the low side, the drive writes per day – an adjustment made to compare write endurance to the warranty period – is within the expected range for TLC flash.

TeamGroup's primary download for SSDs is its SSD S.M.A.R.T. Tool. This application actually includes more than just a SMART-reading capability, as it can display system hardware information and also has a built-in CrystalDiskMark-like performance test. For drive cloning and backup, we recommend the free Multi-Drive, which continues to see improvement.

The drive is non-descript, having only a label with standard information. The rated power is 3V/2.5A, which, with tolerance, has a ceiling around 8W, which happens to be the maximum power draw rating of the drive via SMART. This is certainly on the high side for a budget-oriented, DRAM-less SSD, but it is to be expected with a robust eight-channel controller and older flash. This drive is not ideal for laptops, as a result, but for light use, it's perfectly fine. The label is constructed with graphene, which does assist with heatspreading enough to make the drive workable.

There are two elements we want to discuss here: the Realtek RTS5772DL controller and the flash. We'll start with the flash. These NAND flash packages are, thankfully, relatively easy to recognize with their standard coding. Identifying flash is something many users may like to do, so we'll break this down and show how it works, going from left to right.

The beginning “PF” just means it's lead-free. Keen-eyed readers will then recognize the “29” from the days of Intel and Micron's joint partnership, IMFT, as this group designator was used for both Intel (now Solidigm) and Micron (“MT29”) flash.

“F” means flash rather than the 3D XPoint crossbar memory found in Optane products. “04T” indicates 4Tb, or 512GB, flash packages, which add up to the expected 2TB. The following “2A” indicates support for two channels, something we'll touch on when discussing the controller, followed by “O” for an octal or eight-die package. This indicates 32 total dies that must be 512Gb, or 64GB, each. “C” indicates the Vcc/VccQ voltages/ranges, while “T” stands for TLC, rather than “Q” for QLC, with the remaining two letters indicating product generation. The “J” letter position is something we've seen on many Intel products through the years – the Intel 660p has “H” for 64-Layer, the 665p has “J” for 96-Layer, and the 670p has “K” for 144-layer – so we can now identify this as 96-Layer TLC, or B27A, and everything else fits to make that valid.

This is an older flash made to run at a maximum of 800 MT/s, which, if you do the math, means you really need eight channels – and this works well with each of the four flash packages being capable of handling two channels – in order to hit the NV5000's rated speeds. This is simply a matter of converting MT/s to MB/s and multiplying by the channel count, knowing that the actual bandwidth available will be less than that number. This drive is never going to hit the PCIe 4.0 maximum, but it's also going to exceed 3.0 speeds. It reminds us of the popular SK hynix Gold P31, a drive that was fast enough to be a low-end PCIe 4.0 drive with just four channels of faster flash, but was sold at PCIe 3.0 instead. That turned out to be a really good idea, as the drive was and remains extremely popular even with some of its OEM counterparts. Had it been released as PCIe 4.0, it would have been along the lines of the Kingston NV2 or WD Black SN750SE, instead.

The NV5000 and its flash need at least six channels – using 800 MT/s flash rather than the 1,200 MT/s of the Gold P41 – to match that barely-passing grade, so we're not surprised to see an eight-channel controller here. Realtek doesn't have the best reputation for SSD controllers, with the main negative being that they have a habit of running hot. Unfortunately, the choice of an eight-channel controller is not going to make things better in that department. This controller should be inefficient and hot-running, which reduces its potential as you might not want this in your laptop. On the other hand, it's technically fast enough for the PS5, and the drive could be cooled pretty easily with aftermarket solutions. Further, some of the overheating issues of past Realtek controllers were caused by a reading error and could be fixed with proper firmware.

The fact is, if you're using older flash but still want to hit that target, then you need a controller like this. We've explained why that is a technical necessity, but we want to emphasize that this is about making a budget drive work. We say this is a “blast from the past” because, fundamentally, this is a PCIe 3.0 SSD. A common belief on hardware sites and forums is that any SSD will do, even SATA SSDs, and that PCIe 3.0 is enough for anybody. If only those manufacturers would listen! Well, TeamGroup – being the masters of budget SSDs – kinda did. This drive is something you can find at retail and will work in your old machines, within reason. The controller isn't as dated as it appears, but it's DRAM-less and needs more channels to make up for slower flash. That helps save on cost in comparison to newer, DRAM-equipped controllers. The result is a Realtek controller that's functional, and that's about all we can say for it. Other manufacturers have their own solutions for this spot – the Phison E19T and SMI SM2267XT come to mind – but even at the best of times, they were always budget-oriented.

What is treatment-resistant depression? The true definition is failure to respond to at least two antidepressant medications after giving them the appropriate amount of time to work, which is usually about 6-8 weeks, and still meeting criteria for a depressive episode. That can mean having low mood, changes in sleep, changes in energy levels or appetite, feeling hopeless or guilty — any and all of the above.

There is a wide range of reasons why people can be considered ""treatment resistant"" for depression. One is biological. Some people are genetically made up to respond better or worse to certain medications, and sometimes antidepressants do not work for them.

Another reason could be comorbid factors. An additional medical illness or concurring psychiatric illness might be getting in the way of treating depression.

Or maybe it's an incorrect diagnosis. If we are constantly trying to treat low mood and the patient is still not getting better, maybe it's time for the psychiatrist to think, Okay, is this actually true depression, or should I be trying to treat something else? 

What can you do for a patient who is diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression? You can augment with a different class of medications or try an interventional approach — things like transcranial magnetic stimulation or electroconvulsive therapy. These are ways that you can try to target depressive symptoms without resorting to medication.

An Italian study found that more than 50% of children on chronic dialysis required hospitalisation, with dialysis-related infections being the most common cause. Children who underwent peritoneal dialysis experienced a higher and increasing risk for hospitalisation than those who underwent haemodialysis.

""Dialysis-related infections, especially peritonitis in PD [peritoneal dialysis] patients, emerged as a major contributor to this elevated risk. These findings underscore the critical need for enhanced infection prevention measures and an integrative care approach to improve outcomes and quality of life for pediatric patients with kidney failure,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Rachele Spagnol, University Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy. It was published online on January 19, 2026, in Pediatric Nephrology.

This study relied on retrospective registry data, and information on some variables was incomplete or missing. The registry only recorded inpatient admissions and did not capture outpatient treatments. Changes in practice patterns over the 20-year observation period may have influenced the results.

This study did not receive any relevant financial support. The authors declared having no competing interests.

Cardiovascular risk factors such as high BMI, unfavorable lipid profiles, or high blood pressure from infancy to adolescence were associated with poorer cognitive function in young adulthood. These associations were particularly evident for cognitive flexibility.

“This study strengthens evidence on the important role of cardiovascular risk factors contributing to cognitive function even early on during the life course,” the authors of the study wrote. “These results suggest that even slightly elevated cardiovascular risk factors might play a role in adulthood cognitive function. Thus, an even more aggressive approach to cardiovascular risk management in childhood might be meaningful,” they concluded.

The study was led by Henri Salo, MD, Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. It was published online on January 15, 2026, in Pediatrics.

The cohort was healthy, with little variation in cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive function. The lack of baseline cognitive data prevented understanding of early cognitive changes. The homogeneous ethnic background of the participants might limit the applicability of the findings to other populations.

The study was supported by grants from the Academy of Finland, the Juho Vainio Foundation, the Finnish Foundation for Cardiovascular Research, the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, and other sources. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Marwah Abdalla, MD, MPH: Hello. I am Dr Marwah Abdalla. Welcome to the Medscape InDiscussion podcast series on secondary hypertension. Today's episode focuses on Cushing syndrome, an often overlooked cause of secondary hypertension. We'll discuss why this condition is frequently missed, how clinicians can screen for cortisol excess in patients with hypertension, and what to consider when managing blood pressure in those found to have hypercortisolism.

And with the 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology multi-society high blood pressure guideline emphasizing routine screening for secondary causes, especially in resistant or early-onset hypertension, this topic is more relevant than ever.

First, let me introduce my guest, Dr Lewis Blevins. Dr Blevins is a neuroendocrinologist specializing in the evaluation and management of pituitary and hypothalamic disorders and various adrenal conditions. As the medical director of the California Center for Pituitary Disorders at UCSF Medical Center, he guides a team that provides comprehensive, state-of-the-art care.

He has a special interest in Cushing syndrome, also known as hypercortisolism. He has edited a book on the subject and written a book on the topic directed toward patients and physicians. Welcome to the Medscape InDiscussion Secondary Hypertension podcast.

Lewis S. Blevins, MD: Thank you. It's my pleasure to join you today.

Abdalla: Why do you think hypercortisolism is still such an underrecognized cause of secondary hypertension?

Blevins: That's a good question. I think it's underrecognized because it's a rare disease. People don't think about rare diseases as often as they do the common things that come into the clinical practice. Physicians are busy; they're seeing a lot of patients, there are time crunches and things like that.

You tend to want to treat the numbers, so to speak, and to get the blood pressure under control to prevent morbidity and mortality as a result of the hypertension. Sometimes you forget that there's a cause behind the scenes that needs to be addressed.

Another potential reason is the fact that no two patients with Cushing syndrome are alike. We all learned about Cushing syndrome in medical school and residency, and patients who look like Harvey Cushing's patient, Minnie G, but it turns out most patients don't look that way. So it's not like you can say, ""There's a zebra. It has black and white stripes."" These patients have the zebra diagnosis, which is rare, but they don't look like zebras at all, most of the time; only about 20%-30% of people do. The remainder are less than that, or they have a different constellation of symptoms and signs than this typical textbook case. So they don't scream, ""Here I am. A zebra in your waiting room,"" as many other diseases would, or as we might expect Cushing syndrome, too. But people have, in their mind, that's what the Cushing patient looks like, so they miss it.

Abdalla: Are there certain patient populations where you think it's especially easy to overlook?

Blevins: I think patients with adrenal hypercortisolism are probably easy to overlook because they are the ones that most often don't look cushingoid. Now with severe disease, they will look cushingoid with marked high cortisol levels, big tumors, for example. But by and large, most people with the adrenal adenomas have mild autonomous cortisol secretion. Or very mild hypercortisolism. They don't look cushingoid at all. And we recognize this is probably an emerging cause of...well, not an emerging cause — it's been there all along — but it's an increasingly recognized cause of hypercortisolism. And it used to be thought that about 65% of people had a pituitary tumor, 10% had a tumor elsewhere, and the remainder were adrenal disease.

It may actually be 50/50, so half the people with hypercortisolism that need attention may have adrenal disease. The other half have either ectopic ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) production or a pituitary tumor.

Abdalla: How much of this underrecognition do you think is actually related to terminology? There are many terms, and different, as you say, phenotypes and expressions. So, mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), hidden hypercortisolism, Cushing's. How do you think these labels may contribute to confusion amongst clinicians? Can you clarify what these are?

Blevins: I think they certainly contribute to confusion because people haven't heard them before. But I think that we're on the right track to sort of advertise and broadcast that there are more subtle occurrences of this disease process that we think of as hypercortisolism; whether it's pituitary disease or adrenal disease, both can present with hidden hypercortisolism.

And what's meant by that is someone has something like hypertension, osteoporosis, or uncontrolled diabetes, and then when they're worked up, they're found to have Cushing's. They didn't look cushingoid. So it was hidden, so to speak. It's kind of a misnomer because it wasn't hidden at all, because the hypertension or whatever the gateway diagnosis was, was there — that's the workup.

I don't really like the term hidden. I think it sends the message that, well, if something's hidden, maybe we'd better try to uncover it. So, I accept it for that reason. Mild autonomous cortisol secretion is a good term. I like to think that those people wouldn't have symptoms and signs unless they had relative hypercortisolism. That group of people have a normal urine cortisol level. So that's why it's called autonomous cortisol secretion. Because you can detect that with certain dynamic diagnostic tests, but the truth of the matter is, they wouldn't have hypertension or diabetes if they weren't producing more cortisol for their body.

Everybody has their own normal cortisol production rate. If you check cortisol levels a hundred times on me or you or anybody listening, we would probably see a normal distribution, a mean, and a standard deviation, and that would be where our body wants to be physiologically.

So if my normal level is 20 +/- two standard deviations, maybe it goes down to 7-27 or something like that, and I'm sitting at 40, which is still in a normal range, I'm making double the cortisol that my body needs — and that can cause hypertension, diabetes, insomnia, weight gain, and things like that.

The big trap out there is that someone thinks of Cushing's, and they do a urine cortisol, it's normal, and they dismiss the diagnosis because the cortisol level is normal. But that patient may actually be producing double or even triple the cortisol they should be producing for their body, and they're getting those clinical manifestations as a result of that.

I like the mild autonomous cortisol secretion thing, but those people probably have relative hypercortisolism. I like the term pathologic cortisol secretion, and that's a term that I coined and published recently — that it is due to pathology process. As cortisol secretion, it defines it as abnormal cortisol secretion, whether the patient is frankly hypercortisolemic or normal cortisolemic, I think that term is a good one. I like to use the term Cushing syndrome for people who look like the patient that Harvey Cushing described. Everything else I like to refer to as hypercortisolism, and if it's due to the pituitary, I'll call it ACTH-dependent pituitary hypercortisolism. If it's due to the adrenals, we'll talk about ACTH-independent adrenal hypercortisolism, for example. I think that the terminology is evolving, and hopefully, will evolve at a rate that we can keep up with it and educate people about it so that everybody's on the same page.

Abdalla: For clinicians managing hypertension in busy practices, what early or less obvious clinical features should prompt us to consider cortisol excess as a driver of high blood pressure?

Blevins: I'll answer that question talking about my own clinical practice. I see a lot of people with Cushing's. Most of them have run-of-the-mill hypertension. They're on one or two drugs. Many of them are controlled, so that you can't really say, oh, it's just the people with uncontrolled hypertension or multidrug resistant hypertension, or those with hypokalemia, for example, and edema. You need to recognize that anybody with hypertension can have Cushing syndrome or hypercortisolism. In that case, you want to look for other clues like abnormal weight gain, insomnia, and things of that nature. Some of the more mundane things that you can see in hypercortisolism in a patient that doesn't look like they've been taking high doses of prednisone, for example.

Typically, if you had to pick out a group of people to screen and wanted to sort of catch those who were the most treatment-resistant, requiring multiple drugs, who had hypokalemia, had a low renin and a low aldosterone because it's a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, those would be the ones to think that they might truly have Cushing's.

In fact, if you had to do a blood test to screen, probably looking at the renin and aldosterone and interpreting that in conjunction with the drugs the patient is taking, because a lot of these drugs affect renin and aldosterone levels. But most of the drugs for hypertension raise renin. If you've got a low renin and a low aldosterone and a resistant hypertensive patient, you probably have hypercortisolism, a pretty good screening test.

The dexamethasone suppression test, the 1 mg overnight test, is a good screening test as well. But I think for someone who focuses on cardiology and hypertension, just check that renin and aldosterone. And if they're surprisingly both low, then think about hypercortisolism in that setting. There are other reasons they could be low, but that's a nice screen for that resistant patient in a hypertension clinic, for example.

Abdalla: After you see that, what then should be the next steps for a general clinician?

Blevins: I look at the history. Is there insomnia? Is there weight gain, premature osteoporosis, stretch marks, or easy bruising? Just look at the whole clinical picture because that's going to get back to the Bayesian theories of the pretest probabilities being abnormal.

A person off the street with no pretest likelihood, because they don't have any of those things, the abnormal test results are more likely to be incorrect. So I like to think of Bayesian statistics in the evaluation here: You want to look at all those predictors to see whether your abnormal test is likely to be true, and then go on to a screening test.

And the screening test can be any number of things. A late-night salivary cortisol, an overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test, or a 24-hour urine. Since many people have normal 24-hour urines, that's not always going to pick up the disease. The overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test probably has a false-positive rate of 25%-35% depending on the dexamethasone level you require for a normal test and the cutoff you use. The late-night salivary cortisol test is not always great because some people have normal levels, but they're still producing cortisol throughout the day instead of in a diurnal variation. That's particularly true of adrenal disease.

You're more likely to see an abnormal salivary cortisol in a Cushing's patient with a pituitary tumor than you are with early adrenal disease. So none of these screening tests is perfect, but I think they're all very useful in the context where you have a high pretest likelihood of having the disease. Any one of them can work. Whatever works for the busy clinician. Then, once you have a positive screening test, you have to go to a diagnostic test. Diagnostic tests are still the same screening tests. Some people will do a 2-day dexamethasone suppression test. Other people like to see two or three urine cortisols and things of that nature before they go on to doing imaging studies to try to find the site of disease. Obviously, an ACTH level helps you figure out if this is ACTH-dependent due to pituitary ectopic disease, or low, in which case it would likely be due to adrenal disease.

Abdalla: What about blood pressure monitoring? The guidelines suggest we should do more out-of-office blood pressure monitoring, whether it's home blood pressure monitoring, ABPM (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). So do patterns like nocturnal hypertension or non-dipping also potentially raise a flag that there may be cortisol-related hypertension.

Blevins: I have not used those monitoring devices in my patients, but I'm aware of the literature that indeed, you do lose your variation in blood pressure when you have hypercortisolism because you're making cortisol throughout the day. There's a loss of that variation. And nocturnal hypertension seems to be a real problem.

Abdalla: I want to shift to a very common real-world scenario. With a lot more imaging, there are a lot more incidentalomas. So the adrenal incidentaloma is showing up more often. There's a great 2024 paper in Nature Reviews Endocrinology noting that about 20%-50% of these patients have some mild autonomous cortisol secretion, and hypertension is usually the leading clinical consequence. How should clinicians think about these incidental adrenal nodules in the context of evaluating secondary hypertension?

Lewis: That's a very good question. Obviously, these are common; radiologists see them and report them. Studies have shown that most people don't get an evaluation. Other studies have shown that anywhere from 20% to even 45% of patients will have mild autonomous cortisol secretion. And when we look at those people in long-term studies, we see that they acquire additional morbidity and even some mortality over time with an increase in hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, progression of osteoporosis, neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs as well. So it's believed that they need to be treated.

Chiodini and others in Italy recently presented at the Endocrine Society a paper showing that these patients actually benefit from adrenalectomy, or some other treatment. They didn't study that, but you could treat medically as well, and you would see benefit in improvement in these cardiometabolic parameters of disease that are related to these adrenal incidentalomas in people with MACS.

So I think it's critical to evaluate all of these patients, especially when they have a background of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or osteoporosis, and maybe you use those gateway diagnoses as the reason to evaluate a person with an adrenal incidentaloma. For example, someone has had an abdominal injury and has an adrenal incidentaloma but is of normal weight and has no other disease processes. You probably get away with not evaluating that person, but as an endocrinologist, I feel the buck stops with my colleague and me. We should evaluate everybody, and I encourage primary physicians if they don't know or want to evaluate to at least refer to an endocrinologist to get an opinion. Everybody should be tested for hypercortisolism and hyperaldosteronism, even if they don't have hypokalemia and hypertension that's uncontrolled, in my opinion, and certainly if it's an adrenal medullary tumor for pheochromocytoma.

Abdalla: It'd be great to have unified diagnostic criteria, as well. I think one of the things that's for the lung nodules that really helped is the Fleischner's criteria, or people sort of pushing folks to evaluate a disturbance at a screening level. It's very, very interesting.

So another challenge I think clinicians often have is distinguishing true Cushing's from pseudo-Cushing's states caused by conditions like depression, pregnancy, alcohol use, and uncontrolled diabetes. So how do you think clinicians should approach these cases diagnostically when hypertension is part of the picture?

Blevins: That is probably the one arena of pituitary and adrenal medicine that is most difficult. I have seen patients referred to me by other endocrinologists, who said the patient had pseudo-Cushing's and they ended up having an adrenal tumor that we removed, and they recovered. Same thing with pituitary disease. I have seen people that I labeled as having pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, who three years later developed a pituitary tumor and had pituitary disease all along.

My overarching conclusion is that whenever you think a patient has pseudo-Cushing's, you should refer the patient to another qualified opinion from an experienced clinician. Because the more eyes you have looking at a patient and reviewing the data, the more likely you'll arrive at a correct diagnosis.

Abdalla: So a lot of times patients go through many, many different tests. You see many subspecialists, like you just said. What can we do better as clinicians to sort of prepare our patients for the workup and the journey they may go through while undergoing testing, seeing subspecialists and, for some, undergoing surgery?

Blevins: This is a difficult journey for patients because they come to you and they've been sick for years or have had the comorbidities for a long time, and they're frustrated because they can't be controlled and they hear they may have a particular diagnosis, and they want to know yesterday whether they have that and they want to move to treatment right away. Because it's like now there's hope that they can get controlled and maybe come off a group of medications.

I think it's important as a clinician to tell patients that we need to take our time and proceed in a logical, stepwise fashion: Evaluate them, first confirming that they have the disease, and then second, try to establish the differential diagnosis and work through that before we can even arrive at a treatment plan.

The NIH reported in the 1990s on people that it took 20 years to find the culprit, to find the tumor that was an ectopic, ACTH-producing tumor. I've seen people present to me who have been evaluated off and on for 15 years, and you know, it was obvious to me they had Cushing's all along, but the clinicians evaluating them weren't entirely sure.

That's not anything against the clinician because experience matters in this arena. And it's important to get people to physicians who have experience so that they can, if you will, accelerate that workup. But patients need to learn that not all tests are going to be informative. And sometimes a tincture of time is what we need — 6 months to repeat tests, 6 months later, maybe a year later, just to see.

Because Cushing's usually progresses in most people. Not always the adrenal adenomas, but with pituitary disease it will. And I think it's important to prepare patients for the fact that this might be a bit of a journey to get to diagnosis and treatment.

Abdalla: It sounds like an important step is really having a great clinician-patient relationship. Especially if they're going to go back and forth through things in order to get them through this journey. So, why don't we wrap up now by talking about management pathways. Is there a need to modify antihypertensive medication strategies while evaluating or treating hypercortisolism?

Blevins: Patients with hypercortisolism tend to respond best to drugs that block the aldosterone receptor. If patients haven't been on those drugs, it's good to think about them. You know, whether you use spironolactone or eplerenone, those are good drugs. Some of the ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) work, but not as well. Certainly, alpha blockade isn't going to work well, and calcium channel blockade doesn't work well either, nor does beta blockade.

So I think once you sort of figure out that you're on the pathway to Cushing's, it's important to try to choose some of those drugs. Still, they're not going to work. Or not going to work well, I should say. Treatment really comes down to identifying the disease state and treating that disease state, whether it be with medication to block adrenal corticosteroid production, or adrenalectomy, or removal of a pituitary tumor, or say a carcinoid in the lung causing ectopic ACTH. It really comes down to treating that underlying diagnosis. And once you treat the patient, you usually see — not in everybody — but you usually see hypertension resolve.

Some people do require medication still. Probably, they had endogenous hypertension that was just worsened by having a disease state that exacerbated it. And on that line, I think the people who look like Harvey Cushing's patients are the ones who probably have the multigenic condition that leads to what we call metabolic syndrome.

If you have metabolic syndrome in your family — and you're going to have that anyway if you get Cushing's — that's when you probably most likely look like Harvey Cushing's patient. I just sense that based on 35 years of doing this and seeing a large number of patients and figuring out why some people look like they have Cushing's and other people don't.

When their families start coming in, you can see these people have metabolic syndrome. There's diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. The cushingoid patient who has that is going to look more cushingoid. And it may be that the person who gets the multidrug-resistant hypertension is the one who has endogenous hypertension anyway. And then it's just compounded by the Cushing's. And the people that I see that have what looks like run-of-the-mill hypertension are the ones that just have it from hypercortisolism. We always think about these patients having hypertension, hypokalemia, and multidrug-resistant hypertension. But that's actually rare. I've seen four people this year, but maybe usually 1 of the 40 or so people I see every year would have that pattern. But it's been four this past year. It is interesting that they all came at the same time.

It's probably 50 people I see with Cushing's per year, and one or two might have hypokalemia, but this year it's been four of them. So it's very interesting. I think finding the disease state gets you onto the pathway of treatment. And then usually if you are going to come off medications, it's a period of 3-4 weeks for people to resolve their medication.

Abdalla: That's fantastic. We've covered a lot today, Dr Blevins. Thank you so much for joining us. If you had to leave clinicians with your three key takeaways about why hypercortisolism is missed, when to screen, and how to manage blood pressure, what would they be?

Blevins: I used the term zebras before; that's the term we use in medical school. The patients with hypercortisolism are zebras and are rare. But they often look like horses. So think about Cushing's in anybody with hypertension, and especially if they're on more than one drug to try to get control. It doesn't take a lot of energy to think about it and decide whether you're going to do a test or to think about whether they have some of the other symptoms and signs.

And when you think about all the other things we do, it's less energy to do some diagnostic tests than it is to arrange for some other things that we do for our patients. So think about it, and screen for it when you think about it. That's how you're going to find patients. Once you find a case or see something else that might be related to Cushing's, like that adrenal adenoma that's detected instantly on a scan, refer a patient to an endocrinologist for a bona fide workup, and let them do all the thinking for you and share in the care of your patient.

Abdalla: Great. Well, thank you so much, and thank you all for tuning in. Please take a moment to download the Medscape app to listen to and subscribe to this podcast's series on secondary hypertension.

Exercise not only helps build stronger muscles but also fosters a healthier gut microbiome, with far-reaching benefits for gastrointestinal (GI) health and disease prevention, according to a comprehensive literature review.

Research has shown that physical activity enhances microbial diversity, boosts beneficial short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, and strengthens the gut barrier. These shifts reduce inflammation and may guard against chronic conditions ranging from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to colorectal cancer (CRC).

“I think if clinicians were fully aware of the benefits of exercise for metabolic health in general, and gut health specifically, then they would be more inclined to recommend exercise programs as part of their treatment plans,” first author John Hawley, PhD, with the Mary MacKillop Institute for Health Research, Australian Catholic University in Melbourne, Australia, told Medscape Medical News.

“The problem here starts in medical school, where clinicians have only minimal exposure to both the massive evidence-based literature supporting exercise and dietary interventions for healthspan (as opposed to longevity),” Hawley said.

The review was published in the journal Gastroenterology.

Recent research has revealed notable “crosstalk” between skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota, the authors noted.

Evidence has shown that contracting skeletal muscles release signaling molecules called “myokines” that communicate directly with the gut, which “boosts host immunity, facilitates a more diverse gut microbiome and functional metabolome, and plays a positive role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation,” they explained. 

In studies, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity has consistently correlated with a lower risk for metabolic liver disease, IBD, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In patients with IBS, exercise has been shown to improve motility and ease symptoms, while in those with IBD, it can reduce inflammation and enhance quality of life, the authors noted.

For example, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that exercise improved IBD activity compared with controls.

In a separate study, a combination of exercise and psychological interventions in patients with Crohn's disease led to positive changes in their intestinal microbiome, accompanied by reductions in systemic markers of inflammation. 

The protective effect of regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on cancer risk has been well established, most notably for CRC, with regular exercise shown to cut CRC risk by as much as 40%. Exercise has also been shown to protect against CRC recurrence and improve survival.

Research has also shown greater gut microbiome diversity and differential abundances in CRC survivors who were physically active than in peers who were more sedentary.

Refining the Gut-Exercise Landscape

Despite the large interindividual variation in the human gut microbiome, reduced microbial diversity has been implicated in several GI tract diseases, systemic immune diseases, and cancers, the authors noted.

Accordingly, the gut microbiome has become an attractive target for modulating many of the positive effects of regular physical activity on GI health and disease. However, the precise dose of exercise required to improve GI health is currently unknown.

While moderate exercise strengthens gut health, prolonged intense training can temporarily increase gut permeability, causing symptoms such as cramping or diarrhea. These effects, however, are typically mild and reversible, research has shown.

“We need studies to define the precise dose and frequency of exercise required to promote favorable changes in the microbiome and enhance host immunity,” Hawley told Medscape Medical News. 

“This is essential because, unfortunately, the majority of the (lazy) population want a ‘quick fix' for everything and will only be interested in the minimum requirements to induce these positive effects,” Hawley said.

Hawley believes novel targets uncovered by various “omics” technologies will “undoubtedly help refine the gut-exercise landscape and shape future interventions and treatment therapies.” 

“It is hoped that future therapies to treat a range of GI-related disorders, including cancers, will be based on a growing recognition that regular [physical activity] can positively modify the human gut microbiome, boost immunity, and decrease the incidence, progression, and personal burden of these noncommunicable diseases,” Hawley and colleagues wrote. ""As such, it is recommended that regular physical activity be incorporated into standard clinical treatment protocols for individuals with several GI-related diseases,” they concluded. 

Targeting the gut microbiome for health through probiotics, diet, or fecal microbiota transplantation has the potential to enhance the protective effects of exercise against GI diseases.

The gut-brain-microbiome axis remains “an emerging field of study,” Aasma Shaukat, MD, MPH, gastroenterologist with NYU Langone Health and director of GI Outcomes Research, Gastroenterology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, both in New York City, told Medscape Medical News.

“We're learning more and more about this, and we need to because the microbial colonies are so diverse and we haven't nailed it down yet,” said Shaukat, who wasn't involved in the review. 

Physical activity is “clearly beneficial for the gut microbiome. It regulates the gut motility and also helps us kind of digest food in a way that the gut bacteria can actually feed on the good components and proliferate,” Shaukat said. 

In her own practice, Shaukat said she encourages patients to engage in regular physical activity, which can also boost mood and help relieve stress.

Eating well is also a key ingredient for gut health. 

“What we tell patients is to essentially increase their intake of gut-friendly foods that preferentially grow the bacterial colonies that are beneficial for us,” Shaukat said. This includes fermented foods, yogurt, kimchi, chia seeds, kombucha, pickled vegetables, and whole grains.

“By and large, a balanced Mediterranean diet and regular activity are truly the secret to gut health,” Shaukat said.

In a national retrospective cohort study in England, the incidence rate of vulval squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) remained stable from 2013 to 2022, with diagnostic delays owing to poor awareness and clinical presentation challenges.

""Although artificial intelligence and virtual consultations show promise in skin cancer triage, they present challenges in VSCC,"" the authors wrote. ""Promoting awareness and early detection of vulval changes mitigate physical and psychosexual sequelae of late-stage management of this under reported cancer,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Charlotte Sheern, Norwich Medical School, Norwich, England. It was published online on January 17, 2026, in the British Journal of Dermatology.

Incomplete data collection, particularly regarding surgical procedure codes, may have resulted in an underestimation of surgical excision proportions. The findings were also limited by the focus on self-identifying women in England, which affected generalisability to other populations.

This research did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. One author reported receiving support for research projects with Regeneron, Merck, and SkinAnalytics. Another author reported being an employee of the British Association of Dermatologists.

The FDA has approved daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj (Darzalex Faspro, Janssen Biotech) in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant.

The subcutaneous CD38 monoclonal antibody was previously approved with the same drug combination for patients with transplant-eligible disease. It also carries a previous indication for newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma but with melphalan and prednisone, in addition to bortezomib.

The new approval marks the 12th indication for Darzalex Faspro and the fifth in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, according to a company press release. It was based on the open-label CEPHEUS trial, which randomly assigned 395 patients equally to either daratumumab and hyaluronidase with VRd (D-VRd) or VRd alone for eight cycles, followed by lenalidomide and dexamethasone for all patients and continued daratumumab and hyaluronidase in the D-VRd group until progression.

At a median follow-up of 22 months, the minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate was 52.3% vs 34.8% in the D-VRd arm vs VRd alone. The progression-free survival hazard ratio was 0.60 (P = .0078).

Longer-term results published in Nature Medicine showed that over nearly 5 years, D-VRd led to higher rates of complete response or better (81.2% vs 61.6%; P < .0001) and sustained MRD negativity (48.7% vs 26.3%; P < .0001). Overall survival data were not yet mature.

Labelling warns of infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, cardiac toxicity in patients with light chain amyloidosis, and other issues. The FDA announcement noted that the effectiveness of D-VRd has not been established in patients who refused stem cell transplants as their initial therapy.

The recommended Darzalex Faspro dose is 1800 mg of daratumumab and 30,000 units of hyaluronidase, administered subcutaneously.

Nearly 1 in 5 patients with confirmed amoxicillin hypersensitivity also reacted to piperacillin-tazobactam; most cross-reactions were identified using skin testing.

“These results highlight the importance of a systematic allergy evaluation, including both [skin testing] and supervised [drug provocation testing],” the authors of the study wrote. “Such an approach ensures that most patients with [amoxicillin] allergy can safely receive [piperacillin-tazobactam] when needed, while protecting the clinically relevant minority at genuine risk.”

Esther Moreno, MD, PhD, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on January 16 in Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The study was limited by its single-center design, the inability to perform drug provocation testing in patients with a history of recurrent fixed drug eruption, and the lack of data on long-term outcomes after therapeutic use of piperacillin-tazobactam.

France has authorised Ricimed, the first antibody-based treatment specifically indicated for acute ricin intoxication, providing clinicians with a targeted option beyond supportive care for exposure to one of the most lethal naturally occurring toxins.

Fabentech is a French biopharmaceutical company specialising in medical countermeasures against biological threats and infectious diseases.

The polyclonal antibody technology used in the development of Ricimed has received marketing authorisation in France as a treatment for ricin poisoning. Ricin is a highly toxic natural substance that can cause death within hours to a few days of exposure.

Supported by the Ministry of Armed Forces and Veterans Affairs (Directorate General of Armaments [DGA] and Armed Forces Health Service) in France, Ricimed is the first approved antidote for ricin poisoning, a condition for which treatment was previously limited to supportive measures alone.

One incident, in particular, remains etched in espionage history. On 7 September 1978 in London during the Cold War, Bulgarian dissident writer Georgi Markov, living in exile, was struck by the umbrella of a passer-by while waiting at a bus stop. He felt a slight sting. Four days later, he died in the hospital due to a sudden and unexplained illness. An autopsy revealed that he had been poisoned by a tiny metal pellet implanted at the tip of an umbrella containing ricin, a lethal toxin. The legend of the “Bulgarian umbrella,” later invoked in other assassination attempts, was born.

Since then, although Markov remains the only known individual to have been killed by ricin poisoning, this theoretically extremely toxic substance, which can be manufactured relatively easily from castor beans, a widely available plant, has continued to fascinate authors of thrillers and spy novels.

Numerous works of fiction depict characters who succumb to ricin poisoning. The toxin is notably portrayed as a favoured weapon of the main character in the hit television series Breaking Bad.

However, ricin is not confined to the realm of science fiction. For several years, authorities in various countries have feared that extremist groups could carry out attacks using ricin. The threat has been taken particularly seriously since 2018, when a clandestine ricin laboratory operated by members of the Islamic State was dismantled in Germany. Since then, several similar attack plots have been thwarted.

This context triggered a race among major powers to develop an effective antidote as quickly as possible. In this effort, Fabentech has risen to a challenge.

“Having demonstrated its ability to target and then neutralize ricin before it causes irreparable damage, Ricimed is a treatment that works based on polyclonal antibodies and compensates for the absence of a vaccine or specific treatment,” Fabentech said in a press release.

The polyclonal antibody technology used by Fabentech offers potential for the development of antidotes against bioterrorist attacks and for the treatment of many infectious diseases.

Ricimed contributed to the deployment of a European health shield against intentional biological threats in France.

Speaking to Le Figaro, France's oldest national newspaper, Fabentech CEO Sébastien Iva explained that ricin disrupts the body by halting cell function, while noting several other drug candidates in development at the firm.

Typically, the lungs sustain fatal damage. Our treatment interrupts this toxic process. In animals administered the antidote, we observed pulmonary function recovery, allowing survival.

Given that the possibility of terrorist attacks using ricin is considered a national security issue, Fabentech benefited from the support of the Ministry of the Armed Forces and the DGA and lasted nearly a decade of research and development work.

The granting of marketing authorisation was also supported by the French Armed Forces and welcomed by the French Minister of the Armed Forces, Catherine Vautrin, who previously served as France's Minister of Labour, Health, and Solidarity.

“Supporting the development of companies in France capable of manufacturing antidotes against certain biological agents helps guarantee the operational superiority of our armed forces. Developing and producing such drugs when they do not yet exist on the market is also serving the nation and the public interest,” she said.

Although the threat posed by ricin remains hypothetical, Fabentech reports a strong interest from potential clients, with many countries seeking protection against possible bioterrorist attacks.

The DGA had already placed an order for several doses of Ricimed for deployment in France. For optimal effectiveness, the antidote must be administered within 6 hours of poisoning. Iva confirmed that multiple countries had already expressed interest in acquiring the antidote.

A retrospective study found that preoperative imaging methods all had limited sensitivity for detecting lymph node invasion in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. However, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET had some prognostic value.

“The performance of commonly used imaging methods — CT, abdominal MRI, and even PSMA-PET — was suboptimal in this setting, with particularly low sensitivity across all modalities,” the authors wrote. While PSMA-PET “may be considered selectively,” they concluded, the findings suggest that distant staging can be skipped for most patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

The study, led by Christopher Kniep and Tobias Maurer, Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center, University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, was published online in BJU International.

The retrospective nature of the study may have introduced selection bias. Imaging modality use was not standardized and likely varied by patient and physician preference. Additionally, PSMA‑PET was available for only a subset of patients, and specific tracer details were not available, which may have influenced detection rates.

The study received open access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Taking certain antidepressants at the time of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not associated with an increased risk of death, brain surgery or longer hospital stays, according to a study published on January 28, 2026, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

For the study, researchers looked at serotonergic antidepressants, which treat anxiety and depression by increasing serotonin activity in the brain. These included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

Concerns have previously been raised that serotonergic antidepressants might increase the risk of bleeding in the brain or complicate early recovery after traumatic brain injury. However, our study found no evidence to support those concerns.""

Jussi P. Posti, MD, PhD, study author, University of Turku, Finland

The study included 54,876 people in Finland who were 16 or older when hospitalized with a TBI. A total of 14% used serotonergic antidepressants at the time of the TBI.

Researchers reviewed national prescription records for preinjury antidepressant use and medical records to determine how many people died within a month, whether they needed emergency brain surgery, and how long they stayed in the hospital.

A total of 4,105 people died within a month. This included 7.6% of those taking antidepressants and 7.5% of people who did not.

After adjusting for factors such as age, sex and other health conditions, researchers found people taking antidepressants before injury were no more likely to die within a month than those not taking them.

Antidepressant users were slightly less likely to require emergency brain surgery to relieve pressure or bleeding in the brain and prevent further damage.

Of the total participants, 6.8% of the antidepressant users and 8.6% of those who did not use antidepressants needed emergency brain surgery. After adjustments, antidepressant users had an 11% lower risk.

The amount of time in the hospital was the same for both groups.

""These findings provide reassurance for people who take antidepressants that antidepressant use does not appear to worsen early recovery after traumatic brain injury,"" said Posti. ""Future studies should examine whether these results hold true for long-term recovery and across different health care settings.""

A limitation of the study was that it was conducted only at hospitals and health care centers in Finland, so results may vary in other areas.

A six-month produce prescription program in Los Angeles clinics shows how food-as-medicine strategies can meaningfully improve access to healthy foods for patients with diabetes, but reveals why affordability remains a stubborn barrier.

Study: Nutrition Security Among Medicaid Patients With Diabetes or Prediabetes After Completing a Produce Prescription Program. Image credit: DC Studio/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Annals of Family Medicine evaluated the effectiveness of a produce prescription program in improving short-term nutrition security among Medicaid patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes using a pre–post observational design and self-reported survey measures.

The food-as-medicine strategy involves using dietary interventions to prevent, treat, and manage diet-related diseases. The United States spends roughly $1.1 trillion annually on treating chronic conditions like hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Produce prescription programs (PPRs) provide patients experiencing food insecurity with vouchers to purchase fruits and vegetables. These programs focus on increasing produce consumption, supporting food security, and improving health outcomes, including glycemic control, with modeling studies suggesting the potential to prevent hundreds of thousands of cardiovascular events.

It is imperative for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), as well as for other federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to understand how PPRs can shape a patient's experience with access and availability to healthy foods. Existing research assessing the effectiveness of PPRs has focused on food security or food sufficiency. However, focusing solely on food sufficiency and dietary quality misses critical barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption, including affordability, grocery store access, transportation, cooking knowledge, and awareness of food assistance programs.

Nutrition security, distinct from food security, encompasses consistent access, availability, and affordability of healthy foods. Population studies show nutrition insecurity affects 18 % to 44 % of people and is linked to diabetes and poor mental health. While measurement methods are still evolving, researchers increasingly recognize nutrition security as essential for optimizing health outcomes and for capturing barriers not reflected in traditional food security metrics.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health partnered with three Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to implement a produce prescription program during 2020–2024. This before-and-after observational study assessed changes in nutrition and food security among participating Medicaid patients without a comparison group. The study also identified barriers to healthy eating, including participants' perceptions of the price of healthy foods in their community and their ability to identify healthy foods.

Eligible participants were FQHC patients aged 18 or older, enrolled in Medicaid, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, and screening positive for food insecurity. During 2021–2024, 2,374 patients enrolled across the three FQHCs. Selected participants received $40 per month for 6 months to purchase fresh produce with an electronic debit card.

All patients completed a 20-minute self-administered baseline questionnaire and received their activated debit card. They completed the same questionnaire at the six-month follow-up, either in person or by telephone.

The study assessed household nutrition security using a two-item screener developed by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Kaiser Permanente, and Tufts University as the primary outcome. The authors note that this screener was still undergoing validation at the time of data collection, reflecting the evolving nature of nutrition security measurement. The screener assessed difficulty accessing healthy foods over 12 months, with responses categorized as secure or insecure, and 12 barriers to healthy eating rated as “never,” “sometimes,” or “often true.” Food security was measured using the six-item short form module, with scores of 0–1 considered secure and 2–6 considered insecure.

The study used McNemar tests to identify changes in nutrition and food security from baseline to follow-up. Binary multivariable logistic regression models tested these changes. Model 1 was unadjusted. Model 2 adjusted for baseline covariates and security status. Model 3 additionally adjusted for baseline fruit and vegetable consumption and change over time.

A total of 1,309 participants completed both surveys, with 451 at FQHC 1, 524 at FQHC 2, and 334 at FQHC 3. The program distributed $575,820 in produce benefits, of which participants spent $404,025, or 70.2 %, on fresh fruits and vegetables at participating stores, although redemption data were not available at the individual participant level.

The majority of participants were female, at 71.1 %, with a mean age of 56.5 years. Nearly 80 % identified as Hispanic or Latino, and 12.9 % as Asian. Most participants, 80.4 %, had a high school education or less, and 25 % lived in households with five or more members.

Nutrition security increased significantly during the six-month program, rising from 23.2 % to 38.7 % of participants. Food security also improved substantially, increasing from 25.2 % to 42.9 %.

Beyond the overall increases in nutrition and food security, participants reported improvements across most specific barriers to healthy eating. While cost remained the primary barrier throughout the program, the proportion citing cost decreased significantly from 88.4 % to 85.6 %. The persistence of cost concerns occurred against a backdrop of rising food prices and inflation during the study period, which the authors note may have limited the program's impact on affordability.

Participants also reported an enhanced ability to identify healthy foods and improved access to stores that offer healthy options. Additionally, the difficulty making culturally appropriate foods healthy declined from 62.0 % to 55.7 %, suggesting the program helped participants navigate cultural food preferences while improving nutrition.

The Los Angeles County produce prescription program was associated with significant improvements in both nutrition and food security among Medicaid patients with diabetes or prediabetes over six months. Nutrition security increased by 15.5 percentage points and food security by 17.7 percentage points, with participants also reporting reduced barriers to healthy eating. Because the study used a single-group, pre–post design, the findings cannot definitively attribute these changes solely to the intervention.

Overall, the results suggest that food-as-medicine interventions can be feasibly integrated into clinical settings to address fundamental social determinants of health, particularly access to affordable, nutritious foods, although longer-term and controlled studies are needed to assess sustained and causal effects.

New research reveals how Parkinson's spreads from the gut to the brain, with the help of immune cells – offering a new potential therapeutic strategy – in a study in mice led by scientists at the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL (University College London).

Scientists have long theorized that Parkinson's may start in the gut. This is because one of the first brain areas to be affected in the condition is the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which connects directly to the gut. But scientists have not known how the condition spreads to the brain.

The new study identifies a key role for gut macrophages – a specialized immune cell that acts as a first responder, eating or 'engulfing' and destroying harmful invaders – in helping toxic proteins travel from the gut into the brain. 

The research showed that reducing the number of gut macrophages led to reduced spreading of toxic protein, and improved motor symptoms in mice. Published in the journal Nature, and funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the study suggests a new potential therapeutic approach for Parkinson's that could enable intervention long before onset of motor symptoms.

Previous research has found that between 50-90% of people with Parkinson's had gut symptoms long before their movement symptoms began, for example experiencing chronic constipation decades before diagnosis. Patients are grouped into 'body-first' and 'brain-first' depending on where disease starts, with the former accounting for around two thirds of people affected by Parkinson's.

In the new study, the scientists isolated misfolded alpha-synuclein, the toxic protein implicated in Parkinson's, from the brains of people who had died with Parkinson's. They inserted tiny amounts of the patient-derived alpha-synuclein into the small intestines of mice and followed its spread from the gut into the brain. 

They showed that gut macrophages engulfed alpha-synuclein, and began to show signs of dysfunction in their lysosomal systems, responsible for breaking down the cell's waste material.

The researchers found that the macrophages then signalled to T cells, which are part of the body's adaptive immune response. These ""gut-instructed"" T cells then travel from the gut, into the brain.

Importantly, when the researchers depleted the number of gut macrophages before injecting alpha-synuclein into the small intestine of mice, they found this resulted in reduced levels of toxic alpha-synuclein in the brain, compared to healthy controls (mice in a comparison group) – suggesting a possible therapeutic avenue: targeting these immune cells and preventing them from reaching the brain.

Next, the team plan to look more closely at how the immune system in the body affects the brain in negative ways, and whether this could be harnessed to develop new drug targets. They will also investigate how to exploit markers of inflammation in the blood as early diagnostics for Parkinson's. 

Our study shows that immune cells are not bystanders in Parkinson's; these gut macrophages are responding, albeit in a dysfunctional way. This presents an opportunity to think about how we can boost the function of the immune system and these cells, so that they respond in the correct manner and help to slow or stop the spread of disease.""

Dr. Soyon Hong, Co-lead Author, Group Leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL

Co-lead author Dr Tim Bartels, Group Leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, said: ""Neurodegenerative diseases have slow trajectories over decades. Understanding how Parkinson's begins in the body could allow us to develop simple blood tests to screen for it, enabling diagnosis long before damage to the brain starts. Having the ability to detect and manage Parkinson's before it even reaches the brain could have a huge impact for those affected.""

Researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have identified a targetable driver of brain metastases in patients with aggressive inflammatory breast cancer.

The study uncovers a novel role for soluble E-cadherin (sEcad) in promoting tumor invasion while resisting cancer cell death and triggering brain inflammation via the CXCR2 signaling pathway. The results suggest that targeting sEcad or the CXCR2 pathway could treat or prevent brain metastasis.

The study, published in Neuro-Oncology, was led by Xiaoding Hu, M.D., Ph.D., instructor of Breast Medical Oncology, and Bisrat Debeb, D.V.M., Ph.D., associate professor of Breast Medical Oncology.

This readily measurable blood biomarker plays a key role in driving brain metastasis. Targeting this pathway has tremendous potential to treat and prevent this serious complication and could help guide future therapies.""

Bisrat Debeb, D.V.M., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Breast Medical Oncology

Brain metastasis is a common complication of advanced breast cancer, with a particularly high risk in inflammatory breast cancer. However, there are no effective therapies because the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Previous work by the Debeb lab showed that patients with elevated levels of sEcad in their blood tend to have an increased risk of brain metastasis, earlier metastasis and poorer overall survival. Therefore, the researchers wanted to further understand the role of sEcad.

In this study, preclinical models of inflammatory breast cancer overexpressing sEcad showed higher metastatic burden, reduced survival and increased metastasis to the brain. The researchers found that sEcad activates the CXCR2 pathway, which creates a feedback loop that helps cancer cells evade cell death and fosters an inflammatory, pro-metastatic environment.

Using a CRCX2 inhibitor significantly reduced metastasis and extended survival in these models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

This study identifies sEcad and the CRCX2 pathway as essential for brain metastasis, suggesting that blocking any part of that pathway could slow or prevent cancer spread.

Further, monitoring levels of sEcad in the blood could be a way to identify patients most at risk of brain metastasis, and treatment with a CRCX2 inhibitor seems to be a potential therapeutic strategy for these patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine appropriate treatment approaches.

Those with multiple years of experience in the biomedical industry will have worked in various types of laboratories, clinics, and cryo-rooms, often at the forefront of scientific advancements. Many, however, are run surprisingly inefficiently.

Such inefficient labs are not only overly costly but also waste resources and time, while failing to meet sustainability targets. It is, however, relatively simple to turn the situation on its head. With sufficient forethought and planning, efforts to maximize efficiency and sustainability can be achieved.

Many laboratories, clinics, and biobanks are using excessive amounts of liquid nitrogen, and they often overlook the cost implications of making incorrect choices. Whether laboratory teams are creating a cryo-room from scratch, upgrading an existing one, or simply buying a new freezer, there are some significant considerations that are often overlooked.

One basic element that can have a significant impact on both costs and sustainability is the location of the cryo-room. The further away a freezer is from the source of liquid nitrogen, the more pipework and cooling will be needed to get the LN2 to where it is needed. Ideally, freezers will be sited on the ground floor next to an outside wall so that pipework can be simplified, cooling can be minimized, and sustainability maximized.

Space is often at a premium in clinics due to their location, making it essential to choose equipment that maximizes sample storage space for a given footprint. For example, dewars are a useful piece of equipment, but if a storage room is packed with dewars, this uses up limited space and makes it difficult to manage and access samples. Dewars also require manual filling, and a separate liquid level/temperature alarm is required for each one, meaning they are not the right solution for high-volume, long-term sample storage below -150 °C.

There is a wide range of larger nitrogen-freezers available at various prices. Given the difficulties and risks of storing in liquid nitrogen itself, the majority of these freezers use a form of vapor storage created from an LN2 reservoir. Many of the less expensive options, however, are designs that have been modified for vapor storage from liquid storage, compromising performance on many levels.

Many customers choose the wrong type of freezer for various reasons. If a laboratory already uses a particular type or make of freezer, it may seem easiest to simply replace it with a like-for-like model. Sometimes, those making the decision simply do not know that better options are available, or they may make the decision based solely on price. It is crucial, however, to consider running costs in addition to the initial purchase price.

Here is an example of how quickly the wrong choice of freezer can lead to increasing costs and missed sustainability targets. For example, consider a team that chooses a freezer design that has been adapted from a liquid storage model rather than one specifically designed for vapor storage, or one that stores the LN2 in a jacket with a dry vapor storage area. Though that freezer likely has a lower initial cost, it will have a small liquid nitrogen reservoir, meaning it uses more LN2 just through evaporation. This requires being filled more frequently at a frequency of every one to two days, as opposed to every four to seven days with an efficient vapor storage freezer.

If the freezer is auto-filled from an external tank connected via a Super Insulated Vacuum Insulated Line (SIVL), more liquid nitrogen is required to cool it to cryogenic temperature before the freezer can be filled, as the line becomes longer and is used more frequently. This has a huge impact on the amount of LN2 drawn from the external tank, so more deliveries are required to prevent the depletion of LN2.

To compensate for the higher LN2 consumption of an inefficient freezer, larger tank or more frequent deliveries will be required. This is not necessarily a simple fix, however, since there may not be room for a larger tank, and liquid nitrogen suppliers cannot always guarantee enough deliveries to meet demand.

In addition to requiring a fill every one to two days, an inefficient freezer's design is inherently compromised, resulting in a hold time of just two to four days, compared to the 13-21 days of an efficient vapor freezer. This means cover will be needed over holiday periods to ensure sample safety. Low purchase prices can quickly become a nightmare of running costs becoming out of control.

Stephen Robinson, BioMedical Product Manager at Air Products, advises customers on cryo-room solutions that maximize efficiency and sustainability while minimizing overall costs. While it is more expensive initially to purchase a freezer specifically designed for vapor storage, the investment will be recovered in the long term due to reduced operating and security costs. Once the initial investment is made, the financial benefits will continue.

One of the liquid nitrogen freezers often recommended by Air Products is the MVE HEco Series. MVE has a strong reputation for quality built on over 60 years of experience, and the HEco Series is no exception. It is equipped with robust, built-in safeguards for continuous sample preservation, featuring an advanced alarm system and innovative insulation technology that provides a buffer period of up to 13 to 27 days before samples reach critical temperatures. This gives ample time to resolve any potential issues.

Most of all, though, the HEco Series has been engineered for energy efficiency and streamlined operation. Manual top-ups are not necessary, with auto-fill functionality and automated monitoring. It consolidates all samples into one centralized space, simplifying management by optimizing the storage available in a smaller footprint.

Unlike freezers that have a lid covering their full width, making it tricky to reach samples at the back, the HEco models also have an internal carousel that brings samples up to the operator. There are other advanced features such as a vacuum-jacketed transfer hose, streamlined LN2 plumbing, and extended hold times, all designed to minimize resource usage.

Considering the long-term implications of any cryo facility can really pay dividends. Many people fail to recognize that the right solution is available and ultimately pay for it in the long run, even though it is easy to avoid wasting time, money, and resources.

A study of schoolgirls finds that living in polluted areas is more consistently linked to reduced attention than diet quality, and that antioxidant intake offers no clear protection against memory decline.



Study: Interaction between air pollution and diet on cognitive function in schoolchildren. Image Credit: Maja Argakijeva / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in BMC Public Health, researchers investigated the joint and individual effects of air pollution exposure and dietary antioxidants on concentration and memory in young female Iranian students.

Higher levels of dietary antioxidants and lower exposure to air pollution were both significantly associated with better concentration performance, with air pollution showing the most consistent association across fully adjusted statistical models, while no significant interaction or direct association was observed for short-term memory outcomes.

Short-term memory and concentration are foundational cognitive processes that strongly influence children's learning and academic performance, as well as outcomes in later life. Short-term memory supports information retention over brief periods, while sustained attention enables task engagement and error control.

Deficits in either domain can impair educational outcomes, even among children with typical levels of intelligence. Previous research has identified multiple contributors to cognitive difficulties, including perinatal factors, exposure to environmental toxins, and dietary quality.

Diets deficient in essential antioxidants and micronutrients have been linked to poorer memory and attention. However, diets that contain high amounts of fish, fruits, and vegetables appear protective. Concurrently, air pollution has emerged as a major environmental risk factor for neurodevelopment, particularly in children living in highly polluted urban areas worldwide.

Oxidative stress is thought to be a shared mechanism underlying both poor diet and pollution-related cognitive impairment. Despite these overlaps, no prior studies have evaluated the combined influence of air pollution exposure and dietary antioxidants on children's cognition.

Researchers used a cross-sectional design, including 300 female students aged 9-12 enrolled in elementary schools in Tehran, a megacity with high recorded pollution levels.

Equal numbers of participants were recruited from high- and low-pollution districts using stratified random sampling.

Air pollution exposure was classified based on official monitoring data. Dietary intake was assessed through a semi-quantitative 168-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) completed by parents, adapted from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.

The research team calculated dietary total antioxidant capacity (dTAC) using Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) values for 106 food items, expressed as total daily antioxidant capacity.

Participants were categorized into low- and high-dTAC groups based on the median value.

Cognitive outcomes were assessed using validated tools. Concentration was measured with the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) to capture omission errors, commission errors, and reaction time.

Short-term memory was assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale for Children.

Parents completed questionnaires reporting their children's anthropometric measurements and demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle variables.

Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess main and interaction effects of pollution exposure and dTAC.

Multivariable models adjusted for age, energy intake, socioeconomic factors, dietary micronutrients, and body mass index (BMI).

Students were grouped based on dietary antioxidant capacity, low (TAC1) and high (TAC2).

Children with lower dietary antioxidant intake were slightly younger, shorter, and heavier than those in TAC2. They also spent less time outdoors, although differences in anthropometric measures were not statistically significant.

Students with higher dTAC consumed significantly more energy, fruits, carbohydrates, and micronutrients, including vitamins A, C, and B9, as well as iron and zinc.

Air pollution exposure was associated with differences in parental smoking habits, education, and occupation, indicating socioeconomic variation between regions.

Memory scores were modestly higher among students with higher dTAC and among those living in less polluted areas. However, these differences were not statistically significant, even after adjustment for confounders.

Concentration performance differed significantly by pollution exposure, with children in less polluted areas demonstrating better attention scores.

Higher dTAC was also significantly associated with improved concentration in selected adjusted models, although this relationship was less robust and more model-dependent than the association observed for air pollution exposure.

No statistically significant interaction between dTAC and air pollution was observed for either memory or concentration, indicating that dietary antioxidants did not measurably buffer pollution-related effects on cognition.

This study provides novel insights into the independent roles of air pollution and dietary antioxidant capacity in children's cognitive performance.

Consistent with prior literature, higher pollution exposure was associated with poorer concentration, with this association remaining statistically significant after extensive adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and dietary factors. Higher dTAC was modestly linked to better attention.

No significant associations were observed for short-term memory, nor was there evidence of an interaction between diet and pollution.

Strengths of the study include the use of validated cognitive tests, objective pollution classification, and comprehensive adjustment for socioeconomic and dietary confounders.

Limitations include the cross-sectional design, reliance on an adult FFQ adapted for children, and the inclusion of only female participants, all of which limit generalizability and causal inference.

Overall, while antioxidant-rich diets may support attentional function in polluted environments, exposure to environmental pollution appears to play a more dominant and consistent role in shaping concentration outcomes.

Future studies should employ longitudinal designs and child-specific dietary assessment tools to clarify impacts on cognitive development and memory.

A high-resolution immune cell atlas reveals how inherited DNA and life-long environmental exposures leave separate epigenetic signatures that together program immune function and disease risk.



Study: Genetics and environment distinctively shape the human immune cell epigenome. Image Credit: Anusorn Nakdee / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in Nature Genetics, researchers created a comprehensive atlas to elucidate the combined impacts of genetic inheritance and environmental exposures on the human immune system. The study analyzed blood samples from 110 donors exposed to pathogens, such as HIV and COVID-19, or chemicals, such as pesticides, and found that environmental and genetic factors target different parts of the genome.

Specifically, while genetic factors primarily influence the gene bodies in memory immune cells, environmental factors tend to tweak the regulatory “switches”, enhancers, and promoters in naive immune cells. These findings offer a high-resolution map of how infection history and underlying DNA combine to shape immune cell states and functions relevant to human health, with epigenetic changes frequently aligning with altered chromatin accessibility in regulatory regions.

Traditional wisdom held that environmental exposures determined an individual's long-term health outcomes. The discovery of genetics and DNA shifted this wisdom into a debate over the relative importance of nature, genetics, nurture, and environment in human development.

Scientists agree that one of the most important models of the interplay between genetics and the environment is that of the immune system, which must be rigid enough to distinguish self from non-self, yet flexible enough to learn from new threats.

Previous studies have long established that the DNA sequence is inherited and unchangeable. However, more recent research posits that the way those genes are used is controlled by the epigenome. The epigenome is the mechanistic interaction between genetics and the environment that results in altered gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence.

One of the primary tools the epigenome uses is DNA methylation, the addition of chemical tags, methyl groups, to DNA that act like dimmer switches, increasing or reducing gene expression without changing the underlying code. While previous research has investigated the effects of environmental exposures on epigenetic outcomes, it has focused mainly on bulk tissue, thereby obscuring the fine details of how specific immune cell types and states respond.

The present study aimed to address the limitations of previous research and expand scientific understanding of immune health by analyzing 171 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 110 individuals.

The sample cohort comprised both healthy donors and individuals with specific, defined exposures.



For HIV-1 and IAV, we have internal control samples that are from the same set of donors before infection and collected samples from them after exposure. We also collected PBMC from 12 healthy donors as external controls. For exposures without internal controls (COVID, anthrax vaccine, MRSA/MSSA and OP), all healthy samples were used as controls. We performed snATAC–seq and snmC-seq2 on the PBMCs and identified the eDMRs associated with exposures and genotypes. We also identified the gDMRs using this dataset. BA, B. anthracis. The figure is created with BioRender.com. 

Viral infections, including HIV-1, Influenza A (IAV), and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

Bacterial infections such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and MSSA.

Chemical or vaccine exposures, specifically organophosphate pesticides (OPs) and the anthrax vaccine.

Experimental assays included snmC-seq2 library preparation, enabling sequencing of DNA methylation in single-cell nuclei. Participants' blood samples were sorted into seven major immune cell types, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes. Downstream analyses further resolved these populations into naive and memory lymphocyte states, as well as additional immune subtypes.

Longitudinal internal controls were available for HIV-1 and Influenza A virus exposures, where donors were sampled before and after infection. Other exposure analyses relied on external controls and statistical adjustment and were therefore more limited in their ability to capture within-individual epigenetic change.

By comparing these groups against controls, the study's statistical analyses sought to elucidate exposure-associated differentially methylated regions (eDMRs) and genotype-associated differentially methylated regions (gDMRs).

eDMRs, exposure-associated differentially methylated regions, changes associated with environmental exposures.

gDMRs, genotype-associated differentially methylated regions, changes associated with inherited genetic variation.

The study's snmC-seq2 analysis identified 756,575 environmental methylation markers (eDMRs) and over 275,000 genetic markers (gDMRs) across the investigated immune cell types. The analysis's most notable finding was that nature and nurture appear to operate on different genomic “territory”.

Distinct genomic targets, eDMRs were consistently enriched in enhancer- and promoter-associated regulatory regions, the genomic switches that influence when genes are turned on or off. In contrast, gDMRs were predominantly located within gene bodies. This suggests that while genetic variation shapes the core protein-coding architecture, environmental exposures preferentially modify regulatory networks that control gene activity, often in regions showing coordinated changes in chromatin accessibility.

Cell-state specificity, environmental exposures were observed to have a more pronounced effect on naive lymphocytes, while genetic factors exerted a stronger influence on memory lymphocytes, reflecting the cumulative impact of inherited variation on long-lived immune cell states.

COVID-19 and HIV impacts, prior HIV-1 infection was associated with substantial shifts in immune cell composition, particularly remodeling NK cells and memory T cells.

Regarding COVID-19, the analyses identified a specific monocyte cluster uniquely enriched in patients with severe disease. The statistical separation of this cluster was substantial (P = 2.05 × 10^-237), suggesting that these cells are strongly associated with inflammatory immune programs characteristic of severe COVID-19, without establishing a direct causal role in disease pathology.

Ancestry and disease risks, genetic ancestry was found to influence immune epigenetic responses. In both MRSA and COVID-19 exposures, individuals of African genetic ancestry showed greater methylation changes than those of European ancestry, even after adjustment for covariates.

Furthermore, genotype-associated methylation signals overlapped with known disease-risk loci. Specifically, genetic variants associated with eczema and gallstone disease showed significant colocalization with methylation sites in T cells, linking immune epigenetic regulation to broader disease susceptibility.

The present study provides evidence that nature and nurture are distinct architects of immune cell biology. Although their effects converge on immune function, genetic variation and environmental exposures appear to operate through mechanistically and genomically separate pathways.

The atlas has the potential to advance personalized medicine. Future research will be required to validate the biological and clinical relevance of specific eDMRs and gDMRs, clarify their functional consequences, and address current limitations, such as incomplete exposure histories, modest sample sizes in some exposure groups, and restricted longitudinal sampling, before they can be reliably deployed as high-accuracy biomarkers.

A large cohort study suggests that melatonin from everyday foods may mark dietary patterns associated with lower rates of obesity and depression, while showing no clear links to other chronic diseases.



Study: The Content of Dietary Melatonin in 119 Food Items and Its Relationship With Chronic Diseases: Results of the CUME+ Study. Image Credit: Tatevosian Yana / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, researchers analyzed melatonin content in food items and its associations with several health outcomes using cross-sectional data from a cohort of Brazilian university graduates.

Melatonin, found in animal- and plant-based foods, has been linked to benefits for sleep, mood, and metabolic health in experimental, observational, and supplementation studies. Although melatonin concentrations are lower in foods compared to supplements, melatonin-rich diets can elevate circulating levels within physiological ranges. Increasing melatonin intake through diet may provide physiological doses that more closely align with endogenous rhythms than pharmacological supplementation and may avoid suprapharmacological exposure, according to prior evidence.

Given the burden of obesity, depression, and sleep disorders, dietary melatonin has been examined as a potential marker of dietary patterns associated with these conditions, rather than as a therapeutic intervention. Previous observational and experimental research suggests that melatonin is protective against inflammatory, metabolic, and neurobehavioral outcomes. Observational studies also report inverse associations with liver cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. However, few studies have directly examined melatonin intake within habitual diets or its associations with chronic conditions in adults.

In the present study, researchers analyzed melatonin concentrations in foods and their relationship with various health outcomes. Participants were included from the Cohort of Universities of Minas Gerais (CUME+) study, an open, prospective cohort assessing the impact of dietary patterns and nutrition transition on noncommunicable diseases.

The baseline questionnaire was administered in two parts, one assessing sociodemographics, clinical history, lifestyle, anthropometrics, and morbidity.

The second part included a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and items on dietary habits, supplements, and cooking practices. Nutrient intake was determined using food composition tables, and dietary melatonin content was estimated from the literature and adjusted for total energy intake.

The study outcomes included obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension, metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes (T2D), sleep duration, dyslipidemia, and depression.

Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m². Depression and OSA were based on self-reported medical diagnoses. Dyslipidemia was defined as at least one abnormal lipid parameter, including total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dL (or < 50 mg/dL for females), or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130 mg/dL.

MetS was defined as central obesity plus any two of the following: elevated triglycerides or treatment, reduced HDL-C or treatment, increased blood pressure (BP) or treatment for hypertension, and elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or T2D diagnosis.

Hypertension was defined as medication use, physician diagnosis, systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg, or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg. T2D was defined as self-reported or physician diagnosis, antidiabetic medication use, or FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL. Sleep duration was classified as short (less than 7 hours per day) or normal (7 hours or more per day).

Logistic and Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations between dietary melatonin intake and health outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, family income, binge drinking, smoking, screen time, physical activity, medication use, and sleep duration.

The study included 8,320 participants with a mean age of 35.9 years. Most participants were female and non-smokers. Approximately one-third reported short sleep duration. Dyslipidemia, depression, obesity, and hypertension were the most prevalent health conditions.

Melatonin content was estimated for 119 of 144 food items in the FFQ, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 169.9 ng/g. Mean daily melatonin intake was 25,554.7 ng and was significantly higher in males than in females.

Coffee, lentils and beans, and rice were the primary dietary sources of melatonin. Higher melatonin intake was associated with lower intake of protein, cholesterol, and saturated and monounsaturated fats, and higher intake of fiber and carbohydrates.

No significant associations were observed between dietary melatonin intake and OSA, hypertension, MetS, or T2D. Associations with sleep duration and dyslipidemia were attenuated and lost statistical significance after adjustment for age and sex.

In contrast, dietary melatonin intake was inversely associated with obesity and depression. Individuals with daily melatonin intake of 14,900 to 34,400 ng and 14,900 to 25,000 ng were less likely to have obesity and depression, respectively, with the strongest associations observed in intermediate intake quintiles rather than at the highest levels.

Dietary melatonin intake was inversely associated with depression and obesity in this population, while no significant associations were observed for other chronic conditions or sleep duration.

Overall, the findings support hypotheses regarding a potential role of dietary melatonin in metabolic and neurobehavioral regulation, possibly via anti-inflammatory pathways. However, due to the cross-sectional design, causal inferences cannot be drawn, and further experimental and longitudinal studies are required to confirm these associations and clarify underlying mechanisms.

A detailed lipidomic comparison reveals that EPA and DHA are packaged very differently across marine sources, challenging the idea that all omega-3s are nutritionally equivalent.



Study: Omega-3 Source Matters: Comparative Lipid Signatures and Quantitative Distribution of EPA/DHA Across Marine Resources. Image Credit: I. Noyan Yilmaz / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Marine Drugs, a group of researchers compared how different marine sources store eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) across lipid classes and evaluated their comparative nutritional characteristics.

Heart disease remains the leading global cause of death, yet something as simple as choosing the right dietary fat can meaningfully reduce risk. Omega-3 fatty acids, mainly EPA and DHA, are very important for a healthy heart, brain, and metabolism.

Traditionally, seafood has been the primary dietary source of EPA and DHA. However, growing sustainability pressures and reported reductions in omega-3 levels in some fish species have accelerated interest in alternative sources, including microalgae and microbial oils. This shift raises questions about why these sources are increasingly favored.

It is important to note that the structural form of fat molecules may influence digestion, transport, and metabolic handling, rather than absorption alone. Further research is needed to determine which lipid forms and class distributions of omega-3 fatty acids matter most, not just total quantity.

A lipid analysis was conducted on various marine omega-3 sources, including 12 microalgal species, 1 heterotrophic marine protist (Schizochytrium species), 4 oily fish species, and 9 commercial omega-3 supplements derived from fish, krill, and algae.

Lipids were extracted from dried biomass or oil samples using standardized solvent-based methods to preserve lipid integrity.

Researchers used high-performance thin-layer chromatography to separate complex lipids into classes such as phospholipids, glycolipids, and neutral lipids. Individual lipid bands were isolated and converted into fatty acid methyl esters.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was then used to quantify EPA and DHA content in each lipid class.

Nutritional indices were calculated from fatty acid profiles to assess relative lipid quality and cardiometabolic relevance.

The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids was evaluated, with higher values considered favorable. Additional indices included the index of atherogenicity, the index of thrombogenicity, the lipid quality index, and the ratio of hypocholesterolemic to hypercholesterolemic fatty acids. These measures serve as comparative indicators rather than direct health outcomes.

All analyses were conducted in triplicate, and results were expressed on a dry-weight basis to support reliable cross-source comparisons.

Substantial differences were observed in both the amounts and the structural distributions of EPA and DHA across marine sources.

Microalgae generally contained high levels of EPA but low levels of DHA, with some species showing more than 40% of total fatty acids as EPA. Notably, EPA in microalgae was predominantly embedded within glycolipids and phosphatidylglycerol, key components of photosynthetic membranes, rather than stored as energy lipids.

This structural positioning suggests a biological role beyond energy storage and may influence downstream metabolic handling, although this was not directly evaluated in the study.

The heterotrophic protist Schizochytrium species showed the opposite pattern, with high DHA content (approximately 33% of total fatty acids) and relatively low EPA levels.

More than 85% of its lipids were stored as triacylglycerols, indicating an energy-reserve profile that closely resembles refined algal oil supplements.

Fish species typically contained more DHA than EPA, although both were present in nutritionally meaningful amounts.

Anchovies and sardines emerged as efficient dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids, thanks to their favorable lipid profiles and small serving sizes. While temporal trends could not be assessed, measured EPA and DHA levels were lower than values reported in earlier literature, aligning with reports of declining omega-3 content linked to climate change and shifts in aquaculture feed composition.

Commercial omega-3 supplements varied substantially in lipid structure.

Refined fish oil capsules contained high levels of EPA and DHA, stored almost entirely as triacylglycerols, with phospholipids largely removed during processing. Krill oil supplements differed structurally, with nearly one-third of total lipids present as phosphatidylcholine.

This phospholipid-bound form has been associated in prior research with altered digestion and tissue distribution, although the present study focused on compositional differences rather than physiological effects.

Algal oil capsules provided the highest DHA concentrations and required the smallest intake to meet dietary recommendations. Like fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids were primarily stored as neutral lipids.

Health-related lipid indices reinforced observed compositional patterns.

Algal oils and selected microalgae exhibited the most favorable polyunsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid ratios and hypocholesterolemic-to-hypercholesterolemic ratios. Krill oils showed more variable results, while fish and fish oils generally fell within moderate but acceptable index ranges.

These findings demonstrate that omega-3 sources are not nutritionally equivalent.

Beyond total EPA and DHA content, the lipid structures carrying these fatty acids represent an additional layer of nutritional differentiation. Microalgae primarily deliver EPA within membrane-associated glycolipids, whereas fish and refined oils store omega-3 fatty acids mainly as energy-dense triacylglycerols.

Krill oil lipids contain a higher proportion of phospholipids, distinguishing them structurally from triacylglycerol-dominated oils, although overall lipid quality indices were more variable.

As sustainability concerns increase and dietary patterns evolve, evaluating omega-3 sources by lipid class, rather than only by quantity, may enable more nuanced nutritional comparisons and guide future research, rather than serving as direct dietary guidance.

In recent years, research into cannabis and its main psychoactive ingredient, Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has unearthed medical benefits including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. However, THC is also known to negatively affect learning and memory, limiting its potential clinical usefulness, particularly in disorders of the brain.

Now, a new study led by Chu Chen, PhD, professor in the Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology and Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Chair in neural physiology in the Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas at San Antonio, suggests a combination approach may provide the benefits of THC treatment with fewer negative side effects.

In Chen's study, published in December 2025 in Aging and Disease, his team paired a low-dose THC extract with the selective anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib. When used in mice, the combo improved cognition and reduced Alzheimer's-related brain pathology.

Both drugs are already Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in humans, pointing to a potential fast track to clinical trials.

Chen began his query more than a decade ago into how THC impairs learning and memory. In a 2013 study, his lab uncovered a key molecular driver. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme known for its role in inflammation and pain. It is normally expressed at low levels in the brain but becomes activated during injury, infection or disease. COX-2 also plays a role in synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, a cellular process essential for learning and memory.

When THC is given, it unexpectedly increases COX-2 in the brain. That increase is closely associated with learning and memory impairment.""

Chu Chen, PhD, Professor, Department of Cellular and Integrative Physiology and Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long Chair in neural physiology in the Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas at San Antonio

The discovery helped explain why THC has been difficult to use safely for neurological conditions. Globally blocking COX-2 is not a solution either. Previous clinical trials using high doses of COX-2 inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease did not show cognitive benefits and additionally produced detrimental cardiovascular side effects.

Endocannabinoids - cannabinoids produced within the brain - act on the same cannabinoid receptors as external THC but often exert opposite or regulatory effects. Among them, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a key endocannabinoid that engages signaling pathways that lead to reduced COX-2 activity and less neuroinflammation.

This insight prompted Chen to consider if the pro-inflammatory effects of THC could be blocked while preserving its beneficial actions.

Chen's team chose to add celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor widely prescribed for arthritis and pain. The researchers used very low doses, far below those associated with cardiovascular risk in earlier Alzheimer's trials. For the study, they administered 3 mg/kg of THC and 1 mg/kg of celecoxib per day to mice. This is the human-equivalent in a 165-pound person of 18 mg THC and 6 mg of celecoxib per day.

In the new study, the researchers tested low-dose THC alone and in combination with celecoxib in beta-amyloid and tau mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles are central hallmarks of Alzheimer's.

Treatment was initiated prior to the development of memory symptoms to concentrate on the combination's effect in preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms. Oral doses were given once daily for 30 days.

The results were consistent across both the beta-amyloid and tau models. Although low-dose THC alone improved cognitive performance and reduced some pathological markers, it also increased inflammatory signaling. In contrast, the combination of THC and celecoxib produced better outcomes, including improved learning and memory performance, reduced beta-amyloid and tau pathology, and decreased markers of neuroinflammation.

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that genes involved in synaptic function, inflammation and Alzheimer's disease risk were shifted back toward a healthier profile following the treatment.

""What really mattered was behavior. If cognition is not improved, then the treatment doesn't matter. And that's where the combination clearly worked better than THC alone,"" Chen said.

THC is currently available in synthetic form for chemotherapy-related nausea and appetite loss in cancer and HIV patients and celecoxib has been prescribed for decades for arthritis and other pain. By pairing THC with a COX-2 inhibitor, the scientists effectively reduced THC-related inflammation while preserving its positive cognitive effects.

The findings point toward a pharmaceutical strategy that could be quickly tested in clinical trials.

""If you develop a new compound, it can take 10 to 20 years to reach patients,"" Chen said. ""In this case, both drugs are already approved. That gives us a real advantage.""

This study focused on preventing or delaying the onset of cognitive symptoms. Chen's future studies will determine whether the drug combination can slow disease progression or reverse deficits after symptoms have already appeared.

Still, even preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease by a few years could have a profound impact on patients, families and health systems.

""This work has taken many years. But now we're at a point where basic neuroscience discoveries are pointing toward something that could realistically move into the clinic,"" Chen said.

Interest in cannabis-based therapies is on the rise, and this latest study offers a unique focus on THC's functional mechanisms and solutions to its side effects. The study moves the field closer to safely applying these therapies in clinical care for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Researchers at UC San Francisco have identified a hazardous waste collector in the brain that disposes of the toxic clumps of tau protein that can lead to dementia. 

Neurons with more of this garbage collector, technically known as CUL5, are less vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease. 

The research helps explain how some brain cells may remain resilient even in advanced disease and points to new therapeutic strategies that could boost the brain's natural defenses against neurodegeneration. 

CUL5 is uniquely suited to getting rid of tau. Maybe a future therapy could enhance the body's natural mechanism for avoiding neurodegeneration."" 

Martin Kampmann, PhD, professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at UCSF

Kampmann is senior author of the paper, which appears in Cell on Jan. 28. The work was spearheaded by Avi Samelson, PhD, when he was a postdoc in Kampmann's lab; he is now an assistant professor of Neurology and Biological Chemistry at UCLA. 

The team made the discovery by developing a petri-dish model of human neurons. 

First, they engineered these cells to produce clumps of tau. Then, using CRISPR gene editing technology, they disabled each of the cells' 20,000 genes, one at a time, to seewhether any of the genes had an effect on how fast the tau clumps would form. 

The screen led the scientists to a protein called CUL5, which tagged tau for elimination before it formed clumps in the cell. 

To see if this was really happening in people with dementia, the researchers turned to the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Atlas, a rich source of data from brain samples that were taken from deceased Alzheimer's patients. Even though these patients had died of their disease, some brain cells were much less vulnerable to degeneration. These resilient cells had lots of CUL5 - suggesting that CUL5 prevented tau from forming clumps.

The researchers also found another set of genes that affected how much tau built up. These genes were related to a process called oxidative stress, which causes damage ascells burn energy and gets worse with age. This made tau more ""sticky"" and likely to clump. 

The findings are a boon to a field that has struggled for decades to find new ways to treat dementia. 

""It's the first time we've been able to screen human neurons for genes that determine their resilience to tau,"" Kampmann said. ""We hope that CUL5 can be the first of many new targets for drug discovery against the dementias.""

A large US trial shows that the cumulative burden of alcohol over decades matters for colorectal cancer risk, with heavy lifelong drinking increasing danger and stopping alcohol linked to fewer early precancerous polyps.



Study: Association of alcohol intake over the lifetime with colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Cancer, researchers used data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial to examine the association between lifetime alcohol intake and the risk of developing colorectal adenomas (precancerous polyps) and invasive cancer.

Study findings revealed that higher lifetime alcohol intake was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly rectal cancer, among current drinkers. Conversely, the data suggested that alcohol cessation was associated with lower odds of developing nonadvanced adenomas detected at screening, a very early precursor lesion.

These findings highlight the importance of viewing alcohol consumption as a cumulative exposure and suggest that reducing intake may influence early carcinogenic processes, although causal effects cannot be inferred.

CRC remains a leading cause of cancer mortality, currently ranked third in incidence across the United States (US). While overall incidence rates have declined, diagnoses among adults under 55 are rising, prompting urgent calls to identify and address modifiable risk factors.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has long classified alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans, specifically linking them to CRC.

Most prior epidemiological studies have relied on snapshots of participants' lives, often measuring alcohol consumption only within the 12 months before the study. This approach fails to account for the fact that cancer development is a slow process often spanning decades.

Furthermore, the relationship between alcohol and colorectal adenomas, the precursor lesions that may progress to cancer, remains poorly understood.

The present study aimed to address this knowledge gap by reconstructing participants' drinking histories from age 18 onward. Understanding this relationship is vital, as preventing an adenoma may effectively prevent cancer incidence.

The study leveraged data from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, a large-scale randomized controlled trial of US adults aged 55 to 74.

Study data examined two distinct groups: an incident adenoma cohort of 12,327 participants who underwent flexible sigmoidoscopy screening and a larger CRC cohort of 88,092 participants followed prospectively for clinically diagnosed cancer.

The study data comprised participants' long-term sociodemographic and medical histories. Participants also completed a Dietary History Questionnaire (DHQ) that asked about beer, wine, and liquor consumption across four age groups: 18–24, 25–39, 40–54, and 55 years and older.

These data were collated and analysed to calculate a weighted average of lifetime alcohol intake.

Participants were categorized based on lifetime average alcohol consumption among current drinkers, with those consuming less than one drink per week serving as the reference group, as follows: less than one drink per week, 1 to <7 drinks per week, 7 to <14 drinks per week, and 14 or more drinks per week.

Former drinkers were analysed separately to reduce potential bias related to lifetime abstention.

The study further investigated drinking patterns, identifying participants who were consistent heavy drinkers versus those who changed their habits over time, using sex-specific thresholds aligned with US dietary guidelines.

Statistical models included logistic regression for adenomas and Cox proportional hazards regression for cancer, adjusting for confounders such as smoking, body mass index (BMI), and family history.

The study revealed a robust association between heavy, long-term alcohol consumption and increased cancer risk. Among current drinkers, those with a lifetime average of 14 or more drinks per week demonstrated a 25% higher risk of developing CRC compared with those consuming less than one drink per week (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53; p = 0.003).

Associations were strongest for rectal cancer, where heavy lifetime drinkers faced nearly double the risk of those in the lowest intake group (hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.17–3.28).

Participants identified as consistent heavy drinkers throughout adulthood demonstrated a 91% higher risk of CRC compared with consistent light drinkers (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.17–3.12).

Study analyses identified a nonlinear association for moderate drinking. Participants averaging 7 to <14 drinks per week showed a lower risk of CRC (hazard ratio, 0.79) compared with those consuming less than one drink per week, particularly for distal colon cancer.

The authors cautioned that this apparent inverse association may reflect residual confounding, differences in health behaviours, or reference group effects and does not indicate a protective effect of alcohol consumption.

Former drinkers had significantly lower odds of developing nonadvanced adenomas than current very light drinkers (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39–0.84), suggesting that cessation may be associated with reduced risk at the earliest detectable stages of colorectal neoplasia.

Associations for advanced adenomas and overall adenoma risk were less consistent.

The present study provides evidence that cumulative lifetime alcohol exposure is associated with CRC risk. Study data indicate that consistent heavy drinking is a robust risk factor for CRC, especially rectal cancer.

Findings related to adenomas suggest that alcohol cessation is associated with lower odds of nonadvanced precursor lesions detected at screening, reinforcing the potential value of lifestyle modification even later in adulthood. However, the observational nature of the study precludes causal conclusions, and the findings of adenomas should be interpreted cautiously.

Limitations include reliance on self-reported alcohol intake and a predominantly white, educated cohort. The study underscores that public health messaging may need to emphasize that reducing alcohol intake is not only about immediate health outcomes but also about reducing long-term cumulative cancer risk.

A 27-year population study suggests that where nitrates come from, not just how much we consume, may shape dementia risk by reflecting broader diet quality and vascular health rather than the effects of any single nutrient alone.

The metabolic fate of food nitrates and nitrites, and therefore their health impact, depends heavily on the source. A recent paper in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia explored diet-specific nitrates for associations with dementia risk.

Dietary nitrate intake comes from several sources. Natural nitrates in plants are mostly ingested in root vegetables and green leafy vegetables. They also occur in animal-based foods. Regulated additives are an additional nitrate source in meat products. A fourth source is tap water.

Earlier studies show that vegetable-sourced nitrate intake is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. Clinical studies demonstrate that nitrate intake improves vascular function. Cardiovascular disease and dementia share several common risk factors, underlining the importance of vascular health to cognitive function in older people.

Nitrate metabolism produces nitrite and nitric oxide (NO). The latter is a vasodilator and neuroprotective molecule. Overall, these suggest a potential link between nitrate intake and dementia risk.

Nitrates and nitrites can also be converted in the body to carcinogenic and possibly neurotoxic N-nitrosamines. Meat contains heme and amines that promote nitrosation. Conversely, plant compounds such as polyphenols, folate, and vitamins C and E inhibit the reaction.

Small studies suggest that nitrate intake from different sources is differentially associated with dementia risk. Observational evidence shows an association between lower dementia risk and mostly plant-based diets, such as the Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets.

The current study sought to identify associations of dietary nitrates and nitrites with the incidence of total and early-onset dementia (before the age of 65 years), by food source, namely:

The study also examined the influence of factors like smoking and exposure to nitrosation inhibitors.

The study used data from the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort Study. It included 54,804 participants who were free of dementia at baseline. Food-frequency questionnaires were used to assess baseline nitrate and nitrite intake.

The data was analyzed using restricted cubic splines to model nonlinear relationships between the variables on a continuous scale. Cox regression models were used to capture changes in risk over time.

In this cohort, 4,750 participants developed dementia over a follow-up period of up to 27 years. Of these, 191 had early-onset dementia. The median age of diagnosis for dementia overall was 77 years, versus 62 years for early-onset dementia.

The median nitrate intake from plant-based sources was 44 mg per day, versus 5.8 mg per day from animal sources and 0.8 mg per day from tap water.

Individuals in the highest quintile of plant-sourced nitrate intake had a healthier baseline profile. They were more likely to be women, more educated, more physically active, never-smokers, and living with a partner. They had lower rates of cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conversely, mean energy intake was higher, and diabetes was more common.

In the highest quintile of water-sourced nitrate intake, participants were more likely to be women, physically active, less educated, smokers, and single. Conversely, participants in the highest animal-based nitrate intake quintile were more likely to be men with a higher energy intake.

Plant-based nitrate intake was inversely correlated with dementia incidence. The risk was 10 % lower in the fifth quintile of nitrate intake versus the first. Doubling the intake of nitrate from plants and vegetables reduced the adjusted dementia risk by 8 %. However, plant-sourced nitrate intake likely reflects broader dietary patterns and lifestyle factors, making it difficult to isolate nitrate-specific effects from overall diet quality.

Dementia risk increased in the highest quintile of animal-sourced nitrate and nitrite intake, 4 to 11 mg per day and 0.5 to 0.9 mg per day, respectively, corresponding to estimated intakes consistent with diets high in red meat. Notably, nitrate intake from naturally occurring animal sources, including fresh meat and dairy, was tenfold that from meat products containing permitted nitrate or nitrite additives.

Dementia risk was 13 % higher and 11 % higher for increased animal-based and meat-product-sourced nitrate intake, respectively. Nitrite intake was associated with a 19 % and 11 % increase in risk, respectively.

Prior research has shown inconsistent findings, perhaps because of factors like meat smoking or high-heat cooking, that promote nitrosamine formation.

Dementia risk increased by 14 % in the highest quintile of water-sourced nitrate intake versus the lowest. The risk was 12-16 % higher when comparing drinking water with the lowest versus the highest nitrate concentrations.

The mean water nitrate levels here were 1.8 to 5.1 mg per liter, significantly below the current regulatory limits of 44 to 50 mg per liter. The higher dementia risk at these levels emphasizes the need for further investigation to identify potential confounding factors or co-occurring water contaminants, rather than implying a direct causal role for nitrate itself.

Nitrate and nitrite intake from all sources affected the risk of early-onset dementia more strongly than total dementia rates. In the highest quintile of vegetable-sourced, but not total plant-sourced, nitrate intake, early-onset dementia risk decreased by 39 %.

Large increases in relative risk were found with nitrate intake from naturally occurring animal sources, meat products, and tap water, by 73 %, 40 %, and 53 %, respectively. However, these estimates were based on only 191 early-onset cases, with wide confidence intervals that included the null, making these associations suggestive rather than definitive.

These associations were strongest at younger ages, perhaps due to increased vascular responsiveness.

These results should be considered preliminary because of the small number of cases, the absence of cases diagnosed before age 50, and the high relative risk estimates.

Dementia rates increased across all animal-sourced nitrate intake subgroups except when polyphenol consumption was low. Conversely, with higher polyphenol or vitamin C intake, nitrate intake was no longer linked to a lower dementia risk. This is consistent with a ceiling effect. These subgroup patterns were exploratory rather than formal tests of interaction, but the biologically plausible findings warrant further exploration.

Dementia rates increased with nitrate intake from meat products, but only with higher polyphenol intake. These inhibitors probably cannot detoxify pre-existing N-nitrosamines in these foods. Alternatively, this was a small subgroup, and the finding could be due to chance.

Sensitivity analyses limited to ten years of follow-up showed stronger associations. This could be due to exposure misclassification, which is very likely given that dietary habits change significantly over decades and with age. Since intake was only captured once at baseline, this misclassification could meaningfully skew the risk estimates.

The findings agree with earlier studies suggesting that lower dementia rates are associated with plant-based nitrate intake. Further research is important to understand whether nitrates protect specifically against dementia or simply improve cerebral perfusion. The challenge of isolating nitrate-related effects on dementia is exacerbated by the complex bioactivity of food.

The strengths of the study include its large sample size, long follow-up, high continuance rate, and robust exposure measures. Even so, its observational design rules out causal inferences.

Beyond the fact that plant-sourced nitrate intake likely reflects broader lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, several additional sources of residual confounding may have influenced the findings. Around 10 % of the Danish population is exposed to relatively high nitrate levels in tap water, while nitrate concentrations in workplace drinking water were not captured, potentially leading to exposure misclassification.

Baseline cognitive status was not formally assessed, raising the possibility that some participants may have had unrecognized impairment at study entry, and dementia diagnoses may have been missed during follow-up. In addition, the cohort consisted predominantly of Caucasian participants, which limits the generalizability of the results to more diverse populations.

The findings reveal source-dependent differences in the associations of nitrate and nitrite with dementia. Dementia risk is inversely associated with the habitual consumption of plant-sourced nitrates, highlighting a new area of investigation. Conversely, animal- and water-sourced nitrate and nitrite were associated with higher dementia risk, with this association modified by other lifestyle and dietary factors.

These effects need to be confirmed and clarified by future research. Meanwhile, ""nitrate source, particularly from vegetables, appears to be a meaningful, modifiable contributor within the broader context of diet quality and vascular health"", with overall dietary patterns likely more important for brain health than any single nutrient in isolation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Neighborhood disadvantage accelerates biological aging through emotional distress","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260129/Neighborhood-disadvantage-accelerates-biological-aging-through-emotional-distress.aspx","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:24:00 GMT","

While scientists have long known that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with biological symptoms of accelerated aging, emotional distress accounts for a significant portion of these effects, researchers found in a recent study.

Consistent with a chains-of-risk framework - the theory that later-life health conditions are triggered by sequential, linked exposures earlier in life - the findings support our hypothesis that prolonged exposure to contextual socioeconomic disadvantage accelerates one's biological age, and that some but not all of this effect operates through increases in psychological symptoms.""

Christina Kamis, first author, professor of sociology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

The study's sample population comprised more than 1,440 people living in Wisconsin and included two factors - cumulative exposure to neighborhood disadvantage and overall emotional distress - that prior studies have not explored. Co-author Wei Xu, a professor in the Institute for Health and Humanity at the Medical College of Wisconsin, has led a number of studies investigating links between health disparities and neighborhood conditions.

Published in The Journals of Gerontology, Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, the paper was co-written by Michal Engelman, a sociology professor and the director of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Kristen Malecki, a professor and the director of the Division of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health.

Engelman and Malecki were the co-principal investigators for the Researching Epigenetics, Weathering, Aging and Residential Disadvantage project that contributed to this work. Funded by the National Institutes on Aging at the National Institutes of Health, the project links the residential histories of respondents of the Survey on the Health of Wisconsin to survey and biomarker data, examining the relationship between long-term exposure to residential disadvantage and DNA methylation patterns and metabolic outcomes. Malecki was the principal investigator of SHOW when the data were collected.

While much of the prior research on accelerated aging, neighborhood factors and residents' emotions focused on depression, the current study also explored stress and anxiety, ""and how each of the psychological factors mediated the relationship between cumulative exposure to neighborhood disadvantage and epigenetic aging,"" Xu said. ""What we found is that anxiety appeared to be a really significant mediator between exposure and the outcome.""

Kamis said the research used three epigenetic ""clocks"" that measure an individual's state of biological aging based on patterns of epigenetic changes in the genome. ""These epigenetic clocks have different algorithms and assumptions,"" Kamis said. ""If we're seeing similar patterns across several different clocks, we have stronger evidence of the relationship.""

The team used two-second generation clocks, the PhenoAge and GrimAge, which, when regressed on chronological age, produce residuals indicating epigenetic age acceleration; along with the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which can be interpreted as the rate of biological aging per one year of chronological age, Kamis said.

While the team found that epigenetic age acceleration was common among those in the sample population, the magnitude varied depending on the clock, Kamis said. By the Dunedin PACE, more than 60% of the participants were aging faster than expected; however, the PhenoAge and GrimAge clocks indicated that 46% and 42%, respectively, of those in the sample were affected.

Six census-tract socioeconomic indicators - including median household income, the percentage of rental households and the proportions of residents with a high school education or less - were used to characterize neighborhood disadvantage.

The researchers also created a composite measure of cumulative exposure by tracking each individual's residential history since the age of 18 - a unique level of exposure that prior neighborhood-biological aging research has rarely been able to consider due to data limitations, Kamis said.

The team obtained participants' residential data for up to five decades, Xu said. ""That allowed us to make more accurate inferences about the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and biological aging, as well as the role of psychological symptoms in that relationship, because we accounted for their cumulative life course exposure, not just that associated with their current neighborhood.""

Individuals' psychological symptoms were measured using a 21-item scale that included three subscales that separately assessed depression, anxiety and stress. By clinical measures, about 24% of the individuals in the study had above-normal scores for depression, while 21% had elevated levels of anxiety and 15% had above-normal stress scores, the researchers found. By adding each person's scores on the three subscales together, the team calculated a composite measure called ""overall distress.""

Cumulative neighborhood disadvantage was a significant predictor of greater overall distress across all three models, and it predicted accelerated aging across all three clocks directly and indirectly through increases in distress, Kamis said.

""Cumulative neighborhood disadvantage and overall distress were both significant predictors of accelerated aging for all three clocks,"" Kamis said. ""One-unit increases in cumulative disadvantage were associated with .187 and .219 additional years of age acceleration by the PhenoAge and GrimAge clocks, respectively, and a .006 increase in the pace of aging by the Dunedin PACE.""

For each accelerated epigenetic aging measure, cumulative neighborhood disadvantage had both a significant direct and indirect effect through overall distress, Kamis said. ""About 13% of the effect of neighborhood disadvantage operated through overall distress by the GrimAge clock, while that proportion was around 10% for each of the other two clocks.

""When we looked at each of the psychological symptom subscales separately, most of the indirect effect on accelerated aging occurred through anxiety,"" Kamis said.

Amy Schultz, a scientist at the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, and then-postdoctoral scholar Joseph Clark also were co-authors of the current study.

ATLANTA (Jan. 29, 2026) – Crystal Dunn, one of the legends in the history of the Women's National Team and one of the few Americans to win a FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, a FIFA Women's World Cup and an Olympic gold medal, has officially announced her retirement from professional soccer.

Dunn, 33, calls time on a brilliant 12-year senior international career which also saw her play in the 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, the 2010 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup and the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, at which she helped lead the USA to the top of the podium in Japan. Her effervescent personality, selflessness for her team and penchant for dancing at the drop of a beat always endeared her to teammates and coaches for club and country.

As one of the first Black stars of the U.S. Women's National Team, especially as a field player, Dunn has long been a role model to many young players of color across the country who aspired to reach the highest levels of the game.

Dunn's career will be remembered for her versatility, her tremendous one-on-one defending, her ability to perform far above her size (5-foot-1), her popularity among her teammates, her ability to inspire generations of U.S. Women's National Team players and for a heck of a lot of winning.

“I leave the game with a sense of peace and deep fulfillment for all that I've accomplished,” said Dunn, who was one of the U.S. National Team's most beloved teammates during her career. “I'm grateful for the incredible people I've had the privilege to work with, from teammates and coaches to family and friends, and all the amazing moments we've shared. I'm very much looking forward to my next chapter ahead.”

Mere months after assisting Kealia Ohai (now Kealia Watt) on the game-winning goal in the 1-0 victory over Germany during the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup Final, Dunn made her debut for the senior National Team on Feb. 13, 2013, vs. Scotland.

She was an outside back and a center back during her Youth National Team Career, but when she emerged as a key player for the WNT at the end of 2015 after a stellar NWSL season, she played as a winger/striker. In the final game of the 2018 SheBelieves Cup against England, she played left back, a position she then held for most of 2018-2021 and the final two years of her career 2023 to 2024.

Dunn was off the field in 2022 as she was pregnant and then gave birth to her son Marcel on May 20 of that year.

Known as one of the best “big-game players” in U.S. history, Dunn played all but 75 minutes of the 2024 Olympics, played every minute of her six games at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and played every minute at the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, helping consistently shut down world class forwards while contributing to the U.S. attack down the wings in every match she played.

Dunn, who started her international career in the U.S. U-14 ID camp in 2006, also played in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics (in which she scored against Colombia), the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, and the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. She played in seven total Concacaf tournaments during her youth and senior career, winning them all.

At the 2008 Concacaf Women's U-17 Championship, Dunn scored the game-winning goal in the 1-0 semifinal against Mexico to send the USA to the first-ever FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. She would help the USA to the championship game where it fell to North Korea, 2-1, in overtime.

She finishes her WNT career tied for 22nd on the USA's all-time caps list and tied for 27th on the all-time goals list, an impressive feat for someone who was primarily a defender for the majority of her WNT career.

Dunn grew up in the U.S. Women's National Team youth setup and finished her U-20 WNT career as one of the most capped players all-time at that level with 39 games played. She finished her U-17 career with 13 caps and one goal.

Dunn did not make the roster for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Team, but that spurred her to further dedicate herself to the game and she had a spectacular club season with the Washington Spirit, winning the NWSL Golden Boot and earning NWSL MVP honors in 2015, along with a return to the U.S. National Team. From then on, she was a regular call-up for three different USWNT head coaches.

Dunn played for six different professional clubs in her career, starting with the Washington Spirit, before heading overseas to Chelsea FC for a stint with now-USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, then coming back to the NWSL where she played for the North Carolina Courage, Portland Thorns FC and Gotham FC. She finished her career in France with Paris Saint-Germain.

She helped the Courage win the 2018 and 2019 NWSL Championships. In 2019, she scored in both the semifinal and the final. She also helped the Thorns win the NWSL title 2022 and won the NWSL Shield three times (2018, 2019 and 2021).

Dunn was selected by the Spirit as the first overall pick out of the University of North Carolina in the 2014 NWSL Draft. She won the MAC Hermann Trophy as college soccer's top player as a junior, when she also helped lead UNC to the NCAA title, and finished second to future USWNT teammate Morgan Brian as a senior. For the Tar Heels, she was a four-time All-American, garnering three First-Team selections and one Third-Team. She was the first player to win ACC Player of the Year honors three times since Mia Hamm completed her trifecta in 1993.

Crystal Alyssia Dunn was born and raised a New Yorker, hailing from Rockville Centre, N.Y. where she attended South Side High School and had a decorated prep career. She was a Parade All-American and led her team to three New York state championships -- 2006, 2007 and 2009 – losing only two games in three school seasons. In 2008, she was dedicated to National Team commitments for the U.S. U-17 WNT.

She married Pierre Soubrier on Dec. 29, 2018, and the couple had Marcel about three and a half years later.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

World Cup winner Crystal Dunn has announced her retirement from professional soccer at the age of 33.

Dunn, who featured as a forward, in attacking midfield and at left-back, made 160 appearances for the U.S. national team. Her 12-year career was primarily spent in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), with a couple of brief stints in Europe.

In a post on Instagram on Monday, Dunn said she was “at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished”.

“I'm ready to embrace the life that awaits me on the other side,” she said. “I look forward to spending more time with my family and being a more present mom. This was not a decision made lightly, but was one made with immense gratitude for everything I've experienced as a professional soccer player. I've grown through challenges, celebrated incredible triumphs, and cherished every part of the journey.

“I first kicked a soccer ball at the age of four, never knowing it would change my life and bring me so many moments beyond my imagination. Every stage of my career taught me the importance of humility, resilience, and gratitude. My journey wasn't perfect, but it was beautiful — filled with trophies, medals, lessons, and the indescribable joy of welcoming a baby along the way.

“Turning the page is never easy. There is so much history, so many memories tied to spaces I'll never experience again. The life of a professional athlete can never truly be replicated but I'm excited to continue impacting the game from new perspectives.”

After playing college soccer for the North Carolina Tar Heels, Dunn was selected first overall in the 2014 NWSL College Draft by the Washington Spirit. In her second season with the club, she led the league with 15 goals, winning the NWSL golden boot and the Most Valuable Player award.

Dunn signed for English team Chelsea in January 2017 and was utilized as a left wing-back by coach Emma Hayes. She appeared 28 times for the club before returning to the U.S. with the North Carolina Courage in February 2018.

She won the NWSL Championship in her first two years with the team and was traded to the Portland Thorns in 2020, where she won a third league championship.

A move to Gotham FC followed in December 2023, where she signed a three-year contract, though she spent only one season with the club before the two sides agreed to mutually part ways after the 2024 campaign.

Dunn's final season as a professional came with Paris Saint-Germain, playing five times and scoring two goals for the French team in 2025.

Dunn made her first appearance for the national team in 2013 as a 20-year-old. She was the last player cut from the 2015 World Cup squad but was included in the side for the 2019 tournament, starting every game at left-back as the U.S. won the competition for the fourth time.

She also represented the nation at the Olympic Games, claiming a bronze medal in 2021 in Tokyo and winning gold in Paris in 2024.

By women's soccer writer Tamerra Griffin

It's telling that Dunn signed off on the Instagram post announcing her retirement not with her name, but with her accolades as one of the most decorated women's soccer players in the world for club and country. Her accomplishments on the pitch elevated her name to household status in the women's soccer world, but in many ways, Dunn's successes were so far ahead of the curve in the culture of the sport that they haven't always received their just recognition.

At the height of her career in the NWSL and with the USWNT, Dunn was one of very few Black players in what was (and still is) a predominantly white sport in the U.S. And she didn't just excel in one position, but several, as a Golden Boot-winning striker and arguably one of the most vital players on the USWNT squad that took home its fourth World Cup title in 2019, where she played every minute of the tournament as a left-back.

It's important to note that Dunn's positional changes were often against her personal desires, but her dedication to her team took precedence in most cases and was almost always key to that team's success. Dunn will always be remembered for her versatility — and her dance moves, crafted long before the creation of TikTok — and for the doors she pried open as an unapologetically Black soccer player.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

USWNT manager Emma Hayes talks about Trinity Rodman embracing the captaincy role and adds that Claire Hutton is a captain in the making. (1:08)

United States women's national team great Crystal Dunn on Thursday announced her retirement from soccer at age 33.

The surprising news came via a post on her Instagram account. In it, she said she wanted to spend more time with her husband, Pierre Soubrier, and 3-year-old son, Marcel.

""This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished,"" Dunn said.

""I've achieved nearly everything I dreamed of in this sport and gave all I had to give.""

A post shared by Crystal Dunn (@crystaldunn)

""I'm ready to embrace the life that awaits me on the other side. I look forward to spending more time with my family and being a more present mom. This was not a decision made lightly, but was one made with immense gratitude for everything I've experienced as a professional soccer player.""

Dunn signed with Paris Saint-Germain from Gotham FC in January 2025 but saw few minutes. She made just one appearance in the 2025-26 season.

She was part of the U.S. team that won the 2019 World Cup and 2024 Olympic gold.

In a news release, U.S. Soccer recounted Dunn's accomplishments, calling her 12-year senior international career ""brilliant.""

Dunn played in the 2008 FIFA U17 Women's World Cup, the 2010 FIFA U20 Women's World Cup and the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, at which she helped lead the United States to the top of the podium in Japan.

""Her effervescent personality, selflessness for her team and penchant for dancing at the drop of a beat always endeared her to teammates and coaches for club and country,"" U.S. Soccer said in its statement.

Dunn played for six different professional clubs in her career, starting with the Washington Spirit before heading overseas to Chelsea for a stint with now-U.S. head coach Emma Hayes, then coming back to the NWSL where she played for the North Carolina Courage, Portland Thorns FC and Gotham FC.

She helped the Courage win the 2018 and 2019 NWSL Championships. In 2019, she scored in both the semifinal and the final. She also helped the Thorns win the NWSL title 2022 and won the NWSL Shield three times (2018, 2019 and 2021). 

Dunn was selected by the Spirit as the first pick out of the University of North Carolina in the 2014 NWSL draft.

She won the MAC Hermann Trophy as college soccer's top player as a junior, when she also helped lead UNC to the NCAA title, and finished second to future U.S. teammate Morgan Brian as a senior.

For the Tar Heels, Dunn was a four-time All-American. She was the first player to win ACC Player of the Year honors three times since Mia Hamm completed her trifecta in 1993. 

""I leave the game with a sense of peace and deep fulfillment for all that I've accomplished,"" Dunn said. ""I'm grateful for the incredible people I've had the privilege to work with, from teammates and coaches to family and friends, and all the amazing moments we've shared.

One of the veteran leaders and most versatile players to have ever played for the U.S. women's national team will be moving on.

Crystal Dunn announced her retirement on Thursday, capping off a 12-year senior international career that included helping the USWNT win the 2019 World Cup and the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She ends her national team playing days with 160 caps and 25 goals. 

Dunn, 33, will always be remembered as one of the legends of the game not only because of what she accomplished on the field, but for also being a role model off of it. She was one of the first Black stars of the national team. Her vivacious personality was contagious in every locker room she stepped in, especially when she'd start a dance party out of nowhere or show off her DJ skills. She's mentored plenty of young players, and always put her team first.

Dunn is one of the most versatile players the national team has ever had. She could play any position on the field and often did. She was an attacking player in college at North Carolina, where she was a four-time All-American, won the MAC Hermann Award, and helped the Tar Heels win a national championship. She played attacking midfielder, winger and forward for her club teams, but was often saddled at left back for the national team. Playing on the back line wasn't always Dunn's favorite, as she had a nose for scoring goals. But she did what the team needed and was considered to be one of the best outside backs in the world, especially when it came to winning one-on-one battles.

""I leave the game with a sense of peace and deep fulfillment for all that I've accomplished,"" Dunn said in a statement. ""I'm grateful for the incredible people I've had the privilege to work with, from teammates and coaches to family and friends, and all the amazing moments we've shared. I'm very much looking forward to my next chapter ahead.""

Dunn gave birth to her son Marcel in May 2022 and impressively returned to the field just a few months later. That NWSL season, she scored the winning goal for the Portland Thorns in second-half stoppage time of the NWSL playoff semifinal to send her team to the championship game. The next year, Dunn was one of three moms to play for the USWNT at the 2023 Women's World Cup.

Dunn played for six different clubs over the course of her professional career, including the Washington Spirit, Chelsea, the North Carolina Courage (where she won back-to-back NWSL titles in 2018 and 2019), the Portland Thorns (where she won another title in 2022) and Gotham FC. She most recently played for Paris Saint-Germain.

While USWNT manager Emma Hayes is doing a remarkable job developing the talent pool and young leaders, Dunn's veteran presence will certainly be missed in the locker room as it prepares to qualify for the 2027 World Cup. ","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

In wake of Crystal Dunn's retirement announcement on Thursday, FrontRowSoccer.com is reposting some of her most memorable moments and stories. This story was originally posted during the 2019 Women's World Cup.

FrontRowSoccer.com Editor

PARIS — Crystal Dunn was given a preview of what was to come in the SheBelieves Cup during a 1-1 draw with France at Red Bull Arena on March 4, 2018.

The Rockville Centre, N.Y. native had replaced forward Mallory Pugh in the 73rd minute and figured she would get an opportunity to be part of the United States attack in an attempt to secure a victory. After all, Dunn had proven to be a most dangerous weapon, tying a U.S. record by scoring five times during an Olympic qualifying win in 2016.

As it turned out, by the final whistle, she had much different worries — as a left back to make sure that France wasn't going to score the game-winner. Dunn was forced into defense after Casey Short was stretchered off with a leg injury in the 76th minute

Dunn even had to fight her own natural attacking instincts. On one corner kick, she started to retreat a bit toward her goal though the Americans were trying to score.

“Story of my life, right?” she said at the time. “I just have to be prepared for whatever. I've been that type of player my whole career. It's normal.”

Dunn is arguably the most versatile women's soccer player on this planet. She has played every position but goalkeeper for the USA, which meets France in the Women's World Cup quarterfinals at Parc des Princes Friday. And she has no desire of taking up that position now.

“Absolutely not,” she said with a laugh about the possibility of putting on goalkeeper's gloves. “What those keepers are able to is incredible. It's not in my wheelhouse at all.”

A blessing or a curse?

Like it or not, Dunn has excelled on defense, midfield and forward, so that versatility can be considered a blessing or a curse.

“I think it's a blessing, in all fairness,” said Paul Riley, who is Dunn's coach on the National Women's Soccer League champion North Carolina Courage. Dunn is the team's playmaker.

“I think if she was playing in the 10, she wouldn't play,” said Riley, who was (and still is) the director of football at the Albertson Soccer Club when Dunn played there for his wife Tracey for one of the club's youth teams.

“If the coach likes Lindsey Horan better or Rose Lavelle better, but if you're the best left back there is, you're the left back. For my team, she's not the best left back. I think I have a better left back. That's obviously coaches' choices. But I think, as a No. 10, she electric, she's a game changer. She can change a game at a moment. We probably miss her a lot, probably more than any other player because she just creates moments that are special. It takes a certain player.

Crystal Dunn (center) trains with Megan Rapinoe and Christen Press. (Michael Chow – USA TODAY Sports)

“She scores loads of goals for us. Some are opportunistic, some of them are just brilliant plays by her. She can make her own chances by dribbling. She can create chances by passing. She's technically gifted enough. she's technical enough to pass the ball on the final ball to people. She doesn't just score goals. She assists on goals. She's just a production machine, a valuable weapon to have at the World Cup, in case you have to push her forward or higher. You put her on the left wing and you have four up front and the left two mids are chasing the game.”

So, the 26-year-old Dunn has had the make the transition from an attacking player to a defending one who takes the offensive when the moment is right.

“It's not easy in any way,” she said. “There's a lot that goes on in my head before camp if I'm playing a different position that I have been playing. I just try to keep it simple. I don't overthink. In training when I'm at a different position, when I'm receiving the ball I always know where I want to go. I know my players around me. At the end of the day it's just soccer. I try to keep it as simple as possible and just try to be at my best.

“Playing outside back, I've dibbled and dabbled there, obviously and I have a good gist on what is expected of me. There are definitely times in games where, that I'm like, ‘Ooof, I'm a little unsure of what to do in this situation.' But you know comes down to teammates who will help and support me. They know I'm not always going to have the answers and make the right decisions on the field. Them having my back makes it a lot easier.”

When asked what her preferred position was, Dunn did not have to take long to say what spot that was.

“I definitely think I'm attacking player,” she said. “Where specifically in the attack, it's hard to narrow down but I do think if I had to pick a position, it would be a wide forward, a wide midfielder. This year I did actually play the 10, which was very much central [and] I got a good feel for that. It also helps who I'm playing with. My teammates literally help and put me in the best position to succeed, then every position is fun.”

Which position Dunn is best suited for has been an ongoing debate for years. And by the way, she has 24 goals in 89 international appearances.

“I go through phases where I hate how versatile I am,” she said, “and I go through those phases where I love it. I feel it makes me so unique and it makes me feel like I'm just in a different category. The more I embrace it and the more I open my heart knowing that this makes me special, makes me unique, and it's awesome. That's when I'm at my best. I think when I fight it I'm angry that I have to play so many positions. That's when I am not bought in and I get upset and I don't probably play at my best. So, going forward, I'm just embracing it and that's who I am.”

The Anson factor

When Dunn attended the University of North Carolina, legendary head coach Anson Dorrance originally used the Long Island as a defender. But after seeing what a dynamo she was, he changed his mind.

“When I saw her as a youth player, playing for Albertson, she was an outside winger up front,” he said. “She was in the 11 or 7 [spot]. Then all of a sudden I was seeing with the youth national teams, and I think in the first youth World Cup she played in, she was actually a center back and I think she was playing for Jill Ellis [the current U.S. women's national coach] in that stretch. She comes to UNC because I had seen her as the youth national team level as a center back, I threw her to center back immediately in the first part of her freshman year. She easily won the start as a center back.”

Then Dorrance saw the qualities that made Dunn such a special player.

“The qualities that make her special is that she can beat anyone off the dribble. I mean anyone off the dribble,” he said. “And I am thinking, what a waste of this brilliant dribbler as a center back. She was very good defensively. She could stop people, but then she would get the ball, her first instinct would be to play make. It would be to start penetrating off the dribble. She had no trouble carving all the forwards she was playing against.

“So, I was thinking this was ridiculous: why have this kid who is so good off the dribble playing as a center back? That's when we started moving her around, playing midfield in a 3-4-3, up front in a 3-4-3 and then finally, in her junior and senior year as a 10 and as a 10 she was phenomenal. It wasn't like she wasn't brilliant passer, because no one could stop her off the dribble. Almost every time she got the ball she would beat the other team's six and all of a sudden, we had numbers up somewhere. She was devastating for us at the 10.”

In 2012, Dunn won her second Atlantic Coast Conference defensive player of the year award and MAC Hermann Trophy honors while helping the Tar Heels to In 2013, she captured ACC offensive player of the year before winning the MAC Hermann Trophy as the best women's college soccer player.

So close, yet so far

Four years ago, Dunn just missed making the U.S. squad for the World Cup in Canada. She was an alternate and wound up watching the U.S. games and triumph on TV.

Whatever frustrations and emotions Dunn had, she took it out on the rest of the NWSL, by not only winning the goal-scoring title, but MVP honors as well as a member of the Washington Spirit.

Dunn earned a spot on the 2016 Olympic team that was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Sweden. Now, she has an opportunity to win a world championship.

Crystal Dunn: “If I focus on the short-term goals, then the long-term goals are going to be in my favor.” (Michael Chow – USA TODAY Sports)

“I'm super determined,” she said. “I think four years ago I was a completely different person and player. The way I kind of view life and viewed the game was so different. I think I came full circle. I have another opportunity to fight for a spot on this World Cup roster. I'm just a more confident player. I know who I am as a player and it kind of translates on the field. This time around I am way more relaxed, I would say. I am going in every day just wanting to work hard and get better. If I focus on the short-term goals, then the long-term goals are going to be in my favor.”

She has played a vital role for the Courage, whether it has been threading passes to teammates or scoring goals. Last year year the Courage rolled to the title, losing but once.

“She has become a much better player technically and tactically,” Riley said. “She creates, she scores. She produces. At left back she's good, too. She gets forward, creates. Great crosser of the ball with both feet. Her left foot is much better today than back then, I'll tell you that. She's really, really developed. She's had her ups and downs, not getting picked for the next World Cup. She used all her positive energy. I respect that. She's a great footballer. Great personality in the locker room, too. She helps the team out a lot. She's just not one of those players who shows up now and then. She shows up every week. I think consistency is another thing that people don't notice. She's very consistent in her play, which not always the case.”

Giving soccer some more exposure

Off the field, Dunn is quite proud for posing for the Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue and for ESPN's Body Issue. In both magazines, women can be scantily clad or have nothing on at all.

Dunn had no problem. She is proud of her 5-2 body.

“That was an incredible experience,” she said. “I did the ESPN Body Issue, which is obviously, you're like naked. Then all of a sudden, Sports Illustrated, you're in a bathing suit, at least with little. To me, that was more thrilling in a sense that than the ESPN Body shoot. I just think seeing us in a different light always raises different eyebrows. ”Oh, you're a soccer player. What are you doing posing on a beach and having fun?' What is really important, and I want people to realize that we're more than just an athlete.

“I always step off the field knowing that it's ok to leave soccer behind and kind of focus on other aspects of your life. I'm a wife, a sister, a daughter. I am not just this athlete people see us as. Being part of the Sports Illustrated shoot was just a way to express that we're so much more than what people think we are.

“My husband nearly had a heart attack. But I told him, ‘Listen this is a special moment. It's not every day are you asked to be in Sports Illustrated, so he obviously was very supportive.”

Her husband is Pierre Soubier, head trainer for the Portland Thorns (NWSL) and a native of Aurignac, France. The couple were married on Long Island last December.

“My in-laws, they're French and they want the women's side to do well. But obviously I'm a part of the family now and they're rooting for me and they want me to go all the way,” Dunn told USA TODAY last month. “They've said it's going to be quite tough if we play France. I told them to wear only one jersey and I hope it's the U.S. jersey.”

On Thursday, Soubier posted on Twitter:

Another body to help carry this @ussoccer_wnt to the Cup! @crysdunn_19 I'm on my way! 🌹✈️🇫🇷… Let's Go 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸 @ Portland International Airport

How it began

In what sounds like a familiar story about how many players started their journey in the sport, Dunn began playing soccer with the Rockville Centre Soccer Club when she was four-years-old.

“My parents knew nothing about soccer,” she said. “They just felt I had a lot of energy and told me to go run around and run it off. But I am so fortunate to continue playing this sport. Anyone who picks up a soccer ball, regardless of what skill set you're at, it's such a fun sport to kick around with your friends and you're never going to regret that decision.”

When it came time for travel soccer in the Long Island Junior Soccer League, Dunn performed with the Rockville Centre Power from Under-10 through U-13, winning an Eastern New York Youth Soccer Association State Cup championship. She moved into the RVC Tornadoes from U-13 through U-15 before joining the Albertson Fury as a U-15 player. She was a standout there winning several State Cups title before moving on to college.

“Being part of a good club, it allowed me to go to really top tournaments, allowed me to be seen by top colleges, obviously got my chance to go to UNC,” Dunn said. “That's ultimately what youth soccer does for you. It opens up the window for coaches to see you and recruit you.”

They also had an opportunity to see Dunn play and dominate as a member of the South Side High School squad in Rockville Centre. She was the center piece of the team, leading it to New York State titles in 2006, 2007 and 2009. In the 2009 championship game, she had recorded a hat-trick in the opening 20 minutes, finishing with four goals. She was named the Newsday Long Island player of the year, Nassau County player of the year, BigAppleSoccer.com youth soccer player of the year and the Mike Clark Award as the best all-around athlete in Nassau County.

And if you were wondering why South Side did not win state honors in 2008, Dunn had a pretty decent excuse. She missed the entire season due to youth national team commitments that fall. Playing outside back, Dunn and the U.S. lost to North Korea in the U-17 World Cup final in New Zealand.

Unlike many of her USWNT teammates, Dunn admitted she did not see the USA defeat China via penalty kicks to win the 1999 World Cup. But that certainly did not deter her enthusiasm for the sport.

“I didn't watch the game, so I did not see it actually live,” she said. “But after all the headlines, all the pictures, just them all in the news, I just thought to myself, women's soccer has definitely taken a turn. It's a pivotal moment for the game.”

The Long Island connection

Dunn is one of two Long Islanders on the first, which is a World Cup first. She has joined Northport, N.Y. native and midfielder Allie Long, another product of the Albertson SC, on the squad.

“Honestly, it's so great,” she said. “Me and Allie always talk about how great it is to be from New York. It's such a special place. We always tell me people that if you can survive in New York, you can survive anything. So, us traveling all over the place, we always feel … we can survive this.”

She then laughed.

Dunn comes off as a bubbly personality, always smiling even when a tough question or two is thrown her way. But don't let that fool you. Underneath that shell is one tough New Yorker.

“New Yorkers have that mindset, we are grinders, we can survive anything,” she said. “That's what helped me when I was going away to college. I was in places without my parents. I felt I was built to survive anything. They're asking kids at 12 years of age to fly out of the country by themselves. I think it's really important to have a set guideline of knowing who you are. New York has shaped that in me and I always think I bring New York everywhere I go.”

Now, Crystal Dunn would love to bring the Women's World Cup trophy home to New York and the United States.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew discuss Ricardo Pepi's potential move to Fulham and will it affect his chances of going to the World Cup. (2:56)

On a wintery day in Fresno, California, a group of friends are playing soccer at a local park. In what has become an annual tradition for a collective of 10 to 12 players predominantly from the United Soccer League (USL), the group trains together in the offseason as a way to stay fit for the new year. With an energy of amicable competition, these sessions are an invaluable boost for those who are setting goals for 2026.

Kicking and chasing the ball across the modest public greenery, many are looking for new contracts in the lower leagues, others are seeking to simply stay fit, but as for one prominent player in attendance?

""Everyone's basically grinding for something,"" said the U.S. men's national team's Max Arfsten to ESPN. ""For me, it's trying to make the World Cup.""

Just months out from this year's momentous tournament, Arfsten's 2026 preparations began here with his close circle in his hometown, where the Columbus Crew fullback was stopped a couple of times by kids to take photos after his practices. With his MLS season ending in early November and not beginning again until Feb. 21, the 24-year-old drew upon a potent source of motivation for an athlete at any level: not wanting to lose to your friends.

""Every time you play against the guys from your hometown ... you kind of innately want to prove your worth,"" Arfsten said. ""You want to be the top dog in the city that you're from.""

Doing so helped fuel Arfsten's rhythm during a slow period before a pivotal 2026. In fact, for those who didn't qualify for the playoffs last year, they'll go through a four-month stretch between official MLS matches, with preseason camps now back in full swing. Although the league will switch to a more globally aligned summer-to-spring calendar in 2027, which will push the offseason to the summer and shorten the winter break, at the moment there's an obvious gap in competitive games.

Of course, that break is needed in order to fully recover and regroup, but its timing complicates matters when you consider that weeks after MLS' 2026 season begins, the USMNT will have one last international window before head coach Mauricio Pochettino makes his final World Cup roster decisions. Conversely, the United States' high-profile stars in European leagues will be in the middle of their campaigns, boasting match fitness their domestic-based compatriots are unlikely to equal.

With the World Cup around the corner, Arfsten isn't alone when it comes to extra offseason work. Across the country in St. Louis, Missouri, Columbus teammate Patrick Schulte has his own group that has helped him stay sharp.

""There's four or five of my buddies that I grew up playing with or went to college with that all live here or base here in the offseason, we get a good group together,"" said the goalkeeper who, like Arfsten, feeds off a cordial sense of rivalry.

""I don't want to get scored on by my friends because I won't hear the end of it,"" joked Schulte about his lively sessions back home. ""As a goalkeeper, some of my buddies are forwards. I just want them to know, 'Hey, if we ever play, you got no chance.'""

Schulte and his crew regularly trained this offseason at St. Louis Scott Gallagher SC, where the national team goalkeeper developed his talents at a younger age, but similar to Arfsten's group, they also roamed around local parks. These sessions across St. Louis sometimes ballooned up to 30 players, which can include non-professional academy prospects testing the 24-year-old, who is in the running to head to the World Cup.

""We have MLS guys, we have guys in the USL, guys in [reserve] MLS Next Pro,"" said Schulte.

Over in Florida, fellow national team member Alex Freeman spent part of his MLS offseason at Fort Lauderdale's SAT Soccer, a program that specializes in customized training regimens for some of the world's top players. According to the company, other names with MLS experience such as Josef Martínez, Telasco Segovia, Juanjo Purata and Tadeo Allende also traveled there ahead of 2026.

""A lot of people in offseason come to that spot,"" Freeman said to ESPN about Fort Lauderdale. ""A lot of guys who come in and text me about trainings, and we're able to get a little group and be able to just catch up and be able to also train together, and just be able to improve on whatever we need to do.""

Individual work is also key. While Freeman -- who will leave Orlando City SC and join Villarreal in LaLiga this winter, a source told ESPN's Jeff Carlisle -- discussed fitness, Arfsten noted improvements on specific aspects of his wingback position: ""defending, working on crossing, deep crossing."" Schulte highlighted more sessions than usual in the offseason with a goalie coach that he grew up with.

Houston Dynamo and USMNT midfielder Jack McGlynn, who underwent foot surgery in October, centered on a more introspective style of individual improvement.

""A lot of mental work. I think when you're injured, you have a lot of time on your own to think and kind of reflect on your season, where you could do better,"" McGlynn told ESPN in late 2025. ""A lot of watching film back of all of our games and seeing where I can improve, and I know where I can, and I can't wait to get back on the field, because I know how much better I'm going to be.""

McGlynn is now back to full fitness. Just a few days ago, and with plenty still to prove to Pochettino before getting a call-up, he found the back of the net during a preseason game.

Considering that March's international window will likely be the final audition for the USMNT before World Cup roster selection, the harsh reality for these MLS-based national team hopefuls is that they'll have to hit the ground running once the league starts in mid-February.

In the short term, this could be a disadvantage. For those MLS players who make that World Cup roster, though, could being in midseason form -- rather than coming into the tournament off the back of a grueling European club campaign -- then become an advantage that helps the USMNT?

""I think you can take it in both kinds of ways,"" Freeman said. ""Obviously, you would kind of want to be maybe playing a little more going into January, February ... but also it just gives you time to perfect what you need to do.""

""I don't know. It's a World Cup, everyone's going to be the cream of the crop,"" added Schulte about the possibility of a midseason gain. ""We might be a little more fresh and not have as many games on our legs, but I think at that point in life, with the adrenaline and everything, it's not going to matter too much.""

For Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan, a 30-year-old veteran who has been one of the latest surprising X factors for the national team, there's no denying the impact that MLS players could have.

""European players will be pretty much done with all their games ... so that is a very difficult place [for them] to be in,"" he told media over the winter. ""You're going to have to rely on your entire squad, and there is an advantage for us [in MLS] to be able to come in fresh leading into the World Cup, taking full advantage of the offseason now and then ramping up slowly ... right when summer hits, you're halfway through the season and you're in a good spot.""

If you ask Arfsten, it's a case-by-case basis, but it probably wouldn't shock him if someone from MLS garnered an extra edge -- however slight -- at the World Cup.

""It's specific to the player. I mean, it just depends on what kind of form you're in,"" said the Columbus player. ""But I think in terms of mental freshness, yeah, there's going to be more freshness from us guys.""

Perhaps the guy who pushes the USMNT forward on the global stage this summer is someone who was playing at your local park last month.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Monaco's Folarin Balogun had a goal disallowed against Juventus Frederic Dides/Getty Images

For some it was a chance to reassert their value with timely goals, for others it was a missed opportunity — or even last-ditch heartbreak.

The league phase of the Champions League drew to a dramatic close yesterday, with progress secured for most of the USMNT contingent in Europe.

Weston McKennie, Folarin Balogun, Malik Tillman, Johnny Cardoso and Yunus Musah all featured as their teams finished in the table's play-off positions, ensuring another chance to clinch their place in the last-16 phase through next month's play-offs.

Despite a memorable debut for his new club in this season's competition, when he scored against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in September, Tim Weah of Marseille was left forlorn on Wednesday.

Just when Marseille thought they had scraped through to the play-off round, they were eliminated.

Despite losing 3-0 in Belgium to Club Brugge, the French outfit headed into added time in 24th position, narrowly above the elimination zone. Only goal difference kept them above Benfica, who are managed by two-time Champions League winner Jose Mourinho, before a staggering finale in Lisbon.

The Portuguese side's goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a sensational 98th-minute header that changed everything. It sealed a 4-2 win over nine-man Real Madrid, who dropped from the automatic qualification places into the play-offs, and moved Benfica above Marseille at the last gasp.

At least when he recovers from his disappointment, he will not forget the earlier part of this season's Champions League, especially that fine goal against Real Madrid.

What a moment for the #USMNT forward 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/9IgCp3TkIN

That powerful finish stirred memories of how his iconic goalscoring father George had announced his arrival at another French club, Paris Saint-Germain, on his Champions League debut in 1994.

Less dramatically, McKennie's Juventus and Balogun's Monaco played out a cagey stalemate that meant both teams head into the play-offs.



It may ultimately have been a quiet last league-stage fixture for McKennie but he had already made his mark on this competition. His previous three goals in three Champions League games were a streak timed as perfectly as his finishing, coming in the context of talks to extend his Juventus contract beyond this summer.

The Texan was not the only American who enjoyed an important scoring streak. Balogun notched in three consecutive Champions League games in November and December, including the only goal in wins against Bodo/Glimt and Galatasaray, which helped Monaco progress.

Balogun thought he had scored another vital strike during the first half against Juventus at Stade Louis II in a game Monaco could not afford to lose.

But a well-taken finish was ruled out for his foul on Pierre Kalulu in the build-up, and the Ligue 1 side's nerves remained on edge until the end, even if Juventus struggled to create anything.

Ricardo Pepi also scored three times for PSV in the Champions League this season. The 23-year-old seized the opportunity of becoming his Dutch club's first-choice centre-forward, after previously playing understudy to veteran Luuk de Jong.

A broken arm earlier this month may have curtailed Pepi's involvement in the league phase, but his performances prompted clubs who have been monitoring him, such as Premier League side Fulham, to step up their interest.

Whether he leaves the Netherlands remains to be seen, but Pepi and his compatriot Sergino Dest won't be going any further in this season's Champions League. The defending Eredivisie champions lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich, meaning they were knocked out.

Pepi and Balogun will compete to lead the line for the USMNT in the World Cup, but Mauricio Pochettino's midfield is another area with strong options.

In that respect, Johnny Cardoso will have hoped for better exposure in Europe's elite cup competition so far this term. The 24-year-old has struggled to break into Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid side, and started only one of their eight league-phase games. He came on in the second half of their 2-1 loss to Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.

Cardoso will at least get the chance to feature in the play-offs.

Another gifted young USMNT star carved out his own notable record. Malik Tillman repeated the trick of doing what no other American has done before, by scoring twice in a Champions League tie on Wednesday.

His double against Villarreal helped Bayer Leverkusen to a 3-0 win and with that progress into the play-offs. They will now play either Borussia Dortmund or Olympiacos for a place in the last 16.



It echoed his record-breaking brace in the competition for his previous team PSV, against Shakhtar Donetsk in 2024.

Yunus Musah will compete with Tillman for a midfield slot in Mauricio Pochettino's side this summer, and he will also get at least one more chance to shine in the Champions League beforehand.

Musah made his second start in the league phase for his Italian side Atalanta in a 1-0 defeat at Union Saint-Gilloise, but that did not prevent them making the play-off stage.

The 23-year-old had a quiet game, and with only two Serie A starts so far this season, he might be concerned by his lack of minutes thus far in an important season.

There's a new tournament at the elite level of women's football - the Women's Champions Cup.

Designed to pit the best club teams against each other, the annual competition will conclude this week in London with Arsenal firm favourites to lift the trophy in Sunday's final.

Facing the Gunners, however, will be a team few expected to make it this far. Corinthians, not Gotham FC, will line up at the Emirates Stadium fresh from a semi-final upset.

Corinthians are the dominant force in Brazilian women's football and Sunday's match gives them the chance to highlight the growth of the domestic game in the country.

FIFA recognises Santos as two-time world champions, a status forged in the 1960s and central to the club's global standing. According to Diario Do Peixe, the governing body has repeatedly confirmed the tally. In Brazil, only São Paulo have more.

Those crowns came via the old Intercontinental tournament, which FIFA deems of equal value to its Club World Cup. The new expanded, 32-team edition staged every four years does not alter Santos' record.

They beat Benfica home and away. A 3-2 win at the Maracanã featured two from Pelé and one from Coutinho. In Lisbon, they swept the return 5-2, Pelé hitting three and Coutinho two.

Against Milan, Santos lost the first game in Italy 4-2, facing a side led by Brazilian forward José Altafini, known as Mazzola. They levelled the tie with a 4-2 victory at the Maracanã, Pelé and Coutinho scoring twice. Two days later Dalmo converted a penalty to win the decider 1-0.

That dominance reflected an extraordinary generation. Pelé was supported by Pepe and Coutinho, with Gilmar, Zito, Mauro and Mengálvio also starring, and the team's global tours amplified its fame.

The club returned to the world stage in 2011. After beating Kashiwa Reysol in the semi-final of the updated FIFA competition, Neymar's Santos were outclassed 4-0 by Messi's Barcelona in the final.

Opportunities might have been greater, as Santos even declined Libertadores entries in 1966 and 1969. Supporters will hope the next era adds to a storied tally.

According to Meu Timao, Teles said the performance went beyond what they had anticipated from a week of preparation and stressed the need to keep the same intensity heading into the final. She spoke in the mixed zone at the Gtech Community Stadium in England.

She noted the squad had worked hard, knew Gotham were strong and felt their own quality showed. The plan, she added, was to rest and enjoy the win briefly, then switch focus to the final, which they expect to be difficult, while feeling ready for it.

Teles joined Corinthians at the start of 2025. She made 23 appearances, 19 as a starter, and won the Brasileiro and the Libertadores, but was largely considered a reserve behind options including Thaís Ferreira, Mariza, Thaís Regina and Erika.

Her starting role at this tournament followed Mariza's move to Tigres of México, a right fibula fracture for Thaís Regina, and new signing Agustina Barroso being sidelined with a recurring contracture linked to a scar in the left soleus muscle.

Corinthians face Arsenal in the final on Sunday 1 February at 15:00 Brasília time, at the Emirates Stadium in London.

January 29 – South America's crown jewel tournament in club football, the Copa Libertadores, may be on the brink of its most radical evolution yet and one that could see it challenge the UEFA Champions League not just in prestige, but in global relevance.



CONMEBOL President Alejandro Domínguez has publicly left the door open for clubs from the United States and Mexico to join South America's premier club competition, despite their membership of Concacaf. “The door is open to them,” Domínguez told Globo Esporte, responding to questions about MLS and Liga MX participation.

Those comments landed soon after Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas described it as his “dream” for the club to play in the Libertadores.

“It's a dream, and obviously I've already had conversations with CONMEBOL to see about our participation,” Mas said. “There are precedents, because in the past Mexican clubs have already competed in the Libertadores. I want to play in the Libertadores, I've already said that publicly.”

It was only ten years ago that Mexican clubs were a defining part of the tournament, with Cruz Azul, Chivas and Tigres all reaching finals between 1998 and 2016. Their presence added commercial weight, continental intrigue and meaningful cross-border rivalries.

Domínguez acknowledged that any return would require coordination with Concacaf. “We are very respectful of the other confederations,” he said, while calling it an “honour that teams from other confederations view the Libertadores as a benchmark for international and world competition”.

That benchmark could shift dramatically if MLS and Liga MX champions were granted access. A Libertadores featuring elite Brazilian and Argentine sides alongside Mexican giants and marquee U.S. clubs with global stars in tow would have broadcasters salivating, significantly boosting sponsorship value, particularly in North America's rapidly growing soccer market.

The obstacles remain significant. Concacaf has repeatedly opposed the idea, citing its own Champions Cup as the route to the FIFA Club World Cup, and FIFA has previously blocked Mexican re-entry. Calendars, governance and politics all stand in the way.

Yet the ambition is clear. If CONMEBOL can align the confederations and unlock North American participation, the Libertadores would no longer just be South America's crown jewel — it could become the only club competition outside Europe capable of rivalling the Champions League on a global stage.

Growing interest from England


Spanish media reports have highlighted new developments surrounding Jude Bellingham's future at Real Madrid, with increasing interest coming from the Premier League.





According to El Nacional, several English clubs — none officially named — have submitted bids in recent weeks worth more than €100 million for the England international.






Form under close review


The report suggests that the surge in interest is linked to a dip in Bellingham's recent performances, a situation that has not gone unnoticed by the Madrid hierarchy.

While the midfielder remains highly regarded within the club, his current form has sparked internal evaluation.






Real Madrid's stance


At Valdebebas, Bellingham is still viewed as a cornerstone of both the present and future project. However, the report claims Real Madrid could be open to listening to offers should his performances fail to show clear improvement in the next phase of the season.

At this stage, there are no official negotiations or an expressed intention to sell.






A key figure in recent success


Since his arrival, Jude Bellingham quickly established himself as one of Real Madrid's standout performers, playing a decisive role in the club's recent success in LaLiga and European competition.

That influence, however, has diminished over the past period, fueling speculation both inside and outside the club.

While Real Madrid have no immediate plans to part ways with the midfielder, the scale of the Premier League offers could prompt internal discussions if Bellingham's form continues to fluctuate, placing his long-term future under the spotlight.

Licence fee payers' money will not be used this summer

Micah Richards will be on The Rest is Football podcast

The BBC has made clear it will not use licence fee payers' money to help leading pundits such as Micah Richards to work for rival podcasts during this summer's World Cup.

Cost constraints and environmental considerations mean the BBC's World Cup presentation will come from its Salford studios for the bulk of the tournament, with Richards expected to have a leading role. However, he has also committed to appearing on The Rest is Football podcast, which will be presented by Gary Lineker in New York.

During Euro 2024 the then BBC trio of Lineker, Richards and Alan Shearer recorded episodes of The Rest is Football together in Berlin, but the BBC's decision to stay at home and Lineker's split from the corporation last year have created issues in terms of filming together during the World Cup.

In another complication, The Rest is Football is expected to be shot to higher production standards this summer owing to a distribution deal with Netflix, which will be making the podcast available on its platforms after a £14m deal agreed last month.

Netflix's deal with Lineker's production company, Goalhanger, is understood to include a commitment to produce more than 40 Rest is Football video podcasts during the World Cup, which the streaming platform will want to feature as many big-name guests as possible.

Lineker will be in Netflix's New York studio throughout, with other pundits to join him when they are available. The BBC has told its pundits that it is happy for them to do other media work during the World Cup and many are expected to do so, but it will not subsidise the cost. As a result Richards' travel costs will have to be met by Netflix or Goalhanger.

Shearer will be in the US throughout the tournament on co-commentary duties by the BBC, so there is more chance of him presenting The Rest is Football alongside Lineker in person.

The Match of the Day presenters Mark Chapman, Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan will be based in the Salford studio for the bulk of the World Cup, although one or more of them may travel to the US later in the tournament, particularly if England or Scotland reach the latter stages.

The trio will also have podcasting duties during the World Cup as presenters of The Sports Agents, which is expected to record its programmes remotely.

The BBC chose to base its World Cup coverage in the UK in part because the huge travel distances involved would affect its commitment to reduce its carbon footprint.

The expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, resulting in an increase from 64 to 104 matches, has also influenced its thinking. Despite this rise the BBC's matches will be shown on its main channels rather than on iPlayer, with UK rights shared with ITV.

The BBC and The Rest is Football declined to comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Long Beach Post News


					Long Beach's most read source for local news, investigative reports, arts & culture, food, business, sports, and real-estate.				

The final list of fan zones for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is in. And despite much hype earlier this month from the mayor, Long Beach is not on it.

The international soccer federation announced Wednesday nine World Cup Fan Zones held between June and July — including Downey, Venice Beach and Los Angeles — that will host celebrations to punctuate the 39-day tournament's eight local matches at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.

The zones are intended as places of national pride and celebration, including a live broadcast and refreshments for fans as the U.S. national team plays its first game against Paraguay on June 12.

Other themed events, soccer clinics, a mobile bus tour and a five-day festival in mid-June at Los Angeles Memorial Stadium are also planned.

But an official fan zone will not take place in Long Beach, according to local organizers.

Steve Brenner, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host Committee, said in a call Wednesday that Long Beach withdrew its bid for an official fan zone in December following a series of talks with organizers. When asked, Brenner said he didn't know why the city pulled out.

Given the timing, it wasn't immediately clear why the mayor announced that the city would host one of these celebrations at the State of the City in January with an image of a FIFA World Cup trophy in the backdrop.

A news release from the mayor's office described it as an “official FIFA World Cup Fan Zone” that was paid for using a $378,000 grant from Los Angeles Metro.

Richardson described the event as a “live, two-week activation on Pine Avenue” he hoped would draw thousands of visitors.  A spokesperson for the mayor's office later said the Long Beach event is still planned but will be called a “World Cup celebration.” When asked to elaborate, she said she did not have any more information.

When asked for details, city spokesman Kevin Lee said in a statement that instead of a “single, centralized Fan Zone,” the city will host a series of events in several neighborhoods. An approach, he said, that is more flexible and will “maximize community benefit.”

Official zones are established through a formal licensing process bounded by agreements between the city, host committee and FIFA to use their likeness for branding.

According to Brenner, committee officials reached out to the city shortly after the address, warning it cannot use any official FIFA or committee branding, including the logo or term “World Cup Fan Zone” without prior approval.

The host committee, he said, “remains committed to working collaboratively with the city of Long Beach and other cities and community partners to celebrate the World Cup responsibly.”

The World Cup begins June 11 with an opening match in Mexico City, followed by matches in Los Angeles and Toronto the next day. Matches continue through a group stage in June and tournament in July, finished with a championship match at MetLife Stadium on July 19.

It's expected to bring $892 million in increased spending across L.A. County.

Los Angeles

In addition to hosting eight matches, L.A. will be home to a bunch of major fan events across the city.

Don't have the cash to score tickets to the FIFA World Cup? While it won't be quite the same as having a seat right on the pitch, the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host Committee has announced a slate of major watch parties for this June and July's matches, as well as a handful of community celebrations that lead up to the 39-day tournament.

This summer's World Cup shares its hosting duties across 16 cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada; here in L.A., all eight locally-staged matches will be held at SoFi Stadium, including the United States men's national soccer team opener on June 12. But arguably the main hub of activity for the opening weekend of the tournament will be over at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Held from June 11 to 15, the FIFA Fan Festival there will feature live match broadcasts, concerts and food; we don't know yet exactly how the ticketing process will work, but expect more details to be released in early March.

If the Coliseum is a trek, there'll also be a rotating slate of fan zones across L.A. County, with official watch parties held from Venice to Downtown L.A. to Pomona. Organizers tell us that some of these events will be free while others will have a nominal fee; in any case, the objective here is to get as many Angelenos swept up in the World Cup as possible.

The Original Farmers Market (Fairfax): June 18–21City of Downey: June 20Union Station & LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes (DTLA): June 25–28Hansen Dam Lake (Lake View Terrace): July 2–5Earvin “Magic” Johnson Park (Willowbrook): July 4, 5Whittier Narrows (South El Monte): July 9–11Venice Beach: July 11Fairplex (Pomona): July 14, 15, 18, 19West Harbor (San Pedro): July 14, 15, 18, 19

“Ultimately, everyone will naturally remember what happens on the pitch, but really where the memories are created—the experiences are shared—is off the pitch where people come together and to celebrate the game,” said Ross McCall, FIFA World Cup's executive director of commercial operations, at a press conference on Wednesday. “And right here in Los Angeles is going to be the perfect stage for the world to see how incredible hosts they will be.”

In the lead up to the tournament, the host committee will also hold a series of community events, including 26 soccer clinics for kids; a “Kick It With Us” mobile bus tour toting merch and games that kicks off on March 3 and is set to visit various high-foot-traffic locations; and a volunteer-run community beautification event at Gloria Molina Grand Park on March 14 (with a second event to be announced). L.A. Tourism will be keeping tabs on all of these official events on a World Cup section of its website.

It's been more than three decades since the World Cup has been held in the U.S. (though the FIFA Women's World Cup took place in the U.S. in 1999 and 2003)—and Cobi Jones, the former national team midfielder and current Los Angeles World Cup 2026 community ambassador, looked back fondly on the eight matches held in Pasadena in 1994. “Those matches at the Rose Bowl did more than fill the stadium: They helped changed the trajectory of soccer in the country… creating leagues and creating a passion for this sport,” Jones said. “That's why I'm so excited to welcome the world back into the greatest city on the planet, my hometown of Los Angeles.”

The host committee also unveiled on Wednesday that the World Cup is estimated to bring an $892 million increase in spending across L.A. County, and that a projection of $230 million in media value from future tourism will push that total up to $1.1 billion. Of course, this also comes amid mounting fears of a (probably unlikely) World Cup boycott in the U.S. due to aggressive and, most recently, lethal federal immigration enforcement as well as President Trump's threats to take over Greenland.

Been there, done that? Think again, my friend.

The Premier League secretly removed Ryan Giggs from its inaugural Hall of Fame lineup after he was charged with domestic abuse, fresh reports have revealed. The Manchester United legend was set to be unveiled alongside Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry in 2021, but executives intervened to scrub his name. Despite being cleared in 2023, the 13-time champion remains exiled from the prestigious list.

Giggs was originally scheduled to be one of the first three inductees into the Premier League Hall of Fame when the concept was launched five years ago. According to The Telegraph, the ex-Manchester United winger - the most decorated player in the competition's history - had been selected to headline the 2021 launch alongside goalscoring greats Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry.

However, the celebratory plans were hastily redrawn behind closed doors. League executives reportedly made the decision to ""secretly axe"" Giggs from the marketing materials and induction list after it became clear that legal proceedings against him were escalating. With the Premier League keen to establish the Hall of Fame as a wholesome celebration of footballing excellence, chiefs determined that including the Welshman would create a PR disaster that would overshadow the entire project.

Consequently, when the Hall of Fame was officially unveiled, only Shearer and Henry were inducted as the founding members. Giggs' name was quietly removed from the conversation, and he was not included in the subsequent fan votes that saw fellow United stars like Eric Cantona, Roy Keane and David Beckham honoured later that year.

The decision to withdraw Giggs' invitation was triggered by his arrest in November 2020 on suspicion of assaulting his former girlfriend, Kate Greville, and her younger sister. He was subsequently charged with assault and controlling or coercive behaviour, leading to a high-profile legal battle that effectively paused his career in football.

The timeline of the case clashed directly with the Hall of Fame's rollout. Giggs stood trial in 2022, but the jury was discharged after failing to reach a verdict. A retrial was scheduled, but in July 2023, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) formally withdrew the charges after Ms Greville decided she did not want to give evidence again.

A judge formally entered ""not guilty"" verdicts on all counts, clearing Giggs' name in the eyes of the law. However, the lengthy nature of the proceedings meant that for the first three years of the Hall of Fame's existence, Giggs was considered ""persona non grata"" by the organisers. The Premier League's decision to remove him in 2021 was a damage-limitation exercise designed to protect the brand, but it has created a long-term precedent that they have yet to reverse.

Despite being legally cleared more than two years ago, Giggs remains conspicuously absent from the Hall of Fame in 2026. His continued exclusion has created a statistical anomaly that grows more glaring with each passing induction ceremony. Giggs holds the record for the most Premier League titles won (13) and the most assists in the competition's history (162) - a figure that remains comfortably clear of his nearest challengers.

His appearance record (632) is second only to Gareth Barry, yet he has not even appeared on a shortlist for public voting since the legal case concluded. While his teammates from the Class of '92 have been celebrated, the man who played in every single one of Sir Alex Ferguson's title-winning campaigns remains on the outside looking in.

The continued snub has drawn ire from Giggs' camp, who believe the league is unfairly punishing a man who was acquitted by the courts. The situation boiled over recently when the 2025 shortlist was announced - once again without Giggs' name.

His brother, Rhodri Giggs, took to social media to brand the Hall of Fame a ""sham,"" highlighting Ryan's unparalleled trophy cabinet and using the hashtag #TheShamHallOfFame.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Premier League clubs on red alert after Crystal Palace near agreement to sign Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/jean-philippe-mateta-on-the-move-premier-league-clubs-on-red-alert-after-crystal-palace-near-agreement-to-sign-wolves-striker-jorgen-strand-larsen/blte63d6b4f43e1c0cb","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:53:17 GMT","

Crystal Palace are closing in on a blockbuster deal to sign Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen, a move that may trigger a major transfer merry-go-round in the Premier League. The Eagles have moved ahead of Leeds in the race for the Norwegian, paving the way for Jean-Philippe Mateta to leave Selhurst Park before the window shuts.

Crystal Palace are on the verge of securing their primary target for the winter transfer window, with The Athletic reporting that the club is close to reaching a verbal agreement for Wolves striker Strand Larsen. The south London club are determined to strengthen their attacking line before the deadline and appears to have found their man in the 25-year-old Norway international.

Negotiations are reportedly at an advanced stage regarding both the transfer fee and personal terms, although an official bid has not yet been formally submitted to the Molineux hierarchy. The deal under discussion is understood to be a significant financial package, structured as an initial £45 million fee with a further £5m in potential add-ons.

Agent Jorge Mendes is handling the negotiations on behalf of Wolves, who find themselves in a precarious position at the bottom of the Premier League table. While the deal is not yet signed and sealed, the rapid progress in talks suggests that Palace are confident of landing the tall centre-forward to lead their line for the second half of the campaign.

The development comes as a bitter blow to Leeds, who have been aggressive in their pursuit of Strand Larsen throughout the window. The Elland Road club saw multiple offers - peaking at £40m - rejected by Wolves. It is reported that the player himself was open to the switch, with his agent, a boyhood Leeds supporter, keen to facilitate a move to Yorkshire.

However, Leeds have drawn a line in the sand regarding the valuation. They do not intend to increase their bid beyond the £40m mark at present, effectively ruling themselves out of the race as Palace stepped up with a superior financial package.

This hesitation from the Whites has allowed Crystal Palace to manoeuvre into pole position. With the financial muscle to meet Wolves' demands, the Eagles have seemingly hijacked a move that Leeds fans had hoped would reignite their own season, leaving the path clear for Oliver Glasner's side to finalise the transfer.

Strand Larsen's stock has risen significantly since his arrival in English football. He enjoyed a standout debut campaign in the Premier League during the 2024-25 season, recording an impressive 14 goals and five assists across 38 appearances. Despite Wolves' collective struggles this term - they currently sit rock bottom of the league - the Norwegian has managed to contribute six goals and two assists in all competitions.

His contract at Molineux runs until June 2030, with an option for a further 12 months, which placed Wolves in a strong negotiating position. The striker was subject to even larger proposals from Newcastle last summer, all of which were turned down, and has attracted admiration from clubs in Italy, Spain and the Saudi Pro League. However, the pressing need for funds and the player's desire for a new challenge seems to have finally convinced Wolves to cash in.

The arrival of Strand Larsen at Selhurst Park is expected to have immediate ramifications for the current Palace squad, specifically paving the way for Mateta to depart. The France international, whose contract expires in June 2027, is now considered available for transfer as the club looks to balance the books and refresh their front line.

Palace are seeking a package worth approximately £40m for the 28-year-old, a valuation that has put several clubs on high alert. Nottingham Forest have already made their move, lodging an offer of £35m for the striker who was pivotal for Palace last season.

Interest is not limited to the Premier League, however. European giants are also monitoring the situation, with AC Milan keen on bringing Mateta to Serie A, while Juventus had previously explored the possibility earlier in the window. With Strand Larsen's arrival imminent, the final days of the window could see a scramble for Mateta's signature as Palace look to execute a ""one in, one out"" strategy.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Jose Mourinho admits he was initially unaware that Benfica required a fourth goal against Real Madrid in order to reach the Champions League play-offs, before seeing goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin score in the 98th minute. Mourinho has also revealed that he apologised to Blancos boss Alvaro Arbeloa for his wild celebrations that accompanied a dramatic header.

There was a remarkable twist in the tale late on at Estadio da Luz, with Portuguese giants Benfica keeping their European dreams alive in stunning fashion. A topsy-turvy encounter saw Mourinho's side fall behind - as Kylian Mbappe netted the first of his two efforts on the night - before taking a 3-1 lead early in the second half.

Former Real, Manchester United and Chelsea boss Mourinho thought that a one-goal advantage was enough to secure his team a top-24 finish, with substitutions being made in a bid to “close the door”.

He was then made aware that another goal was required, with his Ukrainian keeper being the man to deliver a vital effort deep into stoppage-time as he rose highest inside a crowded penalty area to glance the ball beyond opposite number Thibaut Courtois.

Mourinho told Movistar afterwards: “I think we deserved it, we really deserved it. Kylian had two chances, and scored two goals. For Benfica, it's incredibly prestigious to beat Real Madrid. It's fantastic.”

He went on to tell Paramount+ of the confusion which ultimately delivered late drama: “When I made the last changes, [Franjo] Ivanovic and [Antonio] Silva, I was told [the scoreline] is enough, so let's close the door.

“A few seconds later, then they tell me we need one more goal, but I cannot make more changes. That was the lucky point, to get the free kick, to allow us to go there with the big guy.

“I've won and lost many matches, but I had never won one with my goalkeeper scoring in the last minute. I thought I had seen everything in football, but in the end, I hadn't.”

Trubin was also unaware that a contribution from him was required at the opposite end of the field to the one that he usually operates in. He said: “I didn't know what we needed. Then I saw everyone telling me to go up. I also saw our coach, so I went up, went into the box, and I don't know ... I don't know what to say. Crazy moment. I don't know what to say. I'm not used to scoring. I'm 24 years old and it's the first time. Unbelievable.”

Unsurprisingly, Benfica's players and coaching staff allowed emotion to get the better of them after seeing Trubin put the finishing touches to a 4-2 win. Mourinho has become famed down the years for his celebratory antics on the touchline.

He did not mean any disrespect to his former employers from Madrid, saying of efforts to clear the air with his coaching rivals: “I apologised for how I celebrated, but Álvaro is a football man and understands that in that moment you get carried away.”

Benfica ended the league phase in 24th place, with just one effort in the goal difference department separating them from Ligue 1 giants Marseille. They will now face either Real Madrid again or another of Mourinho's former clubs, Inter, in the play-offs - with those two teams occupying ninth and 10th spots respectively.

“I'm not thinking about myself, I'm thinking about the players and the club. For them, playing a knockout tie against Real Madrid or Inter is a fantastic opportunity,” Mourinho, who admits that he has not been back to Santiago Bernabeu since leaving a prominent managerial post in 2013, said.

The play-off draw, with eight spots in the last 16 of Champions League competition still up for grabs, will take place at UEFA's headquarters in Switzerland on Friday. The teams finishing 17th through 24th, which includes Mourinho's Benfica, will be unseeded.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chelsea have reached a full agreement to send teenage sensation Kendry Paez on loan to River Plate after cutting short his spell in Ligue 1. The 18-year-old has been recalled from Strasbourg to join the Argentine giants immediately, with the Blues sanctioning the move to ensure their prized asset secures regular first-team football under Marcelo Gallardo.

The future of one of South America's brightest talents has been resolved swiftly by Chelsea's hierarchy. According to Fabrizio Romano, the Blues have formally agreed a season-long loan deal with River Plate, which will see the Ecuadorian midfielder ply his trade at the Estadio Mas Monumental. Having initially placed Paez at their sister club Strasbourg to acclimate to European football, the decision to pivot to the high-pressure environment of Argentine football suggests a desire to see him compete for trophies immediately. The loan agreement is understood to cover the 2026 South American season, giving Paez the platform to play consistently in both the Argentine Primera Division and the prestigious Copa Libertadores.

The decision to recall the midfielder from France was driven by a lack of consistent opportunities at the Stade de la Meinau. Since joining Strasbourg in the summer of 2025, he has managed just four starts in Ligue 1 across the first half of the campaign. While he made 15 appearances in all competitions, his development was deemed to be stalling due to insufficient minutes on the pitch.

Romano reports that another key factor in the recall is the arrival of new talents at Strasbourg. As part of the BlueCo multi-club model, the French side are set to integrate fresh recruits during this window, which would have further engaged the competition for places in the attacking midfield roles. Chelsea officials, monitoring the situation from Cobham, decided that keeping Paez in a rotational role in Alsace would be detrimental to his growth. The recall allows Strasbourg to focus on their incoming reinforcements while freeing Paez to join a squad where he is expected to take on a more protagonist role.

Chelsea view the Buenos Aires club as the ideal solution for the next phase of the teenager's career, largely due to the presence of manager Gallardo. The legendary coach, who extended his contract until December 2026, has a proven track record of developing creative talents such as Enzo Fernandez and Julian Alvarez and preparing them for the physical and tactical demands of elite football.

Moving to River offers Paez a competitive environment that mirrors the intensity of top European leagues but remains culturally closer to home. The prospect of playing under ""El Muneco"" was reportedly a decisive factor for Chelsea. They believe Gallardo's demanding style will help reprogramme the youngster's work rate and tactical discipline, much as it did for previous River exports who have thrived in the Premier League.

This transfer highlights the fluidity of Chelsea's loan management under the BlueCo ownership. The original plan to fast-track Paez through the French league has been abandoned in favour of a more bespoke solution. It is a bold call, particularly given that current Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior spent the first half of the season managing Paez at Strasbourg. Rosenior's firsthand knowledge of the player likely informed the decision that a change of scenery was necessary for him to flourish.

The spotlight in Argentina will be intense as the player, once touted as a generational talent since his breakthrough at Independiente del Valle, swaps the relegation battles of Ligue 1 for the title chases of South America.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arsenal are reportedly in talks to sign Ona Batlle in the summer when her Barcelona contract expires. The Gunners have a wealth of options at full-back, including Smilla Holmberg, Taylor Hinds, Katie McCabe, and Emily Fox but it appears they have their sights set on the 26-year-old. Barcelona are at risk of losing Batlle and team-mate Alexia Putellas, who are both out of contract at the end of the season.

Batlle began her career at Barcelona but after being unable to break into their first team, she moved to Madrid CFF in 2017. From there, she made the switch to Levante in 2018 before signing for Manchester United two years later. But after three years with the Women's Super League outfit, an opportunity to return to the Blaugrana proved too good a chance to turn down. 

In 2023, she said: ""I left with the mindset I could come back. For me, Barca has always been in my heart and it's not easy to say no.""

Since re-joining Barca, Batlle has made a big impression, helping them win Liga F twice, the Champions League once, and two Copa de la Reinas. But, it seems, this may be her last season at the club.

According to The Athletic, Arsenal are trying to sign Batlle but a deal has not yet been agreed. Discussions are ongoing over the Spain international, who can play on either side of defence. Batlle has made 19 appearances in all competitions this season but her days at the club may be numbered. This comes at a time when Barca, due to their financial constraints, may also risk losing star player Putellas as they reportedly don't have the funds to renew these deals. From Arsenal's perspective, McCabe is out of contract this summer, but Batlle is an inverted full-back, rather than an out-and-out left-back.

After leading Arsenal to Champions League glory, Slegers took the next step to solidify her position with the Gunners by signing a deal until 2029 earlier in January. The 36-year-old became the club's interim coach in October 2024 before getting the role full-time in 2025. Incidentally, new deals like this could attract players, such as Batlle, to the club.

The Dutchwoman said: ""From playing in the academy and being in the stands watching Arsenal win the Champions League in 2007, to living it with our players, staff and supporters last summer, I'm immensely proud to have shared this journey with Arsenal, a club that means so much to me and to so many people. I'm delighted to have signed a new contract here, as I believe we have so much to achieve together – this season and in the years to come. I'd like to show my gratitude to our supporters for the incredible backing you give us, whether it's at Emirates Stadium, Meadow Park or on the road. We hear it, we see it and we feel it every day.""

Before a possible Batlle signing takes place, Arsenal are looking forward to the inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup final against Corinthians on Sunday. The Gunners have already guaranteed themselves at least £725,000 to make it to the showpiece event but Slegers is more interested in the trophy than the £1.67m winning check.

""We want to win a trophy,"" Slegers said. ""That's what the players play for, so that will be on our minds on Sunday, that we're really close now. We're one game away from a trophy. What's important is that there's investments in so many ways in women's football so we can make more things possible. We can in all facets, development of young players, referees, coaching, everything. That's of course where money starts to play a role, so it's good that there's more and more money in the game.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Kylian Mbappe has accused his Real Madrid team-mates of lacking “desire”, with the Blancos looking anything but a “team of champions” when suffering a costly European defeat at Benfica. An “embarrassing” goal was conceded there, to the home side's keeper, and the Liga giants will now have to navigate their way through the Champions League knockout play-offs.

A top-eight finish in the league phase would have secured automatic passage to the last 16, but lines were fluffed in spectacular fashion in Lisbon. Real, who are working under interim coach Alvaro Arbeloa following the sacking of Xabi Alonso, rarely looked like getting the job done at Estadio da Luz.

They did take the lead, as Mbappe bagged the first of his two goals on the night, but trailed by half-time and were always chasing the game from there. Benfica, with former Blancos boss Jose Mourinho at the helm, ultimately prevailed 4-2.

A 98th minute header from keeper Anatoliy Turbin saw them sneak into the play-offs, while Real were condemned to ninth place and may have to go through Benfica again in order to keep their dreams of continental glory alive.

Mbappe was less than impressed by what he witnessed in Portugal, with the World Cup-winning Frenchman telling reporters: “It isn't about quality, and it isn't about tactics. It's about having more desire than your opponent.

“You could see that everything was on the line for Benfica, and you couldn't see that for us, and that's a problem. Before the game, both teams had something to play for: us being in the top eight, and Benfica being among the 24. We saw it from Benfica, but you didn't see it from us.

“I don't have a clear explanation. It wasn't the same [at Benfica] as against Villarreal, and that's a problem. We aren't being consistent in our play. We have to solve that. We can't do it one day, and then not another. A team of champions doesn't do that. We have two more games, and that hurts a bit. We wanted to have time in February to work on our play, and instead we'll play the play-offs.”

Mbappe went on to say, with the 27-year-old clearly irked by Real's lack of consistency - with a humbling Copa del Rey defeat at Albacete being followed by two La Liga victories and a 6-1 mauling of Monaco in Europe: “What we did today was not normal. We had a clear goal of finishing in the top eight to have two fewer games and lighten the load, but we started very poorly.

“They deserved to score first. We had one chance and scored. I thought that would get us into the game, but it was the opposite. They were better and if they had gone into the break 5-1 up, it wouldn't have surprised anyone.

“We came out with the intention of changing what had happened. We conceded a goal that hurts a little because it came from a direct play, and from there the game was over. When you're a goal down, you try to push, but the opponent wastes time and that's part of the game. We didn't set the pace or show enough creativity to create clear chances.”

Mbappe said of seeing Ukrainian keeper Turbin find the back of the net: ”The fourth goal doesn't change anything, but it's a bit embarrassing.”

Reports in Spain, from ABC Sports, claim that Mbappe is growing “increasingly irritated by what he sees as an irresponsible attitude from some of his team-mates during a season that is starting to unravel at key moments”.

He demands the highest standards of himself, with 36 goals being recorded this season through 29 appearances, and expects others to tow the same line. That has not always been the case in a campaign that has delivered more change off the field and some uncomfortable questions on it.

Real will discover the identity of their play-off opponents - either Benfica or Bodo/Glimt - when the draw takes place on Friday. They will then be back in domestic action on Sunday when playing host to Rayo Vallecano.

Kylian Mbappe has seen a Premier League move speculated on for some time, and fellow Frenchman Bacary Sagna has told GOAL why Arsenal could be the perfect landing spot if ties are ever severed with Real Madrid. Mbappe is living his professional dream in Spain for now, but a day might come in which he fancies packing his bags for the English top-flight.

While on the books of Paris Saint-Germain, Mbappe was regularly linked with heavyweight outfits in the Premier League. Manchester City boast the financial muscle to make any transfer deal possible.

Liverpool have also been flying high of late, and Anfield has been mooted as a potential future port of call for one of the most fearsome forwards on the planet. Mbappe is said to have spoken with the Reds when heading towards the exits at PSG.

He left them as the club's all-time leading goalscorer, having found the target on 235 occasions, and was able to land a lucrative contract in Spain as no fee had to change hands after reaching free agency.

Mbappe had never shied away from the fact that he wanted to become a ‘Galactico' at Santiago Bernabeu at some point in his career. Remarkable individual standards have been maintained in Madrid, with 80 goals recorded for Real through just 88 appearances.

He is tied to a contract through to the summer of 2029, and will have turned 30 by then, but a new challenge may still appeal. Ambitious teams in England will forever hold interest in players of Mbappe's ilk.

Quizzed on whether the World Cup winner could end up at one of his former employers - such as Arsenal or Manchester City - ex-France international Sagna, speaking in association with Parimatch Online Casino, told GOAL: “If he joined the Premier League, I think Arsenal would suit him. 

“All of the players are kind of the same age, dynamic, young. Arsenal players are fast. If you look at the front line you have [Bukayo] Saka, who is very fast, you have [Eberechi] Eze, who is powerful and fast. You have speed and enjoyment. Arsenal suits him the most in England.

“I'm not sure it's going to happen. I don't think it is ever going to happen because he might retire in Europe with Real Madrid. He has the same kind of speed as Thierry Henry and we know how impactful Thierry was in the Premier League with his speed and ability. I think he would do well in England.”

Mbappe did take in a brief stint with Chelsea's youth team at 14 years of age, having been invited over by the Blues to take part in a meeting with London rivals Charlton. No deal was ever done there.

Monaco ended up being the ones to unleash Mbappe on the world, with a switch to PSG being made in the same summer of 2017 as Neymar completed his record-breaking €222 million (£192m/$265m) transfer to Parc des Princes from Barcelona.

Mbappe was being widely tipped at that time to go on and become a Ballon d'Or winner. He is still waiting on a first Golden Ball at the age of 27, but Sagna has tipped him to end that barren run in 2026.

He said of claims to the title of best player on the planet: “He will win it. I think it is the right season for him to win it this year. I think the World Cup will be good with the France national team. 

“I think he will have a good spell in the Champions League with Real Madrid. On a personal level, he is already ahead because he is doing well and standing in the first position. Unless he has a terrible World Cup, which I doubt, I think he will win the Ballon d'Or this season.”

Mbappe is just two goals adrift of Olivier Giroud on France's all-time scoring chart, so should make more history there in 2026. It remains to be seen whether his blistering pace and keen eye for goal will ever illuminate the Premier League in a manner similar to iconic countryman Henry.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The UEFA Champions League league phase played its final round on Tuesday, and there were some dramatic results, notably the game in Lisbon. Benfica secured a sport to the playoffs phase while dragging their opponent, Real Madrid, following a 4-2 victory.

One of the most exciting matches on the UCL final round unexpectedly happened in Lisbon as the Eagles host 15 times winner, Los Blancos. Ahead of that midweek tie, Madrid were sitting in the top eight spot, which guaranteed automatic qualification into the last 16.

Meanwhile, Benfica need a win, and some results go their way just to get into the two-legged playoff round.  The game seems to be heading into Madrid's favor as they went 1-0 up after 30 minutes through their star striker, Kylian Mbappe.

However, Jose Mourinho's men were not prepared to bow down easily as they battled hard and got back on level terms six minutes later following a goal from Andreas Schjelderup. The home side turned things around just before halftime as Vangelis Pavlidis scored from a spot kick.

Madrid tried to get back into the tie, but it was Benfica that netted their third, thanks to Schjelderup's brace. Los Blancos opened the game up again as Mbappe netted his second in the 58th minute, triggering a potential intense battle.

Unfortunately, instead of getting an equalizing goal, Madrid had to finish the game with nine men after Raul Asencio and Rodrygo saw red. Needing one goal to qualify, Benfica were going all in, and in the last minute, they scored the all-important fourth goal through their goalie, Anatoliy Trubin.

The goalkeeper created such a dramatic moment, which gave his team at least another round to play in the Champions League. Interestingly, Benfica and Madrid could match up again in the next round as they are in the same pot.

Meanwhile, other surprising outcomes at UCL saw PSG also drop into the playoff phase after only picking up a 1-1 draw at home against Newcastle United. Vitinha's early goal couldn't give all three points for PSG as the visiting team equalized just before halftime through Joe Willock.

Another shocking result would be Napoli's exit from the competition, as Antonio Conte continues his poor record in Europe. The Partenopei suffered a 3-2 home defeat against Chelsea, with Joao Pedro netting a brace for the Blues.

Conte's men managed only eight points from eight games, a very disappointing record for the Serie A defending champion. This failure means that there are only three Italian teams left in the competition: Inter, Juventus, and Atalanta.

At an Australian Open where the stakes stretch beyond a place in the final, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev collide in Friday's semi-final with vastly different milestones in sight, and their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry finely balanced at 6–6.

Alcaraz, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, is chasing his first Australian Open title, with which he would complete the Career Grand Slam, while for Zverev — a three-time major finalist and last year's runner-up in Melbourne — the stakes centre on a long-awaited maiden Slam trophy.

Their clash is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. local time / 10:30 p.m. EST inside Rod Laver Arena.

Their paths to the semi-finals reflect that contrast. Zverev has been repeatedly tested, dropping a set in four of five matches, while Alcaraz has been clinical throughout, reaching his fourth straight major semi-final — and first in Melbourne — without dropping a set. Alcaraz has since closely tracked both Zverev's level and the toll required to sustain it.

“I've watched his matches through the tournament,” Alcaraz said of Zverev. “It's impressive the level he's been playing so far, so it's going to be a great battle. I know that he's serving pretty well. He's playing really solid and aggressive when he can in the rallies from the baseline.

“I will be ready, for sure. I'm excited about playing him here [at the] AO in a semi-final. I know what I have to do. I will be well prepared for that match. If he wants to beat me, he has to sweat a lot.”

Alcaraz's quarter-final win over Alex de Minaur showcased his growing control in Melbourne, lifting his intensity after a tight opening set through heavier ball striking and disciplined aggression. These are traits he will again rely on to drag Zverev into physical exchanges.

Zverev's run has been powered by his serve. Against Learner Tien, he struck 24 aces and used his first strike to shorten points, a pattern that has defined his tournament and will be central if he is to avoid extended rallies.

The semi-final may hinge on whether Alcaraz can stretch Zverev and prolong exchanges, or whether Zverev can impose his serve and draw on his experience at this stage in Melbourne — including last year's final — in a setting that remains new territory for Alcaraz at the Australian Open.

“I actually feel like top players feel the most pressure in the beginning, not having an early exit,” Zverev said before he knew the outcome of Alcaraz and De Minaur's quarter-final. “Now, whoever I'm going to play in the semis, Carlos or Alex, they're great players. You just are looking forward to a fantastic match. That's what you are looking forward to.

“Of course, in my case, I'm still chasing that desired Slam. I still want to achieve that, but I also want to enjoy my tennis. Right now I'm doing that, and that's the most important thing for me.”

With history beckoning on both sides, a rivalry locked at 6–6, and contrasting strengths poised to collide, this Australian Open semi-final shapes as a test of strategy, stamina and nerve.

Sabalenka bests Svitolina to reach fourth straight Australian Open final","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4441201/back-again-aryna-sabalenka-bests-elina-svitolina-to-reach-her-fourth-straight-australian-open-final","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:42:34 GMT","

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka advanced to her fourth straight Australian Open final, defeating Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3. The 2023 and 2024 champion reaches her eighth Grand Slam final overall and will face Elena Rybakina in a rematch of the 2023 Australian Open final.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Aryna Sabalenka has made the Australian Open final a familiar destination.

With a 6-2, 6-3 semifinal win over Elina Svitolina, the World No. 1 reached the championship match in Melbourne for the fourth straight year and the eighth Grand Slam final of her career. She has done so without dropping a set, matching her title runs in 2023 and 2024, when she eventually won the trophy. 

""Right now my mentality is like I'm ready to do whatever -- [whoever] is going to be in that finals -- I'm ready to go out there and fight with what I have and do everything I can,"" Sabalenka said to press.

""I think when I have this mentality, I play my best tennis, and I'm there, I'm fighting, I have my opportunities. So that's my approach to the finals this season.""

She now improves to 6-1 against Svitolina on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz and will meet Elena Rybakina in the final. It's a rematch of the 2023 Australian Open final, which Sabalenka won in a comeback 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Sabalenka has also reached the last seven Grand Slam finals on hard court, dating back to 2023.

""I think her shots are heavy, deep, flat balls,"" Sabalenka said of Rybakina. ""It's not easy to work with, but yeah, we have a great history. She's incredible player. We had a lot of great battles, a lot of finals we played. I'm looking forward to battle this power.""

As for Svitolina, she reached her fourth Grand Slam semifinal but is still seeking her first trip to a major final. The Ukrainian opened her 2026 season in Auckland, where she won the title, and the loss to Sabalenka was her first defeat of the year. She is projected to return to the top 10 in the PIF WTA Rankings.

Sabalenka's power game dominated Svitolina when she was on the return. In the first game, after trailing 15-40, Sabalenka won four straight points -- three of them winners -- to save the break points and hold serve. She landed 67% of her first serves, winning nearly 70% of her first-service points. 

Frequently, Sabalenka's serve would stretch the Ukrainian wide allowing Sabalenka plenty of open space for a winner. Other times, Svitolina's returns would go long in an attempt to counter the World No. 1, who finished with 29 winners to Svitolina's 17 unforced errors.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

The first break went to Sabalenka. It didn't come without some minor controversy, however. On the opening point, the chair umpire called a hindrance violation on Sabalenka -- who requested a video review -- for saying something aloud ahead of Svitolina's return. Despite her argument, the call remained in favor of Svitolina, who shortly thereafter had her shot of the match with a forehand dig after Sabalenka hit a drop shot to spark the Rod Laver Arena crowd. 

That brief stint would be short-lived after Sabalenka struck with the break, even saving a game point of Svitolina's in the deuce, taking a 3-1 lead. The four-time Grand Slam champion earned her second break after trading holds for three games to secure the first set 6-2. 

The Ukrainian found herself in the same situation to begin the second set as she did the first -- with a break-point opportunity. This time, she capitalized and then won four straight points the next game, capped off with a fortunate net cord winner, to hold and have a 2-0 lead in the second set.

But that break and hold must've ignited a fire in Sabalenka, who won the next 12-of-13 points, recapturing the set with a 3-2 lead. The Sabalenka-winner to Svitolina-error story returned as the World No. 1 had five winners in the stretch to seven Svitolina errors, and interestingly, Sabalenka won 8-of-10 points of rallies that went nine shots or longer. 

""To be fair, I thought I was returning today also quite well,"" Svitolina said. ""I think my serve was not great at all.

""I think I was returning good, but then her second shot was unbelievable. She was returning well, quick, and then she had another punch coming, the second shot after her serve. I mean, that's why she's World No. 1.""

The point that really sunk any signs of hope for Svitolina came in the ensuing game. Leading 40-30, it was a must-hold point for Svitolina, but despite matching Sabalenka's power on almost every shot in the intense rally, she knew she mishit her final forehand that went wide-left. A small scream with a palm to the face -- not too mention the double fault to give Sabalenka the advantage -- summed up the night the best as Sabalenka broke Svitolina's serve to go up 4-2.

""I was not putting enough pressure on her with my serve, so of course, you know, when you play players like that, you don't have too much time to waste,"" Svitolina said. 

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka advanced to her fourth straight Australian Open final, defeating Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3. The 2023 and 2024 champion reaches her eighth Grand Slam final overall and will face Elena Rybakina in a rematch of the 2023 Australian Open final.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Elise Mertens and Zhang Shuai joined Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic in the Australian Open women's doubles final with a straight-sets win over Ena Shibahara and Vera Zvonareva. Danilina and Krunic defeated Gabriela Dabrowski and Luisa Stefani in three sets earlier Thursday evening to book their own spot in the championship match.

The Australian Open women's doubles final is set, with No. 4 seeds Elise Mertens and Zhang Shuai facing No. 7 seeds Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic.

Mertens and Zhang, runners-up at Wimbledon in 2022, raced through their semifinal, defeating Ena Shibahara and Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 6-2 in 1 hour and 21 minutes on Margaret Court Arena to reach their second Grand Slam final as a team.

“Really great performance,” Mertens said after the match. “I think we're really there as a team. Communication was there, and I felt like today everything kind of worked. But you know, it's been a great tournament so far, so tomorrow (we'll) have a day off or a day of practice and then on to the finals.”

Earlier Thursday evening, Danilina and Krunic outlasted the new pairing of Gabriela Dabrowski and Luisa Stefani 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena, winning in nearly two and a half hours to advance to their second Major final together. They were runners-up at the French Open last year.

The marathon victory followed their upset of No. 1 seeds and defending champions Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend in the previous round.

“I feel like this match had everything in it,” Krunic said in their on-court interview. “(So many) ups and downs. Luisa and Gaby, they played a great match. It's always tough to play against them, and I mean, obviously it was emotional. We just tried to hang in there, especially being a break down in the third, and it worked out for us well.”

Mertens and Zhang saved three match points in their second-round win over Iva Jovic and Victoria Mboko.

“We kind of were fighting, at that point, to stay in the tournament, and now we're in the final,” Mertens said. “So you know, anything can happen when you keep on fighting.”

Their path didn't get much easier from there. They rallied from a set down in the quarterfinals to reach the semis, where they were finally rewarded with a more routine victory.

After Shibahara and Zvonareva held for 1-1 in the opening set, Mertens and Zhang reeled off four straight games for a 5-1 lead, where they held set point. They tensed up slightly, dropping serve as the lead shrank to 5-3, but held at love to close out the set. The second set followed a similar pattern, as the No. 4 seeds surged ahead 5-0, were broken while serving for the match, before quickly regaining their composure.

Zhang took control late, setting up and converting their third match point to book their place in the final.

“This is our second time playing together at a Grand Slam and (now) second final,” Zhang said with a smile. “Oh my God, we should keep playing (together) forever.”

Danilina and Krunic raced to a 5-2 lead in the opening set, lost it, then regrouped in time to take the tiebreak. Dabrowski and Stefani responded in the second set, as the sides traded holds to 3-3 before the topsy-turvy pattern of the match continued, with the Canadian-Brazilian duo winning the final three games to force a decider.

They carried that momentum into the third, breaking and consolidating for a 2-0 lead. But shortly after a brief delay to close the roof due to rain, Danilina and Krunic broke back, leveling the set at 3-3.

The No. 7 seeds earned another break for 5-3 but were immediately broken while serving for the match. They answered in fitting fashion with a break to love, sealing the win with a remarkable rally.

“They were confusing me from the first point,” Krunic said. “I tried to think about my own game; what I'm supposed to do, what comes from my racket, but they're a very energetic team. They move well at the net, and they know how to play doubles.

“Today was a very different match for us, and I'm happy that at the very end we found that extra energy to be in Saturday's final.”

There isn't much past history to draw from when dissecting this matchup, but all four players bring significant doubles success to the final:

Danilina: Career-high No. 8; 2023 US Open mixed doubles champion; 2022 Australian Open and 2025 French Open runner-up; 2024 Wuhan Open champion; 11 WTA titles

Krunic: Career-high No. 17; 2025 French Open runner-up; eight WTA titles

Mertens: Former World No. 1; five-time Grand Slam champion; 2022 and 2025 WTA Finals champion; seven WTA 1000 titles; 23 WTA titles

Zhang: Career-high No. 2; 2019 Australian Open champion; 2021 US Open champion; 2021 Cincinnati Open champion; 16 WTA titles

Both pairs enter Saturday's final one win away from their first Major title together, a breakthrough that would cement their rapidly growing résumés.

Oscar Piastri reflects on first drive of the 2026 McLaren at Barcelona Shakedown

McLaren's Mark Temple talks about 'positives' to takeaway from Barcelona Shakedown

After Red Bull's running across the opening two days of the Barcelona Shakedown, Team Principal Laurent Mekies shared his thoughts.

Laurent Mekies admitted that it was a “very special moment” for Red Bull to run with their own power unit for the first time during the Barcelona Shakedown, with the Team Principal adding that he is “proud” of the squad for the work that has gone into the project.

The Milton Keynes-based outfit were amongst those to hit the track during the first day of the event at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, as Isack Hadjar got behind the wheel of the RB22. They went on to put in further mileage during mixed conditions on Tuesday, this time sharing driving duties between Max Verstappen in the morning and Hadjar later on.

Following Day 2 of the shakedown, Mekies shared his thoughts on the team's running so far and spoke about how it felt to see the new challenger head out onto the circuit on Monday morning, ahead of the squad's first season with their own Red Bull Ford Powertrains power unit.

“We knew it would be a very special moment to be here for the first time with the RB22 with our own power unit, so it came with that special atmosphere and tensions,” said Mekies.

“The last few months and weeks have been incredibly hectic to be ready, but ultimately we were ready on Monday morning to run. I can only take the opportunity to say a big thank you and well done to everybody back in Milton Keynes, chassis-side, power unit-side, because it was incredible to see the car going out at a few minutes past nine on Monday morning with our own power unit.

“We knew we have to do our homework and we have to do it step by step. Nonetheless, we got quite a few laps yesterday with Isack, which was a positive day, starting to learn the power unit, starting to learn the car.”

In terms of the running on Day 2, where Hadjar experienced a crash in the damp conditions, Mekies continued: “Today the weather was a bit more difficult, and Max drove in the morning. We only got one run of dry running before the rain came. It's part of the game, we felt anyway that it was interesting to run in the rain also with these regulations.

“Obviously everything is new, and we knew we would have a lot of work to do. That's what we've done, and then switching to Isack in the afternoon, again no chance for dry tyres but some good learning on the wet and in the right way. But what is important is that Isack is okay, and we will try our best to repair the car and to see what's coming next.”

Mekies went on to further praise the team at Red Bull's headquarters for ensuring that the new power unit would be ready in time for the Barcelona Shakedown.

“I have to say, in terms of what we were expecting from the power unit on these first couple of days, I can only repeat how proud we are from everybody back at base to have managed to give us something that we can actually run with,” he explained.

“Of course it's very early days and of course nothing is perfect, but we could run, we could start to learn, work as one team, so that was a huge satisfaction. It doesn't change the size of the journey in front of us, but certainly it's a first moment that everybody in MK should be proud of.”

Mekies hailed Monday as a “very, very positive day” in terms of the number of laps completed by Hadjar, as well as in regards to the youngster's “learning and development and feedback to the engineers”.

“Early days, but a great energy in the team, great spirits between Max and Isack and the whole team,” Mekies added. “We just can't wait to have the next possibility to run but, as I said, it's something we are trying to analyse now and hopefully we get some answers later on.”

With teams permitted to run on three days across the five available to them in Barcelona, Red Bull have now completed two of those days.

Looking at what the squad's checklist holds for the remainder of the event, Mekies smiled: “The checklist is too long to be completed in just a few days in Barcelona, so it's always going to be a matter of priority and trying to be flexible and adapt your programme as difficulties come out, or in terms of when you find an interesting direction that you should pursue.

“The priority right now as we speak tonight is to assess the damage on the car and to see what it gives to us in terms of opportunities to run in the next day. We only have one day left, so we have to make sure we play that card carefully and it's an analysis that will take still a few hours.”

McLaren's Mark Temple talks about 'positives' to takeaway from Barcelona Shakedown

Lewis Hamilton offered up some initial thoughts on the SF-26 after Ferrari hit the track in Barcelona.

Lewis Hamilton echoed team mate Charles Leclerc's positive early sentiments after Ferrari completed their first running of the Barcelona Shakedown on Tuesday.

Following on from a demo outing at Fiorano last week, Ferrari gave the SF-26 its first proper pre-season mileage at the Spanish venue – Leclerc running in the morning session and Hamilton taking over for the afternoon.

Some of Leclerc's mileage was racked up in dry conditions, before rain arrived and persisted for the remainder of the day, meaning all of Hamilton's laps came on a wet track.

Giving his assessment after jumping out of the car, Hamilton said: “Very challenging today, because it started raining at 10.30am – obviously Charles had a little bit of dry running then it's been wet all afternoon.

“Figuring out how to get the tyres working was really productive – I think we got 120 laps or something like that. Given it's in the wet conditions and we had a red flag, I think that's pretty solid, so I'm really proud of everyone back at the factory for getting the car to this point.

“We got a lot of information on the car today – we definitely need to keep it up, [there's] lots and lots to do, but a good first day.”

Pushed on how satisfying it is for Ferrari to hit the ground running amid such big regulation changes, the seven-time World Champion added: “I mean, it could be so much worse. To get through the day without too many major… there were no major issues, it's just small little increments that we're trying to improve on.

“I think it's great. As I said, we just need to try and get some more days like this.”

Hamilton then shared some thoughts on what lies ahead for himself and Ferrari this week, with teams permitted to run on three of the five Shakedown days.

“Well, I'm hoping to experience the car in the dry, and I think just understanding balance,” he said. “I've not driven it in the dry, so I don't really have a feeling for it. Obviously we drove it in the wet, which is only the front part.

“Then just understanding the deployment. I think deployment's going to be crucial, and understanding that, how to utilise the power, the battery throughout the lap, and recharging, all that kind of stuff.

“I mean, we've done a huge amount of work – everyone's done a huge amount of work on the simulator, so it's not like it's 100 percent brand-new for us. But we still have to go through our sessions and through the data to try and optimise it.”

The ‘Marty Supreme' and ‘I Love LA' star has apologized to fans of the book and revealed that she voluntarily backed out of the film, which is supposed to start shooting in February.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Marty Supreme's rising star Odessa A'zion announced Wednesday night that she has exited Sean Durkin's A24 film Deep Cuts following online backlash to her casting, which was only revealed 48 hours ago. 


	A'zion took to Instagram Stories to tell her fans and followers that she took to heart their comments and concerns about whitewashing the adaptation of Holly Brickley's novel, published in 2023. A'zion was poised to play a character named Zoe Gutierrez, who is described in the book as half Mexican and half Jewish. (In unverified comments shared online, Brickley responded via DM to a fan by saying the character “surely” will be rewritten, “which happens all the time.”)

	“Guys!! I am with ALL of you and I am NOT doing this movie,” the actress posted. “Fuck that. I'm OUT.” She then elaborated: “THANK YOU guys for bringing this to my attention. I AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU! This is why I love you guys. I'm so sorry that this happened. It is SO important for me to let you in on how it all went down: I went in for Percy, but was offered Zoe instead and instantly said yes! I'm so pissed y'all, I hadn't read the book and should have paid more attention to all aspects of Zoe before accepting…and now that I know what I know???”

	A'zion set to star opposite Drew Starkey and Cailee Spaeny in the 2000s-set story about two music obsessed 20-somethings as they chase ambition, belonging and adulthood. Spaeny is set to play music critic Percy with Starkey as a songwriter and love interest.

	











	“I'd never take a role from someone else that's meant to do it. That SHOULD do it! That's not me. There are a plentitude of people more than capable of playing this role and I am NOT one of them,” A'zion concluded. “I can't wait to see who it ends up being.”


	News of her casting was first reported by The Wrap. Per reports, Durkin, who previously directed The Iron Claw and The Nest is set to direct from his own script. He is also producing with Eli Bush, Ronald Bronstein and Josh Safdie with Blake Mills on board for original music.


	In a cover story published on Thursday, A'zion told The Hollywood Reporter's Seija Rankin what kinds of roles she's interested after the breakout success she's experienced as of late. “It's really hard after doing Marty Supreme to think about what I would do next because that was my ultimate goal,” she says. “I guess I just hope to keep playing insane women. I hope I'm never the straight man. I just want the juicy, fucked-up roles. I will play whatever insane character somebody wants me to play.”

Adrian Goiginger's new feature, based on Barbara Pachl-Eberhart's bestselling book, stars Valerie Pachner and Robert Stadlober, and will debut in the Berlinale's Panorama section.


							By

	You likely want to bring a box of tissues when you go see Four Minus Three (Vier Minus Drei), the new feature from Austrian filmmaker Adrian Goiginger (The Best of All Worlds, The Fox), which is based on a true story and world premieres in the Panorama section of the Berlin International Film Festival. What awaits you is an emotional journey through family, death, grief, memory, hope, and tears that also features clowns – yes, clowns! 


	The movie stars Valerie Pachner (The Stories, Egon Schiele: Death and the Maiden, A Hidden Life). She and her partner Heli (Robert Stadlober) are professional clowns, living an alternative, joy-filled life with their two children. But then Barbara loses Heli and the children in a car accident. “In the face of unspeakable loss, her belief in humor, hope, and humanity is put to the ultimate test,” notes a synopsis of Four Minus Three. “Can her way of seeing the world — through both its light and shadow — help her find a way back to life? She bets she'll laugh again.”

	Stefanie Reinsperger, Hanno Koffler, and Ronald Zehrfeld are also part of the cast. The script by Senad Halilbašić is based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Barbara Pachl-Eberhart. The production companies are 2010 Entertainment in Austria and Giganten Film in Germany. Goiginger directed the film and produced it with Peter Wildling, Gerrit Klein, Martin Pfeil, and David Stöllinger. 


	“I first read the synopsis of Four Minus Three at a time when my second child had just been born. My initial reaction was that the story of a woman who loses her husband and children in one fell swoop was too intense for me,” Goiginger highlights in a director's statement. “It was only through Senad Halilbasic's first draft of the screenplay and his perspective on the story that I realized that it was more about hope and life after the accident than about telling a tragedy. That made me want to make this film at all costs.”During the “incredibly demanding, emotional shoot for everyone, both in front of and behind the camera,” the director felt that his stars anchored the film. “I've rarely seen anyone commit to a role the way Valerie Pachner does: 100 percent emotionally invested in every take, regardless of the consequences,” he says. “Robert Stadlober also brought so much personality, edge and humor to his character.”

	











Four Minus Three has a German distributor in Alamode Film, while its Austrian distributor is Polyfilm. THR can now debut an exclusive clip from Four Minus Three. It shows Pachner, as Barbara, remembering happy times with her loved ones. Check out the clip below.

In 'I Love LA,' she's a manic TikTok striver. In 'Marty Supreme,' she's a combustible climber keeping up with Timothée Chalamet. In reality, Hollywood's newest It Girl is a baggy jeans-wearing homebody with three roommates, seven pets and a complicated family legacy.

	Several years ago, Odessa A'zion had a promising audition to join the cast of HBO's Euphoria. She read in front of casting director Jennifer Venditti, known for her uncanny ability to discover fresh talent, including the show's stars Sydney Sweeney and Jacob Elordi. A'zion, only a teenager at the time, earned a callback and a meeting with creator Sam Levinson.


	“He asked me to come in and do the table reads with the whole cast, so I knew he was really serious,” she says. But the COVID pandemic abruptly halted production, and A'zion never heard from the Euphoria team again. The part went to someone else (she declines to say whom), and she — perhaps unfairly — blames herself. “I mean, it's my fault because I don't think that I followed up or asked about it or anything,” she explains.

	All was not in vain, however. Her Hollywood fate would again rest in the hands of Venditti when, four years later, Josh Safdie was starting to put together Marty Supreme. It was to be his first solo feature after the dissolution of his longtime creative partnership with brother Benny, with whom he'd made the propulsive hit Uncut Gems. Safdie was looking for someone to hold her own opposite the already-attached Timothée Chalamet, someone who could bring a level of mischief, yearning and a Fievel Mousekewitz energy to the role. He also wanted a discovery, an actress who would present to the audience zero pretense or baggage. Safdie asked Levinson and Venditti for recommendations, and they suggested A'zion. A few months and several auditions and Zoom meetings later, A'zion got a FaceTime from Safdie.

	











	“He's like, ‘Odessa, Odessa, Odessa, this is where we're going to film the end of the movie, and this is Jack Fisk, who's doing all the production design, and that stage over there, that's going to be Wembley Stadium, look how incredible this all is,' ” A'zion recounts. “I was thinking, ‘Does this mean I get the part?' But I was too afraid to ask. And I can't remember a lot of what he said next, but I remember the last part so clearly. He said, ‘I can't wait to make this movie better with you.' “


	Now, in early 2026, the 25-year-old is sitting in a café near her Los Angeles home, unpacking her experience as the breakout success of the season. Marty Supreme is A24's highest-grossing film in North America at $81 million and counting (it's also the studio's most expensive, at $70 million) and an awards-season darling, with nine Oscar nominations, including best picture. She's still coming down from her Golden Globes high, which she says was the first time she truly understood the impact of the movie's success. “Steven fucking Spielberg came up to me and was like, ‘Can I say hi to you?' “


	She's also one of the new faces of HBO's Sunday night programming; as the seemingly cursed third season of Euphoria faltered through delays and rewrites, the network bet on a new crop of hot young talent with I Love LA, the ensemble comedy from creator Rachel Sennott that both trades in and excoriates zillennial internet-fame culture. She stars as Tallulah, a TikToker trying to pivot a viral moment into lasting fame and fortune with the help of her best friend and manager (Sennott). The network was quick to renew the show for a second season (“I want Odessa to do many seasons of the show,” says HBO comedy boss Amy Gravitt), and the show has launched a flurry of think pieces and discourse, much like its spiritual predecessor Girls. “Honestly, the first thing that made me realize the show was working was the fan-cams,” says Sennott. “Seeing all those videos, or people saying, like, ‘I'm such a Tallulah.' I was sending them to everyone [in the cast], like, ‘You're a star, you're a star.' ”

	











	A'zion knows that she's in the middle of an atmospheric rise. The signs are everywhere, including being asked to do her first major magazine cover. But despite her onscreen bravado, and growing up in the industry as the daughter of Emmy-nominated actress Pamela Adlon, she feels woefully underprepared. There's the schedule — the slog of doing back-to-back press tours, plus an awards campaign, all while starting production on her next (yet-to-be-announced) project on location in Montreal. And there are the eyeballs, both IRL (she has stage fright) and online. “I'm not used to this many people paying attention to me,” she says. 


	Before the publication of her cover story, A'zion announced that she exited Sean Durkin's A24 film Deep Cuts following online backlash to her casting given the character is described in the book as half Mexican and half Jewish. A'zion apologized and explained on her Instagram Stories that she took to heart the comments and concerns about whitewashing the adaptation of Holly Brickley's novel: “I'm so sorry that this happened…I'm so pissed y'all, I hadn't read the book and should have paid more attention to all aspects of Zoe before accepting… I'd never take a role from someone else that's meant to do it. That SHOULD do it! That's not me. There are a plentitude of people more than capable of playing this role and I am NOT one of them.”

	











	She lives in Los Angeles' Mid-City neighborhood, a laid-back, family-filled area that has the opposite vibe of the ultra-hip Eastside neighborhood that the I Love LA characters call home. Think less Marty Supreme jacket and more Vuori zip-up. She has three roommates, a mix of friends and internet connections. When she's traveling for work, they step in to take care of her menagerie of pets; currently, it consists of two dogs, two cats and three tortoises, but at one point there were snakes, a bearded dragon, ferrets and bunnies. “She's messy, but in the way a planet has moons stuck in its orbit,” explains Safdie.


	***


	She arrives at the coffee shop carrying an iced coffee she made at home and declines my offer to treat her to something more. She hasn't developed the taste for luxury goods that her Marty co-star Chalamet has honed over the years of receiving blockbuster-level salaries (and dating a billionaire). She's dressed in her signature wardrobe of baggy jeans, baggy top, vintage boots. When asked how she's celebrated big moments like her recent projects' successes or SAG's Actor Award nom, she comes up empty. “I didn't do anything the day of the nominations; I think I literally just ate pickles,” she says with a laugh. “I'll always be eating pickles.”


	To some degree, A'zion's career feels preordained. Her mother has been a respected Hollywood fixture for decades (best known for Better Things, she also worked on King of the Hill and Californication); her father also worked as a producer and director (though not nearly as successfully as her mother). Her sister Gideon Adlon, five years her senior, is an actress best known for the 2018 comedy Blockers. “I remember that I knew of her,” says her I Love LA co-star True Whitaker, daughter of Forest. “Her older sister knew my older sister, and L.A. is kind of small in that sense.” It's an upbringing easily (and often) dismissed as one of nepo baby privilege, but the reality is more complicated.

	











	She attended CHAMPS Charter High School of the Arts in Van Nuys but then went to boarding school in Germany for a year (her parents divorced when she was young, and her father has lived in Germany ever since). But she didn't speak the language, so she was sent to a special language institution. By the time she went back to the boarding school, she was behind in the actual curriculum, so she came back to L.A. and took summer school classes to catch up. A'zion describes the experience as “weird” but not traumatic.


	When she was 16, her mother's show Better Things premiered. It ran for five seasons on FX, starring Adlon as a divorced actress raising three daughters on her own. Adlon received widespread critical acclaim, plus an Emmy nomination and a Peabody Award for the series, which is widely known to be thinly veiled autobiography. The series depicted her onscreen daughters experiencing common coming-of-age issues like puberty but also more heightened and vulnerable moments; the middle sister, Frankie, has a period of gender dysphoria and is often shown being quite cruel to her mother. Adlon has always insisted that Better Things‘ storylines are exaggerated, but the comparisons to real life are still a sore spot for A'zion, who began using a stage name inspired by her middle name (Zion) in 2021, and she's still uneasy talking about it.

	











	“People will assume things based off of watching the show,” she reads from a note she has saved on her phone, which she wrote in advance, expecting the question. “And all I can say is it's very much from one person's perspective of possible shared experiences.” When asked whether watching her mother's career inspired her to become an actress herself, she is equally guarded. “It's really hard to talk about without getting into personal specifics that I probably shouldn't let the world know about,” she says. Did her mom try to talk her out of it? “Again, that's really hard to answer.” A'zion declined to discuss her current relationship with her mother.


	Adlon declined to participate in an interview, but she spoke in depth about the show's impact on her daughters during a 2016 episode of NPR's Fresh Air. “At first, I was being very protective of [my daughters] in terms of what I was doing and the material so my kids didn't feel like they were being co-opted or that anything was besting them,” she told host Terry Gross. Eventually, she says, her kids got “very involved” in helping her cast the actresses on the show. “They're very much a part of it, and the show is completely dedicated to them and all that they do. The show really gave them a voice.” She hasn't spoken publicly about A'zion's newfound success but did post both the trailer for Marty Supreme and the poster for I Love LA on her Instagram.


	***


	The first job A'zion booked was a five-episode arc on Nashville, playing a teenage runaway who befriends Maisy Stella's Daphne Conrad; she was 17 when it aired. “I had no fucking clue who anyone was on set,” she recalls with a laugh. “Meaning their job positions. The director versus the first AD versus the gaffer. And every time we did a take, I was like, ‘Am I doing this right? Should I be looking at a different spot?' I was so young and bad, and I hope people don't judge me for my early work because I feel like I've come a long way.”

	











	(Whitaker says A'zion is one of the few actors who always knows whether her takes went well. “She's not afraid to be like, ‘You know what, I didn't love that one,' and she's willing to fight for a take that she feels good about,” she explains.)


	Jobs followed steadily, if quietly, from there. She starred in the one-season-long CBS sitcom Fam opposite Nina Dobrev and on the Netflix high school drama Grand Army before pivoting to indie movies as a way to figure out what sort of material she connected to most; she says her role as Yara Shahidi's best friend in 2023's Sitting in Bars With Cake was the first time she really connected to a character. “I remember I saw her in this movie Good Girl Jane,” says Sennott. “She's a supporting character, and I was like, ‘Who is that girl? She's so magnetic and charismatic.' “


	In early 2024, Sennott was working on what was then just a pilot for HBO, inspired by her first year living in L.A. A'zion heard about the auditions and sent in self-tapes for the roles of Alani (the lovable nepo baby played by Whitaker) and Tallulah. The sides described a scene in which Tallulah runs across the street and is nearly hit by a car, and A'zion decided to do it in her backyard.


	“I was always told that casting directors want you up against a blank wall, that they don't want your reader doing too much, but I think that's bullshit,” she says. “And as soon as I stopped listening to that and doing what I thought was right, I started booking.” HBO brought A'zion in to read with Sennott in front of Gravitt and CEO Casey Bloys. Says Sennott, “I just felt so activated by her in our scene, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, it's her.' ”

	











	By all accounts, the character of Tallulah is the show's chaos agent. She's brash and bold — Sennott points out that, according to an often-missed Easter egg in an early episode, she's also a Gemini — and her wardrobe wouldn't be out of place at a club of either the night or strip variety, even if the scene finds her at a funeral. “First and foremost, the thing that is most different about Odessa and Tallulah is wardrobe,” says Josh Hutcherson, who plays Sennott's easygoing boyfriend on the series. “Odessa is always dressed in oversized, boyish, super cool clothes. Tallulah is wearing next to nothing most of the time.”


	A'zion struggled with the chasm. “Playing someone who's out there, personality-wise, is fun, and I know I'm not the quietest bitch on the block, but clothing-wise, that was really difficult for me,” she says. When they taped the first iteration of the pilot, she pushed back on the wardrobe. She also asked to do her own hair and makeup. “I have a lot of mental disorders, and I get really overwhelmed when people are touching me and in my face and in my hair — it's an anxiety thing.”

	











	Sennott had never worked with anyone who requested that before but easily obliged: “It was great, she's amazing at it, and I was like, ‘Girl, I'm about to hire you to do my hair.' ” A rumor started going around on TikTok late last year that A'zion's hair is fake, but her co-stars are quick to shut it down. “She's Miss Hair, she takes forever to accentuate every little curl, but it's not a fucking wig, let me tell you,” says Whitaker.


	By the time HBO ordered the pilot to a full season and the cast and crew reconvened on set, A'zion had come around on the wardrobe. “I was like, ‘Make the shorts shorter, I know who Tallulah is now,' ” she says. “She's confident, and I'm really grateful to her because she helped me get more comfortable with my own body.”


	When A'zion learned about the role in Marty Supreme, she knew the character instantly. To her, Rachel is just like Marty — a woman who will do whatever it takes to get to her end goal (money and security), who is driven, emotional, foolish, enigmatic; it was instantly clear to her that it was a role designed to make an actress pop.


	“It was so juicy and meaty, and I got to do everything: I was kidnapped, I was shot, I was a beggar, I was a really strong, independent woman going through an emotional roller coaster,” she says. “I knew people would respond to that character no matter who played her.”

	











	For her audition, Safdie and Venditti asked her to self-tape a scene in which Rachel calls on a pay phone and shakes down Abel Ferrara's gangster character Ezra Mishkin. She was filming the horror flick Until Dawn in Budapest, and there were old-timey phone booths all over the city, so A'zion set up her tripod — she brings it with her everywhere — and asked her co-star Belmont Cameli to read as Mishkin. The audition, which A24 released on its social media channels, has since gone viral.


	When Safdie met her in person for the first time, she brought him and Chalamet souvenirs from Budapest. “She showed up with a shoulder bag that she seemed prepared to live out of for weeks,” he says, “and gave us these strange objects, which spoke to how she spent her downtime.”


Marty was an easy yes — she'd long had both Safdie and Chalamet on her own wish list of dream collaborators — but not an easy job. They filmed exterior shots during the winter while A'zion was dressed in a pencil skirt. Several scenes called for her to scream or hyperventilate, which started to affect her psychosomatically. The prosthetic pregnant belly she wore gave her welts and cuts (she whips out her phone to show dozens of photos she took of her injuries, which did look particularly gruesome). And she did all this while couch-surfing in New York.

	











	During short productions, films often put actors up in a hotel, but on longer shoots the industry standard is to offer a relocation fee and leave it up to the actor to find their housing. “Very few times does that actually cover rent,” she explains. A'zion first landed at a friend's place in Brooklyn but soon found herself in need of a new arrangement, so she called Whitaker. “She told me I could come stay with her, but she was living there, too, so we were either sleeping in her bed together or I'd sleep on the couch,” A'zion says. If she needed solitude to memorize her lines, she'd put on headphones and walk around the East Village. “I'd give her an A [as a roommate],” says Whitaker. “She's really clean — she's very OCD about it.”


	Despite growing up the way she did, A'zion says she didn't truly understand the way the industry worked until this year. Her previous jobs either didn't garner enough success to warrant a press tour or — in the case of Grand Army — the pandemic prevented her from going to premieres and junkets. She watched her friend [and Better Things star] Mikey Madison go through the machine last year with Anora but says that it didn't prepare her for the intensity of instant exposure. “The first time we did a Q&A after a screening, I was sweating and shaking,” she says.

	











	She has a prescription for beta blockers, the preferred red carpet antidote of several of her I Love LA co-stars, but she's so far declined to take them because she's more scared of the possibility that they might make her feel weird than she is of her current anxiety. I ask if she's going to prepare a speech for the Actor Awards, and her eyes widen. “I think I'm going to have a heart attack just from you saying that,” she says. She shared a table at the Golden Globes with Chalamet and Rose Byrne — Mary Bronstein, the director of If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, is married to Marty Supreme co-writer Ronald Bronstein — and watched in horror as the room's eyes turned their way. “When they both won, they're so deserving, but all I was thinking about is, ‘Now they have to go do the scariest thing on planet Earth: go up there on that stage and talk in front of people they admire.' “


	The natural question for someone experiencing this type of moment is, “What's next?” but A'zion insists she doesn't have a good answer. There will be more projects coming: the movie she's filming in Montreal and the second season of I Love LA, which doesn't have a production date. She's been making music for years — she took formal piano lessons as a kid and has since learned to play the guitar and the ukulele — and spent any free moment of 2025 in a recording studio, with the goal of releasing an album this year.


	“It's really hard after doing Marty Supreme to think about what I would do next because that was my ultimate goal,” she says. “I guess I just hope to keep playing insane women. I hope I'm never the straight man. I just want the juicy, fucked-up roles. I will play whatever insane character somebody wants me to play.”

Seven newly announced series span medical drama, psychological thrillers and genre fare as Netflix deepens its Taiwan-centered Chinese-language content strategy.


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


Netflix on Thursday unveiled its full Chinese-language content slate for 2026, outlining seven new original series that further cement the streamer's long-term bet on Taiwan as its primary hub for Mandarin-language production amid mainland China's ongoing ban on foreign streaming services.


	The lineup spans psychological thrillers, medical dramas, genre hybrids and supernatural action, and brings together some of the region's most bankable stars, including Wallace Huo, Ethan Ruan and Gigi Leung. Executives described the slate as deliberately darker, more genre-forward and creatively ambitious than earlier offerings, as Netflix looks to deepen engagement with Chinese-speaking audiences across Asia and the global diaspora.

	“Chinese-language storytelling is singular in its vibrancy, emotional depth, and willingness to explore complex, darker human truths,” said Maya Huang, Netflix's head of Chinese-language content. “We're especially excited by stories that take creative risks and immerse audiences in extraordinary worlds and experiences.”

	Leading the slate is Miracles of the ER, a grounded medical drama set inside a major Taipei hospital, headlined by Wallace Huo as an emergency department associate director overseeing a team grappling with relentless crises, ethical dilemmas and internal power struggles. The series pairs Huo with rising star Kent Tsai and is slated to launch in the fourth quarter of 2026.

	











	On the darker end of the spectrum, Confessions marks Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Ching-po's first long-form series, reuniting the creative team behind the 2023 black-comedy box office hit The Pig, The Snake and The Pigeon. Starring Ethan Ruan and Gingle Wang, the psychological thriller traces how a violent crime in Taipei binds three families across generations, excavating buried resentment and prompting a moral reckoning.


	Genre experimentation features prominently elsewhere in the slate. Bloody Smart unfolds in a tightly regulated school town destabilized by the emergence of a mythical “Bloodfruit Tree,” while action-comedy The Fixers centers on a down-on-his-luck gangster pulled into a clandestine problem-solving network tied to a century-old temple. Musical drama Dogman charts the rise and psychological collapse of a former rock star now adrift in middle age.


	Two additional series — How to Survive Med School and supernatural sci-fi thriller Pacify — have already wrapped principal photography and will premiere later this year. How to Survive Med School, a coming-of-age campus drama about a young man who rebels after being tricked into enrolling in Taiwan's top medical school, is written and directed by Giddens Ko and co-directed by Kai Ko and Tsai Jia-yin. Pacify, a supernatural action thriller centered on a cynical young woman drawn into a secret exorcism group after her sister becomes possessed, is helmed by Hong Kong filmmakers Derek Kwok, Anthony Yan and Henri Wong.

	











	Beyond the titles themselves, Netflix used the announcement to reaffirm its broader investment in Taiwan's creative infrastructure. Since 2020, the company has launched multiple training and development initiatives with local partners, including writers' room workshops, production training programs and script development schemes aimed at strengthening the local talent pipeline.


	“As the industry evolves, our focus remains consistent: long-term commitment, creative excellence, and a platform where Chinese-language stories can flourish locally and reach audiences worldwide,” Huang said. “Our ambition is to be the destination for Chinese-language entertainment that takes audiences into unexpected worlds.” The new slate builds on Chinese-language projects Netflix has already unveiled for early 2026, led by Left-Handed Girl, which opens Jan. 30. Directed and co-written by Shih-Ching Tsou, the visually immersive drama follows a single mother and her two daughters who return to Taipei to run a night market stall, only to see long-buried family tensions surface. Sean Baker serves as editor, co-writer and producer. The film was selected as Taiwan's submission for the 98th Academy Awards and advanced to the December shortlist.

	He can strike a pose, but Connor Storrie confesses he's not much of a dancer. 


	At Paris Fashion Week yesterday (Jan. 27), the Heated Rivalry actor was reminded of the viral video of himself dancing to Madonna's “Like a Prayer.” When asked by Dazed to name something he's bad at, but loves to do, Storrie joked, “I'm not bad at anything,” and then added “uhm, I don't know dancing?”


	The Dazed reporter replied “I saw the Madonna dance, I think you're good,” with Storrie responding, “That was me, that was me just living.”

Dazed spoke with Storrie at Saint Laurent men's fall 2026 ready-to-wear show in Paris, where he was seated in the front row alongside fellow Heated Rivalry actors François Arnaud and Robbie G.K. The Saint Laurent moment comes after the show's co-star, Hudson Williams, walked the runway at Dsquared2's fall 2026 runway show in Milan on Jan. 16.


	It's been a month since Storrie lit up social media with a video of himself dancing and lip-syncing to Madonna's classic hit. The short was filmed for Interview magazine and uploaded on Dec. 27. Since then, it has generated over 9 million views across the publication's Instagram, TikTok and Twitter accounts.


	As for numbers around Madonna's own “Like a Prayer” song, it generated 1.420 million official on-demand streams in the United States in the week ending Jan. 22, according to Luminate — marking its biggest streaming week in seven months. It last posted a bigger streaming week in the week ending June 5, 2025, when it tallied 1.473 million clicks.


	“Like a Prayer” topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for three weeks in 1989.

The concert industry is still growing. The streaming business continues to boom. But as investors pour billions into artificial intelligence, rights holders are seizing a historic opportunity to drive the value of music to new heights. The ranking of this year's top 40 reflects the force these leaders are showing as they forge strategic partnerships with new technology juggernauts to revolutionize the way fans interact with the artists and songs they love.With great power, of course, comes great responsibility — and the stakes are high. Here's to the success of this year's honorees as they work to safeguard creators' rights and shepherd music into a fruitful new era.

Over the course of the past decade, Grainge has become not only the chief executive of Universal Music Group but something of an unofficial leader of the industry as a whole — particularly when it comes to dealing with the challenges of new business models. More than any other music executive, he has shaped the modern streaming business — first by encouraging and helping to define competition (over features, not exclusives) and more recently by pushing services to improve payouts to rights holders with an “artist-centric” royalty model. And this year he also did more than any other executive to steer the music business into the era of artificial intelligence.For years, Universal has taken the lead on defining AI as both a challenge (potential competition and dilution of the royalty pool on streaming services) and an opportunity (to license training rights to music creation platforms and use the styles of individual performers to open new revenue streams). The challenge came first: In October 2023, Universal and other music publishers sued the AI company Anthropic for infringing copyrighted song lyrics (the case is ongoing), and in June 2024, Universal and the two other major labels sued the AI music services Udio and Suno for allegedly using their recordings to train models without a license. A year later, it was reported that the labels were negotiating. But the industrywide turning point between litigation and licensing was Universal's October deal with Udio. (Warner later signed deals with Udio and Suno; Sony's lawsuits against both companies are ongoing, as is Universal's against Suno.)Universal's agreement with Udio allows the company to train its AI model on some of the recordings and compositions that Universal controls, plus use the voices and performance styles of performers who opt in. Music created by users with these tools will stay inside a “walled garden,” inconvenient to upload to streaming services, where it would compete with music from Universal's artists.The Udio agreement is the biggest of many. Universal has also signed deals with Stability AI, Splice and — early in 2026 — the AI-focused microchip giant NVIDIA. The idea, as Grainge explained in his New Year's internal memo, is that Universal can't afford to ignore an important new technology, nor accept deals from AI companies that don't sufficiently value the rights it controls or protect creators from AI competition. Just as in streaming, Grainge wants Universal to play an active role in shaping the structure of deals and encouraging competition, rather than simply licensing any company that meets certain terms. “We must lean in,” Grainge said in the memo, “and take the reins in determining our future.”That means guiding the conversation around AI, both within the music business and outside it, including helping to start the Human Artistry Campaign and lobbying in the United Kingdom to discourage the government from watering down copyright law there. “We have punched way above our weight on the global stage to ensure that the interests of artists and music companies are front and center in technology, dealmaking and public policy,” Grainge said in his memo. “And we will continue to do so.”Another one of Universal's strategic priorities is adjusting the economics of streaming to prevent known artists from losing out as a flood of music — made by both humans and with the help of AI — dilutes streaming royalty pools. Grainge helped shape the “artist-centric” idea that pushed services to address the issue in different ways, and the company is following up with the concept “Streaming 2.0.” The idea is to build on the artist-centric model and disqualify “AI slop” while increasing average revenue per user in a way that helps not only Universal but, inevitably, other labels and rights holders. Universal signed a new deal with Amazon in late 2024, Spotify in early 2025 and YouTube this past fall.Next up: a deal that could improve streaming services themselves in the form of that January 2026 agreement with NVIDIA that aims “to elevate discovery, engagement and consumption beyond current constructs of search and personalization,” according to the announcement. Any deal with NVIDIA is a win, since it will give the AI sector's leading company an incentive to license training content rather than proceed with the usual Silicon Valley strategy of asking forgiveness instead of permission. There could be more here, though. “We're entering an era where a music catalog can be explored like an intelligent universe — conversational, contextual and genuinely interactive,” NVIDIA vp/GM of Media Richard Kerris said in the deal announcement. It's the kind of technology strategy that's full of promise, and Grainge and Universal intend to help turn it into a big business for the future. —Robert Levine

“With the amount of music coming into the marketplace under streaming, never mind when AI kicks in, you have to expand your horizons more than just thinking, ‘I need the No. 1 record on the charts,' ” says Stringer, whose company closed 65 label, publishing and distribution deals worth more than $2.5 billion in 2025.Even with The Orchard-distributed Bad Bunny ranking as Spotify's most streamed artist in the world for 2025, Columbia/Sony Latin's Rosalía setting a single-day Spotify record for a Spanish-speaking female (42.1 million streams) and the Oasis reunion becoming one of the year's top tours, Sony Music remains in growth mode.“You need volume, and preferably volume with really cool stuff that is actually going to be commercially viable,” Stringer says, as the company expands its footprint in Latin America, Asia and Eastern European territories. “Who would have thought that K-pop would do what it did, or that reggaetón would do what it did, or regional Mexican? You've got to stay on your toes. I want to understand what the next one is.”Last year was Sony's ninth straight year of revenue growth, at an average of 14.7% annually over the past four years, ahead of a market rate of 11.3%, and MiDIA Research declared Sony Music the fastest-growing major in the first half of this decade.Stringer also says the company looks for new ways to expand support of its creators through artist- and songwriter-forward initiatives. “I've had other people who might be competitors say to me, ‘Why did you do that?' My view is that you eventually pay if you don't do the right thing.” —Geoff Mayfield

Rapino marked two decades leading the concert giant in 2025, a year in which Live Nation promoted record-breaking stadium tours by Coldplay, Beyoncé, Oasis, and Kendrick Lamar and SZA; welcomed an estimated 160 million fans; grew revenue to $18.9 billion for the first nine months of the year (the most recent data available); and dominated the Billboard Boxscore year-end Top Tours chart with nine entries in the top 10.Live Nation also added 3,000 new roles and 18,000 seasonal hires “and continues to focus on developing the next generation of leaders who'll shape the future of this industry,” Rapino says, adding that the company expanded its Taking Care of Our Own employee benefits plan with stronger crisis and mental health support, new sabbaticals and more resources for part-time club staff in 2025.The company's record-breaking momentum outpaced, for the moment, ongoing legal challenges from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission — the latter filed in September 2025 that alleged Live Nation and its subsidiary, Ticketmaster, essentially allow ticket brokers to buy and sell tickets in a way that deceives consumers.Rapino prefers to focus on developments intended to improve its servicing of live-music fans. In October, the company announced the appointment of tech innovator and former Square executive Saumil Mehta as Ticketmaster's global president. Mehta's “mandate is straightforward,” Rapino says. “Use AI to transform the Ticketmaster experience. He's pushing hard on AI that makes the fan journey more intuitive and gives artists and venues smarter tools to run their tours and shows.”Mehta's arrival came shortly before the U.K. government banned the selling of tickets above face value, a move that Rapino says “we fully support” and that “Ticketmaster already does” across the pond.Asked if he would support a comparable ban in the United States, Rapino tells ­Billboard, “Short answer, yes. We believe artists should control how their tickets are sold and resold — that's why we built the Face Value Exchange, which any artist can use.” But, he adds, “One platform can't solve this on its own. To truly crack down on bad actors and make the experience better for fans, we need clear rules and real government enforcement.”—Taylor Mims

Spotify's biggest news of 2025 wasn't about AI, licensing agreements or a “superfan” tier that has yet to see the light of day. Rather, it was co-founder and CEO Ek's decision to step down at the end of 2025 to become a still-involved executive chairman. Ek was replaced by co-CEOs Norström and Söderström, who previously were co-presidents in charge of business and product/technology, respectively. The official announcement downplayed the drama, pointing out that Norström and Söderström have led Spotify's day-to-day operations and strategic development since 2023. But a co-­founder handing over the reins to co-CEOs marked an important inflection point for the world's biggest music subscription platform. Wall Street certainly took note: Spotify's share price fell more than 14% in the six weeks following the announcement.Norström and Söderström took leadership of a company with both naysayers and supporters. Critics have long argued that Spotify's app interface is too cluttered, the listening experience is too determined by algorithms and the royalties are too low, to name just a few frequent complaints.But by many key measures, Spotify is successfully navigating the complexities of format expansion — podcasts and audiobooks bolster Spotify's core music offering — and a never-ending need to roll out new features. As of Sept. 30, 2025, Spotify had 713 million total monthly users, up 11% year over year, and 281 million subscribers, up 12%.Even though Spotify stopped being a pure music service years ago, its forays into podcasts and audiobooks have made it a more potent partner for record labels and music publishers. Offering more value to listeners has allowed the company to raise prices that went unchanged for more than a decade. In 2025, Spotify rolled out such features as lossless audio, long-form concert videos and a new editorial series, The Drop Weekly. Those and numerous other improvements helped third-quarter operating income grow 28% to 582 million euros ($682 million) and gross profit improve to 31.6% from 31.1% a year earlier. U.S. prices are expected to rise again in 2026, and the long-awaited “superfan” tier would add to those figures. That's a long way of saying that Spotify's financial model continues to fortify itself for the future. —Glenn Peoples

Kyncl says WMG's 2025 chart success and market share gain prove that “our strategy's working.”After issuing an internal memo in July indicating he was cutting $300 million in costs — including $170 million in staff cuts — to “future-proof” the label group, Kyncl says, “We've decided to put more money behind the music and refine how we operate and deliver with much greater impact. We've been hotter than ever with both Atlantic and Warner Records,” he says. “I can talk about sombr, Maria [Becerra], Alex Warren and Ravyn Lenae all breaking through in big ways, and also Cardi B and Twenty One Pilots all delivering No. 1 albums.”Alternative artist sombr's debut album reached the top 10 in the United States and at least eight other countries. Social media breakthrough Warren had his breakout single, “Ordinary,” spend 10 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. Argentine singer Becerra's single with Rei and XROSS, “Mi Amor,” reached the top 10 in her own country. And R&B singer Lenae's “Love Me Not” single reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.Ed Sheeran's Play reached the top five on the Billboard 200 stateside and in seven other countries. Cardi B's Am I the Drama? became her second No. 1 album, while alternative duo Twenty One Pilots debuted at No. 1 for the second time in its career with Breach.“We've grown our market share, ­especially in the United States, for our recorded-­music market group, up 0.6%, according to ­Luminate,” Kyncl says. “And we did all of this while recalibrating the company for the future, cutting costs and expanding profitability. I'm really proud of what the team has ­accomplished.” In November, Kyncl was the first major music group leader to sign a deal with Suno, the $2.5 billion AI music platform, as part of his mission to protect artists and songwriters, and position them to reap the benefits from AI. “This is the moment,” Kyncl wrote at the time,  “to shape the business models, set the guardrails, and pioneer the future for the benefit of our artists and songwriters.”—G.M.

After spending the past 12 years launching five companies designed to better serve artists and their fans, The Azoff Company spent 2025 focused on growing those businesses: Full Stop Management, which is run by Jeffrey; indie label Giant Music; heritage artist catalog and brand management company Iconic Artists Group; and performing rights organization Global Music Rights. (The latter two companies appear on this list separately.)The fifth company, Oak View Group, took a hit when the U.S. Department of Justice indicted co-founder and CEO Tim Leiweke on bid-rigging charges in July, but a reprieve came in December when President Trump pardoned the executive.For the Azoffs, however, good news far outweighed the bad in 2025. Full Stop artists the Eagles played 26 shows at Sphere in Las Vegas and have booked 12 more dates this year. No Doubt will reunite for 18 shows at the state-of-the-art venue beginning in May. Billboard's No. 17 top artist of 2025, Tate McRae, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 2025 album So Close to What, made her second appearance on Saturday Night Live and grossed $75.8 million on tour (good for the No. 39 spot on Billboard Boxscore's year-end Top Tours list). John Mayer played the Grateful Dead's 60th-anniversary concerts in Golden Gate Park in August, Cardi B was Billboard's No. 67 top artist of 2025, and Camila Cabello and Victoria Monét joined the Full Stop roster. Iconic's wins included an investment in Frank Sinatra Enterprises — a big get since the Chairman of the Board's popularity surpasses that of many contemporary artists. His music has racked up more than 1 billion on-demand U.S. streams every year since 2021.And over at Giant, slizzy rapper Cash Cobain continues to build. His current single, “Hoes Be Mad,” generated approximately 26 million streams, and his song catalog, including that track, has racked up over 220 million, according to Luminate, which, Billboard estimates, amounts to a little over $1 million in revenue.The label is also banking on, among others, Utah teen rockers Riff Wood, Australian pop artist Ruel and British jazz prodigy and singer-songwriter Hohnen Ford.“I don't think you can point to anyone who has from an entrepreneurial base started a business in the last 12 years that has this kind of depth and breadth and reach,” Azoff Company co-president Elizabeth Collins says of its founder.“Irving permeates all the companies,” adds her fellow co-president, Susan Genco. “His philosophy. His Rolodex. His brain.” —Frank DiGiacomo

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science's decision to move the Oscars from a broadcast network to YouTube in 2029 isn't directly related to Lyor Cohen. But listen to Cohen and you'll understand why Hollywood's biggest night, which attracts tens of millions of viewers globally, is leaving network TV for the world's biggest, most important streaming platform. It's the same reason football fans get NFL Sunday Ticket through YouTube TV rather than through a patchwork of U.S. cable TV providers: The world watches on YouTube.“Meeting the fans where they are is the key ingredient to our global success,” says Cohen, who will celebrate his 10th year as YouTube's global head of music in 2026. “Whether it's watching the premiere of your favorite artist's new music video, experiencing the magic of Coachella on your TV or getting hyped for a podcast episode on Shorts, YouTube is the only place where every format lives under one roof.”Americans are especially fond of YouTube — and not just on smartphones. For most of 2025, the platform has been the top Nielsen-rated media distributor by TV viewership, besting The Walt Disney Company (which owns ABC and ESPN), Netflix, NBCUniversal, Paramount and Fox. YouTube commanded approximately 13% of TV viewing time for much of 2025, approximately five percentage points ahead of No. 2 Netflix and more than double the top traditional TV brand.While much of YouTube's viewership comes from ad-supported viewing, Cohen is intent on growing the number of customers who pay to view ad-free. “Our north star is moving casual listeners into forever fans,” he says. As of March 2025, YouTube Premium — the ad-free version of YouTube — and YouTube Music had a combined 125 million subscribers. In the music space, only Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment have more subscribers than YouTube.The proof of a platform's success is ultimately in the royalties it pays to creators and rights holders. Going after subscribers has helped YouTube double the amount paid to the music industry in just over three years. “Our twin engines of ads and subscriptions — which were responsible for over $8 billion being paid to the music industry between July 2024 and June 2025 — are providing the recipe for long-term artist and songwriter success on a global scale,” Cohen says. —G.P.

In 2025, Sony Music Publishing continued its dominance as the largest publisher in the music business by market share. In the third quarter of the year, for example, it came in as the No. 1 publisher on the Top Radio Airplay, Hot 100 Songs and Country Airplay charts in Billboard's Publishers Quarterly rankings.That position was bolstered by a number of competitive new signings, including Billboard's No. 25 top artist of 2025, BigXtha­Plug; British singer-songwriter Myles Smith; Addison Rae; producer-engineer-­songwriter Mike Dean; and producer-­songwriter Julian Bunetta, and the renewal or sweetening of deals with such SMP stars as Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Miley Cyrus and Shakira. Platt also positioned Sony ahead of the competition through the strategic acquisition of Hipgnosis Songs Group.Global expansion remains a top priority for Platt, and in 2025, he helped launch a new Sony publishing office in Thailand and international writing camps in Paris, Madrid, London and Accra, Ghana.Domestically, Platt established a new songwriter hub and office in Los Angeles and returned its Nashville administrative office to Music Row alongside its creative offices. And in September, he received the Otis & Zelma Redding Award of Respect at the fourth annual King of Soul Festival in Macon, Ga., which honors the legacy of the late soul icon. —Kristin Robinson

On a sunny morning in October, Universal Music Publishing Group chairman/CEO Jody Gerson gathered her lieutenants around a table in her Santa Monica, Calif., office, Zooming in her overseas executives on a big screen, and proudly ­introduced what she described as evidence to inform the ­ongoing industry discussion on “whether AI will replace human artistry.”“I'm going to show you why it will not,” Gerson said, clad in a black leather jacket and her signature rose-tinted aviator glasses, cueing the dazzlingly original video for the operatic track “Berghain” that had just been released by Rosalía, whom Gerson signed in 2019 and has worked with closely ever since. “The reaction that this video's getting just gives me hope that real artists will prevail.”Throughout the rest of the meeting, as each team member gave their updates, Gerson interjected frequently to offer support, asking if there was “anything else we could do to help” a certain songwriter and acknowledging one leader for working through his entire vacation to ensure that a critical deal struck the right “balance of what's good for songwriters and what's good for the company on a global basis.”“I want to commend you for fighting the fight and making sure songwriters are paid fairly. We should all be comforted knowing we have this dream team fighting for value,” Gerson gushed.It's been a decade since Gerson took the helm of the publishing business at the world's biggest record company. Since then, she's reigned not just as the most powerful woman in the music industry but as one of the most influential executives in entertainment, approximately tripling her company's publishing revenue and championing songwriters and the value of music at every opportunity — and waking up before dawn each morning to feed her three dogs and practice Pilates before arriving at the office “excited, hoping that I'm going to hear something that I love and that I can contribute in some way to someone's life. I still have the responsibility of that.”

Moot and Marshall turned heads in music publishing last year when Warner Chappell Music finished at No. 2 behind Sony on both of Billboard's Publishers Quarterly Top Radio Airplay and Hot 100 Songs rankings in the second and third quarters with more than 20% of the market in both brackets. WCM also reigned as the No. 1 country music publisher for the entire year, part of the legacy of its Nashville president Ben Vaughn, who died unexpectedly in January 2025 at the age of 49.“Our teams across the globe came together with extraordinary focus and creativity,” Moot says, adding that prioritizing global reach over the last few years has paid off, securing “market-­leading positions in such territories as Germany, Hong Kong and Spain.”New stars that joined the roster last year include Rosé, Diplo, Dre Harris and Cyril, and longtime WCM artist Kacey Musgraves re-upped with the publisher. “The caliber of artists joining — and staying with — Warner Chappell speaks volumes about the trust and belief they place in our teams,” Moot says.Synch licensing has also been a source of growth for Moot and Marshall this year. “We remain deeply committed to breathing new life into our unparalleled catalog,” Marshall says. This includes key wins like securing Led Zeppelin's “Whole Lotta Love” for Nike's Super Bowl ad.For all publishers, new challenges lay on the horizon as generative AI technology gains ground, but Moot says Warner Music Group's “thoughtful partnerships” with AI companies such as Suno and Udio in late 2025 ensure that its writers are “protected and positioned to benefit as this technology grows.” —K.R.

“We had such an incredible year,” Marciano says, “that I'm actually nervous to list [all our major accomplishments] because I'm afraid I may leave someone out.”

The “tip of the iceberg,” as the veteran promoter puts it, includes opening The Pinnacle, a state-of-the-art venue in Nashville; breaking ground on new venues in Portland, Ore., and Austin; and record-breaking years for festivals BST Hyde Park, Stagecoach and Country to Country. In 2025, AEG also remained a steadfast partner to major artists, including Morgan Wallen, whose curated Alabama festival Sand in My Boots debuted in May; Zach Bryan, who set a record for the largest ticketed concert audience in U.S. history when he played the first show at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor; and Andrea Bocelli, who inked a five-year partnership with the promoter in May. All told, AEG Presents rode this success to another No. 2 placement on Billboard's year-end Top Promoters chart, with $2.5 billion grossed.But AEG's horizons keep expanding. For one, Cárdenas Marketing Network, with which AEG partnered in 2024, ranked at No. 6 on the 2025 Top Promoters chart, indicating AEG's growing clout in both Latin music and global markets. “Our international business is a key focus for us right now,” says Marciano, who also cites recent deals with the German promoter MCT Agentur and the French festival We Love Green and the Norwegian office AEG opened in 2025. Elsewhere in the world, Ed Sheeran played seven sold-out shows in India last year.Meanwhile, Marciano says, “We work really hard to superserve both the artists and the audience.” The company's ticketing platform, AXS, has introduced technologies to improve ticket accessibility for fans such as Fair AXS, which streamlined ticketing for Chappell Roan's in-demand fall tour. In 2028, AXS and CTS Eventim will provide ticketing services for the Los Angeles Olympic and Paralympic Games.In this unpredictable business, Marciano stresses adaptability. “Nobody has a crystal ball, and things can change in an instant,” he says. “Being ready to take advantage of opportunities that come your way is what counts.”—Eric Renner Brown

Last year marked 10 years of Apple Music, and Schusser says, “We're incredibly proud of the journey we've taken. We built a truly global product,” that, he adds, “does not and will never have a free tier,” and yet has “the lowest churn rate in the industry.”Schusser says it's also a point of pride that “whenever we ship truly innovative things, our competitors are trying to copy us within three months.” He cites the 2025 debut of Automix as an example; it's a feature that enables users to create seamless, DJ-like transitions between songs. DJ With Spotify soon followed.He also applauds Apple Music's artist relations team — helmed by Zane Lowe — which provides artists opportunities to share their stories through its digital radio programming.“We are worried that at the end of the day, streaming is just a jukebox in the sky,” Schusser explains. “We're in the music business at Apple because we love music. That's why we created these spaces and these moments for artists to express themselves and connect with their fans. It's so important to do it because streaming, by and large, doesn't let them do that.” —K.R.

It's hard to argue that another label has bigger stars than REPUBLIC Collective, where the Lipman brothers have been in charge since founding it in 1995. Their first major hit was Chumbawamba's No. 6 Billboard Hot 100 single, “Tubthumping,” in 1997, which made Republic so valuable the Lipmans sold it to Universal Music Group three years later for an undisclosed amount.Since then, they've taken over record deals for the world's biggest hit-makers, including Taylor Swift (whose indie Big Machine had a strategic alliance with Republic before she signed with the label outright in 2018), Drake (originally signed to Young Money, an indie distributed through Republic) and Morgan Wallen (whose Nashville label, Big Loud, has an alliance with Republic-owned Mercury).Those artists, along with Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, helped power the collection of labels — which includes Island, Mercury and Def Jam — to an industry-leading 16.84% current market share in 2025. “We saw the REPUBLIC Collective compete at the highest level and sail into uncharted waters,” Monte says.Adds Avery: “Artistry and authenticity always win.” —Steve Knopper

Janick still thinks of himself as an outsider in the music business. “It's probably more who I am,” says the record executive who formed his breakthrough indie label, Fueled by Ramen, with an $800 savings bond he'd received from family members.But this self-description sounds odd when Janick discusses the stars on his current label, Interscope Capitol, which racked up a 15.83% overall market share through the end of 2025 — greater than all other major labels, including its Universal Music Group (UMG) in-house rival REPUBLIC.“Lady Gaga, who we started setting up in 2024” with the release of her 2025 album, MAYHEM, “is still going,” he says. Other Interscope Capitol artists he cites: Kendrick Lamar, whose Super Bowl halftime show performance became the most watched in history — 133.5 million viewers, according to the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music — then staged the Grand National Tour, which finished at No. 3 on Billboard Boxscore's year-end Top Tours chart with $358.7 million. Then there's Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Doechii, Playboi Carti, KATSEYE, mgk and Gracie Abrams, “who had her breakout year in 2024 extending into 2025,” he says.“When you start a record label with $800, you have no connection to anybody, no resources and you just have to figure it out,” he says. “Now, I get to be here with every relationship and all the resources you could possibly need.”Janick says that he tells his team to “dream of anything and do anything you want,” and two years into UMG's merger of Interscope and Capitol, the label head has effected plenty of change. Working with Nir Seroussi, the head of Interscope Capitol Miami, Janick and his team have reconfigured the label's Latin division so that international stars such as Karol G, Xavi and J Balvin can more easily share resources with U.S. stars like Gaga and Eilish. They relaunched Lost Highway Records and re-signed Kacey Musgraves to her original label home and boosted the careers of rocker Yungblud and rising singer-songwriter Sienna Spiro.“We're focused on looking forward and not paying attention to the noise around us,” he says. “I came into a great company and a great brand, and we were able to evolve it into something for the future.” —S.K.

Since Grainge took over as CEO at Atlantic in September 2024, the company has gone through a seismic restructuring — shifting 10K Projects under the AMG umbrella, sunsetting the Elektra Records brand, moving the U.K. team under the U.S. leadership structure and undergoing several rounds of layoffs in order to future-proof the company for technological changes to come. Now, “we've got the most incredible, ambitious team — the Dream Team,” he says, noting everything is always a work in progress.But it's already bearing fruit on the artist side. Last summer, Alex Warren ruled the Billboard Hot 100 for 10 nonconsecutive weeks, while Rosé and Bruno Mars' “APT.” came in at No. 9 on the year-end Hot 100, landing record and song of the year nominations at the 2026 Grammys in the process. And with Warren and The Marías also landing best new artist nods, “it means that we're picking the right artists,” Grainge says. “The artists are having incredible success with their A&R teams and their own vision creatively and sonically, and when you put those bits of magic and perspective together, the sky is the limit, right?”Those big records were also buttressed by successes across the musical spectrum. Ravyn Lenae — Billboard's 2025 R&B Rookie of the Year — landed a slew of top 10 chart peaks with her “Love Me Not,” which climbed to No. 5 on the Hot 100, while Cardi B and Twenty One Pilots each grabbed the top spot on the Billboard 200 with their respective albums in the fall — prompting Grainge to joke that Atlantic might branch out into classical music next. “It's an incredible time to be in the record business now, both as a label and also as an artist,” he says. “So we've just got to continue diversifying, and we've got to keep finding our magic, which is predicting what is good — not just for tomorrow, but also what's going to be big in three years. That's where our energy is now.”—Dan Rys

Amazon remains a music merchandising powerhouse, generating more than $2 billion in annual U.S. music revenue from streaming subscriptions and CD/vinyl sales — about 15% of the overall market, Billboard estimates, and 25% of the physical sales market — a distinction its digital streaming competition cannot claim. And Boom says last year's launch of Alexa+, its AI-enhanced virtual assistant, will better serve music fans and their favorite artists.“We launched it with a simple belief: Music discovery should feel more like talking to a friend than searching through songs,” he says. “And honestly, the response has blown away our expectations.”Label executives report that Alexa+ is having a big impact on children's music, in addition to the influence Amazon in general has on that genre, classical music, jazz and most other popular music categories. Outside of the United States, Boom says Amazon wields the most clout in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Mexico and India.Boom says that other 2025 highlights include the company's global livestream —on Amazon Music, Prime Video and Twitch — of the final show of Bad Bunny's San Juan residency. The limited-edition vinyl version of the superstar's 2025 Billboard 200 No. 1 album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, sold in conjunction with the livestream, became Amazon's top-selling vinyl record that week, but, Boom notes, the success of the activation was much more than commercial. “Together with Bad Bunny, Amazon launched initiatives driving meaningful change in Puerto Rico through STEM education programs, agricultural support and economic development — including comPRa Local, a new destination on Amazon.com featuring Puerto Rican products and businesses.”Amazon also launched fan groups on Amazon Music, enabling subscribers with shared musical tastes to connect in their communities. “Fan curation is a huge tool for music discovery,” says Boom, who cites artists such as Lizzo, Justin Bieber and the Deftones and labels' growing use of Twitch for marketing as additional 2025 wins. Label executives confirm that Twitch is a potent tool for launching new albums, particularly hip-hop releases. “Twitch is the best way to connect authentically with your fans,” Boom says.  —Ed Christman

Bay-Schuck and Corson — and everyone else watching the 2025 Grammy Awards — saw the flip that went 'round the world, courtesy of their artist Benson Boone. Sombr, who signed with the label at age 17, scored a top 10 Billboard Hot 100 single and Billboard 200 album, a best new artist Grammy nomination and a Saturday Night Live musical performance slot. Teddy Swims is up for the best pop vocal album Grammy for I've Tried Everything but Therapy (Part 2). Zach Bryan ranked as Billboard's No. 21 top artist of 2025 and grossed $159.6 million on his Quittin' Time tour, and Green Day concluded its two-year Saviors tour, which grossed $43.8 million and sold 405,000 tickets.“We're having a good run lately,” Corson says. After Linkin Park made the inspired move of replacing the late Chester Bennington with Emily Armstrong as co-lead vocalist/guitarist, he says the band had “one of their biggest years ever.” That was reflected in the group's From Zero world tour, which grossed $150.6 million and was No. 15 on Billboard Boxscore's year-end Top Tours chart. Warner also re-signed Madonna, who's working on a 2026 follow-up to Confessions on a Dance Floor.Corson says that he and Bay-Schuck also united the Los Angeles-based flagship label with Warner Records Nashville and Warner Records U.K. to “allow us to execute for our artists on a scale and with expertise that far exceeds the services we provided before.” He adds, “Artists and managers should factor that into their decisions about whether they take their artists to us. Few companies have the expertise within the label group to understand how to manage that.” —S.K.

In 2013, Billboard reported that a number of music publishers privately bad-mouthed the then-7-year-old Primary Wave and its mantra of “marketing, marketing, marketing” for the music assets it acquired. What a difference a decade makes. Now publishers and other catalog investors are currently emulating Primary Wave's strategy of investing in artists' brands as well as their song catalogs and master-recording royalties.Yet, the Mestel-led company — which turns 20 this year — remains distinct from other music-asset buyers. Unlike its competitors, Primary Wave doesn't use leverage when buying artists' assets. And with few exceptions, it insists that the rights holders remain partners. Mestel says Primary Wave usually purchases an 80% stake, leaving the creator with 20%. So, in addition to receiving an upfront payday, creators share in any upside delivered through the marketing of their assets.“We have the biggest marketing, branding and content creation platform of any independent company in the world, with over 140 employees in our core company, not including the staff for our other companies outside the U.S. and joint ventures,” he says.At the 2025 Music Biz conference in May, Mestel said Primary Wave had increased the Whitney Houston estate's returns “fivefold” through such initiatives as the biopic I Wanna Dance With Somebody, licensing deals for a perfume line and even a Houston-branded slot machine. And last year, the company launched the Bob Marley Hope Road immersive live experience at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and the Prince Purple Rain Broadway stage adaptation of the late superstar's 1984 album/film in Minneapolis.Mestel says that last year, Primary Wave also “invested close to $700 million in 45 catalogs, including The Notorious B.I.G., The Cars, Patti LaBelle and many others we haven't announced,” as well as taking stakes in the catalogs of artists in emerging markets such as Vietnam, Indonesia and the Middle East. He adds that at the end of the year, Primary Wave still had about $1.5 billion in potential deals in its pipeline.At the conference, Mestel also noted that the company had acquired $5 billion in assets since its inception. Those investments are made according to the following strategy: “The songs have to be iconic or the artist has to be legendary, or the financial deal has to be so good that you can't turn it down,” he said. “The overriding premise is the asset has to be undercommercialized. We have to be able to grow the value.”Another key to Primary Wave's success, according to Mestel: only taking on licensing opportunities that the artist approves. That way, he said, Primary Wave can become the company “where other artists give you a reference.” —E.C.

The artist management company — which represents approximately 400 acts — ended 2025 with seven of them on Billboard Boxscore's year-end Top Tours chart, collectively grossing $379 million. Billboard's No. 4 top artist of 2025, Sabrina Carpenter, for whom RLM has partnered with Janelle Lopez Genzink and Volara Management, ranked at No. 34 with $77.4 million in concert receipts. She joined road regulars Phish (No. 31, $82.7 million); Chris Stapleton (No. 49, $65.2 million); Dave Matthews Band (No. 54, $54.8 million); Mumford & Sons, managed in partnership with Split Second's Izzy Zivkovic (No. 88, $33.6 million); Luke Bryan (No. 90, $33 million); and country music phenomenon Lainey Wilson, who is managed by Mandelyn Monchick (No. 93, $32.1 million). But those are just the acts who made the top 100. Capshaw says that, all told, RLM artists consistently gross more than $500 million a year.With the largest country roster in artist management — and the most acts on Boxscore's Top Tours chart — Capshaw says the genre continues to be a pillar of the company's success. He's particularly proud of Riley Green's and Tucker Wetmore's achievements over the past year. The former, managed by Daniel Miller and Zach Sutton, scored his fourth Country Airplay No. 1 with “Don't Mind If I Do” (featuring Ella Langley), and Wetmore, who is managed by Autumn Ledgin, reached No. 2 on the chart with both “3,2,1” and “Wind Up Missin' You.” Wetmore will embark on a headline tour in 2026. Capshaw also points to Wilson's continued success, citing her sustained achievements across touring, radio and awards.Capshaw adds that RLM's “established and developing electronic acts are having a real growth period.” GRiZ, who is managed in collaboration with Keith ­LeWinter, returned from a hiatus to headline the Seven Stars festival in Arrington, Va. Subtronics, managed by Eric Silver, also played the festival and sold out a weeklong residence at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, which Capshaw says amounted to 30,000 tickets sold.Mumford & Sons will release new album Prizefighter in February, and Capshaw says he's excited about signing Lauren Daigle, as well as “what 2026 will bring for The Strokes,” who are already booked for Coachella in April.It was also a big year for philanthropy. Capshaw and the RLM team raised $25 million to add to the initial $5 million that he, Dave Matthews and his band donated toward the continued renovation and/or replacement of all public housing in Charlottesville, Va., as well as the construction of additional affordable housing on underutilized land. The project, which began in 2019, has already resulted in 63 new and 105 renovated units, with another 113 new homes under construction, and in total will generate over $200 million worth of affordable housing. —F.D.

BMG wrapped 2025 with several high-profile deals in its pocket. The company's purchase of Jason Aldean's music catalog, reported to be valued at about $250 million, marked its largest single catalog acquisition to date — now part of a rights catalog of more than 1,000 songs by 23 artists and songwriters. According to Coesfeld, since the launch of parent company Bertelsmann's “Boost” investment strategy, which began in 2021, “BMG has invested $1.5 billion in music rights,” and its multiyear U.S. licensing agreement with Spotify granted BMG songwriters “greater transparency” in the streaming market. Meanwhile, a direct licensing agreement with TikTok “enhanced data visibility and deeper songwriter recognition across the U.S., Canada and Brazil.”The label group also accelerated its AI and technology initiatives, deepening partnerships with Google Cloud, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Runway to drive automation, data intelligence and creative enablement. And its transition to a fully direct-to-digital supply chain has improved efficiency, attribution and reporting across the business. —Cathy Applefeld Olson

For Perry, Addison Rae's evolution from TikTok viral megastar in 2019 to a singer with a critically beloved 2025 album, Addison, reflects the changing record industry. “We were in a process where TikTok made things go faster for a small period of time,” he says. “Now we're back to how things have always been.”Columbia — the label of home of both legends like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Barbra Streisand as well as superstars like Beyoncé, Adele and Harry Styles — scored the largest current market share of a Sony label in 2025, 4.51%, thanks in part to Tyler, The Creator's fourth No. 1 Billboard 200 album, Don't Tap the Glass; Blackpink star Jennie's global smash “like Jennie,” which debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard Global 200 and No. 3 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart; and Rosalía's LUX, which debuted atop five Billboard charts. “The number of diverse artists that have stepped forward this year is very exciting for us,” Perry says. —S.K.

In many ways, 2025 was el año del Bad Bunny. The Puerto Rican phenomenon finished at No. 7 on Billboard's year-end Top Artists chart and was, for the fourth time, Spotify's most streamed artist of 2025 thanks in part to his landmark album DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. It was one of multiple records set by the star in 2025. He also became the artist with the most Billboard Latin Music Award wins in history; the only Latin artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year at the Grammys; and, coming up, the first artist to perform ­solely in Spanish as the headliner of the Super Bowl LX halftime show.But for longtime manager Assad, who is also the founder and CEO of Rimas Entertainment, the biggest achievement of all was “without a doubt, the rollout of DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS,” which yielded six No. 1 Latin Airplay singles, and Bad Bunny's 31-date residency in San Juan. “We did that with so much love and passion. We were on a mission for our island,” Assad says. “It's something I will remember forever. It's one of my top professional achievements ever.”Beyond Bad Bunny, Assad scored wins with management clients Karol G and Grupo Frontera, both handled by Rimas' Habibi division, which also represents Sebastián Yatra, Mora and Eladio Carrión. Rimas also acquired a “significant” stake in indie Dale Play Records, home to Bizarrap, Rels B and Duki; while the company's concert ­promotion division, Rimas Nation, produced tours by Young Miko and Eladio Carrión, as well as Bad Bunny's current global tour with Live Nation.Looking to the year ahead, Assad says, “My business prediction for 2026 is the same thing I said for 2025: It's going to be quality over quantity. In 2025 we were right about that, and we will be right again.” —Leila Cobo

In 2025, Roc Nation Distribution upped its game in the sector by making its new dashboard available to the public, which Perez says quadrupled the number of active accounts and increased the division's odds of releasing the next hip-hop hit. Perez says that as of December, 70% of the tracks Roc Nation distributes weekly are hip-hop, “which we're really proud of.”The Roc also helped promote and distribute Clipse's culture-steering comeback album, Let God Sort Em Out, which topped Billboard's Independent and Vinyl Albums charts and earned five 2026 Grammy nods, including album of the year.“We had to work in unique ways with smaller budgets, but with a lot of input,” she says of Clipse's much-lauded album rollout. “It's choosing where we want to be, how we want to be heard, how we want to promote and then the independent label listening. It's really a partnership with the artist, and that's what we were able to achieve.”Following up Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show — the most watched in its history, according to the NFL — may seem like mission impossible, but Roc Nation's choice of Bad Bunny for this year's extravaganza was “an easy call,” Perez says. “The numbers speak for themselves. He's the top Latin artist of the century, and we always take into consideration what the cultural fit is.”Though its proposed deal for a casino in New York's Times Square fell through, Roc Nation secured various partnerships in 2025, including one with the E1 Series electric boat race championship and Roc Nation Sports International. “Creating a cross-pollination with the opportunity of sports, music and lifestyle within E1 was exciting for us,” Perez says. “We love the idea of the electric race boat, and it's global!” —Kyle Denis

Coming into 2025, EMPIRE — the music company that Ghazi initially founded as a digital distributor in his San Francisco apartment in 2010 — had all the momentum in the world. Its latest breakout artist, Shaboozey, had just come off a year where he tied the then-record for most weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with his mammoth hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” which led to five Grammy nominations, including best new artist and song of the year. The company had a thriving global recording and label business, one particularly strong in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and in the hip-hop world, and had added a publishing division that was signing big-name producers and building catalogs. And, in December, he won approval for EMPIRE's $23 million purchase of the iconic One Montgomery building in downtown San Francisco, a 100,000-square-foot former bank that had stood empty for years and had become a symbol of the city's downtrodden central district, which he plans to revamp in a multimillion renovation into EMPIRE's new global headquarters.So, how did Ghazi follow up the biggest year in EMPIRE's history? By taking a step back — sort of. “This was a big infrastructure year for us,” he says of 2025, noting that the company “put more bodies in more places,” hiring regional heads in the Nordics, Korea, Brazil and South Africa, and expanding its teams in the United Kingdom and Mexico and doing joint ventures and buying labels in India, Thailand and Cambodia. He also launched Supply Chain, his new software-as-a-service company that will offer white-label distribution to labels, signing his first deal with MixedByAli's EngineEars in November, and could fill a significant gap in the marketplace if Universal's planned purchased of Downtown goes through. EMPIRE got into the live-events business, hosting a 15th-anniversary concert for 20,000 people in San Francisco and throwing over 20 events for its dance music division, dirtybird. And there's plenty more to come — even as Shaboozey's momentum has barely abated and the company is doing as many recording and publishing deals as ever.“This was the year that I set all that in motion, because from the record side, we were doing so well that it was cool for me to divert my attention somewhere else and double down on infrastructure,” he says. “That means that next year, we can level up again.” —D.R.

The label home of Elvis Presley, Britney Spears, Foo Fighters and Childish Gambino has pumped out a number of new stars in recent years. The biggest is arguably SZA, whose “continuing dominance,” Edge says, resulted in her Grammy-nominated 2024 Kendrick Lamar collaboration, “Luther,” hitting No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March, just before the duo's world tour, and staying in the top spot for 13 consecutive weeks. Others success stories include Tate McRae, who hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with her album So Close to What in March; British rock band Sleep Token, whose Even in Arcadia reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in May; country star Tyler Childers, whose Snipe Hunter opened at No. 7; and rising R&B singer kwn, whose “Worst Behaviour” video with Kehlani earned her Billboard's Rookie of the Month honor in March. “In a world obsessed with virality, we really believe artist development is the foundation of who we are and will continue to be our strength,” says Edge, who started running RCA in 2011 after years as an A&R man. “I've long said that the artists who play with shifting genres would define the time. That is what we are witnessing now in music.” —Gail Mitchell

The largest distributor of independent music in the world is closing in on $2 billion in annual sales, Billboard estimates, and three big reasons for its success are its distribution of international superstars Bad Bunny, Blackpink and Oasis. “Their global success reflects the diversity of our roster and is proof that music from anywhere can resonate with audiences everywhere,” Navin says.He points out that Bad Bunny was Spotify's No. 1 global artist and sold out 31 shows during his San Juan residency, pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the island's economy and sharing its culture and history with the world. “Bad Bunny is a once-in-a-generation artist, and our partners at [his label and management company] Rimas are true visionaries,” he says.In the United States alone, Bad Bunny racked up 5.8 million album consumption units in 2025, including 8.3 billion streams, and Oasis and Blackpink combined achieved 758,000 album consumption units, including 975 million streams.Beyond revenue, those three acts helped boost The Orchard's already considerable U.S. market share. Through the end of 2025, the indie distributor's overall market share is 7.93% year to date, up from 7.17% for the corresponding period of 2024. Current market share rose from 7.30% to 8.44% for the same measurement periods, while catalog share increased from 7.13% to 7.78%.Theis says new additions to The Orchard's roster in 2025 include Alta Music, the label launched last year by former Spotify global head of music Jeremy Erlich, and Encore Recordings, the label started by veteran record executive Joie Manda in 2022. “We also recently launched new relationships with Gorillaz, Grupo Frontera and Andrew Lloyd Webber through our client The Other Songs,” she says, adding that among the artists The Orchard will be working “to elevate global success to new heights this year” is RAYE, who performed at Glastonbury, the Grammy Awards, the Academy Awards, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony and the NFL's first London halftime show in 2025 — and, Theis adds, is gearing up for a world tour.As The Orchard's global footprint expands, Navin says he particularly enjoys unlocking new markets and new opportunities for labels. “We have the best global team in the business,” he says. “Our commitment to connecting artists with their fans is stronger than ever.” —E.C.

“We have increased our investment in culturally impactful music, theater and film every year at Concord,” Valentine says. “And we intend to continue — with plans to work with more artists, for new partnerships and for expansion into new territories.” On the frontline side, “We acquired Stem Distribution, which provides artists with new options to work with Concord in a way that best suits their needs,” he says, adding that the acquisition of Broadway Licensing Global further cements Concord Theatrical as one of the world's top theatrical rights holders, while film/TV division Concord Originals' purchase of RKO secured derivative rights to 5,000-plus titles including classics King Kong and Citizen Kane.In July, Concord announced one of the biggest business deals of 2025. The company raised nearly $1.8 billion through an asset-backed security, issuing a series of new five-year, seven-year and 10-year senior notes secured by its catalog of more than 1.3 million music copyrights, which includes songs by The Beatles, Beyoncé, Bruno Mars, Daddy Yankee, Ed Sheeran, Michael Jackson, Pink Floyd, Rihanna, Taylor Swift and The Rolling Stones.The son of a music teacher, Valentine says “the number of intermediaries companies must deal with will continue to make it hard for us as an industry to enter into agreements that can unlock value for artists and songwriters.” He cites the Mechanical Licensing Collective as an example of moving toward a “more rational mechanism” for customers to cohesively access rights. —C.A.O.

Last year, Eshak and Majid took home Billboard's Power 100 Executives of the Year honors after revitalizing the storied label founded by Chris Blackwell and minting two major breakthrough stars, Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan. In 2024, both were nominated in all of the Big Four Grammy categories — record, song and album of the year and best new artist — an unprecedented achievement for a single label. (Roan ultimately won the lattermost award, while Carpenter took home best pop vocal album and best pop solo performance.)Then the label did it again, following up its blockbuster 2024 with another one-two punch of best new artist nominees in 2025 — this time, Olivia Dean and Lola Young — as well as a second straight album of the year nomination for Carpenter with Man's Best Friend, making her just the seventh artist in the past 45 years to be nominated for that honor in two consecutive years.“[2024] was like a dream scenario, and everything felt new,” Majid says. This past year, then, was “an incredible test for the staff, who fully delivered.” Adds Eshak: “I feel like the label proposition crystallized for us in a lot of ways. We learned who we were.”This year's breakthroughs — which helped Island finish the year with a 2.81% current market share —came about differently from those of Carpenter and Roan. Dean and Young were both signed by Island's U.K. partners, Capitol U.K. for Dean and Island U.K. for Young, but both caught fire the Island way: through steady touring, word of mouth and cultural touchstones like key festival performances and memorable media moments.“So much of what's happening in music right now is culturally driven, and a lot of it just starts with who we have the good fortune to work with,” Eshak says. “We didn't sign those artists, but I think they were both attracted to what we were doing at Island.”The label is more than just a handful of acts. Island boasts a deep roster of talent that includes Remi Wolf, Gigi Perez, newly signed Suki Waterhouse, Charlie Crockett, Alabama Shakes, Keshi and Medium Build. “We're really happy with the direction the company is going in,” Majid says, “and I hope Island represents something that feels very different from everyone else.” —D.R.

Big Loud celebrated its 10th anniversary as a label last year at a time when its artists delivered some of their strongest works yet and helped push its year-end current market share to 2.51%. Billboard's top artist of 2025, Morgan Wallen, debuted at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart in May with I'm the Problem — which replaced his own One Thing at a Time — and remained at the top through the end of the year. He also placed more songs on the Billboard Hot 100 in the chart year (39) than any other act in any genre.Big Loud's year wasn't wall-to-wall Wallen, however. HARDY's “Favorite Country Song” became his fifth track to crack the top 10 of the Country Airplay chart; and Stephen Wilson Jr. turned in some of the most talked-about performances at the Country Music Association Awards. Big Loud also expanded its reach through partnerships with ERNEST's DeVille Records and the continued success of Big Loud Texas with Miranda Lambert, Jon Randall, Brendon Anthony and Dylan Gossett's debut album, Westward. —Jessica Nicholson

HYBE isn't content to export acts to the United States and elsewhere outside of South Korea. The K-pop juggernaut has employed its “multihome, multigenre” strategy to establish foreign bases of operations and utilize its K-pop-style approach to artist and fandom development.Stateside, HYBE partnered with Geffen Records to launch KATSEYE, which was nominated for a best new artist Grammy. In Latin America, an audition process led to the creation of boy band Santos Bravos. In the world's two most populous countries, HYBE is establishing HYBE China and HYBE India as regional hubs.It's not all young artist development at HYBE, though. In 2025, established acts Seventeen topped Billboard's Top Album Sales chart with Happy Burstday while Tomorrow X Together's The Star Chapter: Together and ENHYPEN's Desire: Unleash both reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200.—G.P.

Love it or hate it, AI music is here, and no company is more synonymous with its rise than Suno. Helmed by Cambridge, Mass.-based CEO Shulman, Suno made its arrival thunderous in the music business in 2025.Over the last year, a number of songs and recordings created in part, or completely, by generative AI have gone viral on streaming services, shocking some music lovers. Many of those viral moments have been aided by Suno — including The Velvet Sundown, Xania Monet and the song “I Run” by HAVEN.Suno is still in the midst of a copyright infringement lawsuit with two of the three major-label groups — Universal and Sony — because it allegedly used their recordings for training without a license. The company is also being sued by European collection societies GEMA and Koda and facing two suits filed by indie musicians. But Warner opted to settle its part of the major-label lawsuit with the company in late 2025, signaling that there might be a broader reconciliation with the music business ahead.The AI music company has created a formidable moat with the $250 million series C funding round it announced in November that was led by Menlo Ventures, NVIDIA and Hallwood Media — the lattermost the first music company to publicly back Suno. “It means a ton,” Shulman says of Hallwood. “They are not the only ones [who've invested from the music business], but they are the only ones who are public about backing us. It feels like the first domino.”Suno has also expanded its service by adding features to attract seasoned musicians, such as Suno Studio, which the company refers to it as a “generative audio workstation.” “We still have that party trick [of creating songs at the click of a button] as your first experience,” Shulman says. “But there's now something that backs it up. You stay because you realize there's a lot more there, and you realize you really, really love to make music.”In his announcement about the latest funding round, Shulman said that he's seeing the “future of music take shape in real time.”So, what does that future look like? “The future of music is interactive music,” Shulman says. “It's music that you play with, not that you play, and that is how you make it more valuable for people.” —K.R.

Verde sees running the major Latin music label, which finished last year with a 2.01% current market share, as “a combination of maintaining market leadership and fostering artistic projects.” Over the past year, he's managed to successfully walk that tightrope with the help of a roster that includes Shakira, Manuel Turizo, Kappo, Rauw Alejandro, Rosalía (whose landmark album LUX is being worked in tandem with Columbia Records) and five-time Latin Grammy winners CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso (an alternative duo on Sony's boutique label 5020). “It's a balance I have to achieve. I couldn't run a single company with a single style or a single kind of musical proposal,” Verde says, noting the company also doubled down on audiovisual content this past year. “I love that Sony is different and that this is the roster we've built.” —L.C.

At the top of 2025, Slaiby transitioned out of his SALXCO CEO role and passed the reins to Lindsay Unwin, a 15-year veteran of the ­company, and the artist management firm did not lose a step. Jamaican singer-rapper Shenseea nailed a global crossover smash with her “Shake It to the Max” remix (with MOLIY, Silent Addy and Skillibeng), which spent 27 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart. Metro Boomin delivered a cultural reset with A Futuristic Summa thanks to the college football-­approved hit “Take Me Thru Dere” (with Quavo, Breskii and YKNIECE).The Weeknd, who Slaiby manages with Amir “Cash” Esmailian, earned his fifth Billboard 200 No. 1 album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, and a Hot 100 top 10 hit with the Playboi Carti-assisted “Timeless” (No. 3). His After Hours Til Dawn Tour was No. 4 on Billboard's year-end Top Tours chart with $336.7 million. Since launching in 2022, it has grossed over $700 million, become the top-earning R&B tour in history.SALXCO also oversaw a particularly buzzy year for Grammy-winning R&B legend Brandy. The Hot 100 chart-topper joined forces with Monica for The Boy Is Mine tour, which drew splashy attendees like Michelle Obama, Beyoncé and Jay-Z and helped promote Brandy's Lifetime holiday movie, Christmas Everyday, and the March 2026 release of her Phases memoir. —K.D.

The marquee deal for Moscowitz's Santa Anna, the distribution/label services company that he founded with Sony Music in 2023, was last year's distribution/marketing partnership with Drake's OVO Sound that produced an immediate success: Drake and PartyNextDoor's No. 1 album, $ome $exy $ongs 4 U. Also in 2025, Alamo developed artists from established hip-hop superstars Rod Wave and Lil Durk to country singer Bayker Blankenship, singer-rapper Lazer Dim and rapper Pradabagshawty. “Seeing the whole label consistently ranked in the top 10 for current market share alongside the major labels has been incredibly gratifying for the whole staff,” Moscowitz told Billboard in September.Moscowitz, who started his career at hip-hop institutions Def Jam Recordings and Rush Communications, rose to co-president/CEO at Warner Bros. Records, then helped to create 300 Entertainment, the Lyor Cohen-Kevin Liles label that assisted in breaking Young Thug, Migos and Megan Thee Stallion. He founded indie Cold Heat Records, rebranded it as Alamo in 2016, then in 2021 sold a majority stake to Sony, where the label is in the process of breaking Bossman Dlow, blackbear, Smokepurpp and others. “Having successful [artists] actually makes development of new acts a lot easier,” he said in September. “It eases the financial pressure and allows you to take more chances, to be riskier and lean into the creative more.”Moscowitz explained the three-tiered structure of his Foundation distribution company, Alamo and Santa Anna to Billboard: “Santa Anna has let us get involved with artists that we love very early in the creative process while they are still figuring things out. And it allows us to support them without any of the pressure of the major-label system. It's essentially an incubator.” For this building a system within a system, Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer called Moscowitz a “visionary.” Says Moscowitz: “You have to be more nimble and open to constant disruption than ever before.” —S.K.

The publisher continued to ride high on Billboard's Publishers Quarterly rankings in 2025, usually landing the No. 4 spot on both the Hot 100 Songs and Top Radio Airplay charts. Split Enz founder and Crowded House contributor Tim Finn and DJ-producer Disco Neil signed global publishing deals with Kobalt, which also brokered a worldwide administration deal with indie Mexican publisher K Music Publishing. Additionally, according to the company, it expanded its intellectual property strategy through a partnership with Morgan Stanley, which in 2024 made available $700 million to fund music asset deals. “In 2025, we focused on building a more agile, future-ready publishing organization,” Hubert says. “We also heavily invested in creators, including launching KOSIGN, a service that leverages Kobalt's best-in-class technology for up-and-coming artists, producers and songwriters,” which, he adds, has already seen success, “and we're just getting started.” According to Hubert, KOSIGN has received more than 23,000 applications, of which nearly 2,000 fit the company's criteria and were welcomed into the system, and he says that “several promising songwriters have already been upstreamed to Kobalt proper.”—E.C.

Neal helped country phenomenon Morgan Wallen navigate a year during which he was named Billboard's top artist of 2025, thanks in large part to the spectacular success of his album I'm the Problem. In addition to having the No. 2 Billboard 200 album of the year — topped only by Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl — Wallen landed 39 songs on the Hot 100 in 2025, more than any other act. Of those, nine reached the top 10, including the chart-topping “What I Want” (featuring Tate McRae). The RIAA also declared him as the No. 1 certified country artist in history and third in all genres (behind only Drake and Swift). Wallen is hardly Neal's only successful client. Nate Smith, Riley Green, HARDY, Ella Langley, Ole 60, Matthew West and Anne Wilson are booked by The Neal Agency in addition to Wallen, while Sticks Management's roster includes Gavin Adcock and Wallen. “All of our clients are reaching new heights in touring, music and awards,” Neal says of the past year. “Watching them achieve their dreams, and knowing our team has played a role, is the most rewarding achievement.” This year already looks like a strong one: Green is headed out on his first major arena headlining tour, while Wallen has announced 21 stadium shows with support including HARDY, Brooks & Dunn, Langley and Thomas Rhett. —Melinda Newman

Gardner was promoted to TikTok's top music business gig in February, replacing Ole Obermann, and she wasted no time putting into action a number of changes and new initiatives at the streaming and social media platform.In a year during which parent company ByteDance finally reached a deal in December to create a U.S. joint venture controlled by Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates-based MGX; shut down its music streaming service, TikTok Music; and reduced its workforce, Gardner says it's “business as usual” for her staff. “Our valued industry partners remain the highest priority,” she says.Under Gardner's leadership, TikTok is doubling down on providing tools for songwriters and artists to get discovered on the platform, as well as e-commerce opportunities and special live experiences to strengthen fan connections. Over the last year, Gardner's team has staged a number of concerts and pop-up events for artists' top fans. One notable example was a TikTok event with Miley Cyrus at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, which invited a select few fans to hear an intimate performance of her new album, Something Beautiful. “We thought that there would be a great opportunity to invite the fans that have the greatest engagement with an artist on TikTok to see the artist in person, even if that does mean going off the platform for a bit.”Gardner says her philosophy is that major in-person moments inspire fans to post even more. “Right now, we're finding a way to create joyful intimate moments in a way that encourages fans to film and to bring them back onto TikTok.” —K.R.

Blavatnik — the son of the founder of Warner Music Group's largest shareholder, Access Industries — has been quietly flexing his influence behind the scenes since taking a seat on the WMG board in April 2023. And while in 2024 that included having a hand in helping with the executive transition and subsequent restructuring at Atlantic Records, this past year his focus has been “wider and more global,” he says — a purview he has taken on while he finishes up his studies at Harvard Business School. That has included artist-specific initiatives like helping renegotiate Zach Bryan's deal with Warner Records, worth a reported $360 million — “Zach's a once-in-a-generation talent,” Blavatnik says — and more sprawling initiatives like honing WMG's AI strategy and distribution plans, after the company overhauled ADA's leadership and placed it under the purview of Warner Latin chief Alejandro Duque. “We've really recommitted to growing our presence in distribution,” Blavatnik says. “There's a lot of momentum and a lot of room for us to grow. We're always keeping our antenna up for bolt-on [mergers and acquisitions] targets that could either boost our capabilities or open up new markets.”On the AI front, Warner is the only major label to have settled the lawsuits against generative AI music companies Suno and Udio, while also doing deals with MusixMatch, KLAY, Stability AI and others. “At Warner, our guiding principle is getting compensation and safeguards for artists and songwriters, [and] we're only doing deals with companies that commit to our principles,” he says about the strategy. “The music business, in my view, has always been late to innovate, and I think we have this incredible opportunity here to at least be on time and not fight innovation.”—D.R.

At weekend one of Coachella 2024, during her main stage sunset slot, Sabrina Carpenter gave her then-new single, “Espresso,” its live debut — and by the festival's second weekend, “we knew things had shifted,” recalls her manager, Janelle Lopez Genzink.“It was obviously really exciting,” the Volara Management founder ­continues, “but it was also slightly nerve-wracking, because we knew we were stepping into a meaningful cultural moment that was going to ­continue to grow.”“Espresso” went on to become Billboard's No. 1 global song of the ­summer for 2024 and introduced Carpenter's Grammy-winning, chart-­topping sixth album, Short n' Sweet, released that August; two subsequent singles from the set, “Please Please Please” and “Taste,” hit Nos. 1 and 2 on the Hot 100, respectively. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Volara was ­growing, too. By mid-2024, Lopez Genzink signed pop singer MARINA — who says Lopez Genzink “is one of the few who puts human beings first and commerce second” — and hired a new day-to-day manager, Bianca Nour, to join Volara's tight team, which then consisted of early hires Amy Davidson and Merce Jessor.By the start of 2025, Volara added another act to its roster: HAIM. “They're my favorite rock band out there,” says Lopez Genzink, who was introduced to the trio through its attorney.“Working with Janelle has been the greatest partnership,” the band's Alana Haim says. “From the very beginning, her focus was always on supporting our vision and bringing our dreams to life. No idea is too crazy or too big — she makes you feel like anything is possible, and with her, it truly is.”

The former digital marketing gurus followed Elliot Grainge from 10K Projects to Atlantic Music Group in the fall of 2024 and finished the year with a 7.75% current market share (which includes their former label and 300 Entertainment) — up 0.60 percentage points from the previous year. In an interview with Billboard in October, Talamo said of their arrival at the division formerly run by Julie Greenwald and Craig Kallman: “[First ] we had to go through and see what we felt we could immediately sprinkle our magic dust on, so to speak. Second was the team. We met everybody and talked to them at length. Then we had to decide how we wanted to structure everything — from a marketing standpoint, from an A&R standpoint,” he added. “Really getting under the hood and seeing how we could make it more efficient and more effective in the current music climate.”The two executives say they're now at cruising altitude. In that same interview, Friedman said, “The entrepreneurial spirit and the indie spirit definitely flow through Atlantic now. We don't say no a lot here. People are given the reins to build things and be their own boss, which is really powerful. —F.D.

""Welcome to Melanie Martinez's new world order,"" reads a statement accompanying the surprise release. ""Cry Baby is dead.""

	And just like that, Melanie Martinez is back.


	The New York-born. Latin-American singer, songwriter and alt-pop phenom returns with “POSSESSION,” an edgy number built on a bed of rock.


	“Welcome to Melanie Martinez's new world order,” reads a statement accompanying the surprise release. “Cry Baby is dead.”


	It's her first new music since 2023's Portals, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, her third consecutive top 10 appearance on the chart. Portals went all the way to No. 1 on Australia's ARIA Chart.


	The new track “peels back the ways power can masquerade as love,” read a message from Warner Music. “The song is haunting, satirical and spotlights Melanie's trademark blend of charm, mischief and bite.”

	On “POSSESSION,” Martinez tackles the ugly scenario of domestic violence, singing: “He leaves me all alone, from dusk to f—in' dawn / I'll clean up after all his s—, I'm the housekeeper / He comes home drunk at night, of course he picks a fight, I try my best to bite my tongue, but it keeps bleedin'.”

	Martinez's star rose in 2012 as a contestant on season 3 of The Voice. Although she didn't collect top prize, there's little doubt that she's a winner, bagging 30 billion-plus career streams, upwards of 5.5 billion official YouTube views and more than 62 million followers across platforms.

	











	Her debut album from 2015, Cry Baby, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 and spawned the perfume of the same name, which was self-released the following year and was a sell-out. Later, she partnered with Flower Shop Perfume on a perfume line, the first of which arrived in 2023 — with similar success to its predecessor. The collection has since expanded to include candles, body sprays, and perfume pendants. ​


	In 2024, Martinez set out on her first-ever global arena headline trek, The Trilogy Tour, on which she played to sold-out successive nights at Madison Square Garden, and hit the stage at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Corona Capital Festival in Mexico City.

Two years after the music giant and other publishers sued the Claude creator, they've filed an even bigger case aimed at a legal weak spot for AI companies.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	Universal Music Group (UMG) has filed another sweeping copyright lawsuit against artificial intelligence firm Anthropic, this time potentially seeking more than $3 billion in damages by focusing on accusations that the Claude creator used “pirate libraries” of music to build its models.


	Six months after a judge ruled in a separate case that AI companies could face huge damages for training models on illegally-acquired datasets, UMG says in a Wednesday (Jan. 28) lawsuit that that's exactly what Anthropic did to teach Claude to spit out new song lyrics.

	The new case, which comes as UMG and other majors have begun striking huge settlements with other AI firms, claims that Anthropic's “multibillion-dollar business empire” was “built on piracy.”


	“Publishers recognize the great potential of ethical AI as a powerful tool for the future,” write lawyers for UMG and numerous other publishers in the lawsuit, obtained by Billboard. “However, it remains crucial that AI technology be developed and employed ethically and responsibly, in a manner that protects the rights of publishers and songwriters, their livelihoods, and the creative ecosystem as a whole. Doing so will ensure that AI enhances — rather than imperils — human creativity.”


	The lawsuit claims Anthropic illegally acquired sheet music to “hundreds or thousands” of songs owned UMG and the other publishers, including iconic tunes like The Rolling Stones' “Wild Horses,” Neil Diamond's “Sweet Caroline,” Elton John's “Bennie and the Jets,” Creedance Clearwater Revival's “Have You Ever Seen The Rain,” Maroon Five's “She Will Be Loved,” and Katy Perry's “California Gurls.”


	The new case adds to an earlier lawsuit filed against Anthropic in 2023 by UMG, Concord Music Group, ABKCO and a slew of other music publishers, claiming the AI firm was violating copyrights en masse by using songs without authorization to teach its Claude models how to create new lyrics. Like other AI companies facing a flood of such litigation over the past three years, Anthropic strongly denies those allegations, arguing that the training is instead a so-called “fair use” of copyrighted materials.


	In a ruling last year in a separate case filed against Anthropic by book authors, a federal judge ruled that AI training itself is covered by fair use — a major legal win for the AI industry. But the ruling came with a huge catch: the judge ruled that tech companies must legally acquire the training materials in the first place and would likely be on the hook for enormous infringement damages if they didn't.


	In the wake of that ruling, UMG and the music publishers moved to update their lawsuit with new allegations that Anthropic had relied on millions of books containing sheet music it illegally downloaded from file-sharing sites. But that bid to amend the case was denied by the judge as procedurally improper.


	The result of that decision is Wednesday's new lawsuit, in which UMG and the other publishers expressly cite that procedural backstory and say they were forced to file a new case that is “distinct and separate” to attack Anthropic's alleged piracy.


	“Publishers recently discovered that defendants downloaded by torrenting an enormous number of unauthorized copies of publishers' works from illegal shadow libraries to avoid paying for those works,” the publishers write. “To the extent defendants now try to absolve themselves of liability for this blatant theft by claiming that Anthropic later used some subset of these stolen works for AI training, any such claimed use is irrelevant.”


	A spokesperson for Anthropic did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday.


	In a statement to Billboard, the music companies said they were forced to file the second case because of Anthropic's “persistent and brazen infringement” in using illegally acquired works: “In total, we are suing for infringement of more than 20,000 songs, with potential statutory damages of more than $3 billion. We believe this will be one of the largest (if not the single-largest) non-class action copyright cases filed in the U.S.”

					By Denise Petski 

Senior Managing Editor


Prime Video has set March 20 for the Season 2 premiere of Jury Duty. Titled Jury Duty Presents: Company Retreat, the latest installment form the Jury Duty creative team will launch with three episodes, followed by two episodes on March 27, and a three-episode finale on April 3. It will be available in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.


	Co-created and executive produced by Lee Eisenberg  (Lessons In Chemistry, The Office) and Gene Stupnitsky (Hello Ladies, The Office), Jury Duty Presents: Company Retreat is a documentary-style comedy that captures a corporate offsite event at a family-owned hot sauce company from the perspective of Anthony, a recently hired temporary worker. Unbeknownst to Anthony, the entire experience is staged, every colleague around him is performing a role, and each moment – whether in conference rooms or during downtime – has been meticulously orchestrated. As the founder prepares to step down, the getaway transforms into a clash between big corporate ambitions and small business values, with control of the company hanging in the balance.

	











Jury Duty's first installment chronicled the inner workings of an American jury trial through the eyes of one particular juror, Ronald Gladden. Gladden is unaware the entire case is fake, everyone except him is an actor, and everything that happens — inside the courtroom and out — is carefully planned.

	As we reported last year, the theme of the new installment is David Vs. Goliath, which centers on a small business going on a company retreat. To protect the integrity of the premise with the regular person not realizing that they are part of a scripted TV show, just like they did with Season 1, the casting and production of the new installment was done in a clandestine manner.


	Jake Szymanski (7 Days in Hell, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates) directs and executive produces the series. David Bernad (The White Lotus, Bad Trip) also executive produces with Todd Schulman (The Chair Company, Who Is America?), Nicholas Hatton (Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, Who Is America?), Anthony King (The Afterparty, Silicon Valley), Chris Kula (Wrecked, Community), James Marsden (Paradise, Sonic The Hedgehog 3) and Ruben Fleischer (Superstore, St. Denis Medical).

	











Jury Duty launched in 2023 to strong critical recognition, earning a Peabody Award and AFI Award as well as four Emmy nominations including Outstanding Comedy Series, two Golden Globes nominations and two Critics Choice Award nominations.

International Reporter


Odessa A'zion said Wednesday in a series of Instagram posts that she has dropped out of Sean Durkin's A24 film Deep Cuts following online backlash surrounding her casting. 


Deep Cuts is an adaptation of Holly Brickley's 2021 novel of the same name. After A'zion's casting was announced earlier this week, fans of the book noted that the character of Zoe Gutierrez, which A'zion was set to portray, was of Mexican heritage and Jewish. A'zion is not Mexican, which fans online argued was an irreconcilable difference. 


	Posting on her Instagram stories, A'zion said she agreed with the criticism and had not been fully aware of the character's identity before accepting the role.

	“Guys!! I am with ALL of you and I am NOT doing this movie,” A'zion posted. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Thank you guys for bringing this to my attention. I AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU! This is why I love you guys. I'm so sorry that this happened. It is SO important for me to let you in on how it all went down: I went in for Percy, but was offered Zoe instead and instantly said yes! I'm so pissed y'all, I hadn't read the book and should have paid more attention to all aspects of Zoe before accepting…and now that I know what I know???”


	A'zion added: “Fuck that. I'm out! I'd never take a role from someone else that's meant to do it. That SHOULD do it! That's not me. There are a plentitude of people more than capable of playing this role and I am not one of them. I can't wait to see who it ends up being.”

	











	Set in the 2000s, Deep Cuts is a love story about two music-obsessed twentysomethings navigating the messy realities of ambition, belonging, and adulthood over the course of an era-defining decade.


Civil War star Cailee Spaeny and Queer star Drew Starkey lead the film. The adaptation was initially set up with Saoirse Ronan and Austin Butler, but following scheduling conflicts, both stars dropped out. 


	Eli Bush, Ronald Bronstein, and Josh Safdie are producing alongside Durkin, Anthony Katagas, Jordan Tappis, and A24. Brickley serves as an executive producer.

Um – so how could she or her team now know about the character's heritage on a role they negotiated for her to play?

Hopefully the role goes to one of several qualified Latinas currently working but it doesn't sit right with me that A'zion was met with backlash for accepting the job when it's the producers who are to blame for offering it in the first place.

People should go easy on her. She obviously didn't know that the character of Zoe Gutierrez was a Latina. If only she'd read the book, otherwise how could she possibly be expected to know?

How do you accept a role and have no idea of the character's ethnicity? How odd. Must be missing some info.

So some of these up an comers do actually have a spine, integrity and most of all an awareness about the impact their decisions have on onthers. It seems to be a dying breed, but these exceptions once in while do give hope. Hope some of these young actors, with huge following take notice and use their voices and influence in a similar way. It is needed more than ever!

	The Library of Congress on Wednesday revealed 25 films it is adding to its National Film Registry, movies that span the silent film era as far back as 1896 to Wes Anderson's 2014 nine-time Oscar-nominated The Grand Budapest Hotel.


	Other films to make the cut for the registry, which chooses films annually for their cultural, historic or aesthetic importance to the nation's film heritage, include Christopher Nolan's Inception, the Civil War drama Glory, the original The Karate Kid, Pixar's The Incredibles, Amy Heckerling's Clueless, and a pair of musicals in 1954's White Christmas and 1956's High Society.

	











	The list also included the Tom Hanks-starring AIDS drama Philadelphia, Peter Weir's The Truman Show, Richard Linklater's 1995 romantic trilogy starter Before Sunrise, the Salma Hayek-starring biopic Frida and John Carpenter's 1982 cult sci-i horror film The Thing which the library said received the most nomination votes by the public.

	Four documentaries were also selected: Ken Burns' Brooklyn Bridge, Nancy Buirski's The Loving Story, George Nierenberg's Say Amen, Somebody and Danny Tedesco's The Wrecking Crew.


	The latest class bring the total number of titles in the registry to 925, with some among the 2 million moving image collection items held in the Library of Congress. Others are preserved in coordination with copyright holders or other film archives, the library says.


	“When we preserve films, we preserve American culture for generations to come. These selections for the National Film Registry show us that films are instrumental in capturing important parts of our nation's story,” Acting Librarian of Congress Robert R. Newlen said in a release today. “We are proud to continue this important work, adding a broad range of 25 films to the National Film Registry as a collective effort in the film community to protect our cinematic heritage.”

	











	Below is the full list of 2025 entries into the National Film Register.

Whatever movie stars are made of, Margot Robbie's got it.

The Australian beauty hit the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere of “Wuthering Heights” Wednesday night, paying homage to a Hollywood legend dramatic fashion.

Robbie, who plays Catherine Earnshaw in the Emerald Fennell-directed film, set jaws wagging with one accessory: Elizabeth Taylor's iconic Taj Mahal diamond necklace.

The heart-shaped pendant — featuring the Taj Mahal diamond set in a Cartier necklace — was famously gifted to the late star by her husband Richard Burton on her 40th birthday.

Mounted in jade with a custom gold, ruby and diamond chain the bauble is the ultimate passion piece; The Parsee inscription reads: “Love is Everlasting” as well as the name of Nur Jahan, who received the piece as a gift from her husband, the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahangir.

She added custom diamond earrings designed by celebrity jeweler Lorraine Schwartz, who was a close friend of Taylor's. The drop earrings feature 38 carats of old-cut diamonds, set in blackened bronzed gold.

She also wore a 19th-century ruby and diamond ring from Fred Leighton to round out the incredible jewelry.

As for her outfit, Robbie wore a striking crimson and black Schiaparelli gown, consisting of a strapless black lace corset with a dramatically flared skirt in shades of black and red.

When asked about the inspiration behind the ensemble by Variety, Robbie explained, “This is ‘Wuthering Heights.' If we were to make ‘Wuthering Heights' into a dress, what would it look like? This idea of it soaking up the ground … and seeping up into the dress. The dark lace and the dark sort of decay.”

“Our outfits are going to evolve throughout the press tour to cover some of the seats and ideas in the film,” she added.

The forthcoming movie, out on Valentine's Day, sees Robbie opposite Jacob Elordi, who plays Heathcliff in the Emily Brontë adaptation, and who also stepped out on the red carpet alongside Robbie.

For his part, the “Euphoria” actor looked dapper an all-black Bottega Veneta suit, accented with a black foulard around his neck and a cummerbund. He added all Cartier jewelry including stud earrings, a diamond and ruby tie pin and a diamond ring.

Earlier in the day, Robbie turned up the heat in a red-hot snakeskin Dilara Findikoglu outfit.

The jaw-dropping look featuring a shell-covered bra, corset and barely-there miniskirt that showed off swaths of thigh and dipped low in the front.

She added an enormous pear-shaped diamond choker and wore the Cece Jewellery custom ring that Robbie gifted Elordi featuring two skeletons intertwined.

Robbie, who was a pioneer of the method-dressing trend with 2023's “Barbie,” has already begun her “Wuthering Heights” transformation. She kicked off the promo tour with a stop at “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” wearing a totally sheer black lace McQueen dress and heels featuring a rosary bead embellishment.

She's been favoring bell sleeves in tribute to the Elizabethan-era film, also sporting a Roberto Cavalli mini and sky-high Christian Louboutin heels.

Stylist Andrew Makumal explained the inspiration behind a duo of feather-covered Victoria Beckham looks — one featuring a black corset and the other a very angelic minidress — quoting from the 1847 book.

“Tossing about, she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth…she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species,” he wrote on Instagram.

We can't wait to see all the romantic and increasingly frenetic looks the pair have in store.

Halle Berry is aging like fine wine. 

The actress, 59, flaunted her figure in a black plunging body suit and silver bejeweled skirt while at the “Crime 101” premiere in London on Wednesday.

She accessorized with black platform heels, a long floral necklace and chunky rings.

Berry styled her hair in light waves and wore nude-colored glam.

At one point, the “Catwoman” star posed alongside her co-stars Chris Hemsworth, Bart Layton, Monica Barbaro, Jury Member and Mark Ruffalo.

The Bart Layton-directed thriller is set for release on Feb. 13. 

Berry previously told Page Six that it was a “privilege to age” while divulging her must-have skincare product, Lancôme Rénergie C.R.x. Triple Serum Retinol.

“I love that I'm more confident than I've ever been,” she said. “I feel good in my skin; I've taken care of my skin.”

The “Gothika” star shared that her skin was “drier than it ever used to be” since entering perimenopause, until she found the peptide-based product.

Berry emphasized that she was embracing aging, adding, “It's not about taking your wrinkles away.”

“We've earned every one of these lines, and they're OK,” she said. 

“That's part of our beauty as we age. What it does is it just softens those lines, so you don't have to lose your smile.”

The “Die Another Day” star has also focused on fitness since entering menopause, and announced her partnership with Peloton in October.

“The answer is YES. 💪🏽 Exercise can make a real difference during menopause,” she captioned a photo of herself flexing her muscles in a black workout set.

Berry often shows off her toned body in tiny bikinis, and admitted menopause has taught her not to “give a f–k” about other people's opinions about what she wears or how she moves.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Wonder Man is a mostly pleasant binge with some unexpectedly moving moments","https://www.avclub.com/wonder-man-review-tv-disney-plus-marvel","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:01:00 GMT","

If you're a longtime Avengers comics fan, you probably noticed the superhero Wonder Man's prolonged absence from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character debuted more than 60 years ago in 1964's Avengers No. 9 as a supervillain who eventually reformed and sacrificed himself for the team. Returning literally from the dead, he joined the Avengers full time in the mid-1970s. Now, Wonder Man finally arrives in the MCU but with limited fanfare. That seems odd considering the powerhouse of talent behind the miniseries, which includes director Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings and the upcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day) and showrunner Andrew Guest (Community and Brooklyn Nine-Nine). 

The marketing rollout for Wonder Man was even more subdued than Ironheart's, which hadn't seemed possible. Disney+ will release all eight episodes at once, which led to chatter that Marvel is cutting its losses and burying the show with little ceremony. Whether that's true or not, the release schedule was ultimately a good move that improves the show's overall enjoyment. So far, the only Marvel series that worked better as weekly installments were 2021's WandaVision and its 2024 sequel Agatha All Along. As binge viewing, Wonder Man is a pleasant diversion with some unexpectedly moving moments, thanks mostly to engaging performances from its leading men.

Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is a struggling Hollywood actor who pursues that elusive big break with the same single-minded purpose as Captain Ahab. When he learns that acclaimed director Von Kovak (Zlatko Burić) is remaking a beloved movie from his childhood, Wonder Man, he knows this is the role he was born to play. 

Abdul-Matteen (Watchmen, Black Mirror) is often cast in parts that conflict with his obvious leading-man attractiveness. Simon is awkward and sometimes downright dorky. His commitment to his craft is almost too easy a target—the actor takes himself a little too seriously, which costs him work—but Abdul-Matteen's performance is so natural that he avoids cliché. However, Simon is a difficult person to know. He intentionally puts up barriers around himself; his relationship with his family is strained; and he has no real friends. His isolation is clearly self-imposed: He's keeping a secret from everyone, including the audience, and the show's inherent mystery requires that we don't see too much of the world through his eyes. This is where Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) comes in. 

In 2013's Iron Man 3, Trevor was the actor who played the controversial red-herring villain the Mandarin. Now released from prison, Trevor tries to rebuild his life and befriends Simon to this end. Trevor is our identification character, who is unwillingly cast into his most demanding role yet: a fun spin on the “one last job” career thief. Abdul-Mateen and Kingsley have great chemistry, and their characters' unlikely friendship, rooted in their mutual unrequited love for acting, provides the show's emotional center. 



This Iron Man connection is also a slight nod to Wonder Man's comic-book origin. Originally, Simon was a businessman whose company couldn't compete with Tony Stark's empire. He resorted to embezzlement; and when caught, he blamed Stark for the consequences of his own bad choices. That backstory is far too similar to those of past MCU villains, specifically Iron Man 3‘s Aldrich Killian and Spider-Man: Far From Home‘s Quentin Beck. So it makes sense to focus instead on Wonder Man's Hollywood aspirations. In his 1991 solo comic, Simon tried to balance acting with superheroics against a setting that was frequently more bizarre than any Skrull invasion. (Imagine if Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was also publicly a superhero.) There is significant comedic potential in an otherwise successful superhero still struggling to make it in Hollywood, where movie executives are just as diabolical as any villain. The Wonder Man series is similarly offbeat but can occasionally veer too far from escapist fantasy into mundane dramedy, which is bound to turn off audiences who didn't tune in to watch The Studio with superhero references. Decades ago, Buffy, Angel, and more than a few X-Files episodes demonstrated how a series can ground its epic fate-of-the-world stakes with humanizing comedy. Much like She-Hulk, Wonder Man struggles to maintain that balance.

Wonder Man can at times feel like the Netflix Marvel series from a decade ago, which seemed to exist in their own separate realities from the more bombastic MCU of the movies. This is perhaps not the show for anyone interested in traditional frenzied battles between costumed characters. Of course, fans are admittedly hard to please: Depending on who you ask, heavy continuity in Marvel shows and films can make each installment feel less accessible to new audiences, who must wade through hours of homework to understand what's happening. Other fans complain that the series in particular feel disconnected from any larger narrative and introduce characters and plot points that never pay off. How many post-credits scenes have gone nowhere? Secret Invasion might as well have never happened, which is probably a good thing. If this ends up the only Wonder Man story ever told onscreen, it's still worth watching. But that would also make this feel like a wasted opportunity, as both Simon Williams and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II have a lot of potential.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Giancarlo Esposito pulls no punches at Sundance: ""It's time for a revolution""","https://www.avclub.com/giancarlo-esposito-sundance-time-for-revolution","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:22:54 GMT","

The last decade or so of American politics has inspired a lot of political statements from the people of Hollywood, who are pretty clearly as freaked out by what feel like ongoing and inexorable shifts toward both national and global authoritarianism as the rest of us. But few have been as blunt about it as Giancarlo Esposito was this week, stepping up on his soapbox at the Sundance Film Festival and declaring, “This is time for a revolution—and they don't even know that's what they're starting.”

Esposito, at the festival to promote his new Jon Turturro movie The Only Living Pickpocket In New York, did not mince words or suggest he was being metaphorical in his language, drawing direct parallels between regimes in Russia, Iran, and the United States in his words to Variety: “We have to stand up to it. They can't take us all down. If the whole world showed up on Putin's doorstep or the Iranians' doorstep or in Washington, they'd kill 500 or 50 million or however [many], but the rest of us would survive with a new [world].”

Esposito was one of several stars wearing “ICE Out” pins at Sundance, referencing widespread discontent with both the nationwide emboldening of Immigration Customs and Enforcement in the second Trump administration, and the more specific violence happening in Minneapolis over the last several weeks. “Some very rich old white men are exerting their power to suppress our own people,” Esposito added, “Thus creating a feeling of civil war in the streets, preparing the haters to hate, teaching them how to shoot. This is all a preparation for a very insidious problem that's happening in our world. And for me, I have to speak out. We will not be ICE'd out. This is not going to happen.”

Esposito isn't the only star to speak out at Sundance: Elijah Wood, for instance, was quoted at a protest that broke out in Park City back on Sunday, organized in response to the killing of Alex Pretti in the Minnesota capital on Saturday. (Wood: “The folks who have been unlawfully gunned down in Minnesota—it's awful. Here we are at this film festival that is about bringing people together; it's about telling stories from all over the world. We're not divided here; we're coming together.”) Natalie Portman, Natasha Lyonne, Olivia Wilde, Tatiana Maslany, and more have sported the ICE Out pins, and spoken publicly about their unhappiness with the current regime and the ongoing violence.

It feels like we've been hearing about Henry Cavill and Chad Stahelski's Highlander remake for time immemorial at this point—which, now that we think about it, is pretty apt for a film franchise about various immortals running around chopping each others' heads off, while the regular human public blithely ignores all the random Tesla coil shows said decapitations produce. Now, though, we finally have a glimpse at what Cavill will look like in the film, and—oh, yep, that's a guy with wet-looking hair holding a sword. Yeah, that tracks.

 

 

A post shared by Henry Cavill (@henrycavill)



Cavill posted the photos to his Instagram as a first-look at the film, which reportedly began shooting recently, after months of delays caused by an injury Cavill suffered during pre-production rehearsals. Possibly owing to that recent start date, the photos take the perhaps unorthodox step of not showing Cavill's character Connor MacLeod as, well, a Highlander, i.e., a Scottish warrior from several hundred years ago, and instead showing him as just a sort of guy running around in the modern day in a trench coat. Admittedly, the original film—which starred Christopher Lambert, and became a cult hit after its release in 1986—had a lot of that sort of thing, too, as MacLeod faced off against his ancient enemy The Kurgan in modern day New York. But c'mon, Highlander, you can't give us a little bit of highland action, as a treat?

Highlander has a lot riding on it: Cavill, for his part, probably needs a win after the whole shakeout over his role as Superman a few years back, as well as his high-profile departure from his Netflix series The Witcher. Stahelski, in turn, is filming his first movie not set in his incredibly successful John Wick film franchise; Highlander will be a litmus test for whether his highly visceral brand of action can work without Keanu Reeves there to anchor the punches.

There's no word yet on when Highlander will land in theaters; Russell Crowe, Dave Bautista, and Karen Gillen are all slated to co-star.

No man is an island, even when they've turned their isolated lighthouse residence into Home Alone at the end of the world. Though the tough SOB played by Jason Statham in Shelter might be the kind of guy who doesn't bother naming his dog, a guy who knocks back vodka by the glass as he plays chess against himself, he's still got an action hero's heart of gold. He leads the second action movie out this January from director Ric Roman Waugh, whose (considerably worse) Greenland 2 also tormented the devoted and grizzled father figure at its core. Not content to simply carve a January Action Mt. Rushmore—whose stars are as rough and craggy as their granite equivalents—into his filmography, Waugh is also carving a B-movie niche for himself. Schlocky yet tangible, somewhere between the grim human drama of Greenland and the junky clichés that film mostly overcame, Shelter is Waugh's bargain-bin take on a Bourne-style supersoldier, thrust back into a life he left behind.

He also, sad to say, leaves behind his ridiculous booby-trapped island far too quickly. As you may have guessed, considering how rarely regular lighthouse keepers rig their homes in case of invasion, Mason (Statham) has a bit of a past. The light's never on in his dilapidated tower and the boat occasionally bringing him supplies isn't captained by a coworker, but rather an old military buddy. That buddy, and his buddy's young niece Jesse (Bodhi Rae Breathnach), brave the waves to restock Mason's rocky exile with fuel, food, and booze, seemingly more out of obligation than affection. That's how Mason treats it, giving them the cold shoulder until a storm rolls in and capsizes their ship. He dives in to save the day—saving Jesse, at least; sorry unnamed uncle—only for his heroics to eventually draw an escalating amount of unwanted attention from the mainland.

The spiraling out of screenwriter Ward Parry's spy-adjacent thriller isn't exactly satisfying or elegant. Once Mason and Jesse are forced to flee the island, all of its traps satisfyingly sprung and its various victims impaled, the majority of the script's less-inspired obstacles are caused or solved by an advanced surveillance system named T.H.E.A., which MI6 uses to tap into every single camera in the U.K. (whether that means security cams, phone cameras, or car dashcams) and which the film uses to justify whatever set piece it needs to reach next. Leaving the single location that actually gave Shelter some unique, isolated mystique, the grumpy badass killer and his newfound too-cute ward follow a predictable path—albeit, one that's more like a rowdy dirt road than a slick highway.

As the duo learn to care for each other, Waugh and his Greenland 2 cinematographer Martin Ahlgren shooting both Statham's glowering wrinkles and Breathnach's spunky freckles in frame-filling close-ups, they're pursued by killers and the audience's waning desire to know what the hell is going on. The former issue manifests in muddy off-road car chases, chaotic nightclub brawls, and brutal dockside showdowns. These scratch a primal itch with a welcome low-rent tactility. The latter issue is dealt with by requisite, expository cutaways to the high-tech den of monitors run by Naomi Ackie's MI6 agent, who has taken over for Bill Nighy's recently ousted MI6 head. Away from the relatively charismatic leads, these actors sit at keyboards and try to reenact the least essential Bourne scenes they half-remember from seeing them one Sunday afternoon on USA. “My God, it's actually him,” one agent will say. Another agent clickety-clacks to pull up a case file—but wait, something's not right. Thankfully these scenes don't last long, because there are more important things to get to: There are only 107 minutes in Shelter and nearly as many tropes.

But the pulp and action are sold by Statham with the resigned competence of a factory worker clocking in for a shift, and Breathnach's over-eager performance is balanced out by her expressive face. They're a decent team to watch go through the motions, running through underworld contacts and old pals who owe one last favor. A cold sadness starts to seep into the film, but never quite chills it to the core, as these two people realize how alone they really are without each other, and as Mason realizes that any survivors among his pursuers will one day age into sad men much like him. These are only fleeting notions, though, undercurrents flickering at the edges of the film's lizard-brain need for a father figure to protect his surrogate daughter, for a once-bad guy to kill all the bad guys of the here and now. Shelter serves its more reptilian functions just well enough to damn Waugh to this realm of inexpensive winter thrillers—he might get the chance to add another weathered face or two to that Mt. Rushmore.

It would be an understatement to call Brandon Sanderson a “big deal” in the world of fantasy writing; as the author of the Cosmere universe of books—notably the Mistborn series and The Stormlight Archive, both massive bestsellers—Sanderson is one of the looming monoliths of modern fantasy, with so many fans he can successfully run his own convention just to hold them, and sales that dwarf the vast majority of his contemporaries. And now, Apple's officially getting into the Brandon Sanderson business.

This is per THR, which reports that Sanderson has not only signed an adaptation deal with the tech giant, but one that grants him unprecedented power: Emerging from a bidding war that saw him talking to most of the major players in Hollywood, Apple has agreed to let Sanderson be “the architect of the universe” it plans to craft from his books Besides sounding like a character from one of his far-flung novels, that lofty titles means that in addition to writing and producing—reportedly on a Mistborn movie and a Stormlight Archive TV show, at least to start—he'll also have power over approvals, which is the sort of rarely seen authorial control that gets George R.R. Martin writing very cranky blog posts that he inevitably has to delete.

Sanderson's Cosmere books—the name refers to a wide multiverse of magical realities tied together with shared themes and the occasional Easter egg—have been running since 2005, when he published his first book in the wider series, Elantris. His popularity took off with the first Mistborn book the next year, and then caught some additional heat when the estate of author Robert Jordan selected him to finish Jordan's Wheel Of Time books in the late 2000s. Since then, Sanderson's had massive success through both traditional publishing and crowdfunding—a project he launched a few years back in support of “secret novels” he'd written stands as Kickstarter's most successful publishing campaign ever—most recently with the publication of his latest Stormlight novel, Wind And Truth, back in 2024.

HGTV favorite Ty Pennington opened up about processing tough times amid scary current events in an uplifting message to fans.

The “Rock the Block” host took to social media on Wednesday, January 28, to share a powerful message to his followers. 

“It's been a heck of a month 💔… a year… hell, a decade!” Pennington captioned a photo from the day he married wife Kellee Merrell. “If you're feeling stuck in a cycle of heartbreak and hopelessness, know that you're not alone. And yet through it all, I'm immensely grateful to have someone to weather the storm.”

He added, “Hold your loved ones close. Sending love to everyone who needs it right now.”

After sharing his deep reflection and gratitude, Pennington's HGTV colleagues and followers flooded his comments section with words of support and thanks.

“You're so right, Ty,” “Bargain Block” star Shea Whitfield commented. “I've been keeping close to my little circle lately, soaking up and receiving ALL the love. Sending some your way.”

“American Pickers” star Mike Wolfe sent his love from afar, writing, “Love this and you buddy hope paths cross soon ❤”

Pennington's “Trading Spaces” costar Vern Yip wrote, “Beautifully and wisely said. Sending love to you and all that need it ❤️”

Billy Baldwin commented, “Thank you Ty. Feels that way for so many. Been tough on our kids. Praying for their health. Present, positive, productive and peace for all in 2026.”

“Luxe for Less” star Anthony Elle added, “Sending love right back to you! Beautiful picture btw❤️”

“Help! I Wrecked My House” star Jasmine Roth opened up to fans about a recent parenting struggle with her toddler, explaining that she's unsure how to “explain the uncertainty, the fear, the anger, the division” in the world. 

Roth shared a story of her daughter asking why she was upset, telling her followers, “In that moment, there was nothing to do but hold my daughter and tell her that mommy was reading a sad and scary story”

Roth—who shares daughters Hazel and Darla with husband Brett Roth—continued, “It's a scary time, it's been a scary time, and I really hope we can move forward and learn in a way that brings us all more peace. I share this knowing it won't fix anything, but just to share that so many of us are feeling overwhelmed right now.”

BLACKPINK singer Rosé shared candid thoughts on her romantic life and the challenges of dating under the public eye during an appearance on Alex Cooper's “Call Her Daddy” podcast. Known offstage as Roseanne Park, she spoke about her search for love and the pressures of answering questions about relationships while in the spotlight.

“I am looking for love, but it is complicated,” Rosé told Cooper. She said that any statement about her dating life can quickly become a headline, leaving her in a difficult position. “It is overwhelming when everything you say is turned into news,” she said.

Rosé described the challenges of maintaining privacy in relationships. She recalled past experiences when she and a partner had to take extreme measures to avoid being recognized. The singer said these moments were meant to preserve a sense of normalcy amid public attention.

Rosé also reflected on previous relationships she described as toxic. She said these experiences taught her lessons about boundaries and self-worth. “Some relationships helped me understand myself better,” she said.

Experts and fans alike have noted the pressures K-pop stars face when their personal lives intersect with fame. Rosé emphasized that she prefers to keep most details private, rather than having the media dictate her narrative. She also joked about the absurdity of some public speculation, saying it can be both humorous and exhausting.

Rosé's comments come as BLACKPINK prepares to release their upcoming mini-album “Deadline,” following her recognition at the Grammy Awards, where she received nominations in major categories including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.

Her appearance on “Call Her Daddy” highlighted her willingness to discuss sensitive topics while maintaining control of the story. Rosé said she values honesty over speculation and strives to protect the private aspects of her life that fame often exposes.

“Dating as a public figure is not just about finding someone. It is about protecting your personal life,” Rosé said.

Fans flooded social media with praise for Rosé's candor, noting that even global superstars wrestle with love and heartbreak. Reflecting on the podcast, Rosé said, “I want people to know it's okay to protect yourself and set boundaries, even when the world is watching.” Her words resonate beyond K-pop, offering a rare glimpse of vulnerability from a performer who rarely lets fame define her private life.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Andrew Walker Reveals His Secret Hallmark Movie, ‘Kentucky Roses' (EXCLUSIVE)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/andrew-walker-kentucky-derby-movie-announcement/","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:16:58 GMT","

The secret's out! Beloved Hallmark star Andrew Walker has been sitting on a secret project for close to a year — a new movie that he finally got to celebrate on January 28, 2026. Hallmark Media announced that “Kentucky Roses” will premiere on May 2 — the same day as the 152nd annual Kentucky Derby.

Created in partnership with Churchill Downs, the prestigious Louisville race track where the Derby is held each year, the movie was secretly filmed there in October, just before Walker headed to Miami for the Hallmark Christmas Cruise, he told EntertainmentNow. 

Hallmark Media released a video of Walker looking dapper at Churchill Downs, announcing his new movie. He shared it on social media and wrote in his Instagram Stories, “I can finally talk about it!”

Walker and his best friend, actress and producer (and Kentucky native) Kelly Pendygraft brought the idea for “Kentucky Roses” to Hallmark, he told EntertainmentNow, and were thrilled that the network got behind it. They attended the Kentucy Derby in May 2025 for further inspiration. 

“This film is about honoring Kentucky's history and the people who genuinely love and care for horses,” Walker told EntertainmentNow. “It's rooted in respect and tradition, and it also celebrates all the people behind the scenes who bring Derby Day to life.” 

Walker's leading lady in the movie is Hallmark newcomer Odette Annable, best known for starring on the TV shows “Walker” and “Supergirl.” The cast also includes Ally Ledford, Peyton Meyer, Brynn Thayer, and Gregg Henry. 

According to Hallmark's synopsis, “Kentucky Roses” takes place in the present day and in 1932 at Churchill Downs. “In present-day,” the synopsis says, “Sadie Moore (Annable) works in the Churchill Downs greenhouse, dreaming of becoming a florist and one day contributing to the Derby's garland of roses, just like her great-grandmother, Gloria (Ledford).” 

“As Derby Day approaches,” the synopsis continues, “Sadie meets Ash Taylor (Walker), the son of Churchill Downs' CEO (Henry), who's been asked to do an emergency repair on the iconic Twin Spires after a storm left one damaged. Both Sadie and Ash feel the weight of family legacy and the desire to carve out their own paths. Sparks fly, and their budding romance is complicated by a long-buried connection between their families—a bittersweet love story from the past that threatens to repeat itself.”

“Kentucky Roses” was directed by Hallmark favorite Claire Niederpruem, according to IMDb, and was written by Jamie Pachino, whose many Hallmark credits have included 2022's “Long Lost Christmas” starring Taylor Cole, 2021's “Five More Minutes” with Nikki DeLoach, and 2020's “On the 12th Date of Christmas” starring Mallory Jansen and Tyler Hynes. 

The partnership with Churchill Downs is just the latest collaboration between Hallmark Media and iconic sporting events and legendary venues. During the 2025 holiday season, Hallmark partnered with Nashville's Grand Ole Opry for “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” with an all-star cast that included DeLoach and Kristoffer Polaha.

Meanwhile, Lacey Chabert has been filming a 2026 Christmas movie at Disney World, while Niall Matter and Holland Roden have been filming “A Grand Biltmore Christmas” — the second Hallmark movie set at the historic Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. 

As for sports partnerships, Hallmark teamed up with the NFL in 2024 and 2025 for its “Holiday Touchdown” movies. The first focused on a love story centered around the Kansas City Chiefs, and the second was a celebration of the Buffalo Bills.  

Hallmark Media VP Jessica Callahan said in a statement, “Hallmark Media and Churchill Downs are both legacy brands, each with more than a hundred years of history. Additionally, we share a commitment to giving generations of fans a memorable experience that fosters deep connections. Together, we're thrilled to bring audiences an inspiring story of community, courage, and time-honored traditions.” 

As part of the “Kentucky Roses” partnership, a “collection of romantic jewelry inspired by the movie” will be available in Hallmark Gold Crown stores.



Sounds like it will be a good movie to forward to watching. I like the partnership movies Hallmark is doing – getting to see iconic places in the history.

Odette Annable isn't a newcomer and she's had way more well known acting jobs a than Andrew Walker has

The article said she was Hallmark newcomer, not an acting newcomer.

Dating back to 1988, the National Film Preservation Board selects 25 films each year to add into the Library of Congress as part of the National Film Registry, and this year, that registry of films has now grown to 925 entries across over a century of cinema. 

On Thursday, January 29, the Preservation Board announced its latest selections, and among them are some modern Hollywood blockbusters, a few Old Hollywood favorites, six different silent films, four documentaries, and the first time a Ken Burns film has been added to the national collection. The oldest film, “The Tramp and the Dog,” dates all the way back to 1896, while the newest film is from 2014, Wes Anderson's “The Grand Budapest Hotel.”

Here's the full list of films selected for the 2025 National Film Registry, in chronological order. 

Turner Classic Movies (TCM) will host a television special Thursday, March 19, starting at 8 p.m. ET to screen a selection of films named to the registry this year, as hosted by TCM host Jacqueline Stewart, who is also chair of the National Film Preservation Board. 

“It is very meaningful that the National Film Registry is adding six silent film titles, showing the range of topics and styles in the earliest years of American filmmaking,” Stewart said in an official statement. “And it is especially exciting to see that the top title nominated by the public for this year, ‘The Thing,' has been added to the National Film Registry, along with ‘The Truman Show' and ‘The Incredibles' which also had very strong public support.”

 










The 25 films were selected from nearly 8,000 movies that this year were submitted for nomination, and the board selects movies that are “culturally, historically, or aesthetically” significant. You can nominate a movie, one that is at least 10 years old, for preservation up until August 15, 2026. 

The six silent films are an interesting bunch. “The Tramp and the Dog” was thought to be lost until a print showed up in 2021 at the National Library of Norway, it's the first commercial film shot in Chicago, and it's the first instance of “pants humor,” where a character loses their pants during an altercation. “The Oath of the Sword” is one of the earliest known examples of an Asian American film production. “The Maid of McMillan” is the first known student film. “The Lady” is a heartfelt drama from director Frank Borzage and star Norma Talmadge. “Sparrows” is a Mary Pickford film featuring one of her finest melodrama performances. And “Ten Nights in a Ballroom” features an all-Black cast and is one of only two surviving films made by the Colored Players Film Corporation of Philadelphia.

And any modern cinephiles should be delighted to see classics by John Carpenter, Amy Heckerling, Christopher Nolan, Richard Linklater, Wes Anderson, Ken Burns, and more all be recognized by the Film Registry. 

 










“When we preserve films, we preserve American culture for generations to come. These selections for the National Film Registry show us that films are instrumental in capturing important parts of our nation's story,” said Acting Librarian of Congress Robert R. Newlen. “We are proud to continue this important work, adding a broad range of 25 films to the National Film Registry as a collective effort in the film community to protect our cinematic heritage.”

“Movies have always shaped our culture, with tens of millions of Americans going to the cinema on a regular basis,” says Cinema United CEO & President Michael O'Leary and NFPB Member. “It's a true honor to support the Library of Congress and the Librarian in their important work preserving influential cinematic experiences. The wide-ranging selections, representing stories with universal themes that connect people everywhere, will inspire classic programming at theatres large and small across the country.”

“Moviegoing is part of the American social fabric,” says Joe Masher, Cinema United New York President and NFPB Member. “Cinemas dotting cities and towns across Main Street America are important places where many of us had our first jobs, our first dates, our first family outings, our first community experiences. With classic films bigger than ever in cinemas, we are grateful to the passionate work of the Library of Congress and the Librarian for their exciting additions to the National Film Registry, introducing new audiences to great movies on the big screen the way they were meant to be seen.”

Telling yourself “This is bigger than us” proves an essential survival tactic in “Iron Lung.” Not just for the sci-fi film‘s doomed protagonist — welded inside a rusty submarine and forced to explore a literal ocean of blood to win his freedom — but also for the various audiences navigating YouTuber Markiplier‘s exhausting and ambitious feature debut finally in theaters this weekend. 

In this grueling single-location thriller, adapted from David Szymanski's 2022 horror game, filmmaker/star Mark Fischbach (known online as “Markiplier”) traps viewers alongside himself as Simon, a prisoner aboard the space station Eden. Reeling after a mass-casualty event known as the Quiet Rapture, humanity's last stand is just the starting block for a project that demands endurance before it delivers immersion, ultimately revealing the promise and peril of creator-led video game adaptations at scale. At times, the 36-year-old director seems to mistake fan loyalty for limitless attention, and he risks his young audience with a nightmare that's admirable but likely too taxing for that demographic.

Seen out of context, “Iron Lung” plays like a bleak cousin to Duncan Jones' “Moon” from 2009, though it's sorely missing that indie darling's singular score and expansive visual mythology. Embarking on an expedition so dangerous it resembles an execution, Simon must chart the gaseous bedrock of a crimson-red alien moon — or die trying. True to the video game, the camera never leaves the Iron Lung (a mini-sub with a dark past), and that choice may come as a shock to viewers unfamiliar with the source material. Embracing that constraint takes real patience and a willingness to accept a rhythm defined by claustrophobia over escalation.

A beloved influencer in the gaming world, Markiplier's commitment to loyal adaptation is absolute in spirit but near-impossible in execution when it comes to a property as opaque as “Iron Lung.” The main character is a nameless avatar in the original telling. Neon-green digital readouts, dripping blood, three-ring binders full of technical instructions, and endless close-ups of the navigation system ground the movie in tactile realism but rarely ignite imagination. The result is not self-important so much as punishingly sincere, a movie that believes so deeply in its process that it neglects cinematic momentum. “Iron Lung” runs over two hours, making for a slew of baffling editing decisions (Markiplier also cut the film) that turns suspense into stasis.

That length exposes Simon himself as the film's primary weakness. Written as an expanded version of the player character in the game, he never quite becomes a person despite being played by a world-famous internet personality. His guilt over a mysterious incident at a place called Filament Station and his capacity for violence as a survivor of the apocalypse are gestured at rather than explained, leaving Simon more vessel than hero. The script leans heavily on exposition — internal monologues, disembodied intercom voices, and hallucinatory flashbacks — to communicate lore that might have resonated more powerfully through action or environment. Some of the game's most evocative writing, blending cosmic horror with humanity's loss of faith in itself, gets swallowed by that verbal density.

 










Earnest and likable but never quite enough to make Simon a proper person, Markiplier's performance compounds that problem. Separated from his online platform, the film's star reveals himself as an actor still acquiring the necessary tools for emotional subtlety. He relies on small facial expressions that never quite land, and his authentic expletive-laced frustration builds a certain kinship with the character. That said, it also underscores how much of Markiplier's appeal on YouTube comes from reacting to external challenges. The knowing masochism that makes watching him play difficult or scary video games compelling doesn't translate cleanly when he is the architect of his own haunted house. Simon exists in “Iron Lung” against his will, and that disconnect steadily suffocates its star. 

And yet, “Iron Lung” is far from a failure. Measured against the graveyard of other video game adaptations — especially recent studio misfires like Cineverse's “Return to Silent Hill” — this deeply flawed attempt still stands as a testament to what happens when actual gamers make video game movies. Its imperfections are heartfelt, not cynical, and it's clear that significant effort was put into acquiring the right team for this production. Cinematographer Philip Roy finds texture in near-total darkness, and composer Andrew Hulshult's score, drawing on his celebrated work in the games world (“Doom Eternal,” “Dusk”), provides a confident undercurrent the imagery often lacks. The most effective moments arrive when the Iron Lung's massive camera flashes black-and-white images of the abyss outside, delivering jump-scares that feel genuinely viral. 

 










But again, the editing is where the experiment truly falters. Shots linger long after they've communicated their information, turning repetition into dead weight, and repeatedly staring at a gore-splattered GPS makes the mission feel like a maddening endless road trip. When an intercom announces Simon has 30 minutes left to complete his task, the dominant fear stems less from narrative stakes than from the realization that there is so much movie left to go. 

Ambiguity, a strength of the game, becomes a liability. The film teases monsters, human remains, and lost vessels without letting the audience experience the world beyond the hull. That restraint could have functioned as thematic isolation, but instead it often reads as under-resourcing. Whether the missing ingredient was money, source material, or bold creative swings is difficult to parse; what's obvious is that too little concept has been stretched too far.

The theatrical experience, however, reframes the entire project. In a packed early screening dominated by Markiplier fans, the atmosphere resembled a communal livestream more than a traditional moviegoing environment. Credit names, including those of some Markiplier's collaborators, drew louder reactions than many of the movie's horror beats. Some viewers filmed the screen or chatted through stretches of the runtime, behaviors that would curdle a more cinephilic crowd but felt organic to a fandom accustomed to shared, participatory viewing. That subculture undercuts escapism but proudly points to a different kind of theatrical future.

 










Crucially, Markiplier does not pander to his own audience with in-jokes or winks like you'd find in a “Five Nights at Freddy's” flick. (It's worth knowing that the YouTuber played an integral role in popularizing those games and later films, and establishing the audience-based distribution model we're seeing work again now.) “Iron Lung” is a punishing attempt at artistry, made harder for Markiplier by the decision to direct himself while self-distributing on more than 2,500 screens. Compared to similar efforts that haven't done as well financially or critically, the film stands out for taking itself seriously. It's slow, detail-obsessed, and aware enough of its shortcomings not to overplay them. Markiplier never feels self-aggrandizing and he's got the smarts to know when to cut away, even as he allows his film's setting to fester beyond catharsis.

As a case study, “Iron Lung” may matter more than it entertains. This fascinating stress test suggests that video game adaptations could thrive when entrusted to web-native creators who not only respect but understand their source material — and would benefit from collaboration with more experienced filmmakers. It also forecasts a movie world where audience trust functions as infrastructure, enabling theatrical releases that bypass traditional marketing entirely. That's not replicable for most filmmakers, but its existence nevertheless reshapes conversation.

 










“Iron Lung” is audacious and at times astonishingly boring. Still, it feels more enthusiastic and celebratory than many blockbuster adaptations built on safer math. Insisting that the mission is bigger than any one person, including its creator, the film opens space for more daring, messy attempts to follow. For indie cinema, that alone may be worth the ordeal… if not, the gallons of blood. 

From Markiplier Studios, “Iron Lung” is in theaters January 30.

In one of the first scenes of “Take Me Home,” main character Anna (Anna Sargent) shares a shower with her mother Joan (Marceline Hugot) as the two gently shampoo each other. The boundary between who's the caregiver and who's being cared for is intentionally made unclear, a succinct reflection of the co-dependent, precarious dynamic they share with each other and Anna's father Bob (Victor Slezak).

In the slow, humid Florida suburban home they share, Anna — an adult Asian adoptee with cognitive disabilities — struggles with impulse control and basic hygiene, but is relied upon by her physically ailing mother and her father, whose mental health is on the decline. Crowded atop each other in their messy house, the three have a habit of getting into dangerous situations: early on, Bob nearly runs Anna over while she's reaching for her water bottle stuck underneath his car. Their affection for each other as they make shopping trips is evident, but it's clear this arrangement can't last forever. And when Joan abruptly dies from a heat stroke in a devastatingly mundane scene, it puts the question of what happens next for Anna and Bob into stark relief.

“Take Me Home” is a barefaced personal project for writer-director Liz Sargent, who cast her own sister Anna in the role of the lightly fictionalized protagonist. The character of Emily (Ali Ahn), Anna's younger sister living in Brooklyn who flies down in the wake of their mother's death to look after her father and daughter, is then a bit of an an author avatar, a reflection of the director's real-life relationship with her sister that takes the film to some raw and relatable places.  

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Adapting her own short film of the same name from 2023 into her debut feature, Sargent shows talent at constructing a down-to-Earth, largely observational character study that admirably doesn't lean too hard on inspirational pathos or turgid trauma porn to generate drama or emotion. It makes for a very promising first feature, one that unfortunately undercuts itself with an underwhelming, emotionally vapid fantasy of a conclusion. 

For most of its runtime, though, “Take Me Home” strikes a delicate balance between humor and heartbreak in its family drama, observing the messy emotions that unspool out of its three main characters in the wake of Joan's death without much unearned sentimentality. Bob, in his grief, is more frustrated and shorter-tempered with his daughters than usual, while Anna's ability to function declines. Emily, an interlooper in their home, is determined to set a plan but frustrated by her sister's outbursts and her father's passivity. 

As written by Sargent, the characters' relationships are multifaceted, complex and real: there moments of ugliness, such as a brutal fight between Anna and Emily where Anna screams she doesn't love her anymore, are contrasted with moments of joy that come from shopping trips where they steal ice pops from the supermarket. Uncomfortable truths are left to linger under the surface, including in a heart-to-heart between Emily and her father where he's unable to give a real answer when she asks if he ever thought through the issues that would come from adopting a child with a disability. DP Farhad Ahmed Dehlvi shoots the film with a dark tint, ably capturing the murky, humid atmosphere that makes this home even more oppressive.

 










All three main actors deliver performances that are understated, but sneak up on you with their complexity. Slezak's morose, tired face proves an effective canvas for Bob's inner grief, and he's often adds levity with some dry humor as well. Ahn is sharper and flintier, but conveys the anxiety and mounting pressures Emily is facing quite well. She has an effective, lovely, and believable chemistry with Anna Sargent that makes their characters' relationship the heart of the film; when she departs the story again late into the film, you feel it. 

And Anna Sargent proves a wonderfully unguarded and able performer, proving alternatively funny and deeply sensitive. The script avoids making the character a pat stereotype: she can sometimes verge on the childish in her outbursts, but she's also an adult woman who watches porn in her bedroom and can strike up a friendship playing beer pong with a bunch of macho guys living in her neighborhood. The film, without proving didactic, untangles the complications of finding appropriate care for someone with her cognitive disabilities, as Emily and Bob struggle with a healthcare system that isn't set up to support people like her. 

Which makes the ending all the more of a shame. Rather than seeing through the film's threads to a real conclusion, Sargent opts to jump from a moment of pure despair to a moment that, in its brightly lit cinematography and tranquil utopian bliss, seems to be a pure dream. The obvious comparison may be Sean Baker's “The Florida Project,” another down-to-Earth story that ends in a blissful moment of fantasy rather than confronting harder realities. For “Take Me Home,” which proves to be at its strongest when it's living in the characters' mundane realities, it's a fatal miscalculation, one that leaves the film feeling unfinished and at odds with itself. The ending doesn't exactly erase what “Take Me Home” does well, but it does leave the film a much more dispiriting watch than it otherwise would have been, a promising drama that betrays it's own best qualities.

 










“Take Me Home” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Of the 90-plus films and episodic series premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in 2026, only about a dozen are arriving at the festival with distribution in hand. Many will be looking for homes, but if this year is anything like last year, it may take some time for those sales to close. We'll be tracking all of them as they come in.

Section: U.S. Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Josef Kubota WladykaDate Acquired: Jan. 29 Buzz: One of the buzzier competition titles at Sundance not because of its star power but because of its playful title and crowd pleasing sentiment, one that earned a standing ovation for director Josef Kubota Wladyka and his mother on whom the film is based, the real Ha-Chan. Shot in Japan, Rinko Kikuchi stars in “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” as a woman who leaves the Japanese ballroom dance scene after tragedy strikes, only to be lured back onto the dance floor after developing an infatuation for a new instructor. SPC picked up the worldwide rights to the film. It also stars Alberto Guerra, Alejandro Edda, Yoh Yoshida, and Damián Alcázar.

Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Directors: Olivia WildeDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: This was a true, old-fashioned, late night bidding war between multiple interested buyers that ended up being a 72-hour, marathon competition. IndieWire hears that Neon, Black Bear, Netflix, Searchlight, and Focus Features — and even Warner Bros. at the 11th hour — were all in the mix for what was Olivia Wilde's third feature as a director. We're also hearing that the final bidding got into the 8-figure range. Others may have bid more, but Wilde was determined to get a theatrical deal. And it's fitting too, because this was one of the starrier movies at the festival with Wilde, Seth Rogen, Edward Norton, and Penélope Cruz all leading the ensemble cast. “The Invite” quite simply is about the dinner party from hell when a couple whose marriage is on the brink have dinner with another couple that's polyamorous, but the crowds that saw it say there's a lot more layers to this one than just that. Will McCormack and Rashida Jones wrote the screenplay based on a 2019 Spanish film called “Sentimental.” UTA Independent Film Group and FilmNation co-repped the sale, and the film hails from Megan Ellison and Annapurna, who also previously produced Wilde's debut film “Booksmart.”

 










Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title. “Leviticus” will be released later this year and is actually Neon's second deal for a horror movie out of the festival, as the distributor also over the weekend joined the next film from “It Ends” director Alex Ullom.

Section: PremieresDistributor: Focus FeaturesDirectors: Daniel Roher and Charlie TyrellBuzz: The “Navalny” director teams up with producer Daniel Kwan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”) on a film that goes deep into the perils and promise of artificial intelligence, all through the lens of Roher debating whether this is a good moment to bring a child into the world.

 










Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirector: Alexandria StapletonBuzz: The director of “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” sits down with Brittany Griner, the basketball star who was famously detained and became the subject of a media and political frenzy as she hoped to secure her freedom. 

Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirectors: Liz Garbus and Elizabeth WolffBuzz: More than a sports doc, this portrait of Billie Jean King looks at the tennis icon's compulsion to hide her sexual orientation and eating disorders.

Section: PremieresDistributor: Searchlight PicturesDirector: Andrew StantonBuzz: Though he's directed plenty on TV, Pixar vet Andrew Stanton is returning to a live-action feature for the first time since “John Carter” dropped way back in 2012. “In the Blink of an Eye” is a triptych set in ancient times, modern day, and in the distant future, exploring how those three eras are connected by hope and the circle of life.

Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Director: Aidan ZamiriBuzz: One of three films starring Charli XCX at the festival, the “brat” pop star plays a version of herself in an exaggerated mockumentary that comments on the idea of modern celebrity. 

 










Section: World DocumentaryDistributor: PBS/FrontlineDirectors: Itab Azzam, Jack MacInnesBuzz: This documentary was filmed over 10 years and follows a Syrian refugee girl who travels to Germany and then back to Syria with her family.

Section: PremieresDistributor: NetflixDirector: Rory KennedyBuzz: Perhaps a documentary for “The Queen's Gambit” fans, this film follows a girl from Hungary who is a chess prodigy trying to break into a male-dominated competition circuit. 

Section: MidnightDistributor: ShudderDirector: Natalie Erika JamesBuzz: Shudder picked up this body horror film from the “Relic” director just before the festival. It stars Midori Francis as a woman who takes part in a bizarre weight loss craze that involves eating human ashes, only to become possessed by demonic forces in the process. 

Section: NEXTDistributor: Latino Public Broadcasting and ITVSDirector: William D. CaballeroBuzz: This animated film that combines a variety of styles, including 2D, 3D, and live-action, is a deeply personal autobiographical documentary from mixed media filmmaker Caballero, who looks back on his career and examines grief through the lens of his Puerto Rican family in North Carolina. Theatrical rights are still available. 

 










Section: PremieresDistributor: Nat GeoDirector: Sara DosaBuzz: Like her Sundance breakout “Fire of Love” before it, “Time and Water” is a more elevated nature documentary and follows an Icelandic writer eulogizing both a glacier and his grandparents.

Section: MidnightDistributor: A24Director: Ian TuasonBuzz: A micro-budget horror movie in the vein of “Paranormal Activity” that first played at Fantasia Fest, the actual producers of “Paranormal Activity” helped give the film a new cut and are hoping for another horror hit.

“There's life and there's death. We were still alive, so we thought we'd carry on doing it,” Stephen Morris said in 1983 about New Order, a diamond formed in the pressure of grief after the death of Joy Divison's Ian Curtis. For Injury Reserve bandmates Ritchie With a T and Parker Corey, the death of Stepa J. Groggs applied a similar pressure to reinvent and carry on as duo. Now, five years removed from By The Time I Get to Phoenix, the final release from Injury Reserve, By Storm have emerged with their debut album—a set of glitchy, rabid electronics that captures the process of grieving, maturing, and moving forward, whether they like it or not.

Injury Reserve made their name with brash experimental raps that were as heady as they were fun. By Storm redirects that youthful energy toward something more contemplative but just as intense. In 2023, they debuted with the single “Double Trio,” a free jazz-rap epic that captured the panic of a band in forced metamorphosis. They toured in the years following By The Time I Get to Phoenix against a backdrop of global upheaval and personal change. “That's the scramble,” Ritchie said at the L.A. premiere of the “Double Trio” music video. “This thing's happening. You're wondering how you're going to navigate this, but the reality of this situation is whatever we want.”

Both the lyrics and production of My Ghosts Go Ghost feel more conversational and off-cuff than anything the duo have previously attempted. Jangly guitars and vaporwave sample collages shiver and burst, while Ritchie raps with an improvisational sensibility. On “In My Town,” he criss-crosses between his financial difficulties, the harshness of touring, and a new baby on the way. After his verse, the track lingers for nearly three minutes with no distinct direction. Corey's enormous productions and Ritchie's conversational flows feel hypnotic in dark rooms over large sound systems, but on an intimate listen, moments like these meander.

The album's occasional lack of momentum is echoed in its lyrical focus on languishing and resisting change. On “Can I Have You For Myself?,” Ritchie addresses his partner on the eve of their child's birth, tempering his gratitude with a desire for things to stay the way they are. Dean Blunt-like guitar strums establish calm before the storm, which arrives with a waltzing rhythm suitable for a first dance. My Ghosts Go Ghost works best when its gears grind to create an attention-grabbing dissonance. “Best Interest” puts Polly Bradfield-esque violin improvisations and a dreary billy woods verse on top of a fairly straightforward beat and rhyme from Ritchie. And the duo sounds freer than ever on tracks like “Dead Weight,” with its frantic drumming reminiscent of Rashied Ali or black midi's Morgan Simpson.

My Ghost Go Ghost peaks with its final act, when the duo frames its experience as something to appreciate, not only lament. “And I Dance” comes at the perfect moment for a wash of catharsis as Ritchie celebrates having made it to “the other side.” “And I Dance” also makes for the most tightly written song on My Ghosts Go Ghost. Ritchie's raps feel pointed and specific, and even the flashier moments—electronic squelches that burst and break like an Arca production—pack a harder punch in their containment. It's gratifying to hear Ritchie and Parker Corey find inspiration in a place of hard-earned peace in their artistic and personal lives: They're no longer anchored to their past but fueled by the promise of their future.

Kneecap have announced their next album. Fenian arrives on April 24 via Heavenly Recordings, and features Kae Tempest, Ramallah-based rapper Fawzi, and Irish musician Radie Peat. A lead single that references British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, “Liars Tale,” is out now alongside a music video directed by Thomas James. You can watch it below.

Fenian, which Fontaines D.C. and Black Midi collaborator Dan Carey produced, follows the Irish rap trio's 2024 album Fine Art. Since that release, the group—who have long used their platform to advocate for Palestine and critique Israel—have been banned from performing in Hungary and Canada, and were removed from a Scottish music festival over “concerns expressed by the police about safety.” In May, member Mo Chara was charged with a terror offense for allegedly displaying the Hezbollah flag at a concert, leading the group to cancel a U.S. tour due to its proximity to his court date. Following the investigation launch, Kneecap said in a statement, “Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah.” Kneecap later addressed the charge, which was ultimately thrown out, in the November song “No Comment” with the producer Sub Focus. Since releasing Fine Art, the group has also shared the tracks “Sayōnara” with Orbital's Paul Hartnoll and “The Recap” with Mozey.

In a statement on Fenian, Kneecap said, “They tried to stop us by branding Kneecap ‘terrorists,' with cancellations, with statements from the Prime Minister himself. We had all the motivation we needed…this isn't a swift reaction, but a considered response to those that tried to silence us. And failed.”

When Ari Lennox released her debut, Shea Butter Baby, in 2019, she had just moved into her first solo apartment. She left dishes in the sink and drank from Dollar Tree wine glasses, relishing life on her own terms. She sang from the perspective of a woman in her mid-twenties, sculpting her future in real time, equally thrilled and anxious about the shape it might take. Seven years later, she's become one of the most lauded names in contemporary R&B, beloved for her vulnerability, her playful humor, and her unencumbered sensuality.

In recent years, Lennox says, she's also gotten sober and started dating with greater intention. Her third album, Vacancy, documents this sense of resolve. “There's a space, a void I would love for someone to fill,” she said in a recent interview. “But the reality is people be in and out like a gosh darn hotel.” It's the potency of that still-unrequited desire and her indefatigable drive to fulfill it that's at the emotional crux of the record.

On Vacancy, Lennox sings with the self-knowledge of a grown woman: Instead of reassuring herself that she calls the shots, she now tells partners exactly how long they have to text her back before she moves on (“24 Seconds”). It's inspiring to witness her growth—but if the winking irreverence and willful contradictions that defined her earlier work were symptoms of a more naive outlook, they also supplied the songs with distinct perspective and candor. She doesn't need to return to old techniques, but as it stands, Vacancy sometimes feels composed to the point of redundancy.

The title track, an innuendo-filled slow burn with an unhurried bassline and warm, jazzy saxophone, inhabits the gap between aspiration and manifestation. Lennox commands it with poise and ease: Her voice glides like molten glass as she urges a love interest to spend the weekend, ostensibly to help her fix the shaky table legs and leaking pipes at her place. Like in Shea Butter Baby's “New Apartment,” Lennox uses the image of home to understand the life she wants. But she's clearly being facetious when she claims the place is a mess: She's got Etta James on the surround sound, “hot cocoa on the couch.” All that's missing from this picture is a partner to share it with. (It's a concept that comes up again on “Deep Strokes.”) She ends the song with a directive: “I want you movin' in with me/I need you movin' in with me.” “Vacancy” contains multitudes: the assurance of someone who knows exactly her desire and the vulnerability of asking another person to fulfill it.

From SZA on “20 Something” to Drake on “Hotline Bling” to Erykah Badu's vision of the cellphone as a glitchy spiritual portal, technology and phones in particular are pop music's favorite symbols of potential (or lost) connection. Lennox's writing makes frequent use of tech, meaning that Vacancy feels contemporary even as its sound draws on the soulful pacing and classic instrumentation of 2000s R&B. The very first words she sings are “2 a.m. on the 'gram, feeling crazy.” The Costar app gets a shoutout on “Horoscope,” a simmering ballad that uses astrology to enumerate the ways men have disappointed her in the past. And bouncy, bass-driven pop anthem “Soft Girl Era” references a TikTok trend in which women, especially Black women, celebrate lives filled with luxury and ease.

Internet culture is ubiquitous in contemporary life and dating—but, by virtue of serving millions of people at once, even the most niche internet trends and references also often lack specificity. “Horoscope” veers into this type of vagueness when Lennox lists out the astrological signs and their flaws, sort of the same way you'll see them cursorily explained in Instagram slide shows. But the song is redeemed by a stellar, slow-building vocal performance, and by her sense of humor. You can't help but laugh when she sings, “Sagittarius are some fucking terrorists” or when she remembers the Scorpio who couldn't stop bragging on himself. It's the kind of verve that defines her best work, and this album could have used more of it.

Vacancy is rooted in experience and features the most skillful vocal performances of Lennox's career, highlighting her attention to mood and the patience with which she builds toward runs that feel like falling in love. Still, sometimes the songs feel like they're trapped in amber, with emotion muted and songwriting that verges on repetitive. “That's not my hair on your bedsheets/You said you were all alone,” Lennox croons on “Wake Up,” in the same tone and register she uses to express longing or infatuation elsewhere on the album. After hearing her eviscerate someone's “deceiving, receiving, no-giving-head ass” back on “Whipped Cream,” it feels somewhat anti-climactic. You get the sense she's outgrown this place—like maybe it's time to start apartment hunting.

	The Resonator Awards returned for their second annual ceremony last night at Charlie Chaplin Studios. Presented by We Are Moving the Needle — the nonprofit working to reshape the music industry through increased representation of women and non-binary individuals — the evening unfolded less like a formal awards show than an elevated cocktail party.


	Honorees Chappell Roan, Chaka Khan, St. Vincent, and Haim mingled with presenters Nancy Wilson, Joni Mitchell, Olivia Rodrigo, and Rostam, while the unseasonably warm evening drew a wide cross-section of the music community into Chaplin's outdoor space. Among those spotted were Dave Grohl and Jordyn Blum, Beck, Linda Perry, Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, Paula Abdul, John Mayer, CHVRCHES' Lauren Mayberry, Laufey, producer/songwriter Suzy Shinn, and the evening's host Fred Armisen with wife Riki Lindhome.


	Last year's Resonator Awards were postponed due to the Los Angeles fires, prompting the launch of the organization's Wildfire Relief Fund, which made this year's gathering feel doubly welcome. Part of the event's appeal, A&R professional Dave Godowsky noted, lies in the nonprofit at its center. “It's about something other than yourself,” he said. “Everybody is here for what they contribute.”

	











	That spirit carried into the awards portion of the evening, a point Emily Lazar, founder of We Are Moving the Needle and CEO and chief mastering engineer at The Lodge, underscored in her opening remarks. “This past year has been heavy for so many in our community—from the devastating wildfires that destroyed homes, studios, and lifetimes of work to the civil unrest, uncertainty, and upheaval so many of us have been carrying,” she said. “So being together now like this matters. It reminds us that even when things feel unstable, the creative community still shows up for one another.”

	Lazar highlighted a persistent inequity in the music industry: this year's Grammy Award for Producer of the Year had no women nominees, and only nine women have ever been nominated in the category. Gesturing to the room as evidence of overlooked talent, she said, “Talent is everywhere. It's about access—who gets trusted, who gets invited into the biggest rooms, and who keeps getting left just outside the door.”

	The balance of sincerity and levity continued throughout the night. Lazar presented the Breakthrough Award to producer Roselilah, whose acceptance speech mixed pragmatism with humor. “Sometimes the best thing you can do is ignore expectations and keep going anyway,” she said. “The path wasn't traditional in our culture for women … I had to promise that making beats was indeed a real job.”


	The tone shifted to earnest appreciation with Jason Isbell praising Powerhouse Award recipient Gena Johnson, who emphasized collaboration as both ethos and practice. “I strive for collaboration on every level,” she said. “Together, we are more powerful, more profound, and create a more fun and interesting world of music and art.” That spirit carried through other presentations, including Addison Rae's enthusiastic introduction of longtime collaborators Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd for the In Stereo Award, and Anderson .Paak's smooth, unhurried presentation of Alissia with the All-Star Award.


	One of the night's most personal moments came when Laufey presented Amy Allen — last year's Songwriter of the Year (Non-Classical) Grammy winner, and this year's nominee — with the Calliope Award. Pointing to Mitchell in the audience, Allen said Mitchell had inspired her to start songwriting and playing guitar at age eight. “Thank you for being here and paving the way,” she said. “I am grateful for all of the women who have done that before me, everyone doing it now, and everybody who will be doing it in the years to come.”

	Midway through the evening, a high-energy video montage celebrating Tina Turner, Olivia Newton-John, Pink, Janet Jackson, and Cher paid tribute to manager Roger Davies. Cher appeared via taped message to present Davies with the Transformer Award, followed by the first of two Exceptional Ears Awards, presented by Aaron Dessner to Bella Blasko, before the program shifted into the auction portion of the night. 


	The auction leaned indulgent: lavish group vacations to Greece, Mexico, and Italy, a Friedrich Kunath Art & Experience that included a private performance from The Bird and the Bee, and a Gibson guitar signed by the night's talent. Urged by a fast-talking auctioneer and his familiar cadence, paddles shot up as bids climbed into the four- and five-figure range. Proceeds support We Are Moving the Needle's scholarship and grant programs, which to date have awarded more than $875,000 to women, trans, and non-binary creators pursuing audio education and advancing their music careers.

	











	Lighter moments returned with flair. Doechii brought humor to the presentation of the second Exceptional Ears Award to Jayda Love, while Rostam infused the Disruptors Award presentation to Haim with the same sensitivity he channels in his music. When Olivia Rodrigo handed St. Vincent the Golden Trifecta Award, they  shared a playful stage moment with Rodrigo wearing her fangirl status on her sleeve. They two were so effortless in their banter that they could have doubled as a comedy duo.


	The night felt like it was building toward a peak when Heart's Nancy Wilson took the stage to present Chappell Roan with the Harmonizer Award. She highlighted Roan's fundraising for trans youth, her advocacy in the LGBTQ+ community, and her work supporting backline and mental health for music workers, as well as her generosity in providing free tickets to vulnerable communities.


	Reflecting on performing Heart's classic “Barracuda” with Roan, Wilson said, “I got to see the fans firsthand when I came out and played ‘Barracuda' with these guys. And it was Chappellmania. It was the biggest love energy I'd seen in many, many years out on a rock stage—an absolute, unifying, and healing force that our sad, sad world needs more than ever right now. And so, Chappell, this beautiful imprint you are making moves the needle and will always continue to resonate forward to impact the culture for all times.”


	Roan, a two-time Grammy nominee this year, gave a spontaneous and heartfelt speech. “I feel very uncomfortable being told that I'm a good person,” she said., “I only know what to do because I see other people in my life doing good things, and by listening to trans people who need representation and money for healthcare and rent. I kind of think that it's just an artist's—and anybody who has money's—duty to give it away. 


	After thanking the awards for the recognition, Roan added, “I don't really know what's gonna happen to women, or gay people, or people of color, or really anyone. But I think the only thing that matters is community and kindness, and giving what you have.”


	Perhaps the night's biggest highlight was the undeniable synergy between Mitchell and Khan. Mitchell recounted a cheeky anecdote about “dining and dashing” with Khan — though they later went back and paid the bill. “Every time we meet, something spectacular happens,” she said, before presenting Khan with the Luminary Award.

	











	Khan returned the admiration, calling Mitchell one of her biggest inspirations. “When it comes to writing and … trying to know your words, how to use your words, how powerful they are — she is the absolute tops of that for me. In fact, she sent me to the dictionary several times,” Khan said, eliciting laughter from the audience.


	Receiving the award, Khan reflected on longevity and openness. “Longevity isn't about staying the same. It's about staying open … open to collaboration, open to new voices, open to change, and open to the people behind the scenes whose creativity helps shape everything you hear … When women and all creators are supported, we rise together. To the honorees tonight, you are the future. To the leaders here, keep opening those doors. And to the next generation, your voices matter.”

	The evening soared into a star-studded musical tribute to Khan, supported by Roan's excellent band, who served as the house band for the night. It began with a supergroup — Sia, Greg Kurstin, Daniella Haim, and Thundercat — performing “Tell Me Something Good.” Maggie Rogers and Grace Bowers followed with a gripping, high-energy rendition of “Ain't Nobody,” leading into an unexpected finale as Lalah Hathaway was joined by Khan for a moving performance of “Through the Fire.”


	The spirit of the Resonator Awards was perhaps best captured by Tony Berg who, reflecting on traditional award shows, said, “It always struck me as peculiar, because they tend to reduce the creation of art and the competition they're in as a form of blood sport.” He continued, “But what Emily has created, on the other hand, is something that is purely predicated on merit and contribution, and I think what she's done is a fantastic thing.”

	Two of the world's most infamous bullies — one a U.S. president bitten with the imperialist bug and another a rap icon known for attacking other celebrities online in her orbit — joined forces today in Washington, D.C., in a public show of support.


	During a U.S. Treasury event, Nicki Minaj stood next to President Donald Trump, and from behind a podium, she declared, “I am probably the president's number one fan.” Following her words of devotion, Minaj took to social media later that evening and posted a photo of a “Trump Gold Card” alongside the caption “Welp.” According to the official website, the card requires a $1,000,000 contribution plus a $15,000 processing fee, and in return, offers “U.S. residency in record time.”


	“The hate or what people have to say, it does not affect me at all. It actually motivates me to support him more,” Minaj said during the summit. “We're not going to let them get away with bullying him and, you know, the smear campaigns. It's not going to work. OK? He has a lot of force behind him, and God is protecting him. Amen.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The event today launched “Trump Accounts,” a kind of investment account for children established in last year's Big Beautiful Bill Act. These accounts will be available to people under 18, with investments growing tax-free like an individual retirement account. Once they're adults, account holders will be able to withdraw the money, but only for specific things, including education, buying a home, starting a business, or retirement.

	











	When introducing Minaj to the stage today, Trump said she is investing “hundreds of thousands of dollars” to Trump Accounts. According to PBS, Minaj pledged to donate between $150,000 and $300,000.


	Although Minaj previously told Rolling Stone that she wasn't going to “jump on the Donald Trump bandwagon,” she has since been a vocal supporter of the president and the MAGA movement.


	“I get that a lot of people don't like him for obvious reasons. But what stuck with me was the children being taken away from their parents when they came into this country,” Minaj said in 2020, following the implementation of Trump's first-term “zero tolerance” immigration policy that separated over 5,000 children from their parents. “That really bothered me because I was one of those immigrant children coming to America to flee poverty.”

	Minaj's 2020 comments are a stark contrast to her conversation last month with Erika Kirk, the widow of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and the organization's CEO, during a surprise appearance at its AmericaFest. During a Q&A session, Minaj gushed over Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, saying, “I love both of them.”

	Earlier this month, several Change.org petitions calling to deport Minaj to her native Trinidad and Tobago amassed hundreds of thousands of signatures.  “Deporting Nicki Minaj back to Trinidad would serve as a reminder that public figures need to be accountable for their words and the broader impact they have on diverse communities,” Tristan Hamilton, who began the most viral petitions at the time, wrote on the website. “It's not just about one person's fall from grace; it's about holding everyone to a standard of compassion and consistency, especially when they possess significant influence.”

	Three paintings by late artist Bob Ross — who taught art to viewers nationwide for more than a decade in the 1980s and early Nineties on PBS TV series, The Joy of Painting — sold for a total of  $1.27 million in support of public television following the devastating federal cuts by the Trump administration.


	Auction house Bonhams Skinner announced the news on Jan. 28 and detailed that Ross' 1990 oil painting “Change of Seasons” surpassed its estimate of $60,000 and brought in $787,900, leading the sales. The painting, created during the TV series' 20th season, depicts autumn trees framing snowy mountains in the background, and was described by Ross himself as “just a beautiful little painting'.”


	The other two landscape paintings by Ross included Valley View (1990) and Babbling Brook (1993), which sold for $203,700 and $279,900, respectively — also exceeding their presale estimates. The trio of art collectively garnered more than half of the auction's total sales of $2.4 million at Bonhams Skinner's “Americana: Crafting a Nation: Art, History & Legacy” auction, held in Marlborough, Massachusetts.⁠

	“To see Bob's paintings resonate so powerfully reminds me that his work continues to bring joy and meaning to people's lives,” said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc., in a statement. “I'm hopeful that Bob's work can provide meaningful support to stations nationwide. It's exactly what Bob would have wanted — to continue inspiring and uplifting public television for generations to come.”American Public Television (APT), a non-profit syndicator of television programming, offered the Ross paintings and pledged to direct 100 percent of net proceeds to public television stations around the U.S.⁠ A new collection by the beloved artist will be available at Bonhams Skinner's New York auction in April.⁠

	











	In July, President Donald Trump signed a bill cancelling $1.1 billion in congressional funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps direct federal funds to NPR and PBS, while most of the money is sent to support more than 1,500 local public radio and television stations across the country.

‘When I Found You' sees him back sharing studio time and artistic space with Paul van Dyk, and after their first team-up (‘Someone Like You', for Paul's 2025 ‘This World Is Ours' album), fair to say expectations are at an apex.

Popping January's floors, and plenty of goosebumps along with them, here comes ‘When I Found You'.

Through the instrumental axis of McAuley's melodic sensibilities and van Dyk's propellant architecture, ‘Found You' brilliantly reestablishes their creative rapport.



Clarifying around a recurring, nagging, floor-snagging riff, through the thrust of its floor-kinetic bottom end ‘When I Found You's production presses its advantage. That single-minded drive is framed by steadily evolving melodic and harmonic layers, which widen its club space without ever tipping into excess. Dialing in sailing riffs and carefree atmospherics, between them Paul and Ciaran conjure another instrumental masterstroke.

Whether you be north, south, east or west of our big blue ‘n' green spinning thing, your January needs this! Find it wherever the finest electronic music is streamed or sold (or spun!).

Academic freedom—the right to teach, study, pursue knowledge or research without unreasonable interference—is often perceived through a narrow lens in our country. The dismissal or silencing of a teacher practising this right, often has much deeper and potentially dangerous implications. When academic freedom is attacked in one place, it sends a message far beyond the individual concerned. If one teacher can be punished, cornered, or publicly humiliated, it becomes a warning to thousands of others. The damage, then, is not individual; it is systemic. In Bangladesh, political, economic, social, and cultural forces frequently converge to create an increasingly hostile environment for teachers, researchers, and students alike.

Traditionally, the gravest threat to academic freedom comes from the state. When governments restrict dissent, criminalise speech, or politicise education, academic life becomes fragile. Bangladesh experienced this acutely during Sheikh Hasina's rule, when teachers were jailed, harassed under the Digital Security Act, 2018, subjected to surveillance and intimidation simply for expressing opinions or criticising injustice. Speaking out—whether inside or outside the classroom—became a high-risk act.

However, state repression is only one part of the picture. Neoliberal capitalism has also played a decisive role. Since education has been commodified and reduced to a form of skill training, disciplines that are not immediately “marketable”—promising immediate lucrative job opportunities—have come under pressure. Subjects that encourage critical thinking, social analysis, or dissent are increasingly seen as unproductive or even dangerous. Over time, this creates a social perception that certain disciplines—and by extension, their teachers—are dispensable. The freedom to teach, research, and even attract students gradually erodes.

This is compounded by the rise of social and cultural authoritarianism. When decisions about what should be taught, who should teach, and who should study are influenced not by academic standards but by religious sentiment, political allegiance, or pressure from organised groups, academic integrity collapses. Universities cease to be spaces that promote inquisitiveness and become battlegrounds for moral policing and ideological control.

The consequences of this erosion are not confined to higher education. When academic freedom is damaged at the tertiary level, its effects trickle downwards—to secondary, primary, and even pre-primary education. Fear, conformity, and self-censorship become normalised across the entire education system.

However, academic freedom is not destroyed only by dismissals of teachers. There are many quieter, bureaucratic ways to strangle it. In South Asia, we inherited colonial legal and administrative structures, including the University Grants Commission (UGC) model, which continues to enable excessive control over universities. These structures, combined with neoliberal “quality assurance” frameworks shaped by international financial and development institutions, often force knowledge into narrow, standardised moulds. Under the guise of maintaining quality, they limit intellectual diversity and autonomy.

At the institutional level, pressures are both overt and subtle. Teachers may be told what they can or cannot teach. More commonly, they are punished for being vocal against injustice in society or governance failures—activities that may not be part of their formal academic duties but are inseparable from the role of an academic. Over the past 15–16 years, we have seen teachers being imprisoned, sued, and harassed for expressing opinions. Some have been repeatedly remanded, their dignity and security systematically stripped away.

In extreme cases, academic freedom has been met with outright violence. The enforced disappearance of researcher Mubashar Hasan because of his research topic represents one of the most brutal assaults on academic inquiry imaginable. Others have lost their jobs, faced politically motivated cases, or endured physical attacks. There have been instances where progressive teachers and writers were hacked to death in the past. Students, too, have been targeted—arrested, detained, and prosecuted simply for expressing views.

There are also less visible forms of coercion. Administrative systems are often designed to wear teachers down by delaying promotions, denying leave, manipulating housing, and creating an atmosphere in which survival depends on obedience. This breeds self-censorship, where conformity becomes a strategy for safety.

While these patterns were stark during the Awami League era, the situation has not improved since. What has changed is the nature of the perpetrators. Academic freedom is no longer violated only by the state or university administrations. Increasingly, students, alumni, and sections of the general public are engaging in intimidation, harassment, and physical aggression against teachers.

Elected student representatives have stormed offices, threatened administrators, and publicly humiliated faculty members. Sometimes, teachers have been obstructed from teaching certain subjects. Online spaces have become arenas of relentless cyberbullying, misinformation, and character assassination. Academics are routinely delegitimised through coordinated hate campaigns that twist words and fabricate allegations.

This climate has led to a disturbing conclusion: academic freedom in Bangladesh is virtually non-existent. However, at this point, it is also crucial to clarify what academic freedom does not mean. It does not protect hate speech, incitement to violence, or actions that endanger the lives and freedoms of others. Such acts fall outside the bounds of academic freedom and must be addressed through due process.

The absence of due process is, in fact, one of the most damaging aspects of the current crisis. Over the past 17 months, we have repeatedly seen instant punishment being meted out based on mere accusations and mob pressure, without investigation or accountability. When due process collapses, no one—teacher, student, or administrator—has real rights. Besides, trust between teachers and students, which is central to any functioning classroom, disintegrates. 

This breakdown has been actively encouraged. Violence, intimidation, and humiliation have gone unchecked, sometimes even tacitly endorsed by the highest authorities. As a result, fear has become the organising principle of academic life.

The termination of Layeqa Bashir and ASM Mohsin at the University of Asia Pacific (UAP) must be seen in this context. This was not an isolated incident but the culmination of 17 months of unchecked violations of academic freedom and due process. The spectacle of mobs forcing administrative decisions without investigation sets a terrifying precedent.

By allowing this to happen, the UAP has inflicted lasting damage on its own credibility. Many teachers may now choose to leave this profession, recognising that their rights are unprotected and that university administrations are either unwilling or incapable of acting as administrators at all.

This problem extends far beyond one university. From Chattogram to Rajshahi, from Jahangirnagar to Dhaka University, and across numerous private universities, the pattern is the same. Student groups linked to political organisations have simply replaced earlier political actors, who once gagged academic freedom on campuses. 

University administrations, the UGC, and the Ministry of Education all bear responsibility. In the case of UAP, the UGC was informed early and urged to intervene, but they failed to act. This inaction has contributed directly to the deterioration of academic freedom at a moment when, after the July uprising, many hoped for meaningful change.

Instead of qualitative improvement, we are witnessing qualitative decline. For institutions of higher learning, this is an ominous warning. If administrations cannot govern, they should step aside. Otherwise, universities will soon be run not by academic principles but by intimidation and mob influence.

Academic freedom cannot survive in such conditions. And without academic freedom, universities lose their very reason for existence.

Because awards season is 365 days a year

Probably the most exciting part of low-budget horror filmmaking is that the films tend to latch themselves onto one singular gimmick and take it to extreme, terrifying levels. The found footage subgenre proves this time and time again, starting from the phenomenon that was The Blair Witch Project, and then over the years, we see the subgenre revived in slightly different forms, from home video surveillance in Paranormal Activity to online on-screen meetings like Unfriended.

In the case of Ian Tuason's directorial debut with Undertone, he taps into something that is far more primal. Instead of focusing on a subgenre or a concept, Tuason explores the medium of audio itself, one of the most crucial aspects in terrorizing a viewer. With a premise centering around a podcaster listening to creepy audio files, Undertone thrives in its simplicity, as it careens to us as this undeniable, exciting new voice in horror.

Our podcaster is Evy (Nina Kiri), who has recently moved home to care for her dying mother (Michèle Duquet). Her mom hasn't eaten or drank anything for days, and the nurse has already prepped Evy for her mother's imminent death via a “death rattle” sound she will make. In between taking care of her mother, Evy runs “The Undertone Podcast” with Justin (voiced by Kris Holden-Ried). Each episode sees them listening to a new creepy recording, which is typically sent to them by a listener, and they debate or debunk what they've just heard. Justin, being a superstitious believer in old folk tales and the occult, would often lean in on the recordings and try to connect them with real urban myths. Evy, on the other hand, is our devil's advocate. She wears that skeptic hat with pride, as she turns down practically every theory from Justin.

Things go up a notch when they receive a mysterious email containing ten audio files, which depict a married couple named Mike and Jessa (voiced by Jeff Yung and Keana Lyn Bastidas), who begin to experience… ahem… paranormal activity in their home. What starts off as simply Jessa talking in her sleep soon escalates into something far more disturbing in each succeeding file, as Evy begins to fear that this sinister presence has seeped over to her home.

Undertone is clearly inspired by many other horror stories. The audio recordings Evy and Justin listen to are very much an audio-recorded version of the first Paranormal Activity film, while much of the second act of the film bears similarities to Sinister (Justin even uncovers a demonic connection later on, identifying a figure that's essentially Bughuul from Sinister). Even the bedroom Evy's mother is sleeping in is a visual callback to The Exorcist. Evy has to climb a flight of stairs up every time to get to the bedroom, and even the lighting from the lamp has a similar cold blue hue where you can imagine Max von Sydow and Jason Miller squaring off Linda Blair. Through these creative inspirations, Undertone is very familiar in its content. The narrative doesn't go beyond its hook, resulting in a few beats that are repetitive, if not a bit tedious. The film really goes through all the recordings – as Evy and Justin go from File #1 to #10 one at a time – and even though the recordings themselves progress and intensify well, the script can't escape having to redo the dynamic of Justin believing in it and Evy dismissing it over and over again each time. It gets to a point where Evy's rejection of File #3 sounds exactly the same as her dismissal of File #7.

Where Undertone truly excels is in its form, specifically the work of sound designer David Gertsman and cinematographer Graham Beasley for how they create an ultimate immersive experience. Every time Evy puts on her headphones, all sound is sucked out – exactly how it feels when you put on noise-cancelling headphones. As she looks into abnormalities in the audio files, playing them over and over again to see if she hears a subtle voice in the background saying something, the film is chillingly effective in getting the audience to lean in. Much like the best of found footage films, where the footage makes you look really hard to see if something is there, Undertone wants you to listen closely. But Tuason's sensibilities with the sound go beyond just designing the creepy sound itself, but knowing how to incorporate them with cinematography and where to deploy them in a theatrical setting.

Tuason favors wide shots in moments where we expect close-ups. Multiple times, a shot will linger a few seconds longer than normal. Evy says goodnight to her mother. She turns the lights off. And the shot stays on the mother's face for just a few seconds too long – enough time for our brains to suspect whether she's going to move. As Evy listens to the recordings, consisting of chantings and bangs against the wall, the shot itself has Evy occupying only half of the frame, while the other half shows a hallway in her home. Naturally, our eyes keep staring and we imagine if something (or someone) is there in the house, but as the sound effects play, a sharp viewer would start to notice where in the theater the sound is coming from. “I swear those wall bang sounds were coming from the left speaker, but that last one just came out of the speaker on the right.” Combine those kinds of thoughts with camera framing that makes you expect something in the background, you start to wonder whether those sounds are coming from the audio recording Evy's listening to or if they're coming from her house.

Perhaps the biggest achievement in Undertone is the way it “conditions” us to start imagining things that may or may not be there. When we're not sure whether something is actually standing in the dark, and we can't know for certain whether the sound we're hearing is just an audio file from a computer or actually happening in our physical space, our minds play tricks on us. Reminiscent of the best urban legends and creepypastas, Undertone knows how to do a lot with very little. The best thing I can say about Tuason as a filmmaker is that he fully understands that the audience is capable of freaking themselves out.

It all builds to a riveting climax in which time and time again, Tuason cuts to black and we can only listen – a smart inversion of our gut reactions to “look away” when the film is too frightening. Here, when there's nothing to look at, our imagination makes everything worse. Though the film isn't the sharpest or most original narratively, it's hard to knock a filmmaker whose goal is to create an immersive soundscape, something that has not been done before to this extent. That the end result feels like something I shouldn't be listening to in the first place is an achievement in and of itself. As Undertone comes to its (quite literally) spellbinding end, you can't help but feel like Ian Tuason has just cursed all of us.

Grade: B+

Keith's note: last week NASA decided to halt support for MD Planetary Science Division Analysis and Assessment Groups. The following email was shared widely by the ExMAG executive committee: “Dear Colleagues, The NASA Planetary Science Division (PSD) Director recently announced that the PSD will cease formal support for various Analyses and Assessment Groups (AGs) effective in May 2026.” Full email below.

The letter highlighted the significant values of AGs and recent changes in the NASA landscape that led to the decision. You can review the full announcement here: https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/resources/psd-director-letter-to-the-community/

Despite this decision, the Extraterrestrial Materials Analysis Group (ExMAG) will continue its mission, serving as a vital bridge between the sample science community and NASA leadership.

Since our founding (transitioning from CAPTEM in 2021), ExMAG has been a cornerstone of two-way communication between the sample science community and NASA decision-makers. Recent successes highlight the power of our collective voices:

The rigorous analysis of extraterrestrial materials does more than answer existing questions; it redefines our understanding of the solar system. For example, the discovery of non-negligible OH in Apollo volcanic samples fundamentally shifted our view of lunar volatiles and the Earth-Moon formation. As such, the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey, Origins, Worlds, and Life, placed several sample return missions as top priorities for space exploration.

In the meantime, asteroid samples from OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions are available for the entire science community, and new samples are being planned to return from the lunar South Pole region by Artemis III and from the martian moon Phobos by the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission in 2031. In this new era, it is more essential than ever that community-led assessments of collection, curation, facility, and technology readiness help NASA to prioritize and plan for these samples' return and analysis. ExMAG remains committed to engaging the sample science community and providing a voice for the community to policymakers.

The loss of formal and financial PSD support will impact our operational infrastructure, specifically our annual meetings, the maintenance of the ExMAG website, and the archiving of past documents. The Executive Committee is currently exploring alternative organizational models, archiving, web hosting, and funding options to ensure our long-term sustainability. We are dedicated to maintaining a platform where community-driven analysis can directly influence the decisions that shape the future of planetary science.

We will keep you informed as we finalize our path forward. We want to thank you for your unwavering support and look forward to championing the interests of the sample community for years to come.

The ExMAG executive committee:

Yang Liu (Chair), Philipp Heck (Chair emeritus, acting Vice Chair), Neeraja Chinchalkar, Zack Gainsforth, Danny Glavin, Pierre Haenecour, Lydia Hallis, Rhiannon Mayne, Molly McCanta, Peng Ni, Evgenia Salin, Arya Udry, Nicolle Zellner

A former CIA insider has thrown open one of the most controversial files in UFO history. Scotty Newton Miler, an FBI whistleblower and Church Committee witness, claims that the majority of the MJ-12, also called Majestic-12, documents are authentic.

These papers, first surfacing in the 1980s, have long been dismissed by mainstream sources as hoaxes or disinformation, yet new declassified material from the Trump-era JFK releases has reignited debate over their credibility.

The mysterious documents first appeared in mid-December 1984 when Los Angeles television writer Jamie Shandera received an unmarked package containing an undeveloped 35mm film roll. Bearing a New Mexico postmark but no return address, the film revealed what appeared to be classified briefing documents concerning an alleged government programme studying extraterrestrial phenomena.

Shandera, intrigued, shared the findings with ufologist William Moore, co-author of The Roswell Incident. Their investigation eventually uncovered the related 'Cutler-Twining memo' in the National Archives in 1985, considered a potential corroboration of the leak.

It was not until 1987 that the wider public became aware of the documents, when British ufologist Timothy Good received a copy from an alleged intelligence source. Moore and Shandera then released their versions to the press. Despite mainstream scepticism, some of the original insiders now argue the papers may have been partially genuine, though possibly mixed with disinformation.

Newton, also known as 'Source S-1,' was closely aligned with CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton and testified alongside him during the Church Committee hearings of the 1970s. Following his retirement from the CIA in 1974, Newton led the New Mexico chapter of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, where he networked with other intelligence professionals.

Newton has now confirmed he leaked the MJ-12 documents, asserting their legitimacy. He claims that certain previously doubted files, including the A.A.W.S.A.P. B.A.A.S.S. ten-month report and the 'Kona Blue' document, are authentic. According to Newton, these papers were intended strictly for high-level SCI-F access and were never meant for public consumption. His statements suggest a deliberate suppression and disinformation campaign orchestrated by the CIA's Office of Global Access, aimed at discrediting genuine evidence of extraterrestrial visitation.

The debate over MJ-12 has intensified following the declassification of thousands of pages from the JFK assassination records under President Donald Trump's Executive Order 14176, signed in January 2025. The releases, managed by the National Archives, exposed previously withheld documents and brought attention to Newton's leak. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets scrutinised the releases, examining potential CIA cover-ups and misleading of Congress.

Within these declassified records, researchers uncovered supporting evidence for the MJ-12 files. Dr James Lakatski, who had access to the original S.A.P. documents, confirmed that the 'Kona Blue' report referred to historical events rather than a future plan. This lends credence to Newton's assertion that the MJ-12 papers are not mere fabrications but part of a highly controlled intelligence programme.

If Newton's claims are accurate, the implications are staggering. They suggest the US government maintained a sophisticated suppression programme to control information about extraterrestrial activity on Earth, dating back thousands of years. References within the files indicate interstellar visitation may have occurred as far back as 12,000 years ago, challenging conventional historical narratives.

The controversy also highlights the role of government 'debunkers' and disinformation agents, allegedly funded to protect sensitive programs. Even decades after the initial leak, mainstream agencies such as the FBI and the Air Force officially labelled the MJ-12 papers as fakes. However, Newton's whistleblowing and recent corroborations indicate that these denials may have been part of a broader cover-up.

With the MJ-12 files now resurfacing and further corroborated by credible insiders, the conversation about UFOs and government transparency is far from over. The documents continue to stir debate among ufologists, historians, and intelligence professionals, suggesting that the story of extraterrestrial encounters may be more than just myth or legend.

Erin Doherty (“Adolescence”) and James McAvoy (Split) will star in the supernatural drama Faith, Variety has learned.

Production is currently underway in the UK under British writer-director Paul Andrew Williams (The Cottage).

It follows Gina, a hard-working and devoted single mother who meets a quietly enigmatic stranger, Michael. The presence of someone who appears to care for her brings a new and exciting dynamic to her life, despite the fact she knows nothing about him or what his intentions towards her really are.

Is he a friend, a potential lover, or something more sinister? When Gina's life is abruptly turned upside down and Michael's extraordinary true identity is revealed, she learns that she might just be able to embrace the beauty of living life fully again.

Liv Hill (The Little Stranger) and Smylie Bradwell (Hamnet) round out the cast.

The project is produced by Dominic Tighe of Giant Productions and Danny Page of Homefront Productions & Blazing Griffin.

“Faith is a deeply personal story to me,” said Williams. “Telling a story of strength and hope, set in a known reality yet shadowed by something other worldly that we can't quite explain which is guiding us through life.”

Williams continues, “I am so fortunate to be working with such a talented group of actors and crew who value what this film is trying to achieve. Collaborating with Erin Doherty and James McAvoy has been a gift. Their commitment elevates every moment.”

Faith will be introduced to buyers at the European Film Market in Berlin next month with Bankside Films and Logical handling worldwide sales.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Donald Trump Has No 'Fantasies Of Love' With Melania, Moves Towards 'Business Partner' Relationship: Psychic","https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/donald-trump-has-no-fantasies-love-melania-moves-towards-business-partner-relationship-1774834","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:45:00 GMT","

Donald Trump and Melania Trump are being cast less as a romantic couple and more as a carefully managed power partnership, according to a new psychic reading that claims their marriage now operates like a brand alliance rather than a love story.

The marriage of Donald and Melania Trump is reportedly shifting into a strategic power alliance, with the couple prioritising 'career goals' and brand-building over romantic connection in 2026.

Speaking on behalf of Psychic Chat, astrologer and tarot reader Inbaal Honigman suggested the President and First Lady are moving away from 'fantasies of love' to focus on their collective influence as a meticulously managed global brand. This assessment follows a high-profile first year back in the White House, where the couple has been seen presenting a united, if professional, front at major state events.

The claims arrive amid renewed scrutiny of the Trumps' public chemistry, following high-profile appearances that have fuelled speculation about the true nature of their relationship.

According to Honigman, the Tarot's 9 of Wands card suggests the pair will be increasingly visible together throughout 2026. She predicts more photo opportunities, trips and public activities as they present a united front and 'build a stronger brand as Mr and Mrs'.​

Honigman argues that the energy around them is far more calculated than hearts-and-flowers, saying the focus will be on enhancing their 'value' as a couple instead of nurturing their 'love connection'.​

'They each want to fulfil their career goals as a married couple, but they're not looking for any fantasies of love,' she insisted, suggesting their priorities are firmly rooted in power and influence. The implication is that the Trumps' marriage may now function much like a carefully orchestrated brand collaboration — mutually beneficial, highly visible, and meticulously managed.​

A post shared by instagram

Honigman also foresees a hectic and lucrative year for Melania in her own right. Drawing the 9 of Pentacles card, she said the First Lady, 55, is heading into 2026 with 'high earnings and varied contacts', with the Tarot placing her at the 'epicentre of multiple charities and donations'.​

One revenue stream, Honigman claimed, will come from Melania's philanthropic interests, positioning her as a high-profile figure across several charitable causes. Beyond that, the psychic believes there is a more discreet commercial layer to Melania's image.​

'In addition, there are lots of secret contracts and agreements around what the lady wears and how she styles her hair and make up,' Honigman continued, portraying Melania as an unofficial style ambassador. She 'acts as an unofficial influencer for many brands, and receives lovely gifts and sponsorships in order to promote upmarket trends and styles', a set‑up that blurs the line between personal glamour and professional branding.​

Those claims arrive as Melania steps further into the spotlight with MELANIA, a feature documentary produced with Amazon MGM Studios that recently held a private black‑tie screening at the White House ahead of its worldwide cinema release. The film tracks the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's latest presidential inauguration, with Melania describing that period as a 'rare and defining moment' requiring 'meticulous care, integrity and uncompromising craftsmanship'.

Honigman's reading casts Melania not just as a public figure but as the dominant force within the Trump family. She said the Emperor 'major arcana' Tarot card shows how the former model is 'in complete control of her family', suggesting a commanding presence behind closed doors.​

That same card, she added, underpins a pivotal year for the couple's only child together, Barron Trump, 19. Currently studying at New York University, Barron 'will take his first steps towards a serious career in this coming year, aided by his well-connected parents'.

A post shared by instagram

'The Emperor card is mature and dominant, and it reveals a fearless approach for the First Lady in her role within the family,' Honigman noted, implying that Melania is the one quietly steering her son's next chapter. Her influence, the psychic suggests, stretches from the carefully curated outfits that make global headlines to the long‑term decisions shaping Barron's adult life.​

According to reports from People Magazine, the two continue to maintain independent quarters within the White House, coming together primarily for ceremonial duties and shared interests like interior design.

Donald, 79, and Melania married in 2005, and every gesture between them has been dissected ever since he entered national politics. That scrutiny intensified at a recent private White House screening of MELANIA, where the pair held hands for photographers but did not share a kiss, a detail that quickly filtered into online commentary about their chemistry.

Their New Year's Eve appearance prompted similar chatter, with viral clips sparking debate over whether the couple actually kissed at midnight and viewers describing the moment as 'awkward'. Against that backdrop, Honigman's claim that the Trumps are 'not looking for any fantasies of love' lands into an already sceptical public conversation about whether theirs is a love story, a power alliance — or, increasingly, a bit of both.

As the First Family settles into the second year of the term, the focus remains firmly on legacy and professional longevity, confirming that for the Trumps, the business of marriage is currently the family's most successful enterprise.

CENTRE COUNTY — On a quiet winter night in 1991, a bar in rural Centre County closed like it had a hundred times before. The lights went off. The cash drawer was put away. The door was locked. But the woman who should have gone home afterward never did.

More than three decades later, the disappearance of Brenda Condon remains one of Centre County's most haunting unsolved mysteries. It's a case that has lingered in the background of local memory, resurfacing every few years with renewed urgency, but never resolution.

Brenda Louise Condon was 28 years old on the night of Feb. 27, 1991. She was working as a bartender at Carl's Bad Tavern, a small place near Bellefonte that now lives on only in memory and in the bones of a building that has long since changed hands. That night, she was scheduled to close the bar and then return for the morning shift. What happened in the span of those hours remains one of the county's most confounding disappearances.

Condon was last seen tending bar, maybe chatting with the last patron of the night. When a coworker came to relieve her, the tavern was abandoned. Her car, a gray Mercury Capri, sat in the parking lot. Her cowboy boots were found in the men's bathroom. Her purse and car keys were never recovered. There were no overt signs of a struggle and the night's receipts were tucked away.

Then there was nothing.

The search that followed was intense. Local and state police canvassed the area, interviewed people and chased leads. Brenda's two children, living in Clearfield at the time, waited for her to show up. But days turned to weeks, weeks turned to years and the case grew cold. For the people who knew her, for the ones who worked with her, and for her family, that coldness was a kind of hurt that just didn't fade.

Over the years, the mystery took on its own life. People speculated. Rumors floated on the wind of Penns Valley and around kitchen tables in State College. The internet gave rise to a few forums and pages dedicated to unsolved cases, and Brenda's name found its way into those lists.

Still, solid information was scarce.

Then came someone outside the formal investigation: Kenneth Mains, a retired detective and founder of the American Investigative Society of Cold Cases. Mains grew up nearby. He watched the disappearance unfold in real time as a teenager, and the threads of the case never left him. Over the last several years, he's devoted hours of his own time to digging into Brenda's disappearance, even turning it into a multi-episode series on his YouTube channel “Unsolved No More.”

Mains' work wasn't an official reopening of the case. But he interviewed friends, family and acquaintances, combed through old tips, and looked closely at the few credible leads that came his way. One of his conclusions, shared in the final episode of his series, is that someone who passed through Bellefonte that night — a man working on a crew in the area — may have been involved. He shared his thoughts with Brenda's family and continues to support them, hoping one day something breaks in the case.

In a sign that authorities still want answers, the Pennsylvania State Police are now offering a $5,000 reward for information that helps solve Brenda's disappearance.

Is upgrading from coach to business class on Amtrak actually worth it?

I traveled in both to find out.

While booking train tickets between New York City and Providence, Rhode Island, for a trip in January, I purchased a $30 coach seat on a Northeast Regional train and a $150 return trip in business class on an Acela train.

Here's how the two travel experiences compare — and why I'd definitely splurge on business class again.

Moynihan Train Hall opened in 2021 after a $1.6 billion renovation.

Amtrak passengers traveling in coach or business class can purchase a single-visit pass to the New York City lounge for $50.

The waiting area had its own bathrooms on either side, which helped me avoid the long lines often found at Moynihan Train Hall's public restrooms. Other than that, it was a basic waiting area with benches and a few outlets.

The Northeast Regional trains offer coach and business class, not first class. I paid $30 for my coach seat.

Many passengers immediately claimed an entire row to themselves by putting their bags on the seats next to them and studiously avoiding eye contact with those still walking through the aisles.

As nice as it would have been to have a row to myself, I couldn't bring myself to block off the seat next to me, so it was quickly occupied by another passenger.

In Amtrak train cars, half of the seats face one direction and half face the other. That way, there are always some seats facing in the direction of travel, regardless of the route.

For some, facing one direction while moving in another can disrupt coordination between the brain, eyes, and inner ear, leading to dizziness and nausea. I'm prone to motion sickness, so sitting backward on the train as it swayed and jerked along the track made me feel nauseous after a few minutes. When the conductor came along to scan my ticket, I told her that I wanted to change seats before she issued my seat check, and she waved me along.

There were a few empty backward-facing rows left, but I decided to sacrifice the extra space to avoid feeling sick on my trip. I sheepishly asked another passenger in a forward-facing window seat to move his backpack so that I could take the aisle seat next to him.

I then realized I had hit another snag — both seat outlets for our row were located next to the window seat. If I wanted to charge my phone or computer, I'd have to reach over my seatmate and string the cord over his lap or under his legs. No wonder the window seats were all taken.

I decided to forgo charging my devices for the time being.

The menu included breakfast items ranging from $4 to $8, sandwiches costing between $10 and $11.50, and drinks such as soda, juice, Starbucks coffee, beer, wine, and hard seltzer ranging from $3.50 to $16.

I was pleasantly surprised to find an outlet in the bathroom, as well.

I placed my seat check above my new row to signal to the conductors that they had already scanned my ticket.

In the window seat, I had easy access to both outlets, views of the horizon, and the extra space of the empty seat next to me. The earlier stress of the first half of my trip melted away, and the next two hours flew by.

The station was also under construction, so only one main waiting area was open to all passengers.

I originally paid $150 for my Acela business-class seat. However, I traveled the day before a massive winter storm was forecast to slam the US. After I received a travel alert about possible weather-related delays and cancellations, I paid an extra $63 to switch to an earlier train, bringing the total cost of my business-class trip to $213.

Acela also makes fewer stops than Northeast Regional, shaving about 45 minutes off the trip between Providence and New York City.

When booking a business-class ticket, the seat-selection tool indicated the direction of travel, allowing me to choose my preferred forward-facing window seat.

The guides made it simple to know where to board to find my assigned seat.

In my Northeast Regional coach seat, the overhead bins were uncovered, allowing luggage and coats to spill out over the edges. The covered overhead bins in business class gave the Acela train a sleeker look.

I preferred the simplicity of having a reserved seat in business class over the rush of trying to pick a good spot on the fly while boarding in coach.

Amtrak's coach seats feature about 39 inches of legroom, while business-class seats offer about 42 inches.

My business-class seat was spacious enough that the person sitting in the aisle seat next to me didn't have to stand up to let me through.

The coach bathrooms were comparable to airplane bathrooms in terms of their size. In business class, the bathrooms were large enough to move around easily or even change outfits if needed.

I also appreciated the bathroom's frosted window, which helped with my motion sickness while still providing privacy.

I was able to refill my water bottle instead of paying for one from the café car.

The sandwich options, which included cherrywood smoked ham and fontina on marble rye, peppered turkey, Gouda, and spinach on a baguette, and turkey and Havarti on honey wheat sunflower bread, cost $12.50. On the Northeast Regional train, more basic sandwiches were $10.

Even some of the same items were more expensive. A chicken Caesar salad with an identical description on both menus cost $11.50 on the Northeast Regional train and retailed for $15 on Acela.

The drink menu varied slightly, with a custom Acela Blend roasted by La Colombe offered instead of Starbucks, but the prices were largely the same.

The ability to reserve my seat ahead of time, combined with the extra perks of more spacious seats and bathrooms, made my business-class trip more enjoyable than traveling in coach.

An Amtrak representative told Business Insider that ""Business Class provides an enhanced level of comfort as well as a few additional perks during your journey.""

""On many routes in the Northeast, seat selection is offered, providing a more seamless boarding experience and taking the guesswork out of finding a seat,"" the representative said.

For a shorter train ride, I'd probably just try my luck at finding a good seat to save money. For a four-hour trip like this one, business class was definitely worth the upgrade.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Senate blocks massive funding bill, with critical talks underway to avoid government shutdown","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/29/politics/senate-funding-bill-vote-government-shutdown-ice","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:22:57 GMT","


            Bipartisan senators blocked a massive spending bill Thursday, as eleventh-hour talks continue to avoid a costly partial government shutdown that looms at the week's end.
    


            All Democrats, who are pushing to force changes to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies in the wake of Alex Pretti's fatal encounter with federal agents in Minneapolis, voted not to advance the six-bill funding package.
    


            Instead, they are demanding that Republicans and the White House agree to separate funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, from the rest of the package so it can be renegotiated.
    


            Seven conservatives joined Democrats in keeping the package from moving forward in a 45-55 vote. Senate Majority Leader John Thune changed his vote to “no,” to be able to bring the package up for a later vote.
    


            If the Senate cannot get all 100 senators to consent to splitting the DHS funding bill from the remainder of the package, as Democrats are demanding, then several significant agencies, including Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, will face a lapse in funding.
    


            If a deal is reached, however, the bill would have to be approved by both chambers, meaning the narrowly divided House would have to return to Washington and final approval could be delayed until Monday.
    


            As of Thursday morning, leaders from both parties and the White House were moving closer to a deal.
    


Talks intensify to avert shutdown as White House and Senate leaders eye last-ditch deal



            In the works, was a proposal that would provide funding for the rest of the agencies in the package through the end of September but only temporarily extend funding for DHS, allowing the sides to continue to negotiate.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune appeared hopeful ahead of the procedural vote, though he would not say whether he would back some of the proposal offers by Democrats.
    


            “We're getting closer.  Hope it lands. My hope and expectation is that if the White House and Senate Dems work this out they will be able to produce the votes that are necessary to get it passed,” he said.
    


            On Wednesday, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer had laid out his caucus' demands for changes to ICE tactics and protocols that they want to see included in any funding package for DHS: tighten the use of warrants and end roving patrols, enforce a code of conduct comparable to force policies for state and local law enforcement, and for ICE agents to remove their masks and wear body cameras.
    


            However, even if there is a partial government shutdown and DHS is not funded, ICE will remain operational through funding that stems from President Donald Trump's domestic policy package that was passed last summer.

EUROPEAN UNION

Kallas warns of ‘catastrophe'

EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas yesterday warned that Ukraine was facing a “humanitarian catastrophe,” as Russian strikes cut power in frigid winter conditions. Despite US-led talks in Abu Dhabi to end the war, Russia was “bombing Ukrainians, trying to bomb and freeze them to surrender,” Kallas said. “It's a very hard winter and Ukrainians are really suffering. There is a humanitarian catastrophe coming there,” she said at the start of an EU meeting in Brussels. Russia has stepped up its strikes against Ukraine's power and heating infrastructure, plunging residents into darkness and cold as temperatures have dropped as low as minus-20C. The EU is looking to step up support for Ukraine's power grid and is preparing a new round of sanctions on Moscow for the fourth anniversary of its invasion next month. Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Maria Stenergard called for “a full services maritime ban on all Russian vessels that transport energy” to further curb Moscow's revenues. She also urged a ban on fertilizer imports from Russia and a prohibition on exporting luxury goods from the EU to the country.

Chinese man gets asylum

An immigration judge on Wednesday granted asylum to a Chinese man who fled his country after documenting sites of alleged human rights abuses against Uighurs, his mother and lawyer said. Guan Heng (關恆), 38, had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in August, sparking fear among activists and supporters that he could be sent back to China where they said he would likely face persecution. His lawyer, Chen Chuangchuang (陳闖創), said that his actions “driven by his extraordinary moral courage, are worthy of US government protection.” In late 2021, Guan published a 20-minute video online detailing his travel around the northwestern Xinjiang region, visiting alleged detention facilities for Uighurs.

JAPAN

Tokyo University apologizes

University of Tokyo officials on Wednesday issued a public apology after a second medical professor was arrested for bribery, including allegedly accepting sexual services, while working for the top school. Tokyo police last week arrested dermatology professor Shinichi Sato in connection with accepting expensive meals, visits to hostess clubs and even accepting sexual services at “soapland” establishments. “As an educational and research institution, we have profoundly betrayed the trust of society, and we offer our deepest and most sincere apologies,” university president Teruo Fujii told a news conference, pledging reforms at the school. It followed the November arrest of a plastic surgeon who allegedly accepted bribes from a medical equipment manufacturer.

Nipah screening ordered

Authorities have ordered enhanced screening of people entering the country for signs of Nipah virus infections after India confirmed two cases, adding to the number of Asian countries stepping up controls. Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam have also tightened screening at airports. The Nipah virus can cause fever and brain inflammation and has a high mortality rate. There is no vaccine. However, transmission from person to person is not easy and typically requires prolonged contact with an infected individual. Taiwan is to officially list Nipah virus infection as a category 5 notifiable infection disease in March.


PRECARIOUS RELATIONS:

Relations between the US and its northern neighbor have been rocky since Trump returned to the White House a year ago, with spats over trade and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney decrying a “rupture” in the US-led global order. 
During a visit to Beijing earlier this month, Carney hailed a “new strategic partnership” with China that resulted in a “preliminary, but landmark trade agreement” to reduce tariffs — but

This is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,436 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

Russian troops have stepped up aerial bomb attacks in the Pokrovsk sector of Donetsk Oblast, which could signal preparations for an offensive, Yuliia Stepaniuk, head of communications for the 117th Separate Mechanized Brigade, told Suspilne on Jan. 29.

While there were two to three such attacks in the area earlier this week, Russian forces carried out 30 strikes over the past day alone, Stepaniuk said.

""The enemy is likely preparing an offensive. It's preparing for something,"" she said. ""We are wary of this and are currently monitoring the situation.""

Stepaniuk added that despite poor weather, Russian forces continue to use drones intensively at low altitudes, allowing them to ambush Ukrainian troops and monitor their movement routes.

Russian troops are also moving artillery closer to the line of contact, creating additional risks for Ukrainian units, but the Ukrainian army has so far been able to counter them, she added.

The number of firefights has decreased recently, as Ukrainian forces can quickly detect small Russian units. The melting snow has made enemy movements more visible, according to Stepaniuk.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Jan. 29 that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, agreed to his request not to strike Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities and towns for a week.

The U.S. president did not clarify when or how he relayed this request to Putin, or from what date the supposed ceasefire would begin.

""I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week,"" Trump said during a press briefing, stressing that Ukraine is currently facing extremely cold temperatures. ""And he agreed to do that. And I have to tell you, it was very nice.""

Russian forces launched an attack against Kyiv overnight on Jan. 28, which marked only the latest strike against the capital in Moscow's campaign aimed at knocking out Ukraine's energy grid amid freezing temperatures.

The comments follow speculation that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to a pause in attacks on each other's energy infrastructure, though neither side has publicly confirmed the claims or commented on Trump's statement.

When asked by the Kyiv Independent why Russia would agree to the pause, a Ukrainian source familiar with the matter said: ""It's Trump, try to say 'no' to him.""The source also noted that Russia has already begun accumulating ballistic missiles, a statement that follows President Volodymyr Zelensky's warning that Russia is preparing for another major attack in the near future.

Ukraine's Defense Ministry is working with SpaceX to stop Russian drones from using Starlink, Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Jan. 29, warning the satellite internet system is helping them fly farther.

A Defense Ministry team contacted SpaceX within hours after Russian drones using Starlink appeared over Ukrainian cities, proposing solutions to resolve the issue, according to Fedorov.

""Western technology must continue to support the democratic world and protect civilians — not be used for terror and the destruction of peaceful cities,"" Fedorov said in his Telegram post.

Fedorov's report comes a few days after Serhii Beskrestnov, a newly-appointed advisor to Fedorov on defense technology, reported on Jan. 26 that a Starlink-equipped Russian BM-35 drone, which can fly at a range of up to 500 kilometers (about 310 miles), had reached the central-eastern city of Dnipro.

The D.C.-based think tank Institute for the Study of the War reported similarly, saying on Jan. 27 that Russia is increasingly using Starlink-equipped BM-35 drones for mid-range strikes on the Ukrainian rear.

A man stabbed an enlistment officer in the neck on Jan. 28 in the Uman district in Cherkasy Oblast, the regional enlistment office said.

The attack occurred while a group of military personnel were handing out summonses and checking the documents of draft-age men. 

The enlistment office said the officers acted in accordance with Ukrainian law, while the attacker became aggressive and approached the group, striking one of them.

The attacker was detained immediately, and the wounded enlistment officer was taken to a hospital.

""This cowardly attack is another proof that some citizens have fallen for enemy propaganda, forgetting who is truly responsible for this war aimed at destroying our people as a nation and our country as a state,"" the statement read.

The 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade destroyed a vehicle carrying five Russian soldiers in central Myrnohrad, Donetsk Oblast, the 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Jan. 29, also releasing a video of the attack.

The strike, carried out with FPV (first-person-view) drones, killed one Russian soldier and wounded four others. The vehicle was destroyed and is beyond repair, according to the statement. 

The situation in the city remains difficult, with the Russian army continuing to try to build up its forces in the central part of the city, where fighting is ongoing, the corps said. 

In addition to small infantry units, Russian troops sometimes use light vehicles to attempt quick breakthroughs into the town, the corps added.

Ukrainian forces from the 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, positioned in this sector of the front line, continue search-and-strike operations in Myrnohrad and its outskirts, the statement read.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained a soldier from the Ukrainian Navy's unmanned systems brigade who was allegedly acting as a Russian informant and collecting data on naval drones, the agency said on Jan. 29.

The spy's main targets were the Sea Baby and Magura drones used by the SBU and Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR), the report read. 

The soldier reportedly began cooperating with Russian intelligence through acquaintances, sharing details about his service. 

He was ordered to pass on information about the locations of personnel operating the maritime drones, the coordinates of the drones' storage sites, and their operational routes.

The man is currently in custody, and the investigation is ongoing, the SBU said.

""Law enforcement investigators, together with representatives of Ukrainian expert institutions, will take all necessary measures to identify the repatriated deceased,"" the Coordination Headquarters said in its Telegram post.

The latest repatriation exchange comes as the U.S. pushes Ukraine and Russia to continue peace talks to reach a deal to end the war at all costs. The negotiations for the repatriation of the bodies are one of the few Kyiv-Moscow channels that continue to work, nearly four years into the full-scale war.

At least six people have been killed and 26 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities said on Jan. 29.Russia launched 105 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force said.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky should not “give ultimatums” to the EU over the country's membership in the bloc, Luxembourgish Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel told reporters on Thursday.

Days earlier, the Ukrainian leader said he expects his country to be admitted to the EU by 2027, as part of a US-backed peace deal.

“I'm sorry, I told him…several times ‘don't give ultimatums. It's not in your interest',” Bettel told journalists in Brussels.

“The fact is there are rules, they have the Copenhagen criteria and we need to fulfill them,” he said. The ‘Copenhagen criteria' require an EU aspirant nation to have stable democratic institutions, a competitive market economy, and the bloc's extensive body of law implemented.

Bettel also expressed concern that despite bloc membership being mentioned as part of a settlement of the Ukraine conflict, the EU is being sidelined from the peace talks.

“They are around the table and we are not… I think we are waiting outside for the bill without being around the table.”

According to Zelensky, Ukraine will be fully ready to join the EU by next year.

“We want a specific date in our treaty on ending the war,” he said on Sunday, days after a controversial speech in Davos in which he ridiculed the bloc as indecisive and incapable of defending itself without help from Washington.

Ukraine's EU accession is reportedly being discussed as part of a US-brokered peace deal, which also includes an $800 billion post-war reconstruction plan circulated to bloc members last week.

However, multiple member states have rejected the idea of fast-tracking Ukraine's candidate status into full membership.

“Ukraine's accession on January 1, 2027, is out of the question. It is not possible,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Wednesday, adding that it would take the country “several years” to meet the membership criteria.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stressed that his country's parliament would not vote to allow accession “in the next hundred years.”

Moscow has said it has no objections to Ukraine seeking EU membership. However, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has condemned what he described as the EU's transition into an “aggressive military bloc.”

Ukraine's ambition to join NATO has remained a red line for Russia and one of the underlying causes of the ongoing conflict.

Six suspected investment scammers, along with 25 call center agents, were arrested on Tuesday in Johannesburg during a major crackdown by South African police.

They have been charged with contravening the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act. The suspects, aged between 38 and 61, were apprehended during a joint takedown operation involving local and international law enforcement agencies. The operation formed part of INTERPOL's global Operation JACKAL, which targets online scams and transnational financial crimes.

INTERPOL's Integrated Police Support Group (IPSG), based in Lyon, France, deployed a senior representative from its International Financial Crimes and Anti-Corruption Directorate to support the operation. Authorities said further investigations are ongoing, and additional charges or arrests may follow as the probe into the alleged fraudulent investment scheme continues.

In a similar case, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) arrested five suspects and four companies in connection with an alleged multimillion-rand fraud, theft and money-laundering scheme spanning the Eastern and Western Cape.

According to the Hawks, the investigation centres on Pro Khaya, a construction company based in Gqeberha, which sought to expand its operations to Cape Town between 2015 and 2018.

Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Avele Fumba said the company employed one of the accused, a qualified quantity surveyor, as a branch manager in Cape Town. ”The accused allegedly abused his position by establishing his own private company that offered the same services as the parent company,” Fumba said.

Investigators allege the suspect then identified and worked with subcontractors who colluded with him to generate fake paperwork.

”Through meticulous investigation conducted by the Hawks, the accused strategically identified sub-contractors who colluded with him to facilitate fictitious invoices for payments to be paid by the parent company,” Fumba said.

The Hawks further allege that the subcontractors would then channel money back to the suspect's private company. ”It was further alleged that the sub-contractors in turn would make payments back to his private company.” 

The estimated financial loss to Pro Khaya is about R12 million.

US government could see shutdown on Friday as Democrats stall funding bill over immigration enforcement reform

A key vote intended to head off a partial government shutdown failed in the Senate on Thursday, after Democrats refused to back funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unless it included reforms to federal agents involved in Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign.

However a Senate aide confirmed that Democrats have been negotiating with Republicans on a deal that could result in passage of most government funding bills and a short-term measure covering the DHS, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the US border patrol.

The intention would be to buy time for further talks over Democrats' demands for changes to immigration enforcement in the wake of the deaths of US citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis, which include an end to mask wearing by federal agents, the imposition of a code of conduct and independent investigations of its violations.

Nonetheless, the procedural vote's failure in the Senate appears to guarantee at least a partial government shutdown beginning after Friday, when the current spending authorizations for many government departments expire. Any changes to the DHS funding bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is out of session until Monday.

“Republicans in Congress cannot allow this violent status quo to continue. They must work with Democrats on legislation, real legislation, strong legislation to rein ICE in,” the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said before the vote.

“Democrats are ready to pass five bipartisan funding bills in the Senate, we're ready to pass them today. We're ready to fund 96% of the federal government today, but the DHS bill still needs a lot of work.”

The Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, had asked the chamber to pass a package of six bills that would fund through September departments including homeland security, defense, labor, and health and human services. The House of Representatives approved the measures last week, but Democratic senators rejected the DHS funding bill following the Saturday shooting death of Alex Pretti in Minnesota's largest city by federal agents

Schumer demanded that the DHS bill be set aside so that reforms to agents' conduct could be written into it, but Thune declined, setting the stage for Thursday's failed vote, which required at least some Democratic support to clear the filibuster's 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

All 47 Democratic senators voted against advancing the package, along with seven Republican senators. Thune also voted no so that he could bring the measure back up for consideration in the future.

A Senate aide confirmed to the Guardian that the two sides had been discussing a deal to fund the DHS for the short term and the rest of the government through the fiscal year, but emphasized that the talks remained fluid.

Signs have meanwhile emerged that Republicans are looking to compromise, with Trump acknowledging the negotiations during a cabinet meeting at the White House. “I think we're getting close,” he said, adding: “Hopefully we won't have a shutdown.”

A White House official said that the president “wants the government to remain open, and the administration has been working with both parties to ensure the American people don't have to endure another shutdown”.

Before Democrats announced their conditions on Wednesday, Thune told reporters: “We're anxious to hear what their demands are, what their requests are, what their asks are. I think the administration is willing to sit down with them and have a discussion, perhaps a negotiation about how do we move forward.”

At a press conference in Minneapolis on Thursday morning, Trump's “border czar”, Tom Homan, noted that the administration has “recognized that certain improvements could and should be made” in the ongoing immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, but did not specify what those looked like or when they would be implemented.

“For the people out there don't like what ICE is doing, if you want certain laws reformed, then take it up with Congress,” Homan said. “They're enforcing laws enacted by Congress and signed by president. The same laws have been on the books for the last six presidents I worked for.”

With the House out of session, it remains likely that funding for the DHS will expire, at least over the weekend. That would be unlikely to stop ICE's deportation operations, since the agency received tens of billions of dollars under the One Big Beautiful Bill act passed last year, and the White House could also order its employees to work through a shutdown.

Justice department alleges Anthony Kazmierczak ‘forcibly assaulted' Democrat with water-vinegar mixture

ICE ends Maine surge as border czar pledges to keep Minnesota operation

Minneapolis on edge despite Trump's de-escalation vow

The Justice Department has filed charges today against the man who allegedly tried to spray Democrat representative Ilhan Omar with a “mixture of water and apple cider vinegar” from a syringe during a town hall in Minneapolis on Tuesday.

The affidavit alleges that Anthony Kazmierczak “forcibly assaulted, opposed, impeded, intimidated an officer and employee of the United States” while she was engaged in official duties.

Omar, who has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota, had just finished calling for the resignation of Kristi Noem when Kamierczak appeared to say, “She's not resigning. You're splitting Minnesotans apart” after spraying her, according to the FBI.

This morning, Omar appeared on CNN to reiterate her stance against the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration. “The difference between the president and I is that I was raised to be a decent human being, and my faith teaches me to have compassion,” she said. “He lacks both of those things.”

Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said that he called Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar after she was sprayed with vinegar during her town hall on Tuesday night in Minneapolis.

“We deal with member security issues as they rise” he told a CNN reporter. “I called her as I do any member who has a situation like that. I talked with her briefly, I think she felt like she had adequate protection there.”

The man who sprayed the substance has since been charged with assault.

When asked by reporters whether a deal has been reached to avoid a government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, said on Thursday afternoon that they are “trending in the right direction, but I don't think we're quite there yet.”

Another reporter asked whether he had talked to the White House “about what to do” to which Thune responded: “Yes.”

Democratic Senator Tina Smith, of Minnesota, has said that she was not satisfied by the remarks made this morning by Tom Homan.

When asked by CNN's Manu Raji “was what Tom Homan laid out enough for you?” Smith responded: “No, not at all, it was more conciliatory words but no detail. And I'm looking for information about when troops are leaving.”

“I think ICE needs to get out of Minnesota” Smith added. “I think it is dangerous when they are there, I'm looking for much more detail than he offered today.”

A new survey from Pew Research has found that over 60% of Americans oppose suspending all applications for asylum and giving immigration priority to people if they pay a $1 million fee. 

The survey of 8,512 US adults, conducted between 20 January and 26 January, also found that over 60% of those surveyed oppose keeping large numbers of immigrants in detention centers while their cases are decided, and are against pausing immigration visa applications from people in 75 countries.

But, the survey found that 62% of respondents favor maintaining a large military presence at the US-Mexico border, and that 56% of respondents said that they were in favor of requiring people who want to enter the US to let immigration officers review their social media accounts.

“There are wide partisan gaps on many immigration proposals and actions from the Trump administration” the report states. “But majorities of both Republicans and Democrats oppose giving people priority status in the immigration process for a $1 million fee.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has announced that Trump will sign an executive order at 4pm today “launching new initiative to address drug addiction”.

Leavitt made the announcement on X and shared a link to a CBS News story about the order that Trump is scheduled to sign.

The CBS News story says the order will “coordinate a federal government response to drug addiction and substance abuse” and it states that, per a White House fact sheet, the order will create a “White House Great American Recovery Initiative,” which will advise federal agencies on directing grants to support addiction recovery and aim to increase awareness about drug addiction.

The initiative will also reportedly advise agencies on how to integrate programs focused on drug prevention, early intervention, treatment, recovery support and re-entry, CBS reported.

Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, said Thursday that she would not break with her party if a another government shutdown fight emerges, as Democrats have refused to support a funding package that includes money for the Department of Homeland Security following the second fatal shooting of a US citizen in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents.

Cortez Masto, who previously broke with Democrats during the last shutdown, said on Thursday that “there's a difference now.”

“First of all I don't support shutdowns, never have” she said, adding that “the only one that we're questioning right now is Homeland Security, and rightfully so based on what we have seen, the excessive force and demand for accountability for these officers. So, there has to be a callout.”

The University of Minnesota police reportedly arrested 67 protesters who were demonstrating at the Graduate hotel, where demonstrators suspect that immigration agents are staying, on campus on Wednesday night.

In an Instagram post, the University of Minnesota Students for a Democratic Society shared that all protesters had been cited and released as of Thursday morning. Student activist groups will host another rally near the Graduate to protest the arrests.

Chris Van Hollen, a democratic senator from Maryland, promoted a bill on Thursday that addresses the rising electricity costs AI data centers are bringing to the public. During a press conference, he said the legislation sets out to make sure “rate payers should not have to foot the bill of some of the richest companies on earth”.

The top companies driving data center growth are Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta.

Van Hollen cited a Department of Energy report that says it expects power consumption from data centers to more than double by 2028 because of the rise in AI. He also pointed to a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, which estimates average households in the 13 states in the “Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland” region could see their energy bill grow by $70 per month, or $840 per year, because of pass-on costs from tech companies to consumers.

Van Hollen's “Power for the People Act” comes after Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he was partnering with tech companies to ensure they didn't drive up electricity costs for households. “Big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way,'” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Microsoft was the first company to lay out a plan, and OpenAI made a similar announcement days later.

Van Hollen called Trump's announcement “a nice set of principles”, but said it's not enforceable and not complex enough to address strain-on-the-grid issues, such as black outs and brown outs.

The Justice Department has filed charges today against the man who allegedly tried to spray Democrat representative Ilhan Omar with a “mixture of water and apple cider vinegar” from a syringe during a town hall in Minneapolis on Tuesday.

The affidavit alleges that Anthony Kazmierczak “forcibly assaulted, opposed, impeded, intimidated an officer and employee of the United States” while she was engaged in official duties.

Today's cabinet meeting has just ended after going on for over an hour. Trump notably did not take questions from the press.

Moments after Trump said ‘we're getting close' on a deal to avert a US government shutdown, Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for Trump's surge of immigration enforcement.

Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday.

As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands on Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest.

If these demands are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said that Democrats won't provide the needed votes until the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is “reined in and overhauled” and that this is “a moment of truth.”

Trump said that Russian president Vladimir Putin agreed to not fire on Kyiv for a week due to cold weather.

“I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that,” Trump said at the Cabinet meeting, citing “extraordinary cold” in the region.

“It was very nice. A lot of people said, ‘Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he did it,” Trump added.

Trump also said the US “had zero illegal aliens being admitted into our country for the last eight months”.

“That's hard for even me to believe,” he quipped. According to the department of homeland security's own 2025 year-end review, border crossings dropped by 93% year-over-year.

Speaking on the possibility of a government shutdown, Trump said: “Hopefully we won't have a shutdown and we're working on that right now. I think we're getting close. The Democrats, I don't believe, want to see it either. So we'll work in a very bipartisan way, I believe, not to have a shutdown. We don't want to shut down.”

Talks of a government shutdown have been looming since Senate Democrats demanded a series of reforms on federal agents involved in Trump's mass deportation campaign, including a prohibition on wearing masks, the imposition of a code of conduct and independent investigations of violations.

Speaking on Venezuela, Trump said: “We have the major oil companies going to Venezuela now, scouting it out and picking their locations, and they'll be bringing back tremendous wealth for Venezuela and for the United States. And the oil companies will do fine to Venezuela, will actually make for themselves more money than they've ever made before. And that's a good thing.”

He continued: “I just spoke to the president of Venezuela, informed her that we're going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela. American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela, and they'll be safe there.” He also added that he has “instructed Sean Duffy and everybody else concerned, including the military, that if you would, by the end of today, I'd like you out of the airspace over Venezuela”.

Donald Trump has begun speaking at this afternoon's Cabinet meeting. We will bring you lines from the meeting as they come.

Since returning to office, Trump has used his cabinet meetings to review his administration's accomplishments and provide Cabinet members with an opportunity to shower him with compliments.

There's news of shifting sands in Florida, where Alex Vindman, a key player in Donald Trump's first impeachment, announced Tuesday he was running as a Democrat for a US Senate seat.

The army veteran's campaign says it raised a record $1.7m in the 24 hours after launching his candidacy, and it was given a further lift Thursday when Sabato's Crystal Ball, the respected political forecasting arm of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, nudged the race in his favor.

Vindman still has a mountain to climb to topple the incumbent Republican, Ashley Moody, in November. But the shift from “safe” Republican to “likely” Republican is still a notable development in the former swing state that has become reliably red in recent election cycles.

It follows other small but significant Democratic advances during the second Trump administration, including pushing two Republican candidates close in a special congressional election in April, and Eileen Higgins's stunning upset win in Miami's mayoral run-off last month.

Vindman, a retired Lt Col, and his brother Eugene, now Democratic congressman for Virginia, served the national security council in Trump's first term, and raised concerns that sparked an investigation into the president's demands for Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.

China executed 11 people linked to Myanmar criminal gangs, including “key members” of telecom scam operations, state media reported yesterday, as Beijing toughens its response to the sprawling, transnational industry.

Fraud compounds where scammers lure Internet users into fake romantic relationships and cryptocurrency investments have flourished across Southeast Asia, including in Myanmar.

Initially largely targeting Chinese speakers, the criminal groups behind the compounds have expanded operations into multiple languages to steal from victims around the world.

Those conducting the scams are sometimes willing con artists, and other times trafficked foreign nationals forced to work.

In the past few years, Beijing has stepped up cooperation with regional governments to crack down on the compounds, and thousands of people have been repatriated to face trial in China's opaque justice system.

The 11 people executed yesterday were sentenced to death in September by a court in Wenzhou, China, Xinhua news agency said, adding that the court also carried out the executions.

Crimes of those executed included “intentional homicide, intentional injury, unlawful detention, fraud and casino establishment,” Xinhua said.

The death sentences were approved by the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, which found that the evidence produced of crimes committed since 2015 was “conclusive and sufficient,” the report said.

Among the executed were members of the “Ming (明) family criminal group,” whose activities had contributed to the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to “many others,” it said.

Fraud operations centered in Myanmar's border regions have extracted billions of dollars from around the world through phone and Internet scams.

Experts say most of the centers are run by Chinese-led crime syndicates working with Myanmar militias. The fraud activities and crackdowns by Beijing are closely followed in China.

The September rulings that resulted in yesterday's executions also included death sentences with two-year reprieves to five other individuals.

Another 23 suspects were given prison sentences ranging from five years to life.

Prime Minister Mark Carney, left, takes part in a question and answer session with Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs columnist for the Financial Times, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

As an illustration of Canada's relative irrelevance on the world stage, I always liked the story about external affairs minister Lester Pearson's visit to president Dwight Eisenhower, an avid golfer. 

Pearson emerged from a meeting in disbelief that Ike hadn't even heard of a pressing Canadian issue. “You'd think,” he muttered to an aide, “his caddie would have mentioned it to him.”

There have been moments when Canada popped up for a day or two on American news, but by and large we've been a marginal force. That changed with Mark Carney's speech in Davos. 

Read and watch Mark Carney's Davos speech at the World Economic Forum

Suddenly Canada the bit player is a major player. Suddenly the country repeatedly belittled by Donald Trump is emerging as a threat to him. 

The Prime Minister is now seen as leading the resistance among middle powers of the world to American subjugation. He has articulated better than any other world leader why Mr. Trump's abandonment of post-war multilateralism needs be countered.

The Carney speech is being celebrated in the American media, receiving more positive coverage than possibly any speech by a Canadian leader. That may sound like an exaggeration, but going back to 1867, I can't find any rival to it.

Mark Carney denies walking back Davos speech in call with Trump

The New York Times's Ezra Klein described the speech as hugely important, saying that it has stirred “an international relations earthquake.” David French, one of no fewer than five New York Times columnists to opine on the speech, wrote that it “might be the most important address of Trump's second term so far.”

It spelled out a vision for middle powers to find independence, to not let economic integration become a source of submission, to break free from the hegemony, as Mr. Carney called it, that Mr. Trump is trying to impose. 

The speech trenchantly drove home the point, as Mr. French put it, that the U.S. has “broken faith with our allies.” It's another strong argument against Trumpism, and given the enormous attention the address is getting, the Democrats will be likely to use it in the coming midterm elections.

Mark Carney's survival plan: Canada and other ‘middle powers' must co-operate in order to thrive

Normally European countries have taken the lead among advanced democracies in countering American foreign policy. But no European leader did it effectively this time, and Mr. Carney, with his credibility in the global financial system, stepped into the void.

His Davos appearance followed his rapprochement with China, which also serves to increase Ottawa's imprint on the world stage, and which also irked Mr. Trump.

But while heightening Canada's stature, it's far from certain that Mr. Carney's moves will lead to desirable outcomes for his country. They could very easily backfire.

With the USMCA about to be renegotiated, the speech has put Canada in bad odour with the White House at a bad time. It damaged Mr. Carney's relationship with the President. It will make it harder to get a good renegotiated deal, if a deal at all.

In his address Mr. Carney talked about the rupture in the global order, caused principally by Mr. Trump's authoritarian turn, as if it was permanent. “We know the old order is not coming back,” he said.

Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a speech at the World Economic Forum that blamed U.S. President Donald Trump, without naming him, for what Carney described as a rupture in global relations.

But a turning back could start with a decision by the Supreme Court rejecting Mr. Trump's right to use tariffs as a truncheon against allies to extort concessions. A turning back could come with Democrats winning majorities in both houses of Congress in the midterm elections or with a Democrat victory in the general election in 2028. 

Given the variables, it might have been prudent for Mr. Carney, with trade negotiations around the corner, to hold his fire.

Canadians are giving him high personal approval ratings for the way he is facing up to the challenges. The diversification of trade markets, the better military preparedness and other moves he has taken in response to the American convulsions are seen as necessary regardless of how things play out south of the border. They will make Canada better prepared to face any eventuality.

Only a year ago Mark Carney was without a seat in parliament, and the Liberals looked down and out. He became Leader of the party, then Prime Minister, and now, he has become a global leader. It's an amazing ascendancy, unmatched in the nation's political history. But there's no telling what happens next.

If he makes progress with allies in warding off subjugation by the authoritarian President and his MAGA sycophants, it is he who should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. What a comeuppance that would be for the narcissistic thug who so desperately craves that award.

After being closed since May 2024, the Rafah crossing will likely soon reopen, allowing people to move between Gaza and Egypt again. The prospect gives Palestinians hope, but Israel will continue to impose restrictions.

Many Palestinians in the devastated Gaza Strip have been waiting for the opening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt at Gaza's southern end. In the past, the crossing was Gaza's lifeline to the outside world, an access point that wasn't entirely controlled by Israel.

In May 2024, the Israeli military seized control of the crossing and closed the Gaza side of it, except for rare medical evacuations.

It is expected to reopen after Israel announced on Monday that the remains of the final deceased hostage in Gaza, Ran Gvili, had been recovered. This news is important to show people in Gaza that some progress is being made, Mustafa Ibrahim, a political analyst in Gaza City, told DW.

""The crossing needs to be opened so people feel change and transition,"" Ibrahim said. ""Israel still allows only limited aid trucks. People stranded outside Gaza want to return; thousands of wounded and sick desperately need to travel abroad for treatment.""

The reopening of the crossing is part of the next steps in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, the militant Islamist group that used to govern Gaza.

Although the opening of the crossing had been announced several times before (without coming to fruition), the news traveled quickly in Gaza. After more than two years of devastating war that, according to Hamas health authorities, killed more than 70,000 people in the Palestinian territory, it's a welcome sign that there is some change. The small territory has been under a strict closure and people can't freely decide when they want to leave or come back.

Israel launched large-scale attacks on Gaza after Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by the EU, the US and others, had crossed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages.

Now the planned opening of the Rafah crossing is giving people some hope.

""We want freedom of movement, both in and out [of the territory]. We want Palestinians who wish to return to be able to do so,"" said Shaiman Rashwan, who was displaced during the war, in a phone interview with DW from Gaza City. ""We want a normal life. These are the most basic rights of any people and any nation.""

Hamed Hamdi, a civil engineer who lost his home and now lives in a tent in Gaza City, said that the news had created a dilemma for him.

""Should I leave Gaza and go somewhere else just to save my children from living in tents, receiving an intermittent education and accessing healthcare that doesn't even meet the most basic needs?"" the 41-year-old Palestinian father asked in a phone call with DW. ""Or should I stay here in my country to help rebuild it alongside other specialists and try to create hope from the rubble?""

Traveling through Rafah is no small feat. It hasn't been easy in the past, and it appears to be complicated now, too.

It is unclear when the crossing will open or what the exact procedures will be. On Sunday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office merely announced that Israel had agreed to reopen the crossing ""for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism.""

Hamas said in a statement on Monday that Israel must open the Rafah crossing in both directions ""without restrictions.""

The head of the new Palestinian committee administering Gaza's daily affairs, Ali Shaath, who is part of the new technocrat administration put in place by the US, said last week the crossing would be opened this week to facilitate movement to and from the enclave.

The committee members, who are currently in Egypt, are waiting to enter the territory, which they are expected to do on Thursday.

While details are still unclear, some sources in Gaza suggest that, initially, the reopening of the Rafah crossing could enable patients to leave for urgent medical treatment and allow students or individuals with dual citizenship to leave Gaza.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled the war before the Israeli military took control of the crossing in May 2024 have made Egypt their temporary home. However, Egypt has opposed the permanent resettlement of Palestinian refugees in the country.

Opening the Rafah crossing won't be easy. First, it needs to be rebuilt. Then comes the question of who will be in charge of it.

According to diplomatic sources, the crossing will operate under a temporary mechanism involving the Egyptian and Israeli authorities. The EU observer mission EUBAM Rafah, which was established in 2005, is also expected to be present. The role of Hamas, which still controls parts of Gaza, is unclear.

Travelers will reportedly need to submit their details to be included on a list coordinated by the Palestinian-Israeli Civil Liaison Committee, and they will require the approval of both Egypt and Israel to cross. Those returning to Gaza will reportedly have to submit to strict Israeli screening procedures and need an Israeli permit to return.

According to diplomatic sources, the opening would also facilitate the entry of more humanitarian aid and commercial goods through the crossing, which are currently transferred mainly through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing.

On Monday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said that they were still ""trying to get clarity on what exactly the Rafah opening means, how it will be implemented.

""What we want to see is humanitarian goods going in, cargo going in, both from the humanitarian community and private cargo,"" Dujarric added.

Even before the war, the Rafah crossing was unlike any other international border crossing.

In 2007, Israel largely closed Gaza's borders and imposed restrictions on access by air, land and sea after Hamas seized power from the Palestinian Authority in Gaza by force.

As travel through the now closed Erez crossing in northern Gaza was severely restricted by Israel, most Palestinians attempted to leave Gaza via the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. This, however, was a complicated process that required prior coordination with the Egyptian and Hamas authorities and could take hours.

In the past, Egypt often closed the crossing entirely depending on political developments.

During the first months of the most recent war, some Palestinians, mostly dual nationals, were able to leave via so-called diplomatic lists. Others had to pay up to $5,000 (€4,172) per person to leave and cross into Egypt. Many turned to crowdfunding to cover the costs. This practice ceased when Israel closed the Gaza side of the crossing in May 2024.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Senegal and Morocco fined and banned after AFCON final chaos","https://www.dw.com/en/senegal-and-morocco-fined-and-banned-after-afcon-final-chaos/a-75708036","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 10:14:34 GMT","

Africa's governing football body has issued more than $1 million in fines after the chaotic scenes at the end of the AFCON final. In addition, a number of players and Senegal's coach face bans. 

Just over 10 days after one of the most chaotic Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals in history, the continent's football governing body (CAF) has issued fines worth more than $1m (€835,000) and banned players from both finalists.

A CAF statement released on Wednesday outlined that the Senegal Football Federation had been fined a total of $615,000 for the ""unsporting conduct of their players and technical staff in violation of the CAF disciplinary code principles of fair play, loyalty and integrity"".

Senegal coach Pape Thiaw has been banned for five of the six 2027 AFCON qualifying matches and handed an individual fine of $100,000 for ""bringing the game into disrepute."" Senegal players Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr will miss the first two qualifiers for the next AFCON later this year for ""unsporting behavior towards the referee"".

The final saw Senegal walk off in protest at Morocco being given a late penalty after a VAR (video assistant referee) review moments after Senegal had a goal disallowed. Fans tried to storm the field, journalists fought among each other and after a 15-minute delay, Morocco missed the penalty. Senegal went on to win the game in extra time. Afterwards, Morocco head coach Walid Regragui said the game had given African football a shameful image.

Morocco's federation were fined a total of $315,000 for unsporting and improper conduct by their players, coaches and supporters. A whopping $200,000 of that total was for the behavior of the stadium ball boys, who attempted to seize a towel being used by Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy on a wet night in Rabat — in an apparent bid to distract him.

An additional fine of $100,000 was imposed for the ""improper conduct"" of players and technical staff who invaded the VAR review area and obstructed the work of the DR Congo referee Jean-Jacques Ndala. There was also a $15,000 fine after Moroccan supporters used lasers to try and distract Senegalese players during the game. Captain Achraf Hakimi was also banned for two games, with one suspended, and Morocco's Ismael Saibari was banned for three games, both for ""unsporting behavior"".

Morocco's appeal to have the result canceled and the hosts declared the winner because of Senegal's walk-off was dismissed by CAF.

Morocco will be co-hosting the 2030 World Cup, and are hosting the Women's U17 World Cup annually for five straight years.

Before then, both teams will play at the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Mexico and Canada.

Senegal are in Group I with France, Norway and the winners of the intercontinental play-offs (Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq), but may have to manage without their fans. Morocco, who four years ago in Qatar became the first African country to reach the semifinals of a World Cup, will face Brazil, Scotland and Haiti in Group C.

On the same day Donald Trump was climbing down on his attempt to annex Greenland, a thousand miles away, Ivanka Trump was showing her father how it's done: by acquiring an island of her own.

Ms Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, an unofficial adviser to the president, have secured a deal to turn Sazan, one of the last uninhabited islands in the Mediterranean, into an upmarket tourist resort.

While the president is estimated to have made at least $1.4bn (£1bn) in the last year, according to a New York Times analysis, his daughter and son-in-law are doing pretty well, too. The Albanian deal, set up during Mr Trump's time out of office, is yet another example of the family enriching itself.

Ms Trump, 44, was in high spirits last Wednesday as her convoy rolled into the Albanian resort town of Orikum, accompanied by Edi Rama, the country's long-serving prime minister.

Ms Trump was seen with a big grin on her face and stylish as ever in a long camel overcoat, high heels and clutching a designer handbag.

It's no wonder Ms Trump was smiling. Indeed, she may be laughing all the way to the bank, having taken a leaf out of her father's 1987 book Art of the Deal.

The deal struck, through Mr Kushner's investment vehicle Atlantic Incubation Partners LLC, is worth about £1bn ($1.4bn). That investment vehicle is, in turn, linked to Affinity Partners, a private equity fund set up by Mr Kushner in the months after his father-in-law was voted out of office in 2020. The fund attracted billions of dollars, much of it from a Saudi wealth fund.

Mr Kushner's dealings have raised eyebrows, as have those of the president's sons. Eric and Donald Junior, who run The Trump Organisation (both of them are executive vice-presidents), oversee their father's vast portfolio of property, hotel and golf interests, and have launched lucrative cryptocurrency ventures that have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in the first year of their father's second term.

But little has been written about Ms Trump's eye for a deal. Her trip to Albania last week sheds just a little bit more light on her money-making activities.

Her and her husband's ambitions don't end with just the one Albanian island. Ms Trump also has eyes for Zvërnec, connected to the mainland by a quarter-mile-long wooden footbridge, that contains a monastery and the quaintest of villages.

Other nearby parts of the coast, one of the last unspoilt stretches on the Mediterranean, are also said to be appealing to the couple.

Ms Trump, a mother of three, spent three days in Albania last week. Once Europe's most hardline communist state, it has been transformed under the 13-year stewardship of Mr Rama. A socialist on paper, he understands the wisdom of getting close to the daughter and son-in-law of the US president.

The deal she and her husband have put together has been quite the coup for Mr Rama. “We need super luxury like a desert needs water,” he has declared in embracing the Kushner/Trump vision.

Albania's strategic investment committee, which Mr Rama heads as prime minister, gave the Sazan island development the green light on December 30, 2024, a couple of weeks after Mr Trump won the White House for a second time and three weeks before he took office.

The Albanian committee accepted the proposal to build a luxury resort with a hotel and private villas on the former military outpost, which, until the end of the Cold War, had been a secret military base for submarines.

The dealis set to create in the region of 1,000 jobs and transform the island, which has no fresh water, into an upmarket tourist paradise.

Atlantic Incubation Partners registered Sazan as a trademark in October 2024 for all manner of goods and services, including fragrances, towels, beachwear and nightclubs.

The committee's written decision said that Albania's state-run investment corporation would set up a “joint legal entity” with the Kushner/Trump vehicle to carry out the huge construction work needed.

Opposition MPs have questioned the deal and raised concerns about its transparency. It's unclear if other businesses were able to tender.

Redi Muci, an Albanian MP from the Levizja Bashke (The Together Movement) – a Left-wing opposition party – said: “The process of turning the island of Sazan into an area where a luxury resort will be built has been the same as in many similar cases in which so-called ‘strategic investors' have been selected personally by prime minister Edi Rama: [in] closed-door deals made at private settings, reached entirely away from public scrutiny.”

Environmental campaigners are also aghast. Last week, 41 groups sent a letter of protest to Mr Rama demanding that the Sazan deal be suspended.

Olsi Nika, the executive director of EcoAlbania, said the plan was “completely unacceptable” because both the Sazan and Zvërnec developments were in “areas [that] are part of the country's natural heritage and have legal protected status precisely because of their unique ecological value”.

The deals in Albania have already raised eyebrows in Washington, as has another lined up in Serbia. Again, through Atlantic Incubation Partners, the Serbian government agreed on a joint venture to redevelop the site of the Serbian armed forces headquarters in Belgrade, which was bombed by Nato in 1999.

The deal, signed in February 2024, was only made public by an independent news magazine in Serbia in November last year. Mr Kushner plans to turn the site into a hotel complex with a museum dedicated to “victims of Nato aggression”.

Mr Kushner is on a roll. According to Forbes, he and his wife are now worth about $1.1bn (£797bn), making the couple the second-wealthiest members of the Trump family after the president.

Mr Kushner has fingers in a number of pies, working for his father-in-law in an unofficial advisory role – Mr Trump's go-to man to sort out world peace. If Mr Kushner gets anywhere with his plans for Gaza and his discussions with Vladimir Putin, then he will hope to deliver to Mr Trump the one thing the president now seemingly craves more than anything else: the Nobel Peace Prize.

At Davos, while his wife was enjoying the delights of Albania, Mr Kushner, 45, was unveiling his own “masterplan” to turn Gaza into a tourist resort with 180 seafront skyscrapers.

He followed that with a face-to-face meeting with Putin at the Kremlin to press home a peace deal in Ukraine, accompanied by Steve Witkoff, another real estate developer and Mr Trump's special envoy to the Middle East.

There have been concerns about a possible conflict of interest, largely voiced by Democrats, although there is some disquiet among supporters inside the Trump administration. One well-placed source said: “It has lent itself to some level of unease. But Jared has his own business world to build and he is entitled to do so.”

Mr Kushner was an official and senior adviser in the first Trump presidency, working on a range of subjects, from Covid-19 vaccine development to criminal justice reform, as well as being the chief negotiator and architect of the Abraham Accords that normalised diplomatic relations between Israel and a number of Arab countries, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.

Shortly after Mr Trump's defeat in 2020, Mr Kushner set up Affinity Partners, a private equity firm based on the edge of Miami (where Mr Kushner and Ms Trump live), managing $3bn ($2.1bn) in funds, including $2bn ($1.7) from the Saudi government's public investment fund. By 2024, Affinity had been paid $157m ($131m) in management fees. Atlantic Incubation Partners is listed at the same Florida address.

Friends of Mr Kushner see no problem with the potential conflicts. They believe he is a man who can get jobs done – whether that be rebuilding Gaza in his and his father-in-law's vision, or building resorts in Albania.

“Jared is a fabulous negotiator,” said a friend. “He knows what he wants and he goes for it. He doesn't talk nonsense; he's very calm and never gets flustered.”

Back in Albania last Wednesday, Ms Trump and Mr Rama discussed plans to redevelop the country's increasingly fashionable coast over a meal at the upmarket Bojo Resort.

Mr Rama could have been in Davos. He was due to be unveiled as a member of Mr Trump's newfangled Board of Peace (of which Mr Kushner sits on the executive board) but preferred to remain in Albania.

“I had to make a choice: to answer the father or to welcome the daughter here in Albania, and I chose the daughter,” Mr Rama told Albanian MPs, adding: “And of course I chose the daughter with the father's permission.”

Ms Trump, who converted to Judaism in 2009 before marrying Mr Kushner, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, had requested a kosher meal, said chef Henri Fejzulla, who was only given a few hours' warning that the entourage was heading his way.

“The selected menu was prepared using a special procedure, we followed the kosher method,” he said, adding: “We were notified around midday. Earlier, someone from Ivanka Trump's staff came and told us that meat was forbidden, frying was forbidden, and the dishes had to be very clean. They made us be at the highest level of discipline.

“They wanted a green salad with local vegetables, paccheri pasta boiled and marinated with basil and olive oil. They were simple recipes, because frying was forbidden, as well as fish fillets with vegetables. It was difficult in terms of the cooking method, but with simple, natural products.”

“I got the impression from the dining room, they told me it was very good. Ivanka was simple, very modest,” said the chef afterwards.

Ms Trump had clearly enjoyed herself. “Albania is magical!” she posted on Instagram with an accompanying photo of footprints in the sand leading into the warmish waters of the Mediterranean in winter.

With Mr Trump in the White House, there may be no stopping Mr Kushner and Ms Trump over the next three years and beyond. With his business nous and her charm, the couple may well conquer the world.

			The country is teetering on the edge of ‘mobocracy', where ignorance and harassment trumps reasoned debate and freedom

The Founding Fathers lived in a world of kings and emperors. There was no democracy in their time, and nothing even close since ancient Greece. Men like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, well aware of the poor track record of past democracies, feared the power of the uneducated, propertyless masses, whose sheer numbers could overwhelm wiser heads in government.

So the Founders designed the US Constitution to prevent “mobocracy”. Yet despite their best efforts, they might not have succeeded.

Occasional outbreaks of violent urban protest are a feature of American history going back to revolutionary times, from the Boston Tea Party to the New York draft riots in the Civil War, to the Days of Rage in Chicago. These tended to burn out in a few days.

Since 2020, however, mob behaviour has become more persistent, spilling into assault, vandalism, looting, and arson to protest everything from Israel, US government policy, law enforcement, or sometimes all three. Some of these lasted for weeks or longer, as in the case of the Black Lives Matter riots that started in May 2020, the Portland autonomous zone, and the campuses from Columbia to Princeton that were occupied by student tent camps. Now in blue cities in Minnesota and other states, a new example is emerging: the anti-ICE demonstrators.

The mob that burst, uninvited, into a church in Minneapolis earlier this month during a service broke new and dangerous ground in protesting. They physically entered a space uninvited and stayed when they were asked to leave, harassed worshipers, and shouted slogans inside and outside the church. They were not there to listen, or to pray, or talk – they were there to bully.

I lived for eight years in Africa, where fences, alarms, and guards were normal in cities. But in many US cities, houses have lawns that end at the pavement with no fence at all. In smaller towns, some still leave doors unlocked. Our churches have always been open to strangers, as part of the Christian tradition of welcome.

Sadly, though, terrorist attacks on Jewish schools and synagogues have forced them to add security. And it seems Christians may not be far behind.

In the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, most of the leadership came from the church. Though fighting against great injustice, they took the higher ground. The nation saw on television well-dressed, dignified protesters subjected to shouting, police dogs, firehoses, and truncheons, and it changed American history.

In reading and teaching about the era, I do not recall protesters going into churches and disrupting worship. In the South, there were many churches whose members opposed integration and civil rights. But activist leaders like Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy chose to confront them elsewhere, in public segregated places like lunch counters, buses, and stores.

For the civil rights giants, some places were sacred. They did not pursue their ideological opponents into their private lives at all times and places. And remember – the civil rights movement was trying to overturn the evils of segregation and legal racism. Today's anti-ICE protesters are trying to end enforcement of valid federal immigration laws, which is hardly the same.

In Washington, DC unhinged activists have demonstrated outside federal offices and private institutions, and harassed people on their way to Sunday worship. On numerous occasions last year, mobs of “protesters” chanted slogans, blared fake sirens, and harassed both occupants and pedestrians outside the DC offices of the Heritage Foundation, where I am a fellow. They screamed insults (laced with profanity, naturally) at people entering and leaving the building.

One unhinged man with a megaphone called staff at this 50-year-old conservative Washington think tank pedophiles, Nazis, white supremacists, and other epithets, and suggested that employees perform sex acts on a long-dead German dictator with whom he seemed strangely obsessed. His amplified vitriol was audible throughout the building, though he has somehow avoided triggering DC noise ordinances.

One of the three people arrested in the Minneapolis church invasion is also reported to have been present at protests around Heritage. If he was, his presence in Washington would appear to show the highly organised and well-funded nature of some supposedly organic and local protests against federal law enforcement.

The worst of the Minneapolis and DC protesters got within inches of police officers, seemingly attempting to incite them to violence, a temptation officers most often resist with a professionalism that belies idiotic comparisons by DNC chairman Ken Martin between the US and Iran. In Iran, they have arrested, tortured, and shot protesters for far less. In America, so far, two people have lost their lives during confrontations with federal immigration agents. Their deaths were regrettable and could have been prevented, but comparing Iran's regime to the US is wilful idiocy.

Today's tenor of political debate is a sad echo of the era when Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton would eloquently dispute how best to govern our new nation, or when Abraham Lincoln and Steven A Douglas debated for hours over an Illinois Senate seat.

Conservative campus groups that want to present their message to other students have had their tables overturned, their materials vandalised, and their members assaulted. Instead of being schooled in better manners by their elders, sometimes they are encouraged.

Graham Platner, who is running for the US Senate in Maine, wants “Medicare for all” so badly that he has suggested people follow and harass any members of Congress from Maine who oppose it. The goal is not to convince but to intimidate and coerce.

The no-discussion culture starts early on in life. As James Papola shows in a documentary, high school debate has been captured by Left-leaning dogma.

How we got here comes down to three main reasons: ideology, ignorance, and insanity.

Ideology drives violence. Tyler Robinson, the suspected killer of Charlie Kirk, Thomas Crook, the gunman who tried to assassinate our president, and Robin Westman, who opened fire on children at a Minneapolis church, all seemed to have been mired in gender ideology and other fringe ideas aligned more with Left-wing beliefs than Right-wing.

Insanity should not be underestimated either. All three of the above appeared to have a screw loose, as did Luigi Mangione, the man accused of assassinating health care executive Brian Thompson.

But the greatest of the three is ignorance. Social media posters can have thousands of followers though they appear never to have unfolded a newspaper or cracked a book. One account with 25,000 followers tried to compare America's belated enforcement of immigration law to the Holocaust, Rwandan genocide, and persecution of the Rohingya in Burma. Where does one even start with that incoherence?

The Founding Fathers created three, balanced branches of government to tame the mob. But the ancient force was always there, waiting for a breakdown in public morals and decency to emerge.

Unfortunately, their moment seems to have come.

“Anyone who supports funding DHS and ICE is supporting the murder of Americans,” said Sen. Ed Markey.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) has come out swinging in favor of abolishing ICE and blocking funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), demanding that Democrats use their leverage to do so after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) released a tepid set of demands for a funding vote in the coming days.

In a short video posted to social media on Wednesday evening, Markey said that Democrats “have the power” to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and must use it.

“We cannot and we must not vote to send a single nickel to this lawless organization,” he said, labelling federal agents as “Trump's secret police.” 

“Right now, Democrats have the power to defund and abolish ICE. We should do it,” Markey went on. “Anyone who supports funding DHS and ICE is supporting the murder of Americans. We can stop this. Not one penny more for the Department of Homeland Security.”

Markey appears to be the first senator to speak out in favor of abolishing ICE amid President Donald Trump's current immigration raids.

Markey's remarks came shortly after Schumer released the Senate Democratic caucus's demands for DHS funding. As it is, the funding effectively helps to triple ICE's funding with no guardrails to prevent the agency from continuing to carry out Trump's unconstitutional orders. Despite this, seven House Democrats helped Republicans to pass the bill last week anyway.

On Wednesday afternoon, Schumer said that the Democrats are calling for an end to ICE's patrols and to obtain warrants for arrests. They are also asking for an establishment of a code of conduct regarding use of force, something the agency already has, and a prohibition on agents wearing masks as well as a mandate for body cameras.

These proposals have been condemned as ineffective. Critics point out that they don't even include a demand for Trump to remove his agents from Minneapolis, in spite of their recent killings and abductions of children, and don't try to claw back any of the proposed funding. 

The demands are incredibly weak considering the leverage that Democrats have; the administration started maneuvering to “de-escalate” in Minneapolis as a show for Democrats after they said they'd oppose DHS funding earlier this week, one official admitted to Punchbowl this week.

“Chuck Schumer's legislative demands for DHS funding are so narrow they almost mirror what ICE/CBP have just announced in Minneapolis. Just as Republicans were conceding the need to negotiate, Democrats pre-negotiated themselves into mush,” wrote David Dayen, executive editor of The American Prospect, on social media.

Meanwhile, positions like Markey's are becoming increasingly popular among the public, even if they are scarcely represented in Congress. Support for abolishing ICE has steadily grown this month after the DHS killings of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. YouGov found in polling after Pretti's killing this weekend that 46 percent of Americans support abolishing ICE, while 41 percent are opposed — meaning that more Americans support the idea than oppose it for the first time in recent history.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

We're concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.

We can only resist Trump's attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

Live Updates


            • Shutdown deadline: Bipartisan senators blocked a massive spending bill today, but a last-minute scramble continues for a deal to avert a costly government shutdown. Democrats are pushing for ICE policy changes in negotiations with the White House over a package to fund the government ahead of tomorrow's deadline.
    


            • Cabinet meeting: President Donald Trump met with his Cabinet today, declining to take questions from reporters after updates on issues including the economy, Venezuela and Ukraine. The meeting notably did not feature in-depth discussion of the president's immigration agenda and the tense situation in Minneapolis.
    


            • Possible Iran strikes: Meanwhile, Trump is weighing a new strike on Iran after preliminary discussions between Washington and Tehran over limiting the country's nuclear program failed to make progress, according to people familiar with the matter.
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that will launch a new initiative to combat drug addiction, a White House official said.
    


            The signing is set to take place this afternoon in the Oval Office, per press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
    


CBS News was first to report on the president's expected order.
    


            Discussions about a temporary halt in attacks on energy infrastructure took place during trilateral meetings between US, Ukrainian and Russian officials in Abu Dhabi last week, a person familiar with the discussions said.
    


            American officials raised the idea of such a halt. At the time, it wasn't clear whether Moscow would agree to the pause, which comes amid a cold snap that has sent temperatures plummeting.
    


            On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Russia had agreed to halt attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities for a week, though it wasn't clear when such a pause would begin.
    


            “I personally asked President (Vladimir) Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week. And he agreed to do that,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. “And I have to tell you, it was very nice. A lot of people said, don't waste the call, you're not going to get that. And he did it and we're very happy that they did it.”
    


            Russia has been pounding Ukraine's critical infrastructure over the past weeks and hit a civilian train on Tuesday.
    


            Some Republican lawmakers are signaling that they are open to considering reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in light of the recent killings of US citizens by federal immigration officials in Minneapolis.
    


            “Democrats are wanting some reforms that make sense to me, body cameras making ICE more like other agencies, but that's a band aid. I'm willing to entertain some reforms to make sure that we rein in ICE appropriately and make it more professional,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday.
    


            Indiana Republican Sen. Todd Young told reporters he's “perfectly happy to have a conversation about body cameras, very good idea for anyone in law enforcement.”
    


            He continued: “I hope that … the tragic incidents that have occurred in Minneapolis will help build a stronger immigration enforcement system.”
    


            GOP Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, meanwhile, told reporters, “Every federal agency can be improved but I'm not going to try to make reforms with a gun to my head.”
    


            Democrats have demanded changes to ICE as part of talks over how to fund the Department of Homeland Security and other key federal agencies as a government funding deadline looms.
    


            President Donald Trump just wrapped a meeting with his Cabinet, where he discussed a host of issues, including government shutdown negotiations, the future of Venezuela, the economy and war in Ukraine.
    


            The roughly 90 minute meeting ended without the president taking questions.
    


            Also notable: neither Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem nor Attorney General Pam Bondi spoke during the meeting — despite the tense situation on the ground in Minneapolis this week  following the deadly shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents.
    


If you're just joining us, catch up on key moments from the meeting:


Trump joked about last Cabinet meeting, where he repeatedly appeared to doze off. He called the meeting “pretty boring” and insisted he wasn't sleeping.




            President Donald Trump declined to take questions during his Cabinet meeting Thursday, a rarity for the ordinarily loquacious commander in chief.
    


            After roughly 90 minutes of talking about his administration's accomplishments, and inviting some Cabinet members to speak, Trump wrapped the meeting with a brisk “thank you very much, everybody.”
    


            As reporters shouted questions, Trump shook his head to indicate he wasn't interested in answering queries.
    


            That means he didn't touch on one of the main stories of this week: the tense situation in Minneapolis and the future of his immigration agenda.
    


            Neither Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem nor Attorney General Pam Bondi spoke during the meeting. While Trump praised Bondi in passing at one point, he didn't mention Noem at all.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson would not say today whether he would bring the House back early to Washington to pass a package of bills to fund the government.
    


            Senators and the White House are still negotiating over changes to the House-passed funding package – with talks centered on how to fund the Department of Homeland Security amid Democrats' demands to make policy changes to ICE.
    


            If the Senate passes the package with changes before Friday's federal funding deadline, the House would need to vote on the changed legislation before it goes to the president's desk. The chamber, which has been on a pre-scheduled recess – is set to return Monday.
    


            That means the funding package might not be approved until after government agencies close their doors at the end of the day on Friday.
    


                    “We'll get everybody back as soon as we can,” the speaker said. “The weather may be an issue. There are some members on codels across the world, literally, so we'll do the best we can.”
                





            House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Thursday suggested House Democrats would be open to backing a short-term funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security but warned it “cannot be long.”
    


            “Any agreement that comes together in the Senate we'll have to evaluate in its totality, including as it relates to, if there is to be a continuing resolution, it cannot be endless, and it cannot be long,” he told reporters during a press conference.
    


            CNN reported that the White House and Senate leaders are nearing a deal that would split DHS funding from a larger spending package and temporarily extend funding for the agency, giving lawmakers more time to work through reforms to ICE.
    


            Jeffries was supportive of the Senate Democrats' demands for DHS reforms and said that House Democrats' position is that “dramatic change” is needed with the federal agency “before any appropriations bill related to ICE or CBP proceeds.”
    


            “Taxpayer dollars should not be used to brutalize American citizens, to kill the American people, or to violently target law-abiding immigrant families,” he said.
    


            Jeffries also said he spoke to Speaker Mike Johnson yesterday about the spending bill and reiterated that Democrats intend to proceed with impeachment proceedings for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem if she's not fired.
    


            “Kristi Noem is a complete and total embarrassment. She's a disgrace. And on top of all that, she's presided over the cold-blooded killings of American citizens like Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. Unacceptable. She should have never been confirmed.”
    


            “She's got to go. We are dead serious. She's needs to put on ice permanently,” he added, also calling for White House aide Stephen Miller's firing.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he expects a strong bipartisan vote once a government funding deal is reached, after seven of his conservative senators voted against advancing the critical package.
    


            Some GOP senators were unhappy that Democrats walked away from the spending deal they had already negotiated, he said.
    


                    “When we have something to actually talk about, I'm hopeful that we'll have a good, strong vote on both sides,” Thune said.
                





            All Democrats and the group of conservatives voted against advancing the House-passed, six-bill funding package this afternoon.
    


            But talks are continuing with the White House to reach a deal that satisfies Democrats – who are demanding policy changes to ICE in the bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security – and funds five remaining key agencies.
    


            President Donald Trump said Thursday that he'd personally reached out to President Vladimir Putin to request the Russian leader not fire on major cities within Ukraine, including Kyiv, citing plummeting temperatures in the region.
    


            “Because of the cold, extreme cold — they have the same that we do — I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this, it's extraordinary,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday. “It's not just like cold, it's extraordinary cold, record setting cold over there too… and I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that.”
    


            The president did not specify when he spoke to his Russian counterpart during his remarks Thursday  — but his claims come after a Russian drone strike on a civilian train in the Kharkiv region killed at least five people Tuesday, with carnage in the wake of the attack making it impossible to immediately determine the full number of casualties.
    


            CNN has asked Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment.
    


            Speaking Thursday, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration was “making a lot of progress” in negotiating a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, adding that following a meeting with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi last week he believes “the people of Ukraine are now hopeful and expectant that we're going to deliver a peace deal sometime soon.”
    


            A bipartisan group of senators blocked a massive spending bill Thursday, as eleventh-hour talks continue to avoid a costly partial government shutdown that looms at the week's end.
    


            All Democrats, who are pushing to force changes to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies in the wake of Alex Pretti's fatal encounter with federal agents in Minneapolis, voted not to advance the six-bill funding package. Seven conservatives joined them in keeping the package from moving forward in a 45-55 vote. (Senate Majority Leader John Thune changed his vote to “no,” to be able to bring the package up for a later vote.)
    


            Democrats are demanding that Republicans and the White House agree to separate funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, from the rest of the package so it can be renegotiated.
    


            If the Senate cannot get all 100 senators to consent to splitting the DHS funding bill from the remainder of the package, as Democrats are demanding, then several significant agencies, including Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, will face a lapse in funding Friday at midnight.
    


            If a deal is reached, however, the bill would have to be approved by both chambers, meaning the narrowly divided House would have to return to Washington and final approval could be delayed until Monday.

            Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts and Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections Chair Sherri Allen strongly condemned the FBI search and seizure of documents containing information related the 2020 election.
    


                    “Every audit, every recount, every court ruling has confirmed what we the people of Fulton County already knew,” Pitts said. “Our elections were fair and accurate, and every legal vote was counted. These ongoing efforts are about intimidation and distraction, not facts.” 
                





            The officials did not rule out the possibility of legal action against the FBI.
    


            “No voting machines were taken but I can't tell you exactly what was taken. We do know, like I said, we have the 700 boxes, but I do know other documents were looked into to that we did not believe had anything to do with 2020,” Allen said.
    


            Pitts said that although Fulton County made a strategic decision to comply with the FBI's demands on Wednesday, they've spoken with county attorneys and outside counsel regarding next steps.
    


            “I don't want to disclose what our legal strategy is, but we will be fighting with every inch of our body, with every resource that we have,” said Pitts. “Everyone has told us that we will prevail in the final analysis.”
    


            Pitts and Allen said they don't know who the target of the investigation is, where the FBI is taking the documents or what they're planning on doing with them.
    


            An FBI spokesperson at the scene on Wednesday told CNN that the materials would be taken to the FBI Central Records Complex in Virginia.
    


            President Donald Trump said he spoke to Acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodríguez and informed her that the United States would be “opening up” the commercial airspace above Venezuela even though it is not technically considered closed.
    


                    “American citizens will be, very shortly, able to go to Venezuela, and they'll be safe there, and be safe. It's under very strong control,” Trump said at a meeting of his Cabinet. “I've instructed Sean Duffy and everybody else concerned, including the military, that if you would, by the end of today, I'd like you to have the airspace over Venezuela – planes can go to Venezuela – opened up.”
                





            Trump said last year the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed even though the local government regarded it as open. The Federal Aviation Administration also issued successive notices to airmen leading to the operation that ousted Nicolás Maduro to prohibit civilian flights in the airspace.
    


            US commercial airlines have not been allowed to travel to Venezuela since 2019 and international airlines that travel to Caracas have to comply with strict legal provisions.
    


            The US State Department has for years had a level 4 travel advisory for Venezuela. Even after Maduro was deposed, the State Department urged Americans to “not travel or remain” there.
    


            Trump also said the leadership in Venezuela is doing a “good job” even though earlier this week, Rodríguez said she had had “enough” of Washington's orders.
    


            Trump also said that major oil companies will be going to Venezuela and picking locations, without providing any details. Analysts have said it would take years for oil companies to re-enter Venezuela.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday the US would start issuing general licenses to oil companies that wished to travel to Venezuela so they wouldn't face US sanctions.
    


This post has been corrected to reflect that the State Department has had a level 4 travel advisory for years.



            In a moment of levity and self awareness, President Donald Trump said his Cabinet meeting today will be shorter than the last one, which he acknowledged “got pretty boring.”
    


            “We're not going to go through the whole table, because the last time we had a press conference, it lasted for three hours, and some people said ‘he closed his eyes,'” Trump said.
    


            Trump insisted, though, that he wasn't sleeping during the last Cabinet meeting.
    


            “There's a lot of people. It was a little bit on the boring side, but I didn't sleep,” Trump said. “I just closed them, because I wanted to get the hell out of here.”
    


            “I don't sleep much, but, you know, it's funny, some of them got me in a blink,” Trump said referring to photos of the meeting.

            President Donald Trump said Thursday he was optimistic that Congress would avert a government shutdown, saying negotiators were “working on that right now.”
    


            “Hopefully we won't have a shutdown,” he said during a Cabinet meeting. “I think we're getting close. The Democrats, I don't believe, want to see it either.”
    


            The government is at risk of a partial shutdown at the end of this week if lawmakers fail to strike a deal on a package of funding bills.
    


            Democrats have refused to pass appropriations legislation for the Department of Homeland Security as part of that package, following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. That has sparked a sprint to negotiate a new deal to carve it out and pass the remaining bills.
    


            Senators are voting on a critical, six-bill funding package as a partial government shutdown looms at the week's end.
    


            Democrats are seeking to force changes to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies, which could imperil the package's advancement.
    


            Still, talks are continuing between Capitol Hill leaders from both parties and the White House to reach a deal to address funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.
    


            Under the deal in the works, lawmakers would split off the DHS bill while providing funding for the rest of the agencies in the package — including the departments of Defense, Labor, State, Transportation and Health and Human Services.
    


            Federal funding for the key agencies is set to lapse Friday at midnight.
    


            President Donald Trump said he held a “productive” call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum this morning focused on the border, trade and ending drug trafficking. He also previewed that meetings are ultimately being set up for the two of them in Mexico and the United States.
    


                    “I had a very productive telephone conversation with President Claudia Sheinbaum, of Mexico. It went extremely well for both Countries. Much of it was focused on the Border, stopping Drug Trafficking, and Trade,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We will be speaking again, soon, and ultimately, setting up meetings in our respective Countries. Mexico has a wonderful and highly intelligent Leader — They should be very happy about that!”
                





            Sheinbaum posted her own readout of the meeting, writing that the pair “continue to make progress on trade issues and the bilateral relationship.”
    


            “We agreed that both teams will continue working together. I also had the pleasure of greeting his wife Melania, whom I met during my recent visit to Washington,” Sheinbaum said.
    


            This comes as Trump has traded barbs with Canadian President Mark Carney, threatening 100% tariffs if the country makes a deal with China.
    


            The US State Department this week informed Congress that it will continue to deploy temporary personnel to Venezuela and may need to open a temporary facility as it moves to potentially reopen the US embassy in Caracas.
    


            In a notification dated Monday – the first formal notice to Capitol Hill of the intended reopen – the department said it plans to use a “phased approach” to potentially resume services at the diplomatic facility, which has been closed since 2019.
    


            “The initial phase involves continued deployment of temporary duty personnel to Caracas. In addition, to support increased temporary duty personnel and the potential resumption of embassy operations, the Department of State may also need to open an interim or temporary facility in Caracas, Venezuela, to accommodate temporary duty personnel or operations while the existing facilities are brought to serviceable condition,” said the notification, which was sent to 10 relevant Senate and House committees.
    


            “Over a period, personnel and functions of the Venezuela Affairs Unit in Bogotá, Colombia, would be transitioned to Caracas, operating out of the embassy compound or other interim or temporary facilities,” the notice said.
    


            “These functions may include but are not limited to consular, political, economic, management, security, and public diplomacy,” the notice said. It also said personnel there would “also provide monitoring and oversight of any potential foreign assistance programs in Venezuela.”
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that there were already 70 locally employed staff that helped maintain the embassy while it was shuttered.
    


            “We have a team on the ground there assessing it, and we think very quickly we'll be able to open a US diplomatic presence on the ground,” he told lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said talks were progressing on a funding deal as Republican and Democratic leaders and the White House try to come to an agreement to avert a costly government shutdown.
    


                    “We're getting closer. Hope it lands. My hope and expectation is that if the White House and Senate Dems work this out they will able to produce the votes that are necessary to get it passed,” Thune said on his way to the Senate floor.
                





            He would not say if he would back some of the proposal offered by Democrats on ICE and said that would be subject to talks by all of the parties involved: the White House, House and Senate.
    


            He doesn't yet know, he said, a date for a continuing resolution for funding the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            As he left the floor a short time later, Thune said he and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer spoke on  Wednesday and that he has also spoken with House Speaker Mike Johnson about how to get the needed votes to pass the House, though he did not elaborate on details of the conversation.
    


            Thune said he expects the House will “do what's necessary” to pass the bill and prevent a shutdown.
    


            Asked if White House supports splitting up the bill between the DHS funding and the remaining bills to fund other key agencies, Thune said he'd leave that to the White House to answer.
    


                    “I'll let the White House speak for themselves, but there have been very constructive discussions and conversations I've been part of, so let's just say I'm hopeful. But I don't want to get the cart ahead of the horse, and I think at this point, it's still the White House and the Dem leadership are going to have to figure out the final way to land the plane. If we can,” he said.

            A government contractor pleaded not guilty today to unlawfully sharing classified information with a Washington Post reporter.
    


            Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, 61, pleaded not guilty to five counts of unlawfully transmitting the national defense information to the reporter through an encrypted messaging application and a single count of unlawfully retaining the defense information.
    


            No trial date has been set in the case, though prosecutors said they expected the eventual proceeding to last a week.
    


            The case is being closely watched by press freedom advocates who have raised alarm bells over the Trump administration's decision to seize the reporter's computers and phone days after Perez-Lugones was arrested.
    


            The reporter, Hannah Natanson, has not been charged with any crimes, nor has the Post. Her devices were seized in a pre-dawn FBI raid on January 14 pursuant to a warrant related to the investigation into Perez-Lugones. Government seizures of reporter records are exceedingly rare in the US.
    


            Perez-Lugones previously acknowledged he mishandled classified information, prosecutors said, according to a court hearing transcript obtained by CNN. Perez-Lugones told federal investigators he was angry about “recent government activity,” Assistant US Attorney Patricia McLane said during a detention hearing earlier this month.
    


            Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins told reporters that it's good the White House is engaging with Democrats on a possible government funding deal ahead of Friday's shutdown deadline.
    


                    “This needs to have a bipartisan, bicameral solution, so that's good,” the Maine Republican said, noting that the discussions are happening at the leadership level.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Justice Department has charged a man who squirted apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar at an event in Minneapolis, according to court papers made public Thursday. 

The man arrested for Tuesday's attack, Anthony Kazmierczak, faces a charge of forcibly assaulting, opposing, impeding and intimidating Omar, according to a complaint filed in federal court.

Authorities determined that the substance was water and apple cider vinegar, according to an affidavit. After Kazmierczak sprayed Omar with the liquid, he appeared to say, “She's not resigning. You're splitting Minnesotans apart,” the affidavit says. Authorities also say that Kazmierczak told a close associate several years ago that “somebody should kill” Omar, court documents say. 

It was unclear if Kazmierczak had an attorney who could comment on the allegations. A message was left with the federal defender's office in Minnesota.

The attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown. 

Kazmierczak has a criminal history and has made online posts supportive of President Donald Trump, a Republican. 

Omar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. After she was elected seven years ago, Trump said she should “go back” to her country. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa earlier this week, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.”




 Omar blamed Trump on Wednesday for threats to her safety. 

“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar told reporters. 

Trump accused Omar of staging the attack, telling ABC News, “She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Kazmierczak was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings.

In social media posts, Kazmierczak criticized former President Joe Biden and referred to Democrats as “angry and liars.” Trump “wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. “Stop other countries from stealing from us.”

In another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers' families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?”

Threats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters before dipping slightly, only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.

Officials said they investigated nearly 15,000 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against Members of Congress, their families, staff, and the Capitol Complex” in 2025.

NEW YORK (AP) — Tax filing season is underway, and the IRS expects 164 million people will file returns by April 15. 

The average refund last year was $3,167. This year, analysts have projected it could be $1,000 higher, thanks to changes in tax law. More than 165 million individual income tax returns were processed last year, with 94% submitted electronically. 

People with straightforward returns should not encounter delays, but because of an exodus of IRS workers since the start of the Trump administration, the national taxpayer advocate has cautioned that the 2026 tax filing season is likely to present challenges for those who run into problems filing.

While last year IRS employees were not permitted to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, many of those customer service workers have now left. The IRS started 2025 with about 102,000 employees and finished with roughly 74,000 after a series of firings and layoffs led by the Department of Government Efficiency. 

Here's what to know:

If you file electronically, the IRS says it should take 21 days or less to receive your refund. If you choose direct deposit, it should take even less time. If you file a paper return, the refund could take four weeks or more, and if your return requires amendments or corrections, it could take longer.

The IRS cautions that taxpayers not rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills.

Taxpayers can use the online tool Where's My Refund? to check the status of their refund within 24 hours of e-filing and generally within four weeks of filing a paper return. The “Where's My Refund?” tool will also provide projected deposit dates for most early EITC/ACTC refund filers by Feb. 21, according to the IRS.

Information related to this tool is updated once daily, overnight. To access the status of your refund, you'll need:

— Your Social Security or individual taxpayer ID number (ITIN)

Taxpayers can also consult the IRS2Go app, or their IRS Individual Online Account, to check their refund status.

If you paid more through the year than you owe in tax, due to withholding or other reasons, you should get money back. Even if you didn't pay excess tax, you may still get a refund if you qualify for a refundable credit, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or Child Tax Credit. To get your refund, you must file a return, and you have three years to claim a tax refund.

To qualify for the EITC, you must have under $11,950 in investment income and earn less than a specific income level from working. 

If you're single with no children, your income level must be $19,104 or below. And if you're married filing jointly with three or more children, you must make $68,675 or below. To determine if your household qualifies based on your marital status and your number of dependents you can use the online EITC Assistant tool.

If you have a child, you are most likely eligible for the Child Tax Credit. The credit is up to $2,200 per qualifying child. To qualify, a child must:

— Have a Social Security number

— Be under age 17 at the end of 2025

— Be your son, daughter, stepchild, eligible foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister, or a descendant of one of these (for example, a grandchild, niece or nephew)

— Not provide more than half of his or her own support for the tax year

— Have lived with you for more than half the tax year

— Be claimed as a dependent on your tax return

— Not file a joint return for the year (or filed the joint return only to claim a refund of taxes withheld or estimated taxes)

— Be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or a U.S. resident alien

You qualify for the full amount of the Child Tax Credit for each qualifying child if you meet all eligibility factors and your annual income is not more than $200,000 ($400,000 if filing a joint return). 

You qualify for the Additional Child Tax Credit if ($1,700 per qualifying child) if you meet these factors and have little or no federal income tax liability. You must have earned income of at least $2,500 to be eligible for the ACTC.

The IRS expects most refunds for the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit and the Additional Child Tax Credit to be available in bank accounts or on debit cards by March 2 for taxpayers who choose direct deposit. Some taxpayers may receive their refund earlier, depending on their financial institution.

This year, most taxpayers must provide their routing and account numbers to receive refunds directly deposited into their bank accounts. That's because the IRS began phasing out paper tax refund checks on Sept. 30 in accordance with an executive order.

Watch live as Democratic senators block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies.

Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies Thursday as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement.

Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday. But Trump said just ahead of the vote that “we don't want a shutdown” and the two sides were discussing a possible agreement to separate homeland security funding from the rest of the legislation and fund it for a short time.

As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands on Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest. If those are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown.

Other news we're following:








Trump's executive order Thursday afternoon will establish what he calls the “Great American Recovery Initiative” to address substance abuse in America, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.

The effort will seek to better align federal resources, set goals and use data to respond to the addiction crisis, the fact sheet says. That will include increasing awareness on addiction and advising agencies on how best to help Americans get treatment and celebrate recovery. It will also include consulting with states, community groups, faith organizations and businesses.

The announcement comes as the federal agency responsible for addressing substance abuse has been thrust into turmoil under the Trump's administration, including through a set of mass layoffs affecting the nation's health agencies in mid-2025.

The Trump administration also abruptly canceled some 2,000 grants administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration earlier this month, then reversed course a day later, creating chaos at the agency.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey brushed off Trump's threat that he was “playing with fire” by not enforcing federal immigration laws.

“Our police officers will do their jobs,” Frey told reporters after speaking to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington. “They're not going to do somebody else's job.”

Frey said he was “hopeful” that the number of federal agents in Minneapolis will be reduced and that he expects the conduct of any remaining federal officers will change.

“But again I'll believe it when I see it,” he said.

During his remarks to the mayors' group, Frey said leaders of cities across the U.S. are “on the front lines of a very important battle.”

“This is not a time to bend our heads in despair out of fear that we may be next,” he said. “If we do not speak up, if we do not step out, it will be your city that is next.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement says they were trying to apprehend someone earlier this week with a criminal record when the man ran into a building that turned out to be the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis.

On Tuesday, Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility accused immigration agents of trying to enter the country's consulate in the city without permission.

ICE said Thursday that their officers didn't know the building included the Ecuadorian consulate and that it wasn't “clearly marked” as such.

They said their officers did not enter the consulate and accused the staff there of protecting a “public safety threat.”

“He is still at large,” ICE said.

Foreign leaders and governments presented to former President Joe Biden, his wife, U.S. Cabinet members and other senior officials tens of thousands of dollars in gifts in 2024.

The State Department published the list Thursday. Most gifts are transferred to the National Archives or General Services Administration unless the Treasury is reimbursed or in rare cases, they're kept for official use.

Here's a snapshot:_ The most expensive gift Biden got was the acrylic painting “Marimba” by Angolan artist Guizef Guilherme, estimated to be worth $19,000._ He also got a sterling silver train set worth $7,750 from India's leader._ And a road bike and two crates of dates worth $7,089 from United Arab Emirates' president._ Jill Biden got a bottle of Ormonde Jayne perfume and an 18-carat gold necklace with diamonds from the emir of Qatar and his spouse, worth a combined $11,165.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed the order in a post on X, along with sharing a link to a CBS News story about the executive order that Trump plans to sign at 4:30 p.m. 

The order Trump intends to sign will create a new initiative that will be chaired by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Kathryn Burgum, the wife of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, according to CBS.

In addition to Noem and Bondi, there were other Cabinet members in the room who did not get called on to speak.

That includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, though Trump praised them both during the meeting. 

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and OMB Director Russell Vought also did not speak.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the U.S. military “will be prepared to deliver whatever the president expects,” just a day after Trump warned Iran to “make a deal” on its nuclear program.

Hegseth cited this month's U.S. military raid to capture then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in his warning to Iran.

“They have all the options to make a deal,” Hegseth said at a Cabinet meeting, referring to Iran. “They should not pursue nuclear capabilities.”Hegseth said the military was ready to deliver what Trump wants “just like we did this month.”

An aircraft carrier and accompanying warships arrived in the Middle East this week.

He spoke for about a half hour and called on some of his agency heads, but Trump ended his Cabinet meeting without asking the Homeland Security or Justice Department chiefs to speak.

It seemed an opportunity to avoid commentary on the situation in Minnesota, where the recent deaths of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents has put Homeland Security Kristi Noem in the hot seat, with some members of Congress calling for her resignation.

There were also no comments from Attorney General Pam Bondi, a day after the FBI searched the election office of a Georgia county that has been central to right-wing conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss.

Both Noem and Bondi were present at Thursday's meeting.

It was an unusual sight: The president didn't entertain questions at his Cabinet meeting today.

During other appearances with Cabinet officials — and many other events with reporters present — Trump is apt to take a slew of questions on the news of the day and other topics.

Thursday was an exception. Trump, who had repeatedly implored Cabinet officials to keep the meeting short, let Vice President JD Vance have the brief final word.

Then Trump closed the meeting, prompting White House handlers to usher the press out despite reporters yelling out questions.

Trump's Cabinet meeting has been going on for an hour. Here's who has given updates on their work so far:

At Trump's cabinet meeting, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner said that home sales in December “rose sharply to their strongest pace in three years” — but that's not quite what appears to be happening in the housing market that has been a persistent source of frustration for U.S. consumers.

The National Association of Realtors did report that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of home sales in December rose to 4.35 million units, “nearly” the highest in three years as the trade association noted. But the sum was just a 1.4% year over year increase. 

More importantly, it could have been a monthly blip as the Realtors separately said that pending home sales in December had fallen 3% from a year ago.

Trump has said that he wants to keep home prices high to increase people's net worth, but doing so will likely keep construction levels low and price out possible first-time buyers.

Religious leaders in Washington called the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers “a profound moral failure” and condemned the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics.

“We affirm the sacred worth of every human life,” they said in a joint statement Thursday, adding they “stand with immigrants” and “condemn … the use of indiscriminate and lethal force against civilians.”

The administration's operations, they said, flout “our nation's deepest moral commitments” and “values of human dignity.”

The group includes Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop Robert McElroy; Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde; Rabbi Abbi Sharofsky of the Jewish Community Relations Council; and Zoroastrian Head Priest Berham Panthaki, among others.

McElroy is the latest U.S. Catholic cardinal to pan Trump's approach, and some Catholic media have specifically slammed Catholic Vice President JD Vance. Budde drew Trump's ire after she asked at his inaugural prayer service to “have mercy” on migrants and LGBTQ+ people.



The president said he'd read coverage suggesting that his health chief might outpace Trump's own impact in November.

“So, I have to be very careful that Bobby likes us,” Trump joked.

It's not the first time Trump has been sensitive to the famous Kennedy surname packing more political punch than his own name.

At the start of his administration, Trump frequently mentioned Kennedy's high profile as a member of his Cabinet. He was fond then of suggesting that Kennedy work to make sure he didn't get too politically famous.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gave an update on TrumpRx, a government website in development that's intended to help people buy drugs directly from manufacturers.

The website is part of the administration's larger push to lower drug prices and give Americans options to buy medications at lower prices by cutting out middlemen.

Trump's administration had said TrumpRx was coming in January 2026, but Kennedy didn't commit to that timeline at a meeting of cabinet officials.

“That's going to be happening sometime probably in the next 10 days,” Kennedy said.

Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies Thursday as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. 

Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday. But Trump said just ahead of the vote that “we don't want a shutdown” and the two sides were discussing a possible agreement to separate homeland security funding from the rest of the legislation and fund it for a short time.

Trump said at his cabinet meeting that “next week” he'll announce his choice to replace Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve.

The president has criticized Powell for not slashing benchmark interest rates as low as Trump would like. Powell has insisted that the Fed stay independent of politics and make its choices based on inflation and job market data. 

Even though Powell's term as chair ends in May, he could stay on the board of governors until 2028 and block Trump's ability to appoint someone new to the board as chair.

Trump said his pick will do a “good job” and that he wants the Fed to cut rates when there are signs of economic growth.

President Donald Trump said Thursday he has asked Russian President Vladimir Putin not to target the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv for one week as the region experiences frigid temperatures.

The call for a pause in attacks on Ukraine's capital comes as Russia has been pounding the country's critical infrastructure, leaving many around the country without heat in the dead of winter.

“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump added that Putin has “agreed to that.”

After a nearly half-hour recap of administration accomplishments including on drug prices and the economy, Trump turned to envoy Steve Witkoff — not technically a Cabinet member — to give the meeting's first report.

Trump asked Witkoff for an update on the Middle East, where the remains of the last hostage in Gaza, Ran Gvili, were recovered and returned to his family earlier this week.

“Your policy of peace through strength that's what delivered them home,” Witkoff told Trump.

During his opener, Trump told many of the same stories he often does about policy decisions, although he did make news in noting he had he informed Venezuela's leader Delcy Rodríguez that he's going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela, to which the U.S. suspended commercial travel in 2019.

The president said of his Cabinet meeting in December, “It was a little bit on the boring side.”

Recalling being seen as struggling to keep his eyes open during that gathering, Trump insisted, “I didn't sleep. I just closed them because I wanted to get the hell out of there.”

The comment drew laugher, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has made a trademark of laughing loudest during Cabinet meetings.

Potentially less funny for those gathered during Thursday's meeting, Trump said not everyone would be allowed to speak to save time.

“We're not going to go through the whole table,” the president said, after he opened the meeting by speaking for nearly 25 minutes straight.

The participation of the director of national intelligence was unusual, given that Gabbard is not part of the FBI or federal law enforcement.

Asked to explain, a senior administration official said in a statement that “Gabbard has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, and election infrastructure.”

Trump has long insisted that the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden was stolen from him even though courts, his own former attorney general and audits have concluded that there was no widespread fraud that could have altered the outcome of the 2020 contest.

Trump said he informed Venezuela's leader Delcy Rodríguez on Thursday that he's going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela and Americans will soon be able to visit.

Trump said he instructed U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and U.S. military leaders to open up the airspace by the end of the day Thursday.

“American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela and they'll be safe there,” Trump said.

The U.S. suspended commercial travel to Venezuela in 2019.

Watch live as Democratic senators block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies.

The president, as he kicked off his Cabinet meeting, said his administration is speaking with congressional Democrats on avoiding a partial government shutdown.

“We're working on that right now,” Trump said while declining to go into specifics. He added: “We don't want a shutdown.”

Congress has to pass the remaining government funding by Jan. 31 to avoid a partial shutdown; the money for the Department of Homeland Security has been tied up in the aftermath of the shooting death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis as Democrats demand changes to federal immigration enforcement tactics.

Trump opened his Cabinet meeting by briefly highlighting improvements to the room, then moving on to his administration's successes.

He touched on his administration's efforts on crime before moving to Venezuela, where he thanked staff involved with the military operation to end the presidency of Nicolás Maduro.

They say such changes could lead to widespread problems for voters. For example, they say prior Republican efforts to require proof of citizenship have disenfranchised married women whose last names on their photo IDs don't exactly match their birth certificates or other proofs of citizenship.

The Brennan Center for Justice and other groups estimated in a 2023 report that 9% of U.S. citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, do not have proof of their citizenship readily available. Almost half of Americans do not have a U.S. passport.

The GOP election rules legislation has a long road ahead in the narrowly split Congress, where Democrats have rejected similar ideas as disenfranchising Americans' ability to vote. According to a one-page bill summary:

House Republicans are proposing sweeping changes to the nation's voting laws before Americans get their say in this fall's midterm elections.

The package to be released Thursday, a long-shot Trump priority, includes requirements for photo IDs before people can vote, proof of citizenship and prohibitions on universal vote-by-mail and ranked choice voting.

“These reforms will improve voter confidence, bolster election integrity, and make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat,” said Rep. Bryan Steil, chairman of the House Administration Committee, in a statement.

Majority Leader John Thune opened the Senate as Republicans and Democrats eye an emerging deal to consider immigration enforcement changes and prevent a federal shutdown.

“We're getting closer,” the GOP leader said.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said immigration changes must be included in any deal to fund the government.

“This is a moment of truth,” Schumer said.

Democrats want an end to roving patrols and a requirement that federal agents use body cameras and unmask themselves.

Schumer decried the “thugs roaming our streets” during immigration enforcement.

“Enough is enough,” he said.

Kevin Couch confirmed in an email to The Associated Press on Thursday that he resigned Wednesday, without providing an explanation. It's the latest sign of turmoil at the iconic performing arts venue.

The Kennedy Center's Trump-appointed president, Ric Grenell, had welcomed Couch to the role “as we expand our commonsense programming.”

Couch's exit comes as Trump and first lady Melania Trump are expected to walk the red carpet at the Kennedy Center on Thursday for the premiere of “Melania,” a documentary she produced. 

The center is navigating a wave of artist cancellations in protest of Trump‘s new leadership, which added his name to the venue. In just the past week, composer Philip Glass called off a world premiere of a symphony about Abraham Lincoln, and Grammy-winning soprano Renée Fleming withdrew from two scheduled appearances.

Homan vowed to hold ICE and CBP officers accountable for their actions but didn't go into specifics of the Saturday shooting or indicate anything he thought they'd done wrong during the course of the operation.

“For decades, ICE and CBP have carried out their duties with integrity, professionalism and compassion. That remains the expectation under President Trump. And we will, I will, hold our agents and officers to that standard,” Homan said.

Homan also blamed “hateful rhetoric” for ratcheting up attacks on his officers who he called “American patriots.”

The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee wants to know why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard joined an FBI search of a Georgia election office that was featured in bogus conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss.

Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said that if Gabbard believes a foreign intelligence service tried to swing the election she is obligated to inform his committee. Otherwise, “she is simply attempting to inject the non-partisan intelligence community into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy,” Warner said at a committee hearing Thursday.

Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to questions about Wednesday's action, which involved the FBI executing a search warrant and taking away many boxes of ballots cast by voters. Trump's claims of a stolen election have been repeatedly rejected by courts and state and federal officials, who found no evidence of fraud that would have altered the outcome.

ICE has historically relied on cooperation from local and state jails and prisons with immigrants in custody who've committed or are accused of crimes to alert ICE so that agents can pick them up before they're released. 

Many urban areas don't have such cooperation agreements, saying that keeping detainees beyond their release dates or otherwise working with ICE makes victims or witnesses to crimes more reluctant to support prosecutions. The Hennepin County Jail, which serves Minneapolis, and the Ramsey County jail, which serves St. Paul, don't honor such “detainers,” but both do hand over prisoners if there is an arrest warrant signed by a judge.

ICE argues that arresting immigrants while they're still in custody is safer and better for immigrant communities by avoiding street operations that might result in detentions of other people who are in the country illegally but haven't committed any crimes.

Homan said he appreciates that Minnesota's state prisons honor ICE detainers, “and we're going to expand upon that.”

Trump and his Cabinet have a meeting set for 11 a.m. Eastern. Anyone planning on tuning in should be prepared for a long haul.

The most recent Cabinet meeting ran past the two-hour mark — long enough that the president was caught closing his eyes. While officials defended this as a sign of the president's active listening, he recently suggested in an interview with New York Magazine that he did so because the meeting was boring. December's still fell short of an August meeting that went more than three hours and 15 minutes.

Since returning to office, Trump has used his cabinet meetings to review his administration's accomplishments and provide Cabinet members with an opportunity to shower him with superlatives. Past meetings have also included questions from reporters.

Mayor Frey's office says he'll attend the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday to advocate for an end to the immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis. He'll also meet with federal lawmakers as Senate Democrats threaten to hold up this year's Homeland Security budget unless the Trump administration agrees to limit ICE arrests to the targets of judicial warrants.

“Minneapolis may be where we've seen one of the largest ICE deployments in the country, but it will not be the last if we fail to act,” Frey said in the statement. “I'm going to Washington to make the case for ending this strategy and replacing it with approaches that build trust, improve safety, and put our residents first.”

“I'm staying until the problem's gone,” Homan said.

He said he's made some progress while meeting with elected officials and law enforcement leaders across the city and state, seeking common ground. 

More agreements are now in place between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local jails to hand over immigrants in their custody, and he said this means fewer officers will be needed in the streets, which in turn will allow the Trump administration to draw down staff.

Homan also seemed to suggest a renewed focus on what Immigration and Customs Enforcement calls “targeted operations” designed to focus their arrest efforts on apprehending immigrants who've committed crimes.

Homan said they would conduct “targeted strategic enforcement operations” where they would prioritize “public safety threats.”

He also called on local jails to alert immigration enforcement when they have someone in their custody who is an immigrant about to be released, saying that transferring people over to ICE while they're still in jail is safer for the officers and means they aren't out on the streets.

“Give us access to illegal aliens, public safety threats in the safety and security of a jail,” Homan said.

The Trump administration is looking at basing Trump's new international Board of Peace in the Washington building that formerly housed the U.S. Institute of Peace, according to four administration officials.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the subject has been a matter of serious discussion but stressed that a final decision has not yet been made about where the board's administrative staff will be located.

The building is the subject of litigation brought by former USIP employees and executives after the administration seized the facility last year and fired almost its entire staff. The building has since been renamed the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace, but its name and status remains in legal limbo.

Trump unveiled the board last week in Davos, Switzerland, and it currently has 27 “founding members,” whose first task is to oversee the Gaza peace plan.

The judge's temporary restraining order, which aims to prevent federal officers from arresting and detaining resettled refugees in Minnesota, responded to a lawsuit challenging a new Homeland Security operation to to reevaluate the refugee status of nearly 5,600 people.

The order calls for the immediate release of refugees detained in Minnesota and release within five days of those transferred to Texas.

Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller's quick social media response: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”

Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz warned the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that it had violated 96 court orders in 74 cases this month.

“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law,” he wrote. “ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

It was Schiltz who ordered ICE's acting director Todd Lyons to personally appear in his courtroom Friday after the agency failed to obey an order to release an Ecuadorian man from detention in Texas. The judge canceled the order after the agency freed the man, but warned ICE that future noncompliance may result in orders requiring the personal appearances of top government officials.

ICE didn't respond to an email seeking comment.

Trump's border czar says the administration is open to a drawdown of agents in Minneapolis but only after he sees cooperation from state officials.

Trump sent Tom Homan to Minneapolis after the shooting of two U.S. citizens by federal immigration officers.

At a Thursday news conference, Homan doubled down on the need for local jails to alert Immigration and Customs Enforcement to people in their custody who ICE can remove from the country. Homan said that means that fewer agents have to actually be out on the streets looking for people.

He acknowledged that immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota haven't been perfect but was adamant that the administration isn't surrendering.

If there's been a soundtrack to life in Minneapolis, it's the shrieking whistles and honking horns of thousands of people following immigration agents across the city. They are the ever-moving shadow of the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge.

They are teachers, scientists and stay-at-home parents. They own small businesses and wait tables. Their network is sprawling, often anonymous and with few overall objectives beyond helping immigrants, warning of approaching agents or filming videos to show the world what is happening.

And it's clear they'll continue despite the White House striking a more conciliatory tone after the killing of Alex Pretti, including the transfer of Gregory Bovino, the senior Border Patrol official who was the public face of the immigration crackdown.

“I don't think the threat that we're under will change because they change out the local puppets,” said Andrew Fahlstrom, who helps run Defend the 612, a hub for volunteer networks.

Sen. Susan Collins said Thursday that immigration officials have ceased their “enhanced operations” in the state after more than 100 arrests in an enforcement surge.

She made the announcement after saying she had several direct communications with Noem.

“There are currently no ongoing or planned large-scale ICE operations here,” Collins said in a statement. “I have been urging Secretary Noem and others in the Administration to get ICE to reconsider its approach to immigration enforcement in the state.”

Collins said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and border patrol officials “will continue their normal operations that have been ongoing here for many years.”

Jeff Landry, Trump's envoy to Greenland, says in a New York Times op-ed that the framework of an agreement on Arctic security that Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte agreed upon last week builds on existing defense agreements between the U.S. and Denmark.

“It would expand America's operational freedom, support new bases and infrastructure, facilitate deployment of advanced missile-defense systems like the Golden Dome and crowd out hostile Chinese and Russian influence,” Landry writes.

U.S., Danish and Greenland officials held their first technical talks on Wednesday aimed at securing an Arctic security deal.

The talks follow Trump's repeated calls for the U.S. to take over Greenland for security reasons.

As a continuation of Trump's pitch to Americans on affordability and the economy under his administration, the U.S. Treasury and White House are celebrating the upcoming launch of a program they view as a key milestone: Trump Accounts.

A provision of Trump's tax legislation, Trump Accounts are meant to give $1,000 to every newborn, so long as their parents open an account. That money is then invested in the stock market by private firms, and the child can access the money when they turn 18.

A U.S. Treasury event brought together an assortment of politicians and celebrities — from Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to rapper Nicki Minaj and NBC's “Shark Tank” judge Kevin O'Leary — to discuss the program and its potential impact on the economy. Backers of Trump Accounts have said they're a way to help children from low-income households build wealth.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.

The man arrested for Tuesday's attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.

“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.”

The attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown.

Omar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Thursday she is running for governor of Minnesota, promising to take on President Donald Trump while unifying a state that has endured a series of challenges even before the federal government's immigration crackdown.

Klobuchar's decision gives Democrats a high-profile candidate and proven statewide winner as their party tries to hold onto the office occupied by Gov. Tim Walz. The 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Walz abandoned his campaign for a third term earlier this month amid criticism over the mismanagement of taxpayer funding for child care programs.

Klobuchar cited Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota, federal officers killing two Minnesotans who protested, the assassination of a state legislative leader and a school shooting that killed multiple children — all within the last year. She avoided direct mention of ongoing fraud investigations into the child care programs that Trump has made a political cudgel.

A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.

The decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.

The 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.

A federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country's TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump's latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution. 

The board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president's ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.

The board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.

His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan. 

“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.

But Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.




“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”

In Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump's latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”

“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group's Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”

“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.

The four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany. 

Letters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump's vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump's demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.

Shortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security. 

Amid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump's Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK's enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement. 

Starmer emphasized the U.N.'s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.

France, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump's offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N. 

French President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”

Spain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.

America's adversaries also have shunned the board.

“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China's U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.

He called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council's status and role “are irreplaceable.”

In a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”

So far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump's signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation.

“It's hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump's wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.” 

Eight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump's global peacemaking plan.

The Crisis Group's Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump's ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.

“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.

 Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins ‘America's Newsroom' to report on Democratic leaders pushing DHS changes as the deadline to fund the government approaches.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called White House deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security advisor Stephen Miller a ""hateful bigot,"" but the White House fired back, labeling the lawmaker a ""buffoon.""

""Stephen Miller is one of the malignant architects of the violence and brutality DHS has unleashed on the American people,"" Jeffries asserted in a Wednesday post on X. 

""He slandered hero nurse Alex Pretti as a would-be assassin. Why is this hateful bigot still Donald Trump's chief immigration adviser?"" Jeffries asked.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson slammed Jeffries.

""Hakeem Jeffries is a buffoon who has repeatedly lied about and smeared federal law enforcement officers, including inciting violence against them by encouraging his supporters to ‘fight' President Trump's agenda ‘in the streets.' No one should take anything he says seriously,"" Jackson said in the statement.

A senior DHS official told Fox News Digital that Miller ""has been instrumental in delivering on the President's agenda.""

""At neck-breaking speed, President Trump has achieved the most secure border in American history — Stephen has been a lynchpin in those efforts,"" the official added.

The official went on to say that Miller's ""passion, patriotism and persistence helps fuel this administration in our efforts to carry out the largest deportation of criminal illegal aliens in the history of our republic.""

The Trump administration has been conducting a crackdown on illegal immigrants in the U.S.

Today marks the one-year anniversary of a horrific tragedy over the skies of our nation's capital — the crash of American Airlines Flight 5342. While 12 months have passed, the loss of those 67 souls and the impact it had on their loved ones, their communities, and the country remains painfully fresh.

It is often challenging to find any source of comfort in such unspeakable heartbreak. Yet somehow, through that immense pain, the families of Flight 5342 spent the last year turning their grief into a catalyst for change. Their determination, advocacy, and spirit have galvanized the entire aviation industry to elevate safety like never before — including at the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration.

DUFFY LEADS CHARGE FOR NATIONAL MALL INDY CAR RACE

As it should. National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said correctly this week — this tragedy was 100% preventable. It should have never happened.

In the years before the crash, close calls were missed, safety recommendations weren't properly elevated, and unnecessary cross traffic grew.

More broadly, our antiquated air traffic control system grew older, equipment breakdowns were band-aided over, and controller hiring slowed.

Yes — these are difficult problems to fix. But that's an unacceptable excuse. We may have inherited it, but it's on all of us as leaders to tackle these challenges head-on.

And that's why, since that frigid evening in January, the Trump administration stood firm on its promise to make our skies safer than ever. Anything less would be a disservice to the memories of the lost.

USDOT and FAA quickly took action to enhance safety, including the restriction of traffic around the airport. We made those changes permanent, aligning with the NTSB recommendations.

But we didn't stop there. Using innovative artificial intelligence tools, we combed through piles of data to reveal similar high-traffic hot spots around the country where planes and helicopters interact. Once those hot spots were identified, we adopted additional safety protocols to mitigate risk and keep people safe.

Working with FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, we also launched the largest reorganization in the agency's history. This long-overdue shift will prioritize safety, embrace innovation, increase transparency, and support much-needed cultural changes. The hardworking men and women deserve an agency structure that empowers them to focus on the mission, and I am confident this restructuring will have profoundly positive effects on reversing past challenges.

This reorganization will also help us move at lightning speed to install a brand new air traffic control system. Thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress passing the Working Families Tax Cut Act, we received a $12.5 billion down payment to overhaul our infrastructure aggressively and modernize our skies.

That money is already resulting in tangible results. In the last few months, our transition of telecoms wires from copper, which is decades old and unreliable, to modern fiber has hit the 30% mark. We also converted 168 radio sites, installed 53 new surface awareness systems, and moved 13 towers from paper strips (which are straight out of the 1960s) to electronics.

We already made immense progress under Trump's leadership. But I want to be crystal clear: The job is not done.

Our skies are the safest in the world, but there is still much more we can do. We are doubling down on modernization work, speeding up the pace of installations, and deploying brand new radar systems.

We will continue to push to reform the FAA, carefully review the NTSB's latest round of recommendations, and implement any needed changes.

GRIEVING FAMILIES SAY MORE MUST BE DONE

I recognize no action can make up for the horrific heartbreak each of the Flight 5342 families of the victims is experiencing. We can't bring them back, but we can pay it forward.

It is my sincere belief that by working together, we can create a legacy of change for the better. We have already come so far, thanks in large part to their profound strength. We won't rest until the job is done.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

TRUMP'S LATEST PUTIN CALL: President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social last night that he had an hour and 15-minute phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it a “good conversation,” but not one “that will lead to immediate peace.”

In the call, Putin apparently complained about Ukraine's latest audacious coordinated drone strike deep into Russia against five airfields that hit 15 warplanes that were parked on the ground, including bombers, fighter jets, and helicopters, according to videos posted on social media. “We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes by Ukraine,” Trump wrote. “Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond.” 

While Putin groused about Ukraine hitting legitimate military targets, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is bracing for another massive Russian drone and missile attack, which in recent days have hit civilian targets, including apartment buildings and a passenger train.

“We also know that the Russians are preparing a new strike — our intelligence indicates this,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address. “Now the United States, Europe, and all our partners have to understand how this discredits diplomatic talks. Every single Russian strike does.”

In a reply to Trump's Truth Social post, Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), a retired Air Force general, wrote, “Mr. President, Putin attacked Ukrainian cities last night. Ukraine bombs military targets, Russia kills innocent civilians. One is conducting just war, one is conducting immoral war.”

RUBIO ‘A BRIDGE WE HAVEN'T CROSSED': In his appearance before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the most stubborn obstacle to a ceasefire, and eventual peace agreement, is Russia's demand for the entirety of the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, in particular the rest of Donetsk province which his forces have been unable to wrest from Ukraine's dogged defenses.

The Institute for the Study of War has documented what it called “demonstrable lies and exaggerations about Russian battlefield gains” by Russian Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov, which it concludes is an effort to “push Ukraine and the West to concede to the demands that Russia remains unable to achieve militarily.”

Putin, Rubio said, has boxed himself in by telling the Russian people his army is having great success, when in reality it's making only slow incremental gains at the cost of horrific casualties. “In the case of Russia, they've been telling their people for two and a half years that they're winning this war overwhelmingly, so people are going to wonder, ‘Why are we giving up land if we're winning so strongly?'” 

“As you can imagine in Ukraine, the notion that you would even consider a change in land after all that's gone in the war — is difficult,” Rubio told the senators. “I know there's active work going on to try to see if both sides' views on that can't be reconciled. It's still a bridge we haven't crossed, it's still a gap, but at least we've been able to narrow down the issue set to one central one … a very difficult one, but nonetheless, it's one that work is going on.”

CONTROL OF DONETSK IS ‘ONE REMAINING ITEM' IN UKRAINE-RUSSIA PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, RUBIO SAYS

CSIS: “RUSSIA'S GRINDING WAR IN UKRAINE': An exhaustive analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies released yesterday seeks to puncture the myth that “Russia is marching to an inevitable battlefield victory in Ukraine,” calling Russia a “declining power” that's suffering “massive losses for tiny gains.”

The report titled “Russia's Grinding War in Ukraine” draws three main conclusions: 

Russian forces have suffered approximately 1.2 million casualties (killed, wounded, and missing) and as many as 325,000 killed since February 2022. No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.

Russian forces are advancing at a remarkably slow pace on the battlefield. In the Pokrovsk offensive, for example, Russian troops advanced at an average rate of just 70 meters per day. This is slower than the most brutal offensive campaigns over the last century, including the notoriously bloody Battle of the Somme during World War I. Russian forces have gained less than 1.5 percent of Ukrainian territory since the start of 2024. 

Russia is becoming a second- or third-rate economic power. Its economy is showing strains because of the war, though it has not buckled. Russian manufacturing is declining, consumer demand is weakening, inflation remains stubbornly high, and the country faces a labor crunch. Economic growth slowed to 0.6 percent in 2025, and Russia continues to fall behind in key technologies such as AI.

HAPPENING TODAY: POSSIBLE OFF RAMP COULD AVOID SHUTDOWN: Senate Democrats and Republicans are still talking past each other in public about the Democrats' threat to force a partial shutdown of the government over demands for reforms in immigration enforcement by ICE, but in private, a possible compromise is taking shape.

“The ironic thing about that obviously is that the DHS funding bill actually, if enacted, would spend less on ICE and some of the other things the Democrats are concerned about,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) told reporters yesterday. “It also has important reforms the Democrats have requested, including body cameras. About $20 million in there for that, a couple million dollars in there for de-escalation training, things the Democrats have said that they wanted.”

Thune is still pushing for the Senate to vote on a six-bill package that would fully fund the government — including the Pentagon — for this fiscal year, which began last October. “I think the best path forward, as I've said, is to keep the package intact.”

Democrats, led by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), want the DHS bill separated and the agency, which includes FEMA and the TSA, funded with a short-term continuing resolution. “So it's simple to do and I am quite confident it would pass overwhelmingly. Already I've seen six or seven Republicans say they would vote for it,” Schumer said. “And then we should sit down and come up with strong proposals to reform ICE and rein in ICE and end the violence.”

CHUCK SCHUMER LAYS OUT ICE DEMANDS TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

TRUMP: U.S. READY TO ATTACK IRAN WITH ‘SPEED AND VIOLENCE': Yesterday morning President Trump fired off another ominous threat to Iran on his Truth Social platform, hoping to intimidate Iran to make a deal on nuclear weapons, even though he has claimed for months he has claimed last summer's “Midnight Hammer” B-2 bombers strikes “obliterated” Iran's nuclear capability, and no deal was necessary.

“A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela,” Trump posted. “Like with Venezuela, it is ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary.”

“Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!” Trump said. “Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal,” he said — and if not, “The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again.”

Iran has threatened to retaliate against any U.S. strike, using its considerable arsenal of short and mid-range ballistic missiles to target U.S. bases in the region and ships in the Gulf and straits of Hormuz.

“We have 30,000 to 40,000 American troops stationed across eight or nine facilities in that region. All are within the reach theoretically —  not theoretically, in reality — all are within the reach of an array of thousands of Iranian one-way UAVs and Iranian short-range ballistic missiles that threaten our troop presence,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told senators yesterday. Rubio also said while the U.S. has “enough force and power in the region … to defend against that possibility,” the president always “reserves the preemptive defensive option.”

“So, I think it's wise and prudent to have a forced posture within the region that could respond and potentially, if necessary, preemptively prevent the attack against thousands of American servicemen and other facilities in the region and our allies.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","How Democrats' demands for judicial warrants in immigration enforcement would decimate deportation agenda","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/4438299/how-democrat-demands-judicial-warrants-decimate-deportation-agenda/","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

Democrats are pressing to require the Department of Homeland Security to use judicial warrants for immigration arrests and home entries, a change that current and former Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say would hamstring Trump administration‘s deportation agenda.

While Democratic leaders frame their proposals as a civil liberties safeguard, immigration enforcement veterans warn that it would collapse the administrative warrant system that underpins nearly all ICE arrests. The push has become the central pressure point in the looming fight over Department of Homeland Security funding, with Democrats using the threat of a partial government shutdown to force policy concessions they have been unable to pass on the merits.

At issue is a fundamental distinction in immigration law. 

Judicial warrants are tied to federal criminal offenses and require a judge's approval. Immigration enforcement, by contrast, relies on administrative warrants issued under authority granted by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Those warrants allow ICE to arrest and remove noncitizens who are unlawfully present or subject to final orders of removal, even if they have not committed a standalone federal crime. 

Democrats now want ICE to use judicial warrants for arrests instead.

Jonathan Fahey, who briefly served as Trump's acting director of ICE in his first term, told the Washington Examiner that such a requirement would make immigration enforcement functionally impossible.

“The only judicial warrant you can get is for a federal crime,” Fahey said. “There is no judicial mechanism to arrest someone solely for being here illegally. If you impose that standard, ICE simply cannot do its job.”

Fahey said the result would be de facto amnesty for most illegal immigrants, including those convicted of serious state crimes such as domestic violence, sexual assault, or repeat drunk driving.

“So if you have any legal alien, and say they commit domestic violence in wherever Minnesota, wherever they get released on bail or get released after their sentence, ICE couldn't arrest that person under a judicial warrant,” Fahey said.

Republicans argue that the outcome is not theoretical but inevitable if Democrats' demands are enacted.

“The demand for judicial warrants is a poison pill,” Bill Essayli, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, wrote on X. “It would effectively provide amnesty to illegal immigrants who have not committed a federal felony.”

Democrats' push intensified after media reports about a May 12 internal ICE memo from acting Director Todd Lyons stating that officers may rely on administrative warrants to arrest individuals subject to final orders of removal inside their residences.

The memo says DHS lawyers concluded that neither the Constitution nor immigration statutes prohibit that practice, even though ICE historically exercised caution in doing so. 

The guidance was immediately portrayed by Democrats as lawless overreach. It cut against the advice liberal activists have long given to illegal immigrants, which is to keep their doors closed and refuse to grant entry to immigration officers who don't have a warrant.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who received the memo from whistleblowers, has argued that requiring judicial warrants for immigration enforcement is a basic constitutional safeguard.

“Who would be against judicial warrants for an arrest? It's the Fourth Amendment,” Blumenthal told the Washington Examiner. “Who would be against body cameras? Police across the country, at the local level, have them all the time.”

Blumenthal said Democrats are seeking to “take back control of a rogue agency” and insisted the proposed restrictions would not prevent ICE from carrying out its mission.

“These kinds of common sense reforms ought to be supported by the House as well as the Senate,” he said. “They should be eager to adopt constraints and reforms on ICE that the American people want.”

Chad Mizelle, a former chief of staff to Attorney General Pam Bondi, said this week that the memo reflects settled law, including binding appellate precedent that Democrats are now attempting to override through appropriations.

This may be what you *want* the law to be. But it's decidedly NOT the law in Minnesota or the 8th Circuit. Read the en banc court's decision in US v Lucas. The court held, plain as day, admin warrants suffice for entering the home of a fugitive. Case closed. https://t.co/9h11z1IHmU

In United States v. Lucas, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, sitting en banc, expressly approved the use of an executive branch administrative warrant to enter a home. While Lucas did not involve immigration enforcement, the court cited approvingly the administrative warrant process used to arrest and detain illegal aliens.

The ruling is especially significant because illegal aliens are recognized to have a lesser privacy interest than U.S. citizens under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, a point immigration hawks say Democrats gloss over.

However, some constitutional law experts say the specific case, settled by an opinion weighed by the full 8th Circuit, might have been too fractured to establish any conclusive precedent. 

“Five judges joined a plurality opinion saying that the Fourth Amendment was not violated in part because of the administrative warrant … Three more judges agreed that there was no violation, but they did not reach the issue of whether the administrative warrant was valid … [but] Five judges said that the use of the administrative warrant was invalid,” Stanford Law School professor Orin Kerr wrote for Reason last week.

In Kerr's view, the administration has grounds to stand on with the precedent set in Lucas. But he warned, “There are problems, and those problems lead me to think that the plurality opinion in Lucas doesn't help the Administration as much as it would like.”

The fight over ICE authority has unfolded amid heightened political pressure following two fatal enforcement encounters with protesters in Minnesota this month, which Democrats have cited as evidence that federal immigration operations require new statutory limits.

Federal agents shot and killed Renee Good earlier this month during an enforcement operation, followed weeks later by the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti during another federal encounter on Saturday. While the circumstances of both incidents remain under investigation, Democratic lawmakers have pointed to the cases to justify new restrictions on ICE tactics and arrest authority.

Republicans argue that the backlash to those incidents is being used to justify sweeping policy changes that would undermine immigration enforcement nationwide.

Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) told the Washington Examiner that requiring judicial warrants would paralyze routine ICE operations and embolden interference with federal agents carrying out the law.

“The solution is very simple, which is to let ICE do their jobs,” Schmitt said. “These operations are happening all over the country. You just don't see these sorts of incidents.”

Schmitt warned that Democratic rhetoric surrounding the Minnesota shootings has helped create a volatile environment.

“When you have elected leaders telling people they should get in the face of ICE while they're conducting operations, that's dangerous,” he said. “Protest all you want. You don't get to interfere with ICE operations.”

Republicans argue that the judicial warrant demand is not an isolated reform but part of a coordinated effort to tie ICE's hands operationally.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday that Democrats are unified around a package of DHS restrictions, including ending roving patrols, altering warrant rules, imposing a uniform code of conduct and accountability standards, banning masks, and mandating body cameras for agents. 

All of those proposals had already been gaining traction inside the Democratic caucus earlier this week.

Supporters say the changes are needed to restore accountability. Critics say they are designed to cripple enforcement while appearing reasonable on paper.

The debate is unfolding as ICE already faces mounting resistance in the courts, particularly in Minnesota.

An analysis by MS NOW found that in 61 detention challenges last week, judges ruled against the administration in all but one case, despite a mix of Republican- and Democratic-appointed jurists.

Layering a judicial warrant requirement on top of existing legal resistance would effectively shut deportations down altogether, Fahey argued.

“You would make every jurisdiction a sanctuary jurisdiction by force of law,” Fahey said. “Even places that want to cooperate would be required to release illegal aliens because ICE would lack authority to take custody.”

Blumenthal, however, has dismissed Republican warnings as fearmongering and accused the GOP of blocking reforms for political reasons.

“They're blocking reforms because they're enthralled and in fear of Donald Trump,” Blumenthal said. “On the merits, they have to be for what we're advocating.”

Some Democrats on Wednesday signaled they are willing to decouple DHS funding from enforcement policy to buy time for more negotiations.

Sen. King says he would accept a CR on DHS funding to avert a partial shutdown and give Congress more time to put in restrictions on ICE

The Huffington Post reported Wednesday that Sens. Angus King (D-MN) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-CT) are open to passing DHS funding through a short-term continuing resolution to avert a shutdown while Congress debates restrictions on ICE.

SCHUMER LAYS OUT ICE DEMANDS TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

Overall, former administration officials like Fahey say Democrats' demands are intended to look convincing on the surface but actually serve to undermine immigration enforcement.

“This always gets sold as a reasonable middle ground,” Fahey said. “But once you understand how the system actually works, it's obvious what it does. It ends deportations without ever having to say so.”

Bringing rich and poor together has major benefits.

One popular strain of urban-policy thinking opposes gentrification—the arrival of affluent people into poor neighborhoods—and argues that poverty should be rectified by ever greater expenditure on public housing. The opposite might be true: Government spending can help, but it can also hurt, as badly designed public-housing projects have done. So long as gentrification brings rich and poor together, and offers the latter greater opportunity to take part in a healthy economy, it looks less like a villainous process and more like a heroic one.

Few places illustrate the aspirations and failures of American housing policy as well as the Techwood Homes in downtown Atlanta—one of the first federal housing projects. Its completion, in 1935, even drew the attendance of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who switched on its electricity. To make way for the development, the old slums—in which roughly a quarter of residents were Black—had been cleared away. But the 604 new units were for white tenants only until 1968, when civil-rights laws forced integration. Like the ramshackle shacks it replaced, Techwood fell into disrepair. By the 1990s, Techwood had resegregated, becoming almost exclusively Black, and turned into a byword in Atlanta for urban decline. Gates and windows lay shattered; residents complained of squalid living conditions; drug trafficking and gang violence were out of control.

Judd Kessler: The hidden cost of ‘affordable housing'

In 1993, Atlanta received one of the first grants awarded by the federal HOPE VI program—which aimed to knock down the most decrepit public-housing projects in America and replace them with better housing—to demolish and rebuild the Techwood Homes. The demolitions took place just before the city hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. If you went to Techwood's site today—sandwiched between Georgia Tech and the Coca-Cola museum—you would see a commemorative plaque but almost none of the original brick buildings that fell into dilapidation. Instead, you would find yourself in Centennial Place, a mixed-income community with subsidized apartments alongside private, market-rate housing. It was intentionally designed to reduce the isolation of the urban poor—and it's succeeding.

A new, rigorous study of 200 HOPE VI sites, including Techwood, shows that the redevelopment significantly improved the lives of children. The reasons reveal a crucial fact about economic opportunity: To have social mobility, you need social integration. “Just giving people cash, just giving people education, doesn't do as much as if you pair it with connections that then help them,” Raj Chetty, a Harvard economist and one of the study's authors, told me.

From 1993 to 2010, HOPE VI spent $17 billion to knock down and remake projects. The program was controversial from the outset. The original residents did not have a right to return to the townhomes and other smaller structures that replaced the demolished larger complexes, and ultimately only 28 percent of residents came back. There were fewer units in the lower-density replacements. An influential 2002 report by the National Housing Law Project and other groups titled “False HOPE” argued that the new mixed-income model was “a social engineering scheme built on a number of inaccurate, irrelevant, and harmful assumptions about low income families and their neighborhoods.” These critiques were made during a time of growing revulsion against slum clearance and heavy-handed urban-renewal attempts; the reentry of the creative classes to city centers was only beginning to gain notice. Activists and some academic critics derided HOPE VI as a state-sponsored gentrification program, doomed to harm the people it was intended to help.

But the new study, “Creating High-Opportunity Neighborhoods: Evidence from the HOPE VI Program,” found nothing of the sort. Chetty and six colleagues at Harvard, Cornell University, and the Census Bureau used tax-return data to track outcomes for residents decades after they lived in neighborhoods changed by the HOPE VI experiment. The benefits to children living in the new low-density housing project are considerable: Their earnings in adulthood increased by 2.8 percent for every year they lived in the new developments instead of the old ones, the researchers calculated. This holds even when the researchers compare siblings within the same family. Overall, children whose families moved into revitalized units earn 16 percent more than they otherwise would have earned, they are 17 percent more likely to attend college, and boys are 20 percent less likely to go to jail in adulthood. The future-income increases alone greatly exceed the up-front cost of rebuilding, the authors argue.

The paper contends that the HOPE VI program delivered such significant benefits to children because the demolitions and reconstructions “increased friendships between children from low- and high-income families in high schools near public housing sites.” (In this case, cross-class friendship is measured empirically through proprietary data from Facebook.) “Distressed public housing projects were essentially islands that had limited social interaction with nearby communities,” the paper argues. “The HOPE VI program built a bridge to surrounding communities, allowing public housing residents to benefit from interacting with those residents.” The exact reason is still being worked out: It could be straightforward—that high-achieving peers boost education for others—or more subtle (for example, that closer contact with surrounding areas yields more introductions to parents who can provide job referrals). But integration does seem to matter a great deal. The researchers' results show that simply living in the newly constructed projects was insufficient. Children who moved into these revitalized neighborhoods but experienced no increase in cross-class friendships saw essentially no benefit.

The study does not focus on children displaced by the demolitions. But Matthew Staiger, one of the paper's co-authors, has separate research showing that they too went on to have markedly higher earnings. For adults, however, the findings are more mixed. Although neighborhoods became considerably richer after the HOPE VI revitalizations—household incomes increased by 45 percent, and poverty rates dropped by 12 percentage points—this is due entirely to richer adults moving in. The residents of the original projects, most of whom are scattered to other neighborhoods, are no better off in terms of income even years later. One recurring finding in social-mobility research is that interventions targeted to poor children yield significant results; for adults who are already in poverty, improvement is harder to attain even with expensive interventions.

Our understanding of what kinds of Americans experience upward mobility—and which ones don't—has improved immensely over the past 10 years. Much of that progress is due to the work of Chetty, whose use of administrative data collected by government agencies has provided granular answers to questions sociologists and economists have debated for decades. These papers, often co-written with prominent economists such as Nathaniel Hendren, John Friedman, and Lawrence Katz, point toward a cohesive set of findings: Whatever their parents' circumstances, the kind of neighborhood children grow up in substantially affects their life outcome, for better or for worse. Economists are used to explaining life outcomes as a result of financial or human capital, but Chetty says the cumulative research shows that social capital is just as important.

This lesson is especially stark when applied to childhood poverty. It is unsurprising that poor material circumstances at birth predict poverty in adulthood. Less obvious is the fact that poor children living in concentrated poverty—like those in infamous superblock towers—face worse outcomes than poor children who live near wealthier peers. We know this from studies following the life trajectory of children living in poor, segregated neighborhoods after they were moved by government programs—as in the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program from the 1970s to the 1990s and the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment in the 1990s. The MTO results, written by Chetty, Hendren, and Katz and published in 2016, stunned the economics field after finding that young children whose families left high-poverty census tracts after receiving housing vouchers went on to have 31 percent higher incomes in adulthood (alongside improvements in college attendance and reduced rates of single parenthood). The HOPE VI results show the converse of the MTO experiment to be true too: Kids don't necessarily have to change locations to improve their life outcome—neighborhoods can be made to improve around them.

These results in economics ultimately vindicate foundational ideas in sociology—developed by scholars such as William Julius Wilson and Robert Sampson—that the concentration of disadvantage and social isolation worsen the effects of material disadvantage. The findings also raise an immediate question: If the primary reason that HOPE VI improved outcomes was that it boosted social capital for disadvantaged children, how can that positive intervention be replicated elsewhere? Laura Tach, a Cornell sociologist and co-author of the paper, told me that the HOPE VI program could have boosted social integration through several mechanisms: The demolition of towers (which in many cases were packed together in huge superblocks) made the outside world physically easier to access, reductions in violence and crime made outside connection psychologically easier, and complimentary community-support services for job training and after-school programs may have directly brought people of different social backgrounds together.

Jerusalem Demsas: The real villain in the gentrification story

There is another process that improves neighborhoods around poor children, both by bringing higher-income peers nearer to them and by reducing the violence they are exposed to. This process often occurs without explicit governmental intervention or cost. The problem is that it is regularly dismissed as gentrification, a phenomenon that is not usually cheered. The most common objection to gentrification is that it results in displacement of incumbent residents. The empirical evidence for this is weaker than conventionally assumed. One paper examining children who received Medicaid benefits in New York City from 2009 to 2015 found no elevated rates of moving for those in gentrifying neighborhoods. The HOPE VI study suggests that gentrification should improve outcomes for kids, so long as it actually improves social integration.

This is not guaranteed, certainly, but is perhaps more likely to happen than further governmental action. HOPE VI remade some of America's worst public-housing projects for the better. But it also cost the government $170,000 per unit (in 2022 dollars). The Trump administration has called for a 43 percent reduction in public-housing spending. It is especially hostile to the idea of using federal funds as an explicit tool to break up concentrations of poverty. The lessons of HOPE VI provide a tantalizing clue about how social mobility can be engineered in America by building bridges between rich and poor. How unfortunate it is that the current administration is unlikely to even try.

Google said its Search engine could break if the company is forced to implement strict new controls to protect and nurture web content in the AI era.

The warning came after UK antitrust regulators proposed new rules for Google Search that would give publishers more control over how their content is used in AI features such as Google's AI Overviews and AI Mode.

In response, Google said it is working on new ways to give websites more control over how AI chatbots and AI-powered answer engines access and use online content. The company faces mounting pressure to give content owners ways to opt out of having their data crawled for AI, while still allowing traditional search engines to index this valuable data.

""We're now exploring updates to our controls to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features,"" Google said on Wednesday in a blog post.

That's a major concession from Google, which has been quietly but firmly pushing back against such demands.

Yet, the tech giant also warned that strict new controls could threaten its prized Search engine, which generates most of the company's profits.

""Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,"" the company said, arguing that search and AI are now deeply intertwined.

Google says AI has been core to how Search works for more than a decade, helping rank results and surface relevant links. Creating sharp opt-outs for generative AI features, Google suggests, could undermine the basic mechanics that allow people to find information quickly and allow websites to be discovered at scale.

At stake is a deeper question about what Search should be in the AI era. Publishers increasingly argue that AI summaries substitute for their content rather than pointing users to it, undermining the grand bargain that has underpinned the web for decades. Google counters that drawing hard lines between search and AI risks unintended consequences, including degraded results and a worse user experience.

Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said the UK's proposal is ""progress,"" but didn't go far enough. His company helps run about 20% of the web and has been pushing for new standards to level the AI playing field.

""The CMA's recommendation today doesn't go far enough because it doesn't force Google to split search crawl from AI crawl,"" Prince told Business Insider, referring to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. ""Instead, it requires us all to trust that Google will not be evil when they build their unauditable black AI box.""

""If the CMA wants to encourage innovation and competition in AI, the best thing they should do is force Google to play by the same rules as everyone else and split crawl for AI from the crawl for search,"" he added. ""Every company other than Google would support that because it fosters a healthy market. It's a no-brainer, so it's disappointing the CMA didn't go far enough today.""

A CMA consultation runs until February 25. Whether regulators can tighten the rules without, as Google warns, breaking Search may help determine not just the future of Google in the UK, but the shape of the open web itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm an executive Costco member and mom of 4. Here are 9 items I always pick up during my shopping trips.","https://www.businessinsider.com/best-things-costco-for-big-family-executive-member-2026-1","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:18:00 GMT","

I started shopping at Costco about nine years ago. Back then, I had only one child, but Costco's price for bulk diapers was reason enough to sign up for an executive membership.

Now that I'm a mom of four, it only made sense to keep renewing that membership year after year. Here's what I buy at Costco to keep my family of six happy and full.

I'm typically exhausted after grocery shopping, but a delicious rotisserie chicken makes dinner easy.

We almost always have enough leftovers for chicken tostadas the next night, and I frequently use the carcass (plus some onions, celery, carrots, and herbs) to make broth in the slow cooker.

I love making the Imperial Garden frozen edamame as a side dish with dinner. An added bonus is that it's one of the few plants my kids will actually eat.

This big bag is full of smaller portions that go from frozen to ready-to-eat in just three minutes in the microwave.

It pairs well with the rotisserie chicken, and sometimes, I even eat it as a salty bedtime snack.

My kids love berries, and though I'm happy they reach for a healthy option, the price tag for these fruits can be high.

However, I've found Costco's strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries are affordable and delicious.

Everyone in our house, from my 7-month-old baby to my 34-year-old husband, loves the creamy and delicious Kirkland Signature organic Greek yogurt. It's high in protein and nonfat and pairs perfectly with the aforementioned berries.

I always snag a few bags of the Kirkland Signature dried beef steak strips.

My husband usually eats these jerky snacks with his lunch, and I often grab a handful on my way out the door for school dismissal. They're quick, easy, delicious, and gluten-free.

My husband and I rely on Kirkland Signature protein bars for a macro-friendly snack or breakfast.

They're so delicious that I almost feel like I'm eating a candy bar. Almost.

Costco's large box of Goldfish, which includes three bags of the snack, is the only size that makes sense for my family.

I fill a bin in the snack cabinet with the cheddar crackers and store the extra in our pantry. The bin sees a lot of refills, but this giant box usually lasts us about a month.

Costco has a great selection of nut butter, and I usually find myself buying more than one kind. In an opinionated household of six, everyone has a favorite spread, and they don't often overlap.

I grab almond butter for my husband, natural peanut butter for me, Nutella for my 8-year-old, creamy Jif for my 6-year-old, and crunchy Jif for my 3-year-old.

It may not come as a surprise, but babysitters aren't exactly lining up at my door to watch my four kids. Instead, my husband and I like to get creative with date nights at home using Costco's beef loin New York steaks.

I can typically find a pack of five for about $50. We usually grill or reverse sear steaks on Friday nights after the kids are in bed.

A Ukrainian soldier, until recently a drone operator, shared a video earlier this month walking viewers through the gear he carried with him into battle against the Russians.

It featured an interesting mix of stuff, from drone detectors to weaponry to what he characterized as ""tactical Crocs.""

Dimko Zhluktenko, now an analyst with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, spoke to Business Insider about the items that he considers key to staying alive, comfortable, and as effective as possible against Russia. He still carries a lot of the gear with him, even though his role has changed.

He picks his gear with great care, emphasizing that much of what he carries was his choice, not government-issued.

""The stuff that the government issues sometimes is good, but it's not the best fit."" He said the military largely trusts soldiers to choose what works best for them.

Zhluktenko, who worked in tech before the war, said his gear comes from a mix of state funding, items he bought himself, and crowdfunding. He tries to keep what he carries on his person to around 10 kilograms, calling it ""a comfortable amount of gear that is still extremely useful,"" though he can carry more when needed.

This war has seen low-tech solutions fielded against cutting-edge weapons, such as wire mesh and cages used to stop advanced drones, or wooden decoy tanks designed to fool expensive munitions.

As a drone operator, Zhluktenko carried a pair of scissors to sever the cables of fiber-optic drones that now litter the battlefield as these jamming-resistant drones become increasingly prevalent.

Cutting the cables ""became a part of our standard operating procedure"" in areas saturated with fiber-optic drones, he said. Units are sometimes instructed to cut ""each and every"" cable they see, just in case.

Zhluktenko said that they don't even worry about friend or foe concerns. Similar responses have been seen with the radio-frequency drones, with soldiers panic-jamming everything regardless of who the systems belong to.

Zhluktenko said that he bought retractors for all his team so they wouldn't lose their scissors.

He carried an issued firearm — an old Soviet-designed weapon — which is good enough for his role because he doesn't operate in areas with much direct fighting.

He said it is ""much older than I am,"" but noted that he modified it and ""it's not too bad."" He replaced some internal components and the handguard, adding one from Ukrainian manufacturer Kpyk to improve grip. He said its primary use is targeting drones that can't be stopped in other ways. Gunfights are not the norm in this war.

He also carried extra magazines and a pouch for empty ones.

To improve dexterity, he wore silicone-grip gloves from the American company Mechanix Wear, which make it easier to operate drone controllers. The grip provides ""extra sensitivity"" for precise movements and prevents slipping.

He carried a mechanical compass because Russia's electromagnetic warfare throws off the ones in his iPhone and Garmin.

And Zhluktenko also had sunglasses, since spotting his own drone in a crowded sky is critical and the ""sun is a big factor.""

Zhluktenko had a pair of shoes he brought with him that resemble the American-designed footwear Crocs, but his are made by a Ukrainian company, M-Tac. He said they are ""absolutely essential"" because it's impossible to wear combat boots all the time.

He called them ""tactical Crocs,"" explaining that he only breaks them out in moments when the threat is low.

When it was time to get to work, he would wear combat boots made by the German company Lowa. He said he had been using these boots for around four years, along with orthopedic insoles. He said that he can wear them all day without pain.

He also carried hand sanitizer — ""you probably remember those from COVID era, but I still use them at war,"" he said, — a multitool that includes a knife and spoon to eat with, and a cap to protect him ""from excessive sun"" in the field.

Zhluktenko said he carried a drone detector, an electronic system that scans radio frequencies to detect incoming drones. He said it can alert him if a drone is flying toward him and sometimes show the video feed from the enemy drone, revealing what it is seeing.

Ukraine has bigger systems in place to try to warn soldiers of incoming drones, but they can sometimes miss one. Even if they don't get a warning from command posts, ""there might be just some random FPV drone that just flew in and might damage us."" He explained that these drone detectors are ""becoming more and more essential"" and are needed ""ASAP.""

He also carried a Motorola radio, a ""basic"" one where he can talk with his brothers in arms, and night vision goggles that he uses for nighttime drone launches and landings.

He put a GoPro on his chest so he can rewatch his actions for improvements, almost like sports teams do with replays.

Zhluktenko also has a Ukrainian-made MITLA anti-drone gun, which shoots nets to stop drones flying toward him by snagging their propellers. He said he got his recently and has never had to use it. It's a single-use product that was released this year.

And he carried electrical tape ""because there is always something that you could fix"" when it comes to his technology and other gear.

Zhluktenko said that his body armor is the ""most important"" piece of gear that he carries, regardless of his role. He bought and selected it himself.

""I didn't use whatever the government gave to me,"" he said. ""It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a good fit.""

He chose a system that allows for extensive customization. He uses armor from M-Tac and added components such as a weight-distribution system from the Ukrainian company Balistyka, which attaches to the vest and gives him ""the flexibility to move around much better."" Most of the injuries in battle come from shrapnel, so he wanted to protect as much of his body as possible without limiting his ability to move quickly.

He customized his armor with additional panels to protect areas like his stomach, spine, ribs, and hips, areas where a tourniquet can't easily be applied. He shared that many soldiers use neck protection, but he found it didn't offer enough freedom of movement.

He also wears glasses with ballistic protection to shield against shrapnel.

He uses a ""very lightweight"" helmet from Team Wendy, which supports his night-vision goggles. He said weight is important to him so that it doesn't strain his neck.

He also carries tourniquets and bandages. The first, on a battlefield where medical evacuation and trauma care are likely not readily available, is crucial for staying alive. He said these tools — he carried four on his person at the time of filming — are among his ""most important stuff.""

Zhluktenko carried a ""proper knife"" that he said is old and getting ""a bit rusty"" but still works well enough, along with a multitool that includes features like a small saw. A follower on X sent it to him. He also uses a carabiner to carry extra gear.

He carried zipties and padlocks so his unit could take over and secure vacant positions. Many positions have doors, and they would lock them and write on the door which unit took it, along with their call sign and phone number.

He also carried a flashlight with red and white modes made by a friend's company, Syaivo, which gives them to Ukrainian soldiers for free. He also had two other flashlights that he could put on his helmet and armor.

My 2025 was dominated by the tough decision to leave my job with the federal government in February. After signing the paperwork and moving on, I began thinking about what was next.

I enjoyed some time off and dipped my toes back into the job market. I took occasional recruiter calls and experimented with freelance writing while spending time in Mexico City and Rio.

Suddenly, headlines about a softening job market began to stack up. A year later, many of those same concerns still dominate the conversation. As coverage of layoffs, hiring freezes, and longer job searches became more common, I put my foot on the accelerator.

I now work as a compensation analyst in the tech sector, but I had to expand my search to find this job.

Previous job searches had taught me the importance of patience and resilience. It's a numbers game. Leverage your network. The right opportunity is out there. I appreciated those general truths going in.

When I encountered the familiar dance of recruiters who seemed enthusiastic and then went silent, I was prepared for it. Even an especially eye-roll-worthy sequence with an exciting tech company didn't throw me off: an interview scheduled and canceled at the last minute, a later request to reschedule, a coding assignment completed, and then no response.

What proved far more difficult was the uncertainty behind it all. I couldn't tell which signals mattered. Was the job market softening because of tariffs? Because of AI? Were we heading toward a recession? Was white-collar work itself undergoing a more permanent shift? Was a referral the only way to get a job? I wasn't sure what information to anchor to.

Living in New York City at the time, I knew I was in a competitive job market, but I also assumed it was abundant. Even if there were millions of job seekers in New York, I thought there would be millions of jobs to match them. I began to wonder whether that assumption actually held.

The idea that I would find my next role in New York had been a fundamental part of my decision to leave the government in the first place, but over time, the signals I saw began to complicate that picture.

I read an article that said New York City hadn't added any new jobs in the first half of the year. Having just left a role analyzing job gains and losses across the country, I was aware of how uneven labor markets could be.

I also found myself thinking about my parents and how often they had moved for work. First from Nigeria, and then multiple times within the US, they had never anchored their decisions to a single city. They went where opportunity was. City preference came second.

I still had no desire to leave New York. I loved the city, but as my buyout runway shortened, I needed a new approach.

It was time to run a labor market experiment.

At first, my expansion was modest. I looked at Philadelphia, where rent was cheaper, and Chicago, which seemed like New York lite.

The responses began to pick up. What started as a regional adjustment quickly became a national search. The Sun Belt felt abundant. Interview invites began to come from companies in Phoenix, Houston, and Nashville.

Momentum was building. Geography was no longer a limiting factor. I continued applying in New York, but the priority had shifted. I wasn't optimizing for location anymore. I was optimizing for the best opportunity.

I hadn't initially included Washington, D.C., in my expanded search because I knew firsthand how many federal employees were newly seeking work.

What I didn't fully appreciate was how much the D.C. job market had evolved over the years. D.C. wasn't just a government town anymore; it was home to a rapidly growing concentration of banking and technology jobs, both within the city and in Northern Virginia.

After weighing several cities, recruiter conversations, and potential paths forward, I accepted a new role as a compensation analyst at a tech company in Northern Virginia, which was a lateral move for me.

After years of analyzing jobs and wages across industries and regions for the federal government, I would now be applying that lens inside a single organization, focused more narrowly on how compensation decisions play out in practice within a fast-moving, technology-driven business. The search was officially over.

Many of the articles I'd read about the job market focused on how difficult things had become for new college graduates. Having just gone through a challenging search myself, I could appreciate that reality.

What stood out to me was how central geographic mobility had been to my own outcome, even with several years of experience at a well-respected government agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to lean on.

Moving isn't an option for everyone, and I resisted it at first, but it struck me as a lever that younger workers could consider. Data shows people move far less frequently than they once did, even as opportunities have spread across more regional labor markets. Historically, going where opportunity is has been one of the most reliable ways to create a new path forward, and it turned out to be the key to my search.

I live in D.C. and commute to Northern Virginia. I found the cost-of-living adjustment relatively manageable compared with New York. Citywide salaries are only modestly lower, while rents are noticeably lower, and the rental market feels much more favorable to tenants. Finding an apartment was relatively easy for me.

The past year was defined by transition; the next will be about building. I plan to spend most of 2026 getting settled into my new job and life in D.C.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Senate panel passes crypto CFTC regulation bill","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/senate-ag-committee-advances-crypto-bill-to-establish-cftc-regulatory-authority.html","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:03:41 GMT","



The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to advance its version of a cryptocurrency market structure bill to create CFTC regulatory authority over digital commodities, a major development for digital asset regulation.

The Digital Commodity Intermediaries Act advanced on a party line-vote with 12 Republicans voting ""yes"" and 11 Democrats voting ""no."" The vote is notable because it marks the fist time a crypto market structure bill has advanced beyond a Senate committee. The Senate Banking Committee would also need to approve its version of a crypto market structure bill before the two measures could combine and advance to the full Senate.

Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman, R-Ark., proceeded with the bill after losing bipartisan support for an earlier version. Boozman had worked with Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on a draft bill last year, but Booker walked away from the version the committee voted on Thursday. However, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said in an interview with CNBC last week that she was ""very optimistic"" the Agriculture Committee would advance its measure.

The Senate Banking Committee's consideration of its version of the bill was postponed from Jan. 15 at the last minute after opposition from the crypto industry, including Coinbase. A new Banking date has not yet been set. Boozman said Thursday that he looks forward to working with the  Banking Committee on issues discussed in his committee. Those points include scams linked to crypto ATMs.  

Boozman in a statement Thursday called the vote ""a critical step toward creating clear rules for digital asset markets."" He said ""there's still more work ahead,"" adding that he is ""hopeful"" the development ""will build momentum in the Senate to advance this legislation."" 

He said the measure would establish a clear legal definition of digital commodities establishes a spot market digital commodity intermediary regulatory regime with the CFTC. He said the bill also would create consumer protections, including conflict of interest safeguards and customer disclosure requirements.

Boozman released the present bill version Jan. 21 to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission new authority to regulate digital assets. The legislation builds on the bipartisan CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill that the House of Representatives passed last summer, and incorporates provisions negotiated with Senate Democrats as well as input received during bipartisan meetings with stakeholders, according to Boozman.During Thursday's hearing, Booker noted that a bipartisan discussion draft was released in November and said that when he came back to Washington in January, he learned his ""Republican colleagues were walking away from the bipartisan process that produced the draft and was also walking away from a lot of the very things that I read in the policy framework that held our agreement together.""   Booker said ""the product put before us today is not the bipartisan draft that we have been working on."" ""It was negotiated with two parties at the table, but it isn't in accord with the principles we laid out in November in a bipartisan way,"" he said. ""However, despite this, I still deeply believe in the work that we've done. We've come so long.""  

Booker said Democratic concerns with the bill include the fact that President Donald Trump ""is grifting on crypto himself,"" which he called ""ridiculous.""  During Thursday's hearing, Booker noted that a bipartisan discussion draft was released in November and said that when he came back to Washington in January, he learned his ""Republican colleagues were walking away from the bipartisan process that produced the draft"" and were also ""walking away"" from a lot of the points ""that held our agreement together.""

CNBC reached out to the White House for comment related to the concerns from Democrats tied to the president's crypto ventures, but did not immediately hear back. However, in past statements, a White House spokesperson told CNBC that ""there are no conflicts of interest."" On Thursday, Democrats offered amendments that would have included banning public officials –including the president – from engaging in the crypto industry and addressing involvement in digital commodities from foreign adversaries. None were approved.

[The stream is slated to start at 11 a.m. ET. Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]

President Donald Trump held a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday.

The meeting came as Trump and other administration officials seek to de-escalate tensions over immigration enforcement activities in Minnesota, where federal agents in the past month have killed two U.S. citizens during confrontations over immigration actions.

There is a risk that there will be a partial shutdown of the U.S. government later this week over opposition by Democratic senators to passing a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement.

On Wednesday, Trump, in a social media post, said, ""A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose.""

The warning came as Trump has pressured Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program and to cease a brutal crackdown on protestors domestically.

In this article

Software stocks on Thursday slid deeper into an ongoing intense sell-off  this year as investors recoiled from the sector on growing fears that artificial intelligence could upend many firms' business models. 

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dropped about 5% in morning trading, on pace for its biggest one-day decline since last April during the tariff-triggered downturn. The fund is now down about 21% from its recent high, pushing the software industry into bear-market territory and underscoring how quickly sentiment has turned against one of Wall Street's former favorite industries.

Month to date, IGV is down almost 14%, on pace for its worst month since October 2008 when the fund fell 23%.

The concern about the AI threat outweighed solid earnings from bellwether names like ServiceNow, whose shares plunged more than 12% Thursday. The enterprise software maker topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations and issued better-than-expected guidance.

""Good, but not good enough,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note of ServiceNow's report. ""In an environment of heightened investor skepticism on incumbent application vendors, stable growth, in line with expectations, likely falls short of shifting the narrative.""

The pressure has deepened across the sector as investors question whether AI competitors and automation tools could erode demand for traditional software licenses and workflows. Valuations once justified by steady subscription growth are being recast as investors assess the possibility that AI could permanently shrink long-term revenue potential.

Megacap Microsoft  added to the pressure, sliding about 10% after reporting a slowdown in cloud growth for the fiscal second quarter, putting the stock on track for its steepest one-day drop since March 2020. The company also issued softer-than-expected guidance on operating margin for the fiscal third quarter.

Investor unease has been amplified by the rapid pace of AI development itself. Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5 late last year, its third major model launch in just two months. The company said the model excels at coding, operating computers and assisting with complex enterprise tasks, with ideal users including professional software developers and knowledge workers such as financial analysts, consultants and accountants.

""It is a little embarrassing that in 10 days, Anthropic was able to invent, co-work, put it out and everybody ... could look at it and go, 'Wow, why isn't Microsoft doing that? Why don't I know about that?' And that is a narrative they need to fix,"" Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I think patience is going to run thin on the Street.""

Also on Thursday, SAP slid as much as 14% after the German software giant reported weaker-than-expected growth in its cloud contract backlog for the fourth quarter. Current cloud backlog rose 16% to 21.1 billion euro (US$25.3 billion), falling short of expectations for about 26% growth, which UBS analysts called a ""disappointment.""

ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott sought to counter investor fears on the company's earnings call Thursday, saying concerns that AI will displace software vendors are misplaced. 

""The real payoff comes when trillions of tokens move beyond pilots to be embedded directly into the workflows where business decisions are made,"" McDermott said. ""ServiceNow is the gateway to this shift, serving as the semantic layer that makes AI ubiquitous in the enterprise.""

He added that because AI systems are probabilistic, companies still need workflow software to ensure consistent business outcomes.

First Brands Group founder Patrick James and his brother Edward have been indicted in New York for allegedly defrauding lenders out of billions of dollars before the auto parts supplier collapsed into bankruptcy.

An indictment was made public on Thursday in Manhattan federal court.

The nine-count indictment contains charges including running a continuing financial crimes enterprise, bank fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Both defendants could face decades in prison if convicted.

Lawyers for the defendants were not immediately available for comment.

Patrick James had been First Brands' chief executive, while Edward James was a senior vice president.

Prosecutors said the defendants ""perpetrated a series of fraudulent schemes"" against First Brands' lenders and financing partners.

These schemes allegedly included inflating invoices, double- and triple-pledging loan collateral, falsifying financial statements, and concealing substantial liabilities.

""These schemes yielded billions of dollars in financing to First Brands and enabled Patrick James and Edward James to reap millions of dollars in proceeds derived from their fraud,"" the indictment said.

First Brands was founded in 2013, and by last year had become one of the world's largest suppliers of auto parts such as brakes, filters and lighting systems, with about $5 billion in annual sales.

Prosecutors said First Brands financed its growth by borrowing billions of dollars that were secured by inventory and physical assets such as plants and equipment.

This, according to prosecutors, left First Brands vulnerable to cash flow disruptions and potential declines in asset values, leaving the company dependent on access to capital.

First Brands imploded quickly in September, when it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors.

On Monday, it said it had begun winding down parts of its North American operations while it seeks buyers for various assets.

Despite borrowing $1.1 billion after filing for bankruptcy, First Brands said earlier this month that cash on hand had shrunk to $190 million.

At a Thursday hearing in Houston bankruptcy court, First Brands received a judge's permission to obtain short-term financing from General Motors and Ford.

The automakers will prepay $48 million for parts deliveries over the next week, and perhaps more financing week-to-week, to allow First Brands to continue operating businesses that serve them.

Those businesses employ 17,000 people in North America. First Brands has already shut operations at its Brake Parts, Cardone and Autolite units, which employed 4,000 people.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin price plunge: Why are crypto prices dropping this time?","https://mashable.com/article/bitcoin-price-plunge-crypto-falls-jan-29","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:06:52 GMT","

Cryptocurrency is facing yet another big price plunge.

Bitcoin dropped to the $84,000 range on Thursday, the lowest price it's seen in 2026 so far. Other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Doge also experienced falling prices, with values being down as much as 6 percent.

Crypto analysts suggest that this is a crucial price point for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to maintain or its valuation may continue to drop.

As crypto outlets point out, the price drop of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies didn't happen in a vacuum. The stock market, especially tech stocks like Microsoft, took a huge dive on Thursday. Crypto-related stocks also took a big hit as well.

As investors sell off investments, crypto holdings traditionally take a big hit as one of the more riskier bets. According to Coindesk, investors have liquidated more than $650 million across all crypto assets during the Thursday selloff. 

Some analysts believe that Bitcoin could see its prices drop below $80,000 in the near future.

Why a drop below $85,000 might risk more selloff","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/bitcoin-s-major-safety-net-just-snapped-after-falling-below-usd85-000-here-s-how-low-it-can-go","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:07:14 GMT","

Bitcoin just crashed through a price milestone it's been holding on to for two months, and sellers are calling the shots now.

That trusty milestone? Bitcoin's average price over the last 100 weeks. Since November, this so-called 100-week simple moving average has consistently acted as a safety net, a level at which buyers have continued to buy every dip for nine weeks straight.

But today, prices have slipped below $85,000, convincingly moving below the 100-week average line, as seen in the chart below. The breakdown means sellers have overpowered all the buying power around the support, establishing a potential path lower.

So, where can the sell-off find the next wave of buyers?

In April last year, buyers emerged at around $75,000, stalling the selloff at the time, which makes it a key level to watch now. 

Below that, the next support is at the 200-week average, which is at $58,000. 

While chart patterns are popular, they don't always guarantee directional bets — just like any big-picture or fundamentals clue. Smart traders always watch for a key level that, if reclaimed, flips the bearish vibe on its head.

Right now, for bitcoin, that's $95,000, a level where buyers kept getting outbid by sellers early this month and in December. The bullish case comes back to the table if prices surpass that level.

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

Cosa sapere: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

The New York Stock Exchange is 234 years old and its grand stone edifice stands as one of the world's most enduring symbols of capitalism. So it came as big news last week when the NYSE announced it planned to implement a dramatic technology upgrade by putting thousands of stocks on the blockchain—a nod to the growing influence of the crypto industry, which is already selling tokenized versions of equities. One academic, however, suspects the plan is just smoke and mirrors, and shared his skepticism on the latest episode of Fortune's Crypto Playbook vodcast, which you can enjoy on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube.

According to Professor Omid Malekan, who teaches a blockchain course at Columbia Business School, NYSE's press release suggested the exchange was seeking to reap publicity, while providing little in the way of specifics.

“The announcement was very high on hype and very short on details. And I always find that telling, because there has been a tendency over the years with crypto where you have established incumbents announce something very exciting, but then years later, nothing comes of it,” said Malekan.

He pointed out that the NYSE lacked serious technical specifications and failed even to state which blockchain the exchange planned to use for its grand plans. Also worrying, said Malekan, is that the plan appeared designed to include all of its current business partners, some of which have direct financial ties to NYSE.

This plan to preserve all existing partners is problematic since the nature of blockchain is that it can eliminate a raft of financial middlemen, and let parties transact directly in an instant and transparent manner. This poses threat to a legion of auxiliary service providers on Wall Street like transfer agents and settlement houses that are essential to the current system of stock-trading.

In an op-ed for Fortune, Malekan likened NYSE's gambit to how one-time giant AT&T responded to the early days of the Internet, when it bought a content provider in order to deliver pre-selected websites to home TV sets using its cable system. That didn't work out, of course, and now Internet natives like Google have become 20 times larger.

Malekan explained that NYSE appears caught in a classic innovator's dilemma where an incumbent tries to embrace the way of the future, but is hampered by a need to preserve its existing business model. In this context, it is often new players that rise up to define the next era of an Industry—as Google and Facebook did in the world of communications and media.

And indeed, NYSE's blockchain announcement comes at a time when a number of startups and newer financial players are already making fast strides in tokenizing stock. Those include startups like Securitize and SuperState, as well as big fintech and crypto players like Robinhood and Kraken.

All of this will mean NYSE, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, will have a hard time keeping up.

This doesn't mean, of course, that NYSE faces the risk confronted by some incumbents of getting blown away altogether in the face of new technology. Malekan points out that moving stocks to the blockchain isn't going to happen overnight and that NYSE—which was created in 1792 when 24 traders signed an agreement under a buttonwood tree near Wall Street—enjoys a reputation as one of the oldest and most venerable financial institutions in the world.

You can hear more of Malekan's comments on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube, along with a conversation between hosts Jeff and Leo about other hot topics, including the fate of an important crypto bill and the failure of social media network farcaster.

Moonbirds began as an NFT project in 2021. Its direction shifted in 2025 following the acquisition by Orange Cap Games. This raises a central question: what direction does Moonbirds now aim to define?

After acquiring Moonbirds, Orange Cap Games announced plans to issue a token and expand the broader ecosystem.

To position the Moonbirds IP around fandom rather than speculation, the team is introducing multiple engagement formats, including a card game, Blind Box 2.0 initiatives, and mobile games.

While the expansion of the Moonbirds IP is promising, a clearer and more concrete utility framework for the $BIRB token is still required.

🇰🇷 한국어로 읽기 →

Moonbirds was a high-profile NFT project that traded up to 40 ETH in 2021. As the NFT market entered a downturn, attention faded. Recently, however, Moonbirds has returned to the spotlight following the announcement of a token launch plan. Still, viewing Moonbirds purely as an NFT reflects a perspective anchored in 2021.

In May 2025, Moonbirds entered a new phase after being acquired by Orange Cap Games. The acquirer's objective is not to operate Moonbirds as a standalone NFT collection, but to develop it as a broader IP-driven business. This shift requires moving beyond the valuation of a single NFT and instead assessing Moonbirds within a larger strategic framework.

The future Orange Cap Games envisions through Moonbirds is becoming the “next Pop Mart.”

CEO Spencer Gordon Sand has stated his ambition to build a multi-billion-dollar company by positioning Orange Cap Games as the Pop Mart of Web3.

This ambition is closely tied to Sand's career background. He has been an early investor in NFT projects such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, RTFKT, and Cool Cats, giving him firsthand exposure to how NFT projects evolve into IP, and how they fail.

In particular, as one of the largest holders of Pudgy Penguins, he has seen the brand extend into mainstream media, including television, where non-crypto audiences actively engage with the characters.

This experience likely shaped his conviction around building a “next Pop Mart.”

Consistent with this background, Orange Cap Games' vision for Moonbirds diverges sharply from a typical NFT sales model. Rather than focusing on NFT distribution within Web3, the company aims to use Moonbirds as a starting point to acquire and scale multiple high-potential IPs, ultimately positioning itself as a diversified, IP-centric consumer business similar in structure to Pop Mart.

A representative success case of Pop Mart is the character Labubu. Labubu was not originally created by Pop Mart. In 2019, the company signed an exclusive agreement with a Hong Kong–based artist and successfully introduced the character to a mass market.

Pop Mart is not a simple reseller of third-party IP. Its core strength lies in vertical integration.

Similar to a talent agency, the company manages the full lifecycle of IP development, from artist discovery and IP licensing to product design, manufacturing, and direct-to-consumer distribution through its own channels. This integrated structure allows Pop Mart to repeatedly scale new characters using a consistent expansion model.

Orange Cap Games appears to be pursuing a comparable approach. Rather than focusing solely on product creation, the company aims to build a distribution layer capable of delivering multiple IPs.

This system spans physical distribution, such as figurines and trading cards, cultural distribution through offline tournaments and events, and digital distribution via games and NFTs. The objective is to create a repeatable framework that can support and scale any IP introduced into the ecosystem.

For Orange Cap Games, producing physical toys inspired by Moonbirds NFTs matters. However, trading cards play a more central role in establishing a scalable ecosystem.

To differentiate its trading card game, the company avoided the industry-standard Blue Core card stock and instead developed its own Orange Core material. This proprietary stock reduces common issues such as edge wear and card bending. Orange Cap Games controls both material selection and the manufacturing process, extending product ownership down to production details.

These efforts were validated when the cards received PSA 10 grades from PSA, the highest rating available. This was followed by a direct collaboration with PSA, resulting in co-branded promotional cards.

Product quality alone is not sufficient. Distribution infrastructure determines whether physical products reach the right audience. Placement in high-traffic locations frequented by target consumers is critical.

To this end, Orange Cap Games partnered with major global distributors:

GTS Distribution, the largest collectibles distributor in North America

Star City Games, a core distributor for Magic: The Gathering

Asmodee, the world's third-largest board game and toy distributor

As a result, Moonbirds products are no longer limited to crypto-native channels such as exchanges. They are now available in local hobby shops and toy stores, meeting a baseline requirement for global expansion.

At this stage, Orange Cap Games has secured both product quality and distribution access. The next challenge is retention: whether customers who purchase these products remain engaged within the broader Moonbirds ecosystem.

Producing high-quality products and securing distribution are necessary, but not sufficient. The real challenge is persuasion. Among countless character products on retail shelves, what makes consumers choose Moonbirds?

The success of Labubu at Pop Mart was not driven by visual appeal alone. Orange Cap Games applies a similar logic, using structured strategies designed to influence consumer behavior rather than relying on design alone.

Cards function not only as collectibles but as components of a game. For cards to become meaningful collectibles, a playable game must exist first. Without active gameplay, even well-designed and well-manufactured cards remain decorative objects.

The central question is how to attract players to a new card game.

Orange Cap Games targets participants in large-scale trading card tournaments. These events often run for five days, with roughly half of participants eliminated on the first day. The company schedules its own tournaments on the second day, positioning them as an alternative for eliminated players.

From a participant's perspective, an additional competitive opportunity is compelling. Preparation leads to familiarity with the game, core players begin to cluster, and the product starts to function as a real game rather than a niche experiment.

When a Moonbirds tournament is held alongside a major established competition, players also begin to associate it with the same competitive standard. This shift in perception is critical. The strategy is less about immediate conversion and more about reframing Moonbirds TCG as a legitimate part of the broader card game ecosystem.

At its core, this approach is not only about participation, but about changing how the product is perceived.

In practice, Orange Cap Games applied this strategy in 2025 with its Vibes TCG at SCG Con, where side tournaments were run alongside major competitions. Over time, this approach has steadily expanded the scale and visibility of the Vibes TCG events.

Pop Mart's traditional blind boxes, such as those featuring Labubu, typically contain a single figurine. Once the box is opened and the item revealed, the experience ends. The model is designed around one-time consumption.

Moonbirds takes a different approach with Blind Box 2.0. Each box contains three distinct collectibles:

A plush or figurine

Trading Card

NFT

By purchasing a single box, consumers engage with three separate experiences rather than one.

Orange Cap Games refers to this model as the “Hybrid” category. This is not simply a bundle of three products. The core idea is cross-channel onboarding, where each item serves as an entry point into a different part of the ecosystem.

Toy-focused buyers discover TCG cards and are introduced to gameplay.

TCG-focused buyers receive NFTs and gain exposure to onchain assets.

NFT-focused buyers receive physical toys and are guided into offline communities

A single blind box becomes a gateway into all three of Orange Cap Games' business lines: toys, TCG, and NFTs. Consumers may engage only with their original purchase intent. However, once curiosity extends beyond that initial purpose, they are naturally guided into adjacent parts of the ecosystem.

Purchasing trading cards requires spending, and collecting figurines requires prior interest. Free-to-play mobile games, by contrast, require little more than a download. Some users may later invest time or money to improve their decks or progress, but the initial barrier to entry remains low.

Angry Birds provides a useful reference. The gameplay was simple, but the characters became globally recognizable. From there, the IP expanded into films, merchandise, and theme parks. The game served as the starting point for broad IP distribution.

Moonbirds' mobile game is designed to play a similar role. Through gameplay, users become familiar with the characters and gradually absorb the broader worldbuilding. Even users with no immediate intention to purchase cards or figurines are exposed to Moonbirds through the game.

Over time, this familiarity creates recognition. When consumers later encounter Moonbirds products in retail settings, the characters are no longer unfamiliar. The mobile game establishes the mental bridge that turns passive awareness into potential purchase intent.

Orange Cap Games has built the infrastructure and strategy to expand Moonbirds. For investors, however, the key question remains: what does the $BIRB token actually do?

The team describes $BIRB as a “coordination layer.” In this framing, the token is intended to accelerate cultural distribution and enable memes to spread more efficiently. The strategy is to anchor the business in physical consumer products while using crypto-native dynamics to amplify brand reach.

The challenge lies in specificity. It remains unclear what concrete benefits accrue to token holders. Revenue sharing from product sales, NFT-linked memberships, or other incentive mechanisms have not been clearly defined.

Orange Cap Games emphasizes long-term ecosystem growth. Rather than distributing profits to token holders, revenue is expected to be reinvested into the business. The goal is to create a positive feedback loop where attention generated in non-crypto markets feeds back into the crypto community.

A notable strength is that this is not a business assembled solely to justify a token launch. The company generated real revenue through Vibes TCG before introducing the token layer. This approach differs materially from meme coins that lack underlying operations.

However, open questions remain. Whether the token's proposed “cultural coordination” function can operate in practice, and whether that function translates into sustained token value, has yet to be demonstrated. A reinvestment-first strategy may also be less appealing to short-term investors.

It remains uncertain whether Moonbirds can achieve Pop Mart level success. Still, the project serves as a live experiment in how NFT-originated IP can be monetized in the real world. The concrete design of $BIRB and its early performance will determine the outcome of that experiment.

Early 2026 is officially the “last call” for legendary gains! Speculative capital is moving fast, ditching boring launches and piling into powerhouses that pair massive stories with bulletproof presale math. This isn't just about finding a project; it's about hunting the top crypto ICO where perfect timing and explosive pricing tiers turn small moves into life-changing wins!

From adrenaline-pumping GameFi to “unbreakable” quantum-resistant tech, the race for dominance is on. Every investor is picking their fighter based on risk and reward; some want community-led hype, others want high-tech defense, and some just want the raw power of presale physics. 

As entry doors slam shut and prices skyrocket, the clock is ticking! Here's why the market is buzzing over these legends and why BlockDAG is the ultimate ticking time bomb of opportunity.

BlockDAG is no longer just a project; it's a financial rocket ship fueled by cold, hard math! The team has just activated the last release before the official launch, a lightning-fast final few hours that unlocks the final 1.25 billion BDAG at a steal of just $0.0005. Once this countdown hits zero, the presale shuts down forever, the supply is locked tight, and BDAG blasts off into public trading at market-driven prices.

There are no resets, no delays, and no second chances! In just 48 hours, the team will reveal exactly how to claim your BDAG and prepare for the exchange madness. Having already hauled in over $450 million, BlockDAG has proven it's a heavyweight. With a listing target of $0.05, the structure points toward a staggering 10,000% ROI potential. This $0.001 (and final $0.0005) window isn't just an entry, it's a once-in-a-cycle event!

Tapzi is shaking up the Web3 world with its skill-to-earn model that actually rewards talent! Forget boring passive income; Tapzi is all about high-stakes tournaments and competitive play where your ability determines your bag. This is the top crypto ICO for gamers who want to win big while having a blast.

The presale is designed to reward the fast and the bold, with prices scaling as the community grows. By focusing on real human players instead of bots, Tapzi has built a rock-solid foundation that's keeping the hype at a fever pitch. With NFT upgrades and massive tournaments on the horizon, the upside is massive for those who get in before the gaming masses arrive!

AgoraLend is the disruptor the DeFi world has been waiting for! It's smashing the gates of traditional lending by letting you borrow and lend a huge range of tokens that other platforms ignore. It's a permissionless revolution that puts the power back in your hands with adaptive risk tools that keep your assets safe while your yield grows.

Even with its major phases wrapping up, AgoraLend is still a hot topic in top crypto ICO circles. It appeals to the serious DeFi degens who want infrastructure that actually scales. If you believe in a future where any token can be collateral, AgoraLend is the project that's building that bridge right now!

BMIC is the “secret weapon” for long-term holders who want their wealth protected against the next generation of threats! As quantum computing nears, BMIC is building a defensive fortress. It's not just a token; it's a security-first finance stack that makes your wallet “un-hackable” by future tech.

This project draws a sophisticated crowd that prioritizes durability over short-term noise. With a fixed supply and a roadmap built for resilience, BMIC is the foundation of the 2026 security narrative. For those hunting the top crypto ICO with real staying power, BMIC is the ultimate hedge against future chaos.

The 2026 presale scene is a goldmine for the brave! Tapzi is winning on fun, AgoraLend is winning on utility, and BMIC is winning on safety. But let's be real, BlockDAG is the one leading the charge with pure, unadulterated scale.

With $450 million raised and only a few hours left to grab the final BDAG batch at $0.0005, the FOMO is real. The decision isn't whether it's a win; it's whether you get in before the market takes over and the 100x potential becomes history. The clock is running… LET'S GO!

Bitcoin's price dipped hard on Thursday to a low of $83,757 as the crypto market experienced a sell-off sparked by investor fears around AI spending. 

The biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was recently priced slightly higher at $83,788 after dropping over 6% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko. Over the past week, it has dropped by 6% and is down year-to-date. 

Ethereum also took a hit and was trading for nearly $2,792 — a 24-hour dip of more than 7%. While other major coins and tokens such as XRP and Solana also experienced similar daily drops. 

The crypto sell-off came as big tech stocks dipped on news that Microsoft earnings showed the software giant had reported record spending. Investors are worried that AI expenditure is too big and results are taking too long to bear fruit. 

“Regardless of the fact that many in the Bitcoin space see Bitcoin as the world's hardest money and stack Bitcoin regardless of price, the vast majority of the market still sees Bitcoin as a tech trade,” Timot Lamarre, director of market research at Unchained, said.

Bitcoin and the wider crypto market has in the past moved along with US equities — particularly tech stocks. 

Traders betting on the future price of digital coins had their positions fast closed Thursday following the sell-off. 

In the past 24 hours, a total of $822.4 million in futures positions have been liquidated. Of that figure, $696.8 million were long positions. 

And $313.7 million in positions betting on the future price of Bitcoin going up have today been liquidated. 

Bitcoin was largely unmoved after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged and its chair signalled no urgency to begin cutting them.

The asset has typically performed well in a low-interest rate environment. But market observers this week are largely paying attention to what earnings from major tech companies will do to the asset class.

Apple, Meta Platforms and Tesla will also report earnings this week. Experts told DL News that strong results could lift risk-on assets like Bitcoin.

The U.S. Senate's Agriculture Committee is holding its first markup hearing on crypto market structure legislation, giving lawmakers a chance to debate and vote on amendments and possibly advance the actual legislation.

ND (11:30 a.m. ET): After less than an hour of debate and just a handful of amendments, the Senate Agriculture Committee voted to advance its market structure legislation to the full Senate on a party-line vote (12 lawmakers voted for it, 11 against). All eyes are now back on the Senate Banking Committee, which postponed its own markup hearing earlier this month and has yet to set a new date. 

ND (11:28 a.m. ET): Unmentioned so far in Thursday's hearing: The crypto markets themselves, which were down heavily between 4% and 7% over the past 24 hours of trading. Bitcoin hovered around $84,000 at press time.

JH (11:24 a.m. ET): We moved from Democrat amendments to a Republican one that's meant to block foreign adversaries of the U.S. from meddling in the U.S. crypto markets. Senator Tommy Tuberville pushed the amendment ""about ensuring our digital markets are not compromised by our enemies.""

But Tuberville agreed to withdraw his amendments with an understanding of ""what we're trying to accomplish today,"" he said. So he asked that the ideas can come up again later.

ND (11:22a.m. ET): More from Booker earlier:

""What I and so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle see is that we are standing on the cusp of extraordinary humanity, changing breakthroughs that could give Americans a financial system that is faster, cheaper and more inclusive,"" he said. ""I have seen in my own community that the system we have right now often screws customers, hurts their ability to access financial markets. There is a democratizing force, or at least potential that is moving across our country and across the world.""

Senator Adam Schiff of California likewise commented that Democrats had a working group to support crypto legislation, likening crypto to artificial intelligence: ""We want these jobs. We want this industry to stay in the United States, and that means that we need to have rules of the road where we're not essentially making decisions through litigation."" 

However, he expected that the bill will advance on party lines due to the partisan nature of the bill, he said. 

JH (11:17 a.m. ET): The opening Democratic amendments went down, as expected, in party-line votes, including the standout issue meant to target President Donald Trump's crypto business interests.

It's been a cordial disagreement so far today, with Democrats gently accusing that Republicans abandoned negotiations and Republicans gently suggesting that disagreements can be resolved later.

ND (11:14 a.m. ET): The second amendment offered, this time by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, would prohibit the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department from ""providing digital commodity intermediaries with a taxpayer-funded bailout"" in the event of banking failures, pointing to Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank. 

Boozman said that ""nothing in the bill would grant the CFTC authority"" to provide bankruptcy assistance, calling the amendment ""unnecessary."" 

The amendment failed 11-12 on party lines. 

ND (11:08 a.m. ET): The first amendment, offered by Senator Michael Bennett, a Colorado Democrat, addressed Democrats' concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's profiting off of his family's various crypto interests and businesses. 

""I think this issue strikes at the core of our democracy,"" Bennett said. ""This amendment is not about crypto or even particularly about President Trump. It's about returning to a system of government and ethics that that we thought the American people deserved.""

Boozman said he was opposed to the amendment as it reached ""way beyond"" the Agriculture Committee's jurisdiction.

The amendment failed 11-12 on party line votes.

ND (10:56 a.m. ET): The Thursday hearing will see lawmakers offer up amendments on the underlying text, which the committee published last week. While the Senators were working on bipartisan legislation, Committee Chairman John Boozman said in a statement last week that ""fundamental differences in policy"" remained and the members of the committee had not come to an agreement on the text that was published.

Senator Cory Booker, the Democrat leading negotiations on the bill, said in opening remarks that lawmakers were close to an agreement on key issues, pointing to U.S. President Donald Trump and his family's crypto ties as one outstanding area of concern, as well as the lack of a firm agreement on quorum at federal agencies. 

""In football parlance, we moved from our own goal line all the way down 70 yards. We're almost in the red zone on this bill, and that frustrates me, because I see a bipartisan glide path to land this plane, to punch through the end zone,"" Booker said. 

Boozman, in his own opening remarks, said lawmakers had made ""really significant progress"" in putting the bill together. 

""Advancing this bill is the first step, and there are many steps to come in achieving those goals,"" he said. ""I also encourage that the administration and Senate leadership to coordinate and ensure that the CFTC is fully constituted and adequately funded.""

Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture

Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale.

Ano ang dapat malaman: 

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

Why a drop below $85,000 might risk more selloff","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/29/bitcoin-s-major-safety-net-just-snapped-after-falling-below-usd85-000-here-s-how-low-it-can-go","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:07:14 GMT","

Bitcoin just crashed through a price milestone it's been holding on to for two months, and sellers are calling the shots now.

That trusty milestone? Bitcoin's average price over the last 100 weeks. Since November, this so-called 100-week simple moving average has consistently acted as a safety net, a level at which buyers have continued to buy every dip for nine weeks straight.

But today, prices have slipped below $85,000, convincingly moving below the 100-week average line, as seen in the chart below. The breakdown means sellers have overpowered all the buying power around the support, establishing a potential path lower.

So, where can the sell-off find the next wave of buyers?

In April last year, buyers emerged at around $75,000, stalling the selloff at the time, which makes it a key level to watch now. 

Below that, the next support is at the 200-week average, which is at $58,000. 

While chart patterns are popular, they don't always guarantee directional bets — just like any big-picture or fundamentals clue. Smart traders always watch for a key level that, if reclaimed, flips the bearish vibe on its head.

Right now, for bitcoin, that's $95,000, a level where buyers kept getting outbid by sellers early this month and in December. The bullish case comes back to the table if prices surpass that level.

De novo genes generally refer to genes that arise from previously non-coding sequences. This evolutionary path — when randomly expressed sequences become folded and active proteins — challenges our understanding of genetic innovation and has prompted studies to address the evolutionary and mechanistic knowledge gaps. More specifically, prior work has illuminated the mechanisms underlying the origin of de novo genes, their potential functional roles in the cell and the evolutionary processes that lead to these functions. Recent advances in both experimental and computational approaches have contributed to insights into the emergence of de novo genes and the broader implications for our understanding of biological complexity. In this Review, we place particular emphasis on efforts to quantify the likelihood of de novo gene emergence in eukaryotes given genomic characteristics, as well as the mechanisms by which de novo protein structures that are not actively selected against become amenable to selection-driven changes.

This study shows that complete sequence divergence explains at most one-third of orphan genes across yeast, fly and human, indicating that most orphan and taxonomically restricted genes likely originate de novo from non-coding sequences rather than through undetectable divergence.

This study shows that in mammals, new ORFs frequently emerge de novo from non-coding DNA but are usually short-lived, with only a few becoming translated and retained over time, suggesting that many young genes arise as ‘frozen accidents' of random transcription rather than by gradual adaptive evolution.

Genes that originate from previously non-genic sequences through the emergence of transcription and translation signals. This definition does not preclude de novo genes containing short remnant elements from, for example, long silenced pseudogenes.

Mutations that create novel start codons, remove premature stop codons or enhance transcriptional or translational signals, potentially activating previously non-coding sequences or modifying existing ones to acquire gene-like properties. (Conversely, disabling mutations may deactivate genes by disrupting essential regulatory or coding elements).

Small proteins typically comprising fewer than 100 amino acids that are translated from short open reading frames; they are also referred to as micropeptides or small ORF-encoded peptides. Despite their size, microproteins can have important regulatory functions, including modulation of larger protein complexes, cell signalling and metabolic processes.

(neORFs). ORFs that have not yet attained protogene or de novo gene status and may ultimately be purged by selection or drift, or occasionally become fixed. Typically, their transcripts are present in some individuals or populations but not yet fixed.

Protein-coding genes that lack detected homologues in other species or lineages, making them unique to specific taxonomic groups. They can arise through various mechanisms, including de novo gene birth, rapid sequence divergence or horizontal gene transfer. ‘Orphan' status is deliberately preliminary, whereas the ‘taxonomically restricted gene' status denotes a proven classification.

A conceptual term denoting a newly expressed ORF that fulfils some gene-like properties such as being longer, translated and fixed in a population, but shows no conclusive signals of selection (yet).

(sORFs). DNA sequences typically encoding fewer than 100 amino acids (or 100 codons) that begin with a start codon and end with a stop codon. sORFs can be found in 5′ untranslated regions, 3′ untranslated regions, long non-coding RNAs or as independent transcription units, and they are sometimes also called small open reading frames.

The complete set of translated sequences within a cell, encompassing both canonical protein-coding genes and non-canonical translated regions. The concept highlights the continuum between coding and non-coding sequences and provides a framework for studying translation beyond annotated genes.

Chemical synthesis is the process of creating complex chemical compounds from simpler precursors.Credit: Andrew Lambert Photography/SPL

Searching for blockbuster drugs and wonder materials is an arduous task for chemists. To make their promising compounds, they must trawl through millions of known chemical reactions, with hundreds of thousands more added annually, and then test whether it is possible to synthesize them.

Now, researchers have created an artificial-intelligence system that vastly simplifies and accelerates the process of chemical synthesis. The system, which is called MOSAIC and is described in a study published in Nature on 19 January1, recommended conditions that researchers were able to use to generate 35 compounds with the potential to become products like pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals or cosmetics without needing to do any further trawling or tweaking.

“The synthesis of small molecules is the slow step in drug discovery and a number of other important areas,” says study co-author Timothy Newhouse, a chemist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

MOSAIC could remove this bottleneck, adds Newhouse, so could lead to more and better products. It is “capable of drafting complete laboratory instructions — detailed enough for chemists to follow — to help create molecules that have not previously existed”. 

Predicting the conditions of chemical reactions has been a key focus of AI use in chemistry. One of the most prominent tools is IBM's RXN for Chemistry, which is based on a large language model (LLM).

It uses a system called simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES). This translates chemical 3D structures into letters, numbers and punctuation, which are better suited to a system that recognizes language. By contrast, LLMs such as ChemCrow are trained for chemistry tasks using natural-language data2.

The SMILES approach makes it easier to process chemical information such as starting materials and solvents. “Our goal was to build a general model that could read chemistry the way chemists write it [by] listening to the language of experimental procedures and quickly turning that collective voice into a practical suggestion,” says Newhouse. Newhouse adds that integrating the step-by-step instructions that MOSAIC produces into automated systems would be a “natural next step”.

The researchers used an AI system they had developed previously3 to cluster a database of around one million reactions extracted from patents into 2,285 subsets. Using the subsets, the team trained Meta's partially open-source Llama LLM to create 2,498 separate expert models, each specialized in one combination of chemical transformation starting from one type of molecule. This approach can run on computers locally because it uses fewer parameters than do the major LLMs.

Martin Seifrid, a materials scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, says that MOSAIC is notable in that it avoids “throwing the largest possible model at a problem, instead choosing to focus on a carefully designed system of much smaller ‘expert' models”. “Each specialized model is more accurate within its domain,” Seifrid says.

A 33-year-old man survived for 48 hours without his lungs, after a medical team replaced the organs with an external artificial-lung system1 that it developed to keep him alive until he could receive a double lung transplant.

There have been cases in which people have had their lungs removed and been connected to an external device to maintain oxygen levels. But, the devices used in these cases don't count as artificial lungs because they do not maintain blood flow across the heart, meaning it cannot function normally, says Ankit Bharat, a thoracic surgeon at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, who helped to develop the artificial system.

Bharat says his team's design is unique because it maintains a balanced and continuous flow of blood to the heart, reducing the risk of blood clots that could trigger a heart attack. The findings were published today in the journal Med.

The engineering behind the artificial-lung system is remarkable, says Natasha Rogers, a transplant clinician at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. It is difficult to maintain normal heart function in the absence of lungs, she says. “They were really very brave.”

The team's artificial-lung system could be used in other critically unwell people while they become healthy enough to receive lung transplants, she adds.

Before being placed on the artificial-lung system, the man had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome — an often-life-threatening condition in which the lungs cannot absorb enough oxygen — triggered by the influenza virus. He was then placed on a ventilator but developed a drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The infection caused parts of his lungs to fill with pus, and he went into septic shock, at which point his heart and kidneys began to fail.

“He was so sick, he had a cardiac arrest and he was actively dying,” says Bharat. Because the man was too unwell to receive a lung transplant, the team decided to remove his lungs — the source of the infection.

Surprisingly, the man began to improve quickly. “Within 48 hours, he was off all the medication to support his blood pressure, his kidney function was completely restored and his heart was working normally,” says Bharat. At that point, the man received a double lung transplant and has showed no signs of organ rejection or impaired lung function years later. “We are now approaching almost three years since we did this, and the patient is doing really great,” says Bharat.

Earlier this month, Joseph Thacker's neighbor mentioned to him that she'd preordered a couple of stuffed dinosaur toys for her children. She'd chosen the toys, called Bondus, because they offered an AI chat feature that lets children talk to the toy like a kind of machine-learning-enabled imaginary friend. But she knew Thacker, a security researcher, had done work on AI risks for kids, and she was curious about his thoughts.

So Thacker looked into it. With just a few minutes of work, he and a web security researcher friend named Joel Margolis made a startling discovery: Bondu's web-based portal, intended to allow parents to check on their children's conversations and for Bondu's staff to monitor the products' use and performance, also let anyone with a Gmail account access transcripts of virtually every conversation Bondu's child users have ever had with the toy.

Without carrying out any actual hacking, simply by logging in with an arbitrary Google account, the two researchers immediately found themselves looking at children's private conversations, the pet names kids had given their Bondu, the likes and dislikes of the toys' toddler owners, their favorite snacks and dance moves.

In total, Margolis and Thacker discovered that the data Bondu left unprotected—accessible to anyone who logged in to the company's public-facing web console with their Google username—included children's names, birth dates, family member names, “objectives” for the child chosen by a parent, and most disturbingly, detailed summaries and transcripts of every previous chat between the child and their Bondu, a toy practically designed to elicit intimate one-on-one conversation. Bondu confirmed in conversations with the researchers that more than 50,000 chat transcripts were accessible through the exposed web portal, essentially all conversations the toys had engaged in other than those that had been manually deleted by parents or staff.

“It felt pretty intrusive and really weird to know these things,"" Thacker says of the children's private chats and documented preferences that he saw. “Being able to see all these conversations was a massive violation of children's privacy.""

When Thacker and Margolis alerted Bondu to its glaring data exposure, they say, the company acted to take down the console in a matter of minutes before relaunching the portal the next day with proper authentication measures. When WIRED reached out to the company, Bondu CEO Fateen Anam Rafid wrote in a statement that security fixes for the problem “were completed within hours, followed by a broader security review and the implementation of additional preventative measures for all users.” He added that Bondu “found no evidence of access beyond the researchers involved.” (The researchers note that they didn't download or keep any copies of the sensitive data they accessed via Bondu's console, other than a few screenshots and a screen-recording video shared with WIRED to confirm their findings.)

“We take user privacy seriously and are committed to protecting user data,"" Anam Rafid added in his statement. “We have communicated with all active users about our security protocols and continue to strengthen our systems with new protections,” as well as hiring a security firm to validate its investigation and monitor its systems in the future.

While Bondu's near-total lack of security around the children's data that it stored may be fixed, the researchers argue that what they saw represents a larger warning about the dangers of AI-enabled chat toys for kids. Their glimpse of Bondu's backend showed how detailed the information is that it stored on children, keeping histories of every chat to better inform the toy's next conversation with its owner. (Bondu thankfully didn't store audio of those conversations, auto-deleting them after a short time and keeping only written transcripts.)

Even now that the data is secured, Margolis and Thacker argue that it raises questions about how many people inside companies that make AI toys have access to the data they collect, how their access is monitored, and how well their credentials are protected. “There are cascading privacy implications from this,"" says Margolis. ”All it takes is one employee to have a bad password, and then we're back to the same place we started, where it's all exposed to the public internet.""

Margolis adds that this sort of sensitive information about a child's thoughts and feelings could be used for horrific forms of child abuse or manipulation. “To be blunt, this is a kidnapper's dream,” he says. “We're talking about information that lets someone lure a child into a really dangerous situation, and it was essentially accessible to anybody.""

Margolis and Thacker point out that, beyond its accidental data exposure, Bondu also—based on what they saw inside its admin console—appears to use Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT5, and as a result may share information about kids' conversations with those companies. Bondu's Anam Rafid responded to that point in an email, stating that the company does use “third-party enterprise AI services to generate responses and run certain safety checks, which involves securely transmitting relevant conversation content for processing.” But he adds that the company takes precautions to “minimize what's sent, use contractual and technical controls, and operate under enterprise configurations where providers state prompts/outputs aren't used to train their models.”

The two researchers also warn that part of the risk of AI toy companies may be that they're more likely to use AI in the coding of their products, tools, and web infrastructure. They say they suspect that the unsecured Bondu console they discovered was itself “vibe-coded""—created with generative AI programming tools that often lead to security flaws. Bondu didn't respond to WIRED's question about whether the console was programmed with AI tools.

Warnings about the risks of AI toys for kids have grown in recent months but have largely focused on the threat that a toy's conversations will raise inappropriate topics or even lead them to dangerous behavior or self-harm. NBC News, for instance, reported in December that AI toys its reporters chatted with offered detailed explanations of sexual terms, tips about how to sharpen knives, and even seemed to echo Chinese government propaganda, stating for example that Taiwan is a part of China.

Bondu, by contrast, appears to have at least attempted to build safeguards into the AI chatbot it gives children access to. The company even offers a $500 bounty for reports of “an inappropriate response” from the toy. “We've had this program for over a year, and no one has been able to make it say anything inappropriate,” a line on the company's website reads.

Yet at the same time, Thacker and Margolis found that Bondu was simultaneously leaving all of its users' sensitive data entirely exposed. “This is a perfect conflation of safety with security,” says Thacker. “Does ‘AI safety' even matter when all the data is exposed?”

Thacker says that prior to looking into Bondu's security, he'd considered giving AI-enabled toys to his own kids, just as his neighbor had. Seeing Bondu's data exposure firsthand changed his mind.

“Do I really want this in my house? No, I don't,” he says. “It's kind of just a privacy nightmare.”

As a veteran of the war on terror, I have spent the past year watching Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers expand their operations across the country on a heretofore unprecedented scale and with a new faux-military bearing. From equipment to weapons to tactics, ICE and other immigration enforcement bodies want to be seen as combat forces carrying out their missions. Witness on Thursday, when White House border czar Tom Homan talked about Minneapolis as a “theater” for his agents. Overlooking that ICE is not, in fact, part of the armed services of the US—it's a civilian law enforcement agency—it is useful to break down their operations through a military lens to find the strategic implications. Because if an agency wants to cosplay as a military force, it deserves to be evaluated as one.

Let's start with the tools of the trade: equipment, uniforms, and armament. From the military perspective, soldiers choose the appropriate equipment and armament for the mission. An infantry squad would not go into a jungle campaign equipped for an urban fight. Squads in Iraq and Afghanistan often “dressed down” for counterinsurgency missions, where building mutual trust with locals was more important than showing up as if ready for World War III. Sometimes, units went into the opposite posture when a show of force was needed. Equipment, armament, and tactical employment vary from mission to mission.

ICE agents—civil representatives of the law, remember—often show up to raids kitted out as if they're preparing to enter Fallujah circa 2004 against a well-entrenched enemy equipped with machine guns, mortars, and explosive vests. They also arrive in a mishmash of uniforms, hoodie sweatshirts, military gear, and masks, leaving everyone confused as to whether these are law enforcement officers or just some random dudes.

Where soldiers tailor their armament for the mission, ICE agents carry weapons and equipment inappropriate for simple search-and-seizure missions: ballistic helmets, bullet resistant plate carriers, magazine drop pouches on their legs, weapons loaded with a cornucopia of optics, silencers, and other attachments you wouldn't catch your average infantryman dead with (the more weight on the weapon makes it less effective in a firefight).

Tactically, the way ICE performs its missions has little to do with “enemy” posture or the mission. One, there is no “enemy:” There are persons who may or may not have violated civil law. These people have not declared an intent to resist violently and with deadly force. Yet ICE shows up with maximum force and intimidation—often roping in people on the sidelines and increasing the media impact of their actions.

Generally, ICE agents move with zero military sense. They bunch up and cluster around their target or in doorways; in a combat zone, soldiers clustering up like this could be annihilated by a single grenade or burst from an automatic weapon. It also demonstrates that ICE agents often have very little clue what their mission is. Soldiers are taught to disperse and always move with a head on a swivel for situational awareness. As a soldier, you are taught to point your weapon only at something you intend to shoot. ICE agents have brandished their weapons. Soldiers train to reserve deadly force for identified enemies and to preserve life where possible. ICE and federal agents have publicly killed two unarmed American citizens.

Multiple images show ICE agents “stacking” on a door, a formation used in close quarters combat. Rather than resembling any type of recognizable urban warfare formation, ICE agents' tactics often seem to be modeled off what they've seen in movies or imbibed via TV shows or video games. Given that training for ICE officers has dropped down to about six a half weeks, TV and movies might be their biggest source of knowledge. It demonstrates that ICE agents aren't moving with a tactical focus; they're doing what they think will look cool and intimidating in photographs.

When you get down to the basics of what ICE does—seizing and restraining people—they approach it in a chaotic fashion. Videos show officers bunching up, milling around, often turning on bystanders. They smash windows haphazardly, abandon cars with their engines still running alongside the road, and operate in a manner one Maine sheriff referred to as “bush-league policing.” Military tactics for seizure and search are far more precise. Every person in the squad has defined duties and responsibilities: While some form an outer cordon to ensure unit security, one searches the individual taken into custody, one maintains security over the prisoner, one logs everything found, etc.—all with the goal of reducing confusion and preserving the integrity of the unit.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, 20 years of counterinsurgency operations demonstrated that escalating combat for no reason often just creates more violence. Units found that de-escalation often created fewer civilian casualties, which in turn meant that those civilian's families were less prone to take up arms against coalition forces, which reduced coalition casualties. Escalation, by the same token, often undermined US policy. As a result, units trained to de-escalate where possible, while preserving the option to return violence with proportional but catastrophic lethality for anyone who initiated violence.

ICE tactics rarely seek to de-escalate but instead ramp up violence via threats, intimidation, and assault. These tactics vaguely resemble the worst of US military operations in the war on terror, which left embedded bitterness and hatred in the local populations. Repression, humiliation, and degradation—especially the accidental or deliberate killings of family members—drove more recruits into the ranks of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their allies than anything else.

Here we transition to link the tactical with the strategic. Military strategy is most broadly defined as combining the ways (tactics) and means (resources) to achieve a specific end. If ICE tactics are the means to a strategic end, then the implications are either confusing or chilling. Confusing, because if the administration hoped to increase deportations while keeping public support, ICE tactics are counterproductive. Chilling, because ICE tactics do line up with one theory recognized by military strategists: the theory of control.

This theory, which is commonly seen in authoritarian states like the People's Republic of China or Russia, encompasses many realms of irregular conflict: media warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare (sometimes called “lawfare”), to name a few. While strategies of control can be used against external enemies, they can also be used internally. A strategy of control uses terror tactics to create a violent resistance to justify its brutal subjugation and as an excuse to change laws enlarging the definition of terrorism and treason. Regimes then use the surrounding chaos and noise to continue its other initiatives. It is, roughly speaking, conducting policy by crisis.

War, it is said, is a continuation of policy by other means. State-backed violence, too, can be a continuation of policy. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, has repeatedly urged ICE agents to escalate their tactics and increase arrests, and he broadcast to agents that they had “federal immunity.” Since that last remark in October 2025, ICE tactics have become far more violent. But historically speaking, host nations—and in this case we speak of California, Illinois, Oregon, Minnesota, and Maine, I guess—simply do not take well to long-term abusive behavior.

If political ends of these tactics are not to sow profound mistrust, confusion, doubt, anger, and division, then they appear misdirected and misapplied. Tactics disconnected from strategy ultimately result in strategic failure. In this case, ICE tactics would endanger a Republican majority in Congress and control of the White House.

In the end, no matter how hard ICE tries to project its militant image, it remains an arm of the civilian authority and not that of the military. It is not fighting enemies of the United States. It is vital that we remember this and resist normalizing military-style tactics in our streets.

ICE agents and US military members do share one very real commonality: We all swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. While the military upholds this, ICE agents flaunt their extraconstitutional actions on our TV and phone screens every day.

Personally, ICE's operations seem like a fever dream of the worst parts of the war on terror coming back home to roost. From ineffective facial recognition scans (BATS and HIIDES, anyone?) to “geardos” who spent more time at Ranger Joe's (a military outfitter) than the range to late-night raids to catch a local terrorist leader who, half the time, was just a random guy trying to get through the day. We brought the mechanisms of a surveillance state to war with us, and they snuck into our duffel bags and followed us home. We emphasized accomplishing the mission no matter what and bred a generation of yes-men. We drove in heavily armed convoys down neighborhood streets, and now those trucks roll through our streets.

My generation spent its youth at war. We volunteered to do this, I acknowledge, but with the somehow implied belief that we could do some good. And that what we did mattered and that we stood for something. Something significant and unique. But as we watch the least effective and most morally objectionable of our tactics come home and be used amongst and against us, we are left with a profound feeling of betrayal. This, too, is a result of misaligned tactics.

Google DeepMind is opening up access to Project Genie, its AI tool for creating interactive game worlds from text prompts or images. 

Starting Thursday, Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. can play around with the experimental research prototype, which is powered by a combination of Google's latest world model Genie 3, its image-generation model Nano Banana Pro, and Gemini. 

Coming five months after Genie 3's research preview, the move is part of a broader push to gather user feedback and training data as DeepMind races to develop more capable world models. 

World models are AI systems that generate an internal representation of an environment, and can be used to predict future outcomes and plan actions. Many AI leaders, including those at DeepMind, believe world models are a crucial step to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). But in the nearer term, labs like DeepMind envision a go-to-market plan that starts with video games and other forms of entertainment and branches out into training embodied agents (aka robots) in simulation. 

DeepMind's release of Project Genie comes as the world model race is beginning to heat up. Fei-Fei Li's World Labs late last year released its first commercial product called Marble. Runway, the AI video-generation startup, has also launched a world model recently. And former Meta chief scientist Yann LeCun's startup AMI Labs will also focus on developing world models.

“I think it's exciting to be in a place where we can have more people access it and give us feedback,” Shlomi Fruchter, a research director at DeepMind, told TechCrunch via video interview, smiling ear-to-ear in clear excitement over Project Genie's release.

DeepMind researchers that TechCrunch spoke to were upfront about the tool's experimental nature. It can be inconsistent, sometimes impressively generating playable worlds, other times producing baffling results that miss the mark. Here's how it works.

You start with a “world sketch” by providing text prompts for both the environment and a main character, whom you will later be able to maneuver through the world in either first- or third-person view. Nano Banana Pro creates an image based on the prompts that you can, in theory, modify before Genie uses the image as a jumping off point for an interactive world. The modifications mostly worked, but the model occasionally stumbled and would give you purple hair when you asked for green.

You can also use real-life photos as a baseline for the model to build a world on, which, again, was hit or miss. (More on that later.) 

Once you're satisfied with the image, it takes a few seconds for Project Genie to create an explorable world. You can also remix existing worlds into new interpretations by building on top of their prompts, or explore curated worlds in the gallery or via the randomizer tool for inspiration. You can then download videos of the world you just explored. 

DeepMind is only granting 60 seconds of world generation and navigation at the moment, in part due to the budget and compute constraints. Because Genie 3 is an auto-regressive model, it takes a lot of dedicated compute — which puts a tight ceiling on how much DeepMind is able to provide to users.

“The reason we limit it to 60 seconds is because we wanted to bring it to more users,” Fruchter said. “Basically when you're using it, there's a chip somewhere that's only yours and it's being dedicated to your session.”

He added that extending it beyond 60 seconds would diminish the incremental value of the testing.

“The environments are interesting, but at some point, because of their level of interaction the dynamism of the environment is somewhat limited. Still, we see that as a limitation we hope to improve on.”

When I used the model, the safety guardrails were already up and running. I couldn't generate anything resembling nudity, nor could I generate worlds that even remotely sniffed of Disney or other copyrighted material. (In December, Disney hit Google with a cease-and-desist, accusing the firm's AI models of copyright infringement by training on Disney's characters and IP and generating unauthorized content, among other things.) I couldn't even get Genie to generate worlds of mermaids exploring underwater fantasy lands or ice queens in their wintery castles. 

Still, the demo was deeply impressive. The first world I built was an attempt to live out a small childhood fantasy, in which I could explore a castle in the clouds made up of marshmallows with a chocolate sauce river and trees made of candy. (Yes, I was a chubby kid.) I asked the model to do it in claymation style, and it delivered a whimsical world that childhood me would have eaten up; the castle's pastel-and-white colored spires and turrets looking puffy and tasty enough to rip off a chunk and dunk into the chocolate moat. (Video above.)

That said, Project Genie still has some kinks to work out. 

The models excelled at creating worlds based on artistic prompts, like using watercolors, anime style, or classic cartoon aesthetics. But it tended to fail when it came to photorealistic or cinematic worlds, often coming out looking like a video game rather than real people in a real setting. 

It also didn't always respond well when given real photos to work with. When I gave it a photo of my office and asked it to create a world based on the photo exactly as it was, it gave me a world that had some of the same furnishings of my office — a wooden desk, plants, a grey couch — laid out differently. And it looked sterile, digital, not lifelike. 

When I fed it a photo of my desk with a stuffed toy, Project Genie animated the toy navigating the space, and even had other objects occasionally react as it moved past them.

That interactivity is something DeepMind is working on improving. There were several occasions when my characters walked right through walls or other solid objects. 

When DeepMind released Genie 3 initially, researchers highlighted how the model's auto-regressive architecture meant that it could remember what it had generated, so I wanted to test that by returning to parts of the environment it generated already to see if it would be the same. For the most part, the model succeeded. In one case, I generated a cat exploring yet another desk, and only once when I turned back to the right side of the desk did the model generate a second mug.

The part I found most frustrating was the way you navigated the space using the arrows to look around, the spacebar to jump or ascend, and the W-A-S-D keys to move. I'm not a gamer, so this didn't come naturally to me, but the keys were often non-responsive, or they sent you in the wrong direction. Trying to walk from one side of the room to a doorway on the other side often became a chaotic zigzagging exercise, like trying to steer a shopping cart with a broken wheel. 

Fruchter assured me that his team was aware of these shortcomings, reminding me again that Project Genie is an experimental prototype. In the future, he said, the team hopes to enhance the realism and improve interaction capabilities, including giving users more control over actions and environments. 

“We don't think about [Project Genie] as an end-to-end product that people can go back to everyday, but we think there is already a glimpse of something that's interesting and unique and can't be done in another way,” he said.

Apple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they've recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.

​As first reported by Reuters, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the live translation capability introduced last year. 

The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.

The Financial Times reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple's second-largest acquisition to date, after buying Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014. 

​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he sold PrimeSense, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple's transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.

Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.

The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple's first quarterly earnings, in which analysts are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It's also expected to be the company's strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.

Something else to keep in mind is that the data products are extremely large. It would be expensive to give the public access. I used to host these types of data sets for EU countries. The workload just from authorized users is resource intensive, it doesn't scale cheaply. (I once woke up to find a metaphorical smoking crater where my server racks were because an authorized user shared his credentials with a few friends overnight.)

The licensing commonly restricts you to small hobbyist use cases. There are typically restrictions on use of data, the amount of data, and retention of data. I've never looked at Copernicus data before but it appears to have the same kinds of restrictions. This is the licensing equivalent of ""source available"" rather than true ""open source"". Hopefully they are improving on this front.While the data may be available in theory, no one ever invests in the data infrastructure that would allow people to access it in practice. They always have a nice website and API but it is like trying to watch Youtube over a dial-up modem. Usable access is reserved for researchers with an approved use case.The US government does an unusually good job at both of these in my experience. Even when US public data sets that are not readily available online, you have to contact someone, it is usually for good reason. For example, because they are multi-exabyte data sets sitting on tape somewhere that almost no one ever asks for.

They say they hope to retrieve trace gases at that global scale (seemingly with 30 minute cadence), which I think would be new. Also, they seem to say that this spectral resolution would enable them to retrieve temperature and humidity as a function of height -- not just surface temperature and column-integrated water content (""humidity"").Aha, here's a nice link (https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/geo-ir-sounder/) on exactly this question, pointing out the NASA IR sounders that have existed for many years (AIRS). These instruments get vertically-resolved atmospheric information, but they are not at GEO so their coverage is different. This makes them less useful for NWP.

EDIT:We actually work close with one startup that sprung out from academia. The founders wrote their masters thesis on object detection and pattern recognition using sentinel imaging. They had basically one product: to detect certain objects. After a couple of years they had gotten a handful of customers (basically they'd receive coordinates to some are of interest, and then tasked with trying to detect something), which afforded them to purchase commercial data (from other types of sensors) for building more robust systems. This in turn grew their customer bas, and they started adding products.Then they were acquired by one of the largest private space companies.But, in any case, it all started with access to free data. Would they have started a company like this, if they hadn't had access to the data from ESA? Who knows, but it made it all much easier. And they were able to completely bootstrap the company.

Companies like RocketLab pivoted to in-space stuff and that's where they actually make money.Pretty much every single small rocket company has lost money with small rockets and pivots to larger rockets where there is more demand because of constellations. But in Europe, that will be near impossible because of the Ariane monopoly.And closing the case on reuse for small rockets is even more difficult.I really think calling companies that have barley done a test-launch 'spacex competitors' is a silly. At best its a luxury competitor to SpaceX ride-share launches.

So far the support for these small launchers has been mostly for new missions and nowhere near in the volume to support even two of these small launch companies. Specially if Vega also survives as a rocket.Europe simply does not produce enough launches for these companies. And all of them will suffer from very low launch rates and non will be able to seriously compete for international payloads.

At the end of the day, LLMs are a statistical approximation or projection.A good example of this is how LLMs struggle with multiplication, particularly multipolcation of large numbers. It's not just that they make mistakes but the nature of the results.Tell ChatGPT to multiply 129348723423 and 2987892342424 and it'll probably get it wrong because nowhere on Reddit is that exact question for it to copy. But what's interesting is it'll tend to get the first and large digits correct (more often than not) but the middle is just noise.Someone will probably say ""this is a solved problem"" because somebody, somewhere has added this capability to a given LLM but these kinds of edge cases I think will constantly expose the fundamental limits of transformers, just like the famous ""how many r's in strawberry?"" example that di the rounds.All this comes up when you tell LLMs to write legal briefs. They completely make up a precedent because they learn what a precedent looks like and generate something similar. Lawyers have been caught submitting fake precedents in court filings due to this.

OpenAI, the company best known for its AI applications like ChatGPT and Sora, is reportedly working on a social media network designed to be free from AI bots. The catch is that users may need to have their irises scanned for access.

Forbes reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the project, that the platform is still in very early stages and is being developed by a small team of fewer than 10 people. The goal is to create a human-only social platform that would require users to prove they're real people. To do that, the team is reportedly considering implementing identity verification through Apple's Face ID or through the Orb, an Orwellian eye-scanning device made by a company that was also conveniently founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

This new social media platform seems to be Altman's latest attempt to solve a problem he himself and his fellow “architects of AI” helped create.

Altman first tried to tackle the bot problem in 2019 when he co-founded Tools for Humanity, the company behind the World app, formerly known as Worldcoin. The project aimed to create a global ID and a crypto-based currency that would only be available to verified humans. The project has since evolved into a “super app” called World that has messaging and payment features. But verification requires humans to get their eyes scanned by the soccer-ball-sized Orb device in exchange for a unique digital ID code stored on their phone. In theory, this could help filter out annoying AI bots from gaming, social media platforms, or even financial transactions like concert ticket sales.

So far, roughly 17 million people have been verified using the Orb, a far cry from the company's stated goal of reaching one billion users. Part of that adoption problem is logistical. People have to physically travel to one of the 674 verification locations worldwide to get their eyes scanned. In the U.S., there are only 32 such locations, most of them in Florida. More broadly, the idea of getting your eyes scanned by a company founded by one of Silicon Valley's most controversial figures isn't any easy sell.

Unsurprisingly, several countries have already temporarily banned or launched investigations into the company's biometric technology, citing concerns around privacy and data security.

Now, that tech seems like it could be making its way to a new social media network. Sources told Forbes that the new social platform would allow users to create and share AI-generated content like images and videos. And while OpenAI has proven it can build popular apps, it's far from clear whether a new social network could meaningfully pull people away from existing platforms, especially when you add biometric verification as a barrier.

ChatGPT alone now reaches roughly 700 million weekly users, and the company's AI video app racked up about one million downloads within five days of its launch. In comparison, Meta reported in September that its platforms, which include Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, now reach about 3.5 billion daily active users combined. All of which already allow users to generate and share AI-generated content.

OpenAI seems to hope that its promise of a bot-free environment will be enough to draw in users.

Altman himself has repeatedly voiced his frustration with bots online. In September, Altman responded to a post showing comments in the ClaudeCode subreddit praising OpenAI's coding agent Codex. “i have had the strangest experience reading this: i assume its all fake/bots, even though in this case i know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real,” he wrote in a post on X.

He went on to theorize why this might be happening, pointing to people picking up “quirks of LLM-speak” and also “probably some bots.” “But the net effect is somehow AI twitter/AI reddit feels very fake in a way it really didnt a year or two ago.” Altman wrote.

A few days earlier, Altman wrote in another post that he had never taken the dead internet theory seriously, “but it seems like there are really a lot of LLM-run twitter accounts now.”

The dead internet theory claims that since around 2016, much of the internet has been dominated by bots and AI-generated content rather than real human activity. But maybe there is someone other than Altman who could be trusted to find a solution.

The Webb space telescope has allowed us to peer farther back into the universe than ever before, providing a rare glimpse of the cosmos a mere 280 million years after its very existence began.

Using Webb's Near-Infrared Spectrograph, scientists have confirmed a new cosmic record of the most distant galaxy ever observed. Galaxy MoM-z14 existed just 280 million years after the big bang, providing clues to what the universe was like during its infancy and how it has evolved over time.

“With Webb, we are able to see farther than humans ever have before, and it looks nothing like what we predicted, which is both challenging and exciting,” Rohan Naidu, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said in a statement. Naidu is the lead author of the paper describing the discovery, published this week in the Open Journal of Astrophysics

Webb first spotted MoM-z14 in May 2025, an exceptionally luminous and compact galaxy that's around 50 times smaller than the Milky Way. The galaxy appeared to be very young, teeming with the formation of new stars.

Following its discovery, scientists had to confirm just how far the galaxy is. Due to the universe's sheer size, distant objects appear as they existed millions, or even billions, years ago. The universe is also expanding, so physical distances in terms of light years becomes a tad more tricky when looking at objects this far.

Astronomers found that MoM-z14 has a redshift of 14.44, meaning that the light from the galaxy has been traveling through space for so long that it's been stretched and shifted toward longer, more red wavelengths at the end of the spectrum due to the universe's expansion.

By measuring the galaxy's redshift, the scientists behind the discovery were able to confirm that its light has been traveling through space for 13.5 billion years. The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old, meaning this galaxy has existed during the relatively younger years of the cosmos.

The previous record holder is galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0, which existed 300 million years after the big bang.

MoM-z14 is surprisingly luminous, adding to a growing list of exceptionally bright galaxies found in the early universe that are 100 times brighter than theoretical studies predicted. Webb's previous observations of early galaxies has shown that the stars inhabiting them have high amounts of nitrogen, which may contribute to their brightness.

“We can take a page from archeology and look at these ancient stars in our own galaxy like fossils from the early universe,” Naidu said. “Except in astronomy we are lucky enough to have Webb seeing so far that we also have direct information about galaxies during that time.”

Although those ancient stars would not have had enough time to produce such high amounts of nitrogen, scientists believe the dense nature of the early universe may have resulted supermassive stars capable of producing more nitrogen than the stars observed in the local cosmos.

The discovery of the ancient galaxy reveals more clues to the puzzle of the universe's timeline, but there's still a lot more cosmic mystery for telescopes like Webb to probe for answers.

“To figure out what is going on in the early universe, we really need more information,” Yijia Li, a graduate student at the Pennsylvania State University and a member of the research team, said in a statement. “It's an incredibly exciting time, with Webb revealing the early universe like never before and showing us how much there still is to discover.”

Silicon shield will remain with Taiwan.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, has rebuffed claims that the U.S. intends to shift 40% of Taiwan's semiconductor capacity to the U.S., therefore removing the island's silicon shield, reports DigiTimes. He insisted that the global fab construction represents new capacity growth rather than relocation. Haung also said that TSMC must expand worldwide to meet surging AI-driven demand for chips and keep Taiwan as its stronghold.

Huang explained that demand for wafers is now outpacing what Taiwan's power grid can physically support, making overseas production a necessity rather than a political manoeuvre. He said that while TSMC will build and expand fabs in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, a substantial share of its output will remain in Taiwan, as no other region can replace the island's manufacturing ecosystem. According to Huang, spreading production across multiple regions strengthens resilience for both Taiwan and the U.S. and prevents supply bottlenecks as AI hardware volumes rise sharply.

For Nvidia, which sells everything it can produce both in Taiwan and the U.S., vast manufacturing capacities are crucial. Meanwhile, getting enough memory — HBM, DDR5, GDDR7, LPDDR5X, or even NAND — is as crucial for the company as getting enough compute silicon. To that end, production capacities for DRAM and NAND in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and eventually the U.S. are just as important to Nvidia as logic production. Huang said the company is coordinating closely with all major HBM suppliers —Samsung Electronics, SK hynix, and Micron Technology — to secure the volumes required for its next-generation AI accelerators, namely Rubin.

When it comes to geopolitics, Huang said that lawmakers must balance three competing goals: national security, technological leadership, and economic leadership. Therefore, he dismissed remarks by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who compared exporting advanced AI processors to China to 'selling nuclear weapons to North Korea,' and reminded that the current U.S. government has determined that selling Nvidia's H200 to Chinese entities does not undermine national security. However, he noted that it is now up to the Chinese government to let these processors into the country, as the company is awaiting regulatory clearance from Chinese authorities.

During his Taiwan visit, Huang plans to attend internal Nvidia meetings and Lunar New Year events, as well as to meet TSMC founder Morris Chang and chairman C.C. Wei.

A National Institute on Ageing (NIA) survey revealed social isolation, financial stress, and a steep decline in positive feelings toward ageing among older Canadian adults.

The decline in optimism toward ageing is the steepest since the annual survey began 4 years ago, noted survey authors Talia Bronstein, director of Policy, and Samir Sinha, MD, director of Health Policy Research, both at the NIA.

“On the flip side, it was promising to see that more older adults reported having access to a regular primary care physician, and fewer reported that they were unable to access regular dental care,” they told Medscape News Canada. “This may be a positive reflection of the new policies and initiatives to improve access to primary care providers and the widespread rollout of the new Canadian Dental Care Plan, specifically supporting lower-income older adults.”

The survey was published online on January 20.

The “NIA Ageing in Canada Survey,” now in its fourth year, provides annual snapshots of the perspectives, experiences, and expectations of older Canadian adults. This year's survey, conducted online from June to July 2025, included a representative sample comprising 6001 Canadians aged 50 years or older who were living in community settings across all provinces and territories. It highlights the “growing disconnect between how older Canadians want to age and the supports available to them,” according to NIA.

The report includes the following notable findings:

“The survey highlights that a subset of older Canadians are healthy, socially connected, and financially prepared for later life, while also underscoring the substantial inequalities among older adults,” Natasha Lane, MD, PhD, assistant professor of geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told Medscape News Canada. “The financial pressure many older Canadians are experiencing makes it difficult to maintain health, quality of life, and independence at home.” Lane, who did not participate in the study, also is associate editor of the Canadian Geriatrics Journal.

“Access to healthcare services alone is insufficient if older adults are struggling with basic needs such as housing stability, food security, or safe living conditions,” she added.

Notably, she said, “the findings likely underrepresent older adults experiencing the most severe forms of socioeconomic hardship, including those who are unhoused or living in extreme poverty, as these groups are less likely to participate in online surveys.”

Although dental care has become more affordable since the introduction of the Canadian Dental Care Program in 2023, she acknowledged, “awareness of the program remains limited, and many older adults are still forgoing dental care due to outdated assumptions about cost. Increased public awareness could help ensure that eligible individuals benefit from existing programs.”

The survey also reinforces evidence that many adverse socioeconomic and health outcomes disproportionately affect older women, who were more likely to report financial insecurity and barriers to accessing care, she said. “These findings underscore the value of routinely asking how health and social policies affect women and other groups differently as inequities cannot be addressed if they are not measured and acknowledged.”

Clinicians can help by encouraging people of all ages to stay socially connected, Bronstein and Sinha said. “Social isolation and loneliness in particular can negatively impact people's health and well-being and even increase their risk for dementia.”

Clinicians also can encourage older adults to find a primary care provider to help them prevent or manage chronic health conditions that become more common with age, they said. “Furthermore, clinicians can remind their patients that taking simple, healthy actions like staying socially connected, managing blood pressure, being physically active, and addressing their hearing and vision issues can not only prevent outcomes like dementia and other chronic health issues but also help improve their overall quality of life as they age.”

“Social isolation and loneliness have well documented impacts on health and raise the risk of premature mortality,” they added. “In fact, severe loneliness has been seen as being equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. It is critical that clinicians recognize this as a public health challenge.”

“Ageing in the right place requires coordinated action across all levels of government, alongside civil society, health and social care providers, and community organizations,” the report stated. “With deliberate, evidence-based policy reform, Canada can embrace its ageing population as an opportunity to create more inclusive, resilient, and compassionate communities for people of all ages.”

Funding for the report was provided by Manulife and the Waltons Trust. Lane reported having no relevant financial relationships.

People with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID experience a disruption to their brain connectivity during a mentally demanding task.

The new Griffith University research, published today, used ultra-high field MRI technology to investigate the significant reduction in brain connectivity in specific parts of the brain.

Professor Sonya Marshall-Gradisnik from Griffith's National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases said there were common symptoms experienced by people with ME/CFS or Long COVID with this study focusing on neurological features.

""The symptoms include cognitive difficulties, such as memory problems, difficulties with attention and concentration, and slowed thinking,"" Professor Marshall-Gradisnik said.

Lead author and PhD candidate Maira Inderyas said the study saw participants undertake a cognitive test while inside the MRI machine to gauge their brain activity.

The task, called a Stroop task, was displayed to the participants on a screen during the scan, and required participants to ignore conflicting information and focus on the correct response, which places high demands on the brain's executive function and inhibitory control.

The set up allowed us to precisely measure which areas of the brain were activated while the patient was performing a mentally demanding task.

The scans show changes in the brain regions which may contribute to cognitive difficulties such as memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and slower thinking.""

Maira Inderyas, lead author and PhD candidate 

The research supported what many people with ME/CFS and Long COVID experience which was that cognitive effort was not just tiring but could have real neurological impacts, and adequate rest was not optional but essential.

The ultra-high field MRI used in the study was one of only two available in Australia.

The research was funded by ME Research UK and the Stafford Fox Medical Research Foundation.

The paper 'Distinct functional connectivity patterns in myalgic encephalomyelitis and Long COVID patients during cognitive fatigue: a 7 Tesla task-fMRI study' has been published in the Journal of Translational Medicine.

Humans can't live without lungs. But Ankit Bharat's patient did for 48 hours. 

Reporting January 29 in the Cell Press journal Med, surgeons describe how they removed a patient's infected lungs and built ""artificial lungs"" to keep him alive until a double lung transplantation was available. The work shows how the approach may serve as a life-saving bridge to transplantation. 

""He was critically ill. His heart stopped as soon as he arrived. We had to perform CPR,"" recalls Bharat, the lead author and a thoracic surgeon at Northwestern University. ""When the infection is so severe that the lungs are melting, they're irrecoverably damaged. That's when patients die."" 

The patient, a 33-year-old man, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening condition in which inflammation and infection overwhelm the lungs. Triggered by the flu, his lungs deteriorated rapidly and were further compromised by bacterial pneumonia. Eventually, his lungs, heart, and kidneys started to fail. A double lung transplant became his only chance of survival. 

The lungs were damaged beyond repair and were fueling infection. But the patient's body was too sick to accept new lungs; it needed time to heal. 

The heart and lungs are intrinsically connected. When there are no lungs, how do you keep the patient alive?"" 

Ankit Bharat, lead author and thoracic surgeon at Northwestern University

To solve the problem, Bharat's team engineered an artificial lung system that temporarily replaced the lungs' functions. The system oxygenated the blood, removed carbon dioxide, and helped maintain a stable blood flow through the heart and body while the patient had no lungs at all. 

Once the infected lungs were removed, the patient's condition improved. His blood pressure stabilized, organ function recovered, and the infection subsided. Two days later, donor lungs became available, and the surgeons performed a double lung transplant. More than two years later, the patient has returned to daily life with good lung function. 

""Conventionally, lung transplant is reserved for patients who have chronic conditions like interstitial lung disease or cystic fibrosis,"" says Bharat. ""Currently, people think if you get severe ARDS, you keep supporting them and ultimately the lungs will get better."" 

But the lungs, when removed from the patient, told a different story. By analyzing them at the molecular level, the researchers found widespread scarring and immune damage. These are signs that the tissue had reached an irreversible stage and could not recover on its own. 

""For the first time, biologically, we are giving molecular proof that some patients will need a double lung transplant, otherwise they will not survive,"" says Bharat. 

For now, the approach remains limited to highly specialized centers with the expertise and resources to carry it out. Bharat hopes that over time, the concept will be adopted into more standardized devices that can keep patients alive while awaiting new lungs. 

""In my practice, young patients die almost every week because no one realized that transplantation was an option,"" Bharat says. ""For severe lung damage caused by respiratory viruses or infections, even in acute settings, a lung transplant can be lifesaving.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study uncovers how the brain's 'memory replay' process is impaired in Alzheimer's disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260129/Study-uncovers-how-the-brains-memory-replay-process-is-impaired-in-Alzheimers-disease.aspx","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:53:00 GMT","

Memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease may be linked to impairment in how the brain replays our recent experiences while we are resting, according to a new study in mice by University College London (UCL) scientists.

The researchers say their findings, published in Current Biology, could help scientists develop drug treatments targeting this impaired brain function, or help design new tests for early diagnosis.

Co-lead author Dr Sarah Shipley (UCL Cell & Developmental Biology) said: ""Alzheimer's disease is caused by the build-up of harmful proteins and plaques in the brain, leading to symptoms such as memory loss and impaired navigation - but it's not well understood exactly how these plaques disrupt normal brain processes.

""We wanted to understand how the function of brain cells changes as the disease develops, to identify what's driving these symptoms.

""When we rest, our brains normally replay recent experiences - this is thought to be key to how memories are formed and maintained. We found this replay process is disrupted in mice engineered to develop the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's, and this disruption is associated with how badly animals perform on memory tasks.""

The replay process, which occurs in the brain's hippocampus, involves place cells firing in rapid sequences during rest. Place cells - discovered by Nobel prize-winning UCL neuroscientist Professor John O'Keefe - are neurons (brain cells) that represent specific locations. When we visit somewhere, particular place cells fire, and as we move the cells fire in a sequence. Later, when we rest, these cells reactivate in the same sequence, helping memories become ingrained.

For the study, the researchers were testing how well mice performed in a simple maze task, while monitoring their brain activity with sets of electrodes that could simultaneously track roughly 100 individual place cells.

In mice with amyloid pathology, the replay process was fundamentally altered. Surprisingly, replay events occurred just as frequently as in healthy mice - but their structure was disorganised. The normal, coordinated patterns of place cell activity that should reinforce memories were scrambled. The researchers also found that place cells in affected mice became less stable over time, with individual neurons no longer reliably coding the same locations, particularly after rest periods - precisely when replay should be strengthening these representations.

This disruption had consequences on memory tasks: affected mice performed worse in the maze, appearing to forget where they had already been and revisiting corridors that led nowhere.

We've uncovered a breakdown in how the brain consolidates memories, visible at the level of individual neurons. What's striking is that replay events still occur - but they've lost their normal structure. It's not that the brain stops trying to consolidate memories; the process itself has gone wrong.

We hope our findings could help develop tests to detect Alzheimer's early, before extensive damage has occurred, or lead to new treatments targeting this replay process. We're now investigating whether we can manipulate replay through the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is already targeted by drugs used to treat Alzheimer's symptoms. By understanding the mechanism better, we hope to make such treatments more effective.""

Professor Caswell Barry, co-lead author, UCL Cell & Developmental Biology 

The research was conducted by researchers in the UCL Faculties of Life Sciences and Brain Sciences, and supported by the Cambridge Trust, Wellcome, and the Masonic Charitable Foundation.

One of the greatest players ever leaves the game.

One of the greatest players in American soccer history is calling it a career. Today, United States Women's National Team legend Crystal Dunn announced that she is retiring from professional soccer, bringing to an end one of the most prolific careers any American soccer player has ever had.

Dunn began her career as a forward, quickly becoming one of the best strikers in the NWSL. She eventually moved to left back, where for upwards of a 5 year stretch was considered the best left back in the world. She was Her career was marked by her versatility, her defending, and her sense to find the net, and she grew into one of the greatest role models the national team has ever had. Dunn has inspired a generation of players with her tenacious play and the joy that she showed on the field and with the fans.

“I leave the game with a sense of peace and deep fulfillment for all that I've accomplished,” Dunn said in a statement released by U.S. Soccer. “I'm grateful for the incredible people I've had the privilege to work with, from teammates and coaches to family and friends, and all the amazing moments we've shared. I'm very much looking forward to my next chapter ahead.”

Her list of accolades is a mile long. With the University of North Carolina, she won the NCAA national championship in 2012, a season where she also won the MAC Hermann Award as college's best player. She was the NWSL MVP in 2015 and won 3 NWSL titles, in 2018 and 2019 with the North Carolina Courage and in 2022 with the Portland Thorns. She also helped the Courage win the NWSL Shield in 2018 and 2019 and helped Portland win it in 2021. With the Thorns, she was also a NWSL Challenge Cup champion and International Champions Cup winner in 2021. She was on the NWSL Best XI in 2015 and 2018 and was the 2015 NWSL Golden Boot winner. She also won a Spring title in 2017 with Chelsea.

On the international level, she helped the United States win the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2012. She of course was a member of the USWNT when they won the 2019 Women's World Cup. She earned Olympic bronze in 2020 and Olympic gold in 2024, and has winners' medals from the Concacaf Women's Championship (2018), Concacaf Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament (2016, 2020), SheBelieves Cup (2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024), the Algarve Cup (2015), Tournament of Nations (2018), and the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup.

Despite only standing 5'1” tall, she showed tremendous fight and heart on the field. She played all but 75 minutes of the 2024 Olympics, helping the team to a gold medal. She also never left the field in the 6 matches she played at the 2019 Women's World Cup, again helping the team to their second consecutive Women's World Cup title and fourth overall. In total, Crystal Dunn scored 50 goals and added 44 assists on the club level and had 160 caps for the USWNT with 25 goals and 20 assists. She exits the game with a legacy that forever inspire future generations of players.

USWNT's Crystal Dunn opens up about her experience as a mother and athlete, and highlights the importance of representation in women's sports.

United States star Crystal Dunn has retired from professional soccer after a decorated playing career to spend more time with her family.

The 33-year-old New York native helped the U.S. win the 2019 Women's World Cup and the gold medal at the Paris Olympics.

“This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished,” she wrote in an Instagram post Thursday. ""I've achieved nearly everything I dreamed of in this sport and gave all I had to give.

“I'm ready to embrace the life that awaits me on the other side,” she continued. “I look forward to spending more time with my family and being a more present mom.”

Dunn was under contract with Paris Saint-Germain, which said Thursday that both sides agreed to end their collaboration. A versatile player who contributed from multiple positions, Dunn had joined PSG in January 2025 after she left Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League. She made nine appearances for PSG, scoring two goals and providing two assists.

Dunn appeared in 160 games for the United States, scoring 25 goals.

“As one of the first Black stars of the U.S. Women's National Team, especially as a field player, Dunn has long been a role model to many young players of color across the country who aspired to reach the highest levels of the game,” the U.S. soccer federation said in its announcement about Dunn's retirement.



“Dunn's career will be remembered for her versatility,” the federation continued, ""her tremendous one-on-one defending, her ability to perform far above her size (5-foot-1), her popularity among her teammates, her ability to inspire generations of U.S. Women's National Team players and for a heck of a lot of winning.”

Before Gotham, Dunn played for the Portland Thorns, taking most of 2022 off for the birth of her son Marcel. She also had stints with the North Carolina Courage, Chelsea, and the Washington Spirit.","{'href': 'https://www.nbcnewyork.com', 'title': 'nbcnewyork.com'}","soccer"

Malik Tillman was the star of the show for a host of European-based U.S. men's national team players after the first round of the 2025-26 UEFA Champions League wrapped on Wednesday. It bodes well for securing a spot for the World Cup, but competition remains fierce to make Mauricio Pochettino's 26-man squad. 

With the USA's late-March friendlies against European powers Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta now less than two months away, here's how several of the top USA players have fared lately for their clubs:

The rangy Texan's career-best season continues for Juventus; although McKennie's three-game scoring streak in the Champions League ended in a scoreless tie in Monaco on Wednesday with U.S. assistant Miguel D'Agostino in the house, he was singled out for praise by Juve manager Luciano Spalletti last weekend. On social media, McKennie's father credited Spalletti for the 27-year-old's sparkling form this season when posted: ""Wes is the happiest I have seen him in quite some time. Coach has definitely been the difference!""

If there's an American in better form than McKennie right now, it might be Aaronson. The 25-year-old attacker was named man of the match in Leeds' last game, a 1-1 tie at Everton. He's now made seven straight starts for Daniel Farke's side, with three goals and an assist over that span. Pochettino's staff has noticed as chief assistant coach Jesus Perez attended Leeds' 1-0 win over Fulham on Jan. 17.

The towering striker continues to excel for Derby County in England's second-tier Championship, with two goals (and a helper) in his last three league appearances. He now has eight goals in 25 games since arriving from Charlotte FC in August.

Before missing Augsburg's shocking win over German champs Bayern Munich last weekend because of yellow card accumulation, the 19-year-old Hawaii-born Banks started 13 consecutive Bundesliga games. Assuming he reclaims his place, Banks is in line for a March invite — at least — given the USA's dearth of center-back depth after Chris Richards and 38-year-old Tim Ream.

Limited to just four appearances for Atlético Madrid in 2025 because of ankle and knee ailments, Cardoso has started the second half of the season strong. The 25-year-old defensive midfielder has made two consecutive La Liga starts, both of them shutout wins. The New Jersey native also went 90 minutes for the first time this season on Jan. 13 in Atleti's 1-0 Copa del Rey win over Deportivo La Coruña.

With a goal and an assist in Marseille's last two Ligue 1 outings, Weah is rounding into form at just the right time. D'Agostino will travel to watch Weah at the Stade Velodrome on Saturday, when Marseille hosts Paris FC.

With MLS-based center-backs like Ream, Miles Robinson and Walker Zimmerman idle during the domestic league's long offseason, the 26-year-old McKenzie continues to log solid minutes in the French league. He has gone 90 minutes in six of Toulouse's seven games since the start of December.  He even had an assist in Sunday's 2-0 win over Brest.

[The 26: The Latest Projection for the USA's World Cup Roster]

An ever-present player for Middlesbrough when healthy, Morris has been quietly excellent over his 23 Championship games so far. The 24-year-old's tireless defensive work in central midfield is one of the main reasons Boro is on pace to earn automatic promotion to the Premier League this spring.

So what if Tillman hadn't scored for Bayer Leverkusen since November? Netting twice in any game in Europe's top club competition was bound to be looked on fondly by Pochettino and his staff; the 23-year-old's match-winning double qualified the German power for the Champions League knockout stage.

While Pepi remains out with the broken arm he sustained earlier this month, the injury actually increases the likelihood of him moving to Premier League mainstay Fulham before Monday's transfer deadline. With the striker sidelined until March, PSV has little incentive not to cash in if the Cottagers — who submitted an improved $38 million bid for Pepi this week — meet their asking price.

Wright scored back-to-back game-winning goals for Premier League-bound Coventry City earlier this month, breaking a 14-match goalless streak across all competitions with the Sky Blues.

Little has gone right for Downs since the then-20-year-old forward converted the shootout attempt that sent the USA to the Gold Cup semifinals last June. After his 12 goals helped get Cologne promoted to the Bundesliga last season, Downs has yet to score in 17 games split between Southampton and Hamburg so far this term. While 2026 might come too soon for Downs, the youngster remains a top prospect for the 2030 World Cup cycle.

The 2022 World Cup starter is still struggling to gain traction with Atalanta, where he's on a season-long loan from AC Milan. He's played fewer than 700 minutes across all competitions, though he did earn his fifth start of the season in Wednesday's defeat to Belgium's Union Saint-Gilloise. (Musah was subbed out before the hosts' 70th minute winner.)

The defensive midfielder started the USA's October win over Australia and remains a mainstay for Bundesliga side St. Pauli, for which he has played almost 2,000 minutes. He's still probably a World Cup long-shot, though, as his position is easily the USA's deepest.

There's still time for Sargent's impasse with Norwich City in time to facilitate his wish to sign with Toronto FC before Europe's winter transfer window slams shut. Until then, the striker remains as far away from a World Cup place as ever.

As productive as Reyna was for Pochettino in November, it's been a tough start to 2026 at the club level. Before missing Borussia Mochencgladbach's 3-0 loss to Stuttgart last weekend, the 23-year-old attacker played just 25 minutes off the bench in three games since Germany's winter break.

Fulham's handling of Jedi continued to confound. The London club has now started the veteran right-back in eight straight Premier League games since he finally returned from knee surgery and lately, he's looked gassed: Last Saturday, Jedi was subbed less than an hour into the Cottagers' 2-1 triumph over Brighton.

He's been a regular for Celtic since compatriot Cameron Carter-Vickers tore his Achilles tendon in the fall, but the central defender has struggled alongside his team. The defending Scottish champs have won just two of their last five league games, and Trusty was red-carded toward the end of Saturday's 2-2 tie with league-leading Hearts.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

Former U.S. national team goalkeeper Brad Guzan has joined the Atlanta United front office, the club announced on Thursday. Guzan, who retired in October after a 21-year professional career, has been named as Atlanta United's club ambassador and sporting advisor. He'll report directly to Atlanta's chief soccer officer, Chris Henderson.

Guzan, 41, spent the last part of his career in Atlanta. He helped guide the club to their first and only MLS Cup title in 2018. He retired as the club's all-time leader in appearances. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Guzan admitted that he has plenty to learn as he transitions from a life on the field to one that includes office politics and Outlook calendar invites.

Still, Guzan believes that he can add “a unique perspective” to his new role as a former player at the club and a respected international goalkeeper. He'll now be fully immersed in player recruitment, scouting, data and analytics, and youth development.

“I'm learning the ropes and moving forward, I think I certainly can add value to these different areas,” Guzan said.

Guzan will remain heavily involved with his community and charitable work in the Atlanta area. He'll also likely be part of TNT's U.S. national team coverage. Television work has piqued his interest of late, but helping Atlanta United's first team succeed will be his priority. Guzan referred to his former club as a global brand.

“I think when you look at Atlanta United, we're built off of our supporters, we're built off of our fans and the supporters who have made this club what it is,” he said. “And so now I'll be able to get out and spend more time with them, spend more time in the community and continue to increase what Atlanta United is, who we are as a club across not only Atlanta, but Georgia and ultimately the world.”

Guzan joked that adding his input to front office decisions will be a change for him. An imposing figure in goal, Guzan has been the face of the franchise in good times and bad. Having to curtail his competitiveness for an office setting will be part of the learning curve that he hopes to surpass as quickly as possible.

“I think that's probably been one of my biggest fears of moving forward into this side of it,” Guzan said. “There's obviously different rules that you have to play by, as opposed to just yelling at someone who's standing in front of you, maybe not doing their job on the field. You can be a little bit more direct. I think here it's a softer approach.”

Guzan considered other professional opportunities, he said, before accepting this new role with Atlanta United, one he called “a no brainer.”

“There's a lot of things that happen behind the scenes that (reporters) don't see, folks that you guys don't obviously talk to that make a football club run and successful and not just on the field,” he said.

“And so being able to work with people in different departments, see how things are done on their side and learn a bit of the business side of things,” Guzan continued, “the sporting side of things, and see how it all comes together to ultimately have a product of a professional football club? I think seeing different areas of the club through other people's eyes, I think, is hugely important.”

Guzan said that he has not spoken to the front office about the club's struggles over the past five seasons. “I don't have all the answers,” he said. Yet, the last time Atlanta United was at the top of MLS came in 2018. The head coach at the time was Tata Martino. The Argentine has returned, along with his MLS Cup-winning staff, to change the club's fortunes.

“I'm grateful for this opportunity. It just so happens that it does look from the outside that it has come full circle,” Guzan said. “(Martino) leaves (the club) and things maybe don't go the way we all envisioned over the last X amount of years. And now he comes back. I've now transitioned into this side of the building.”

Guzan was a reliable team leader during Martino's first stint. He'll look to have some answers that may align with what will become the first team's new philosophy, following the dismissal of former manager Ronny Deila in October.

“If I can lend any sort of feedback or experience that I've had while here, and say, ‘Tata, while you weren't here, this is where I think we struggled and this is where things kind of went wrong for us.' Or, ‘Hey, I remember in 2018 this was really productive when you were doing XYZ.' I'm totally open. I'm excited to be a part of this going forward. If I could be a benefit and a positive in any way, I'm more than happy to be a part of it.”

According to Meu Timao, Corinthians endured a day of contrasting fortunes on Wednesday. The women's side reached the final of the inaugural Women's Club World Cup, while the men were beaten in their Brasileiro opener.

In the morning in London at the Gtech Community Stadium, Corinthians faced Gotham FC of the United States in the semi-final. Gabi Zanotti scored late in the second half to seal a 1-0 win.

They will meet Arsenal of England in Sunday's final, scheduled for 15:00 Brasília time.

The win also guaranteed a financial boost. Both finalists will receive at least US$ one million, about R$ five point three million, while the champions will earn an additional US$ one point three million, roughly R$ six point nine million, for a total of US$ two point three million, around R$ twelve point two million.

In the evening, the men's team began the 2026 Campeonato Brasileiro with a 2-1 defeat to Bahia at Vila Belmiro. Breno Bidon scored for Corinthians, while Jean Lucas and Willian José secured the win for the northeastern side.

World Cup

Fox Sports will air a record 70 FIFA World Cup games on network television, including every game from the round of 16 through to the final, a strong commitment for the 2026 tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

The 70 games to be aired on Fox doubles the 35 aired on network television during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Most notably, Fox will put more knockout games on network TV than it did in Qatar, when it aired six round-of-16 games on its main broadcast network. All but two knockout games will air on network television. (Two round-of-32 games will air on FS1.)

All 104 games of the biggest-ever World Cup — 48 teams will compete in this version, an increase from 32 in 2022 — will air on either Fox or FS1. All three U.S. men's national team group stage games will air on Fox.

“FIFA is putting on the biggest World Cup in history, and Fox Sports is living up to that standard,” Fox CEO and Fox Sports executive producer Eric Shanks said. “Our broadcast schedule affirms Fox is truly going to be America's home for the beautiful game over a span of 39 incredible days. We look forward to bringing the country together for its 250th birthday with all the world here for the greatest event on the planet.”

The summer will be dominated by soccer, with games spanning more than a month.

Among the group stage highlights on Fox will be a tripleheader on June 16 featuring three of the competition's top stars, with Kylian Mbappé and France taking on African Cup of Nations champion Senegal; followed by Erling Haaland and Norway against the winner of a FIFA playoff; and concluding with Lionel Messi and defending World Cup champion Argentina taking on Algeria.

There is one notable group stage game that will air on FS1: Brazil vs. Morocco on June 13.

With game times set for a global audience, coverage will typically begin in the late morning or early afternoon Eastern Time and run through the night. That includes FIFA World Cup Live shows on Fox and World Cup Today on Fox and FS1.

The World Cup final will air on Fox on Sunday, July 19 at 3 p.m. ET. Live coverage will begin at 12 p.m. ET with a three-hour edition of FIFA World Cup Live followed by a one-hour postgame show.

For the first time ever, Fox will also air a simulcast on its streaming service, Tubi, for both the opening ceremonies and two matches: The tournament's opening game of Mexico against South Africa on June 11 and the U.S.'s opening game against Paraguay on June 12.

The full broadcast schedule can be found here.

Bayern Munich midfielder and German international Leon Goretzka says European teams are emboldened heading to the World Cup.

Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka says United States President Donald Trump “has managed to make us feel not only German, but also European”.

Goretzka, who plays club football for Bayern Munich, in an interview with Die Zeit newspaper published on Wednesday, spoke about the World Cup being hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, and he suggested Germany and other European teams will be the favourites.

“Others have caught up, but in the most important game in the world, we're still ahead of every continent,” Goretzka said.

“Far from being left behind, Europe will show everyone what's what on the field.”

The countdown to the June 11-July 19 football tournament has drawn calls for a boycott. Oke Gottlich, the president of Bundesliga club St Pauli and one of the German federation's 10 vice presidents, last week said the time had come to “ seriously consider and discuss this”.

Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter also weighed in on Monday.

In his X post, Blatter quoted Mark Pieth – a Swiss lawyer specialising in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, who called on fans to boycott the World Cup – and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”

Pieth, who also chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago, had initially been quoted in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.

“I'm aware of the political debates,” Goretzka added. “Still, I expect it to be a great tournament. It will advance football there and convince many people that it's a fantastic game.”

Germany has been drawn in World Cup Group E with Ivory Coast, Curacao and Ecuador.

'Proud' Graeme Lowdon reflects on Cadillac's progress at Barcelona Shakedown

Andrew Shovlin: W17 is getting 'quicker day-by-day'

From tennis stars and Olympic champions to NBA legends and footballing icons, F1 has become a popular outing for elite athletes across many sports – and the feeling is mutual.

Tennis superstar and Friend of F1, Jannik Sinner, is well under way in his Australian Open defence, as he today set up a semi-final match up with Novak Djokovic. Sinner is looking to make it three titles in a row Down Under, as well as securing a fifth Grand Slam title at just 24 years old.

The Italian has helped to bring the tennis and motorsport world together, attending multiple races as part of his role, while also spending time with George Russell, Carlos Sainz, and fellow countryman Kimi Antonelli.

Sinner is a high-profile example of Formula 1 crossing over with other elite sports, but it is far from the only one. Drivers frequently show their love of competition, attending, participating, and sometimes even investing in the sporting world. And with some of the biggest names taking interest in all things racing, let's break down the multitude of sports that crossover with F1...

Sinner became a ‘Friend of F1' in 2023, having made no secret of his love of racing. “One of the main reasons why I love F1 is because I feel there's a lot of synergies between tennis and racing,” he said. “I feel that in both sports it's all about the small details that make a huge difference.”

The obsession is clearly a family affair, as Sinner has complained during post-match interviews of his brother missing his tournaments to attend races instead!

Sinner isn't the only tennis Grand Slam winner to make their love of F1 known, with Djokovic, Serena and Venus Williams, and Roger Federer all drawn to the high-speed entertainment.

Those synergies between tennis and racing have enticed the grid too, with plenty of drivers attending Grand Slams to watch the best of the best. Wimbledon and the British Grand Prix fall at similar times, so every year SW19 becomes a hotspot for F1 drivers. The likes of Russell, Ollie Bearman, Liam Lawson, Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly have all gone to the Championships, while Oscar Piastri attended his home Australian Open courtside last year.

While the paddock may currently be more interested in a different racquet sport, namely padel, a few of them still enjoy the more traditional tennis – Lance Stroll, Sainz, and Antonelli are pretty handy on the court.

A sport as big as football was always going to have a hold on the drivers, but this current grid have taken their love to a whole new level. With the majority of drivers self-confessed fans of various top teams, Pierre Gasly has taken his love of the beautiful game a bit further, investing in French third division side FC Versailles – an exciting passion project for the 29-year-old. He even has the number 10 on his car to pay homage to footballing icon Zinedine Zidane!

It's not just F1 drivers funding football, however, sometimes footballers fund F1. Former Premier League stars Juan Mata and Trent Alexander-Arnold became Alpine investors in 2023. Alexander-Arnold has attended a few races, while other footballing stars who've watched the action include Kylian Mbappe, David Beckham, Ruud Gullit, Mason Mount, Sergio Aguero, and Luis Suarez.

The paddock are definitely better behind the wheel than on the pitch, but they still enjoy a good kickabout, as highlighted in the yearly Monaco charity football game that has seen the likes of Leclerc, Sainz, Hadjar, Gasly and Sergio Perez battling it out. The Mercedes and Aston Martin factories also got involved with a charity game in Brackley in 2025, with the Silver Arrows coming out on top 3-2!

Ever the stunt masters, Red Bull produced an epic F1 x Football crossover, sending new Racing Bulls rookie Arvid Lindblad into Leeds United's stadium to complete football challenges in an F1 car! Some Leeds players attempted to race Lindblad's machinery, before taking on the youngster in a penalty shoot-out.

The newest F1 team on the grid have already played into their American roots by planning an American football crossover like no other. Cadillac have decided to splash the cash on a coveted Super Bowl advert to launch their brand-new livery on February 8th. Make sure you keep your eyes peeled during the broadcast!

The Denver Broncos came up one game short of the Super Bowl, losing to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game, much to the disappointment of Lewis Hamilton. The Briton became a part-owner of the franchise four years ago and has even made it to a few games between American races – although he'll have to wait a little longer for a Super Bowl experience with his team.

With the Miami International Autodrome built around the Hard Rock Stadium, including part of the paddock on the pitch itself, there was always going to be some time for footballing fun. Home of the Miami Dolphins, the stadium always features games and challenges for the drivers to try out on Thursday of Miami race week. The paddock have tested their kicking and catching skills, with the help of Dolphins players, of course. Miami quarterback Tua Tagovailoa even got a hot lap from Piastri – it looked like he had a great time!

The consortium that invested in Alpine featured some of the NFL's biggest names. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce joined a whole host of sportspeople and celebrities who put money into the Enstone outfit, with Mahomes deciding to get a closer look at his venture at last year's race.

There isn't an event quite like the Olympics – so it's no surprise that Olympic sports have a big following in the paddock. Appreciation between Olympians and drivers is reciprocated, with the former increasingly taking in the action trackside over race weekends.

Piastri and Leclerc got a taste of some track and field at the Monaco Diamond League meet in 2025, with the duo meeting pole vault legend Mondo Duplantis after the Swede defied gravity to break the meeting record of over six metres! It seems the world record holder has a need for speed off the track too, swapping pole vault for pole position to present Lando Norris with the Qualifying award at COTA in 2024.

Elsewhere, high jump Olympic champion Mutaz Barshim waved the chequered flag at the Qatar Grand Prix in 2021, four-time Olympic champion Mo Farah has been spotted at multiple race weekends, and track and field power couple Tara Davis-Woodhall and Hunter Woodhall presented the Sprint trophies for the US GP last year. And of course, there's the iconic image from 2017 of Usain Bolt and Hamilton recreating the Jamaican's legendary pose on the podium in Texas.

However, it's not just track and field, with Olympic medallists from all disciplines spotted at races. Judo legend and nine-time world champion Teddy Riner has long been a fan, while skateboard sensation Rayssa Leal stole the show over the Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend last season.

One of Hamilton's closest friends, elite fencer Miles Chamley-Watson, is a regular presence on the seven-time world champion's side of the garage. Hamilton had the chance to return the favour at the 2024 Paris Olympics, sitting front row for the men's foil team competition to watch Chamley-Watson claim fourth with Team USA.

He later posted on Instagram, “I'm so proud of you brother. The challenges you've faced and overcome to get here is nothing short of amazing” – after all, no one understands the dedication, sacrifices and pressure of elite sport quite like another athlete.

It's not just the summer sports that draw Olympic icons to the paddock – winter Olympians have become familiar faces at races all over the world. Three-time Olympic snowboarding gold medallist Shaun White is also a close friend of Hamilton, often attending to show support, while snow stars Lindsey Vonn, Eileen Gu, and Chloe Kim have gotten up close to the action in previous years. For some, snow sports literally run in the family – Australian snowboarder Scotty James has enjoyed plenty of race weekends himself, supporting his brother-in-law, Stroll!

The drivers clearly have a great love and admiration for winter sports too! Many head to the slopes each winter break, but in 2026 it's reached another level. Yuki Tsunoda started off his year strong, showing off his skills in Austria whilst competing in a charity snowboarding event alongside the Alpine Skiing World Cup. Meanwhile, Antonelli had the honour of carrying the Olympic torch through Palmanova ahead of the Winter Olympic Games starting in February in his home country – an unforgettable memory for the Mercedes man.

If there's one sport that F1 drivers love almost as much as driving, it's golf. You'd be hard-pressed to find a member of the grid who doesn't enjoy time on the course – especially when it involves competition. It seems the bragging rights were settled at the 2023 ‘Netflix Cup' ahead of the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix, with Sainz coming out on top alongside his partner two-time major winner Justin Thomas.

But for Alex Albon, it's not just his fellow drivers who put his skills to the test – it's his fiancée! Lily Muni He is a professional golfer on the LPGA Tour – we can only hope he's managed to pick up a few tips from her along the way!

The F1 paddock is also a hotspot for professional golfers, but arguably none more so than the current Masters champion Rory McIlroy, who has not only attended plenty of races in the past, but is also one of the star-studded sports investors in Alpine.

Cycling is another sport that pairs naturally with F1 – not just for the drivers themselves as an effective training method, but the sport as a whole. Despite being two wheels versus four, both demand cutting-edge technologies, engineering and a large focus on aerodynamics. It's no surprise that partnerships exist between F1 teams and pro cycling outfits, with Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe running alongside Red Bull Racing, and INEOS Grenadiers partnering with Mercedes.

Therefore, it was inevitable that cyclists and F1 fans are such big fans of each other's disciplines. Five-time Olympic gold medallist Harrie Lavreysen put Leclerc through his paces around Zandvoort in 2024, finding time to discuss their different approach to steep banked corners – while other cyclists head to race weekends for a more relaxing time.

The drivers have seemed starstruck by the likes of Chris Hoy, Demi Vollering, and Mark Cavendish all causing a stir. One particularly special guest in the paddock was Alex Zanardi, himself an F1 driver between 1991-94 who has since become a four-time Paralympic gold medallist in handcycling after having both of his legs amputated.

For some of the drivers, cycling is less about training, and more about competing. New Cadillac recruit Valtteri Bottas spent time in his ‘gap year' from racing in 2025 lining up for a number of gravel races alongside his partner, professional cyclist Tiffany Cromwell.

Meanwhile, Bearman and Sainz have been relishing their time on two wheels – perhaps helped by heading out for the odd ride or two with their ‘pretty fast' friend, Tadej Pogacar. That's a pretty effective way of getting the cardio in!

Although basketball players and F1 drivers differ greatly in terms of height, they do both share a mutual appreciation of their respective sports. Just last week, Antonelli enjoyed courtside seats to watch the NBA London Game, featuring the Orlando Magic and the Memphis Grizzlies. They even performed a jersey swap before the game!

A few years prior, the French-speaking trio of Leclerc, Esteban Ocon and Gasly soaked in the atmosphere of the NBA Paris game courtside, as they enjoyed the Chicago Bulls' win over the Detroit Pistons.

Some of the NBA's biggest names have made a habit of making viral moments during race weekend – who can forget four-time champion Shaquille O'Neal's iconic appearance at the 2021 US Grand Prix in Texas? McLaren have a special friendship with Golden State Warrior and six-time NBA all-star Jimmy Butler, who blew up online after his hot lap antics with Lando Norris.

Last season, Las Vegas Aces superstar and four-time WNBA MVP A'ja Wilson took advantage of F1 on her doorstep, as she waved the chequered flag for the final race of the F1 ACADEMY season.

Combat sports like boxing are excellent for keeping fit, explaining why numerous drivers have incorporated the sport into their training regimes. Leclerc, Verstappen and Ocon have all been seen with the gloves on, although perhaps with less intensity and risk in their workouts than the professionals.

The biggest MMA fan on the grid is likely to be Red Bull's Hadjar, who has often been spotted near the octagon over the last year. He was at a Professional Fighters League event in Lyon last year, and even met UFC's Khamzat Chimaev before Suzuka, which he was clearly very excited for!

Boxing legends have also taken an interest in F1, with former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua taking in the atmosphere on the grid on several occasion, having also invested in Alpine a couple years back.

The Ashes always draws huge crowds Down Under, and this year was no exception. Honorary Australian Bottas was at the Adalaide test, while the Australian-born driver Piastri attended his hometown test in Melbourne – the McLaren man even managed to meet some of the stars of the Australian side.

The roles have been reversed many times, with some of cricket's very best frequently visiting F1 tracks across the world. Red Bull athlete and hero of the Afghan national cricket team Rashid Khan was at Abu Dhabi last year, gifting a special bat to Verstappen before the finale.

Members of England cricket team also chose to watch the racing around Yas Marina, with the likes of Ben Stokes, Joe Root, and James Anderson in attendance in 2022. Stokes, along with fellow England bowler Stuart Broad, also displayed their love of motorsport by taking part in the Virtual Grand Prix series in 2020, with Stokes getting the better of his team mate around Interlagos.

Almost four decades into her still-vital career, the 2026 MusiCares Person of the Year remains devoted to giving back.


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



Nearly four decades into Mariah Carey's still-vital career, three goals have remained constant for her: to love, heal and uplift.


	“I've always tried to incorporate messages into my songs like ‘Make It Happen' and ‘Hero,' ” says Carey, 56, on a day off from her recent December holiday residency at Las Vegas' Park MGM. “It's just an interesting thing to be able to give back in that way. I didn't grow up with money. And if you grew up like me, it means even more to be able to give back.”


	Carey's long-established commitment to giving back, as well as her prodigious career, will get the spotlight on Jan. 30 when the five-time Grammy Award winner is honored as the 2026 MusiCares Person of the Year. She will join an illustrious circle of prior honorees that includes the Grateful Dead, Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, Joni Mitchell, Gloria Estefan, Billy Joel and Dolly Parton.

	











	“Mariah Carey's influence extends far beyond her remarkable artistry,” MusiCares executive director Theresa Wolters said upon the announcement of Carey as Person of the Year. “She has used her platform consistently to provide tangible support to communities, whether through disaster relief, youth empowerment or programs that help those facing barriers to opportunity. Her work exemplifies the values at the heart of MusiCares: creating systems of care that lift people up and ensure music professionals and communities can thrive.”


	Over the years, Carey has supported various disaster relief efforts, including for victims of Hurricane Katrina and the COVID-19 pandemic, and has championed other causes like HIV/AIDS, education, human rights and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. But Camp Mariah, the youth initiative she co-founded with the Fresh Air Fund — headed today by CEO Lisa Gitelson — was her first charitable project and is still at the heart of all of her philanthropic endeavors.

	











	In December 1994, Carey, a member of the Fresh Air board, performed a holiday concert at The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan — and debuted her now-­classic holiday song, “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” The event raised more than $700,000 to benefit her eponymous annual camp in New York's Mid-Hudson Valley, which launched the following summer, and was further bolstered by a $1 million donation by Carey herself. (Camp Mariah is just one aspect of the work done by Fresh Air, a nonprofit founded in 1877 to provide outdoor experiences for New York children from underserved communities.) The summer component of Fresh Air's multiyear Career Awareness Program (CAP), Camp Mariah's free, three-week experience for children between ages 12 and 15 features traditional activities like sports, swimming and hiking complemented by introductions to career tracks ranging from film and photography to robotics and culinary arts, and a careers class that provides help with résumés and cover letters.


	“It's such a big thing for me because most of these kids have never been outside their own blocks,” Carey says of her camp, which was also the setting for her 1996 “Always Be My Baby” music video. “That's why we keep doing it every year. I go up there and talk to the kids so they can learn about the different things they can do in life.”


	Most recently, Carey partnered with LGBTQ+ advocacy organization GLAAD in early December to auction off her hot pink, rhinestone-­studded “Protect the Dolls” jacket — which she wore during an August performance at Brighton, England's Pride in the Park festival — to support the trans community (it ultimately sold for $5,500).

	











	“All of us should do what we can to give back something,” Carey adds. “And it's also important to do more than that. I get caught up with my schedule sometimes, so it's not as much as it should be. But it's still an important part of my life.”


	As is the prolific, record-setting career that in turn has helped foster Carey's philanthropy — and has also made her a powerful business force in the music industry. Carey became a superstar in 1990 with her self-titled debut album, which featured four No. 1 singles, including “Vision of Love” and “Someday.” Since then, she has amassed 19 No. 1s on the Billboard Hot 100, among them “Hero,” “One Sweet Day” and “We Belong Together.” Her 16th studio album, Here for It All, arrived in September, and became her 19th top 10 entry on the Billboard 200. The album — her first since 2018's Caution — simultaneously landed atop four other charts as well: Top Album Sales, Top Current Album Sales, Top R&B Albums and Independent Albums. After spending the majority of her career on major labels, Carey released Here for It All independently through gamma. and her Mariah imprint.


	Alongside her MusiCares recognition — and not to mention her five career Grammys, including a 1991 win for best new artist — Carey continues to receive industry accolades. In 2025, those included the MTV Video Music Awards' Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, the BET Awards' Ultimate Icon Award and iHeartRadio Music Awards' Icon Award. And she capped the year by adding another record-breaking achievement to her already long list of accomplishments. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” scored its 20th week at No. 1 on the Hot 100, surpassing the 19-week runs of Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus' “Old Town Road” and Shaboozey's “Tipsy (A Bar Song),” in 2019 and 2024, respectively. Prior to “Old Town Road” and “Tipsy,” Carey had held the record for more than two decades with “One Sweet Day,” her 1995 smash featuring Boyz II Men that spent 16 weeks atop the chart. (Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber's “Despacito” tied that mark in 2017.) Asked about the strategy behind how she's continued to level up while sustaining such an influential career, Carey credits a team that includes manager Michael Richardson and Rob Light, her agent and CAA partner/managing director.


	“I've always worked really hard,” Carey says, “because I knew [from the start] that I wanted to be here for a long time. The one lesson I've learned is to just be true to yourself. And I was fortunate enough to be able to do that. There were some things along the way that weren't ideal, you know, but here I am.”

	











	And she's preparing to level up again: Along with Andrea Bocelli, she will headline the opening ceremony for the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on Feb. 6, her first major appearance on that global stage.


	With the Park MGM holiday residency — which grossed $8 million over 10 shows, according to Billboard Boxscore — now behind her, Carey says she's “thinking about doing residencies in different countries in Europe.” Also on tap for her 2026: continuing work on a documentary she's making with Sony Pictures and a long-teased biopic adaptation of her 2020 best-selling memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, with producer-director Lee Daniels at the helm (the pair previously worked together on Daniels' films Precious and The Butler).


	As Carey's holiday residency wound down, global music platform Wax Poetics announced its auction of an ultra-rare, original 1988 demo tape by the singer-songwriter-producer had fetched a winning bid of $54,050. It underscores Carey's legendary status — even if she scoffs at that notion.


	“Everybody has their own little meanings for what things they say,” she says. “But I don't call myself a legend. I'm just still working, still trying hard.”

EXCLUSIVE: Prime Video‘s God of War series has found its Thor.


Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (Severance, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) has joined the cast of Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios' TV adaptation of PlayStation's ancient mythology-themed video game of the same name.


	Thor is the God of Thunder, a mountain of a man who has weathered many a battle in his time, but whose actions in a war fought long ago now haunt his waking hours. Once the loyal soldier of Asgard and his father's right-hand man, Thor is now but a shadow of his former self as he drowns himself in alcohol and tries not to think of the price he paid.  Keeping his wife and children at arm's length has only deepened his isolation, but the power (and danger) of the God of Thunder is still there just beneath the surface.

	











	Ólafsson joins the previously announced series lead, playing Kratos, Ryan Hurst, who previously portrayed Thor in PlayStation's God of War Ragnarök. For his performance, he was nominated for a BAFTA Award.

	From writer, showrunner and executive producer Ronald D. Moore (Outlander, For All Mankind), God of War follows father and son, Kratos and 10-year-old Atreus, as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.


	The cast also includes Teresa Palmer as Phoebe/Sif, Thor's wife and the goddess of family, and Max Parker as Heimdall, the Watchman of Asgard and one of the sons of Odin.

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


Damon Lindelof is getting back into showrunning with a new kidnap thriller at HBO. The Warner Bros Discovery-owned cable network has handed The Chain a straight-to-series order.


	Based on Adrian McKinty's 2019 novel, the project marks the first time that Lost co-creator Lindelof is getting back into the showrunner chair since HBO's Watchmen, which aired in 2019.


	Lindelof, who signed a two-year overall deal with HBO last year, has served as an exec producer on more recent projects including Peacock's Mrs. Davis and HBO's superhero series Lanterns, which is set to come premiere this year.

	











The Chain is an eight-part limited series with Media Res, the company behind The Morning Show, serving as co-studio.

	HBO said Lindelof is “expanding the mythology of McKinty's thriller”.


	The book follows a mother, who is targeted by a dangerous group of masterminds, she must commit a crime to save her kidnapped daughter—or risk losing her forever.


	It follows Rachel Klein, who drops her daughter at the bus stop and heads into her day. But a cell phone call from an unknown number changes everything: it's a woman on the line, informing her that she has Kylie bound and gagged in her back seat, and the only way Rachel will see her again is to follow her instructions exactly: pay a ransom, and find another child to abduct. This is no ordinary kidnapping: the caller is a mother herself, whose son has been taken, and if Rachel doesn't do as she's told, the boy will die. Rachel is now part of The Chain.The Chain has an interesting backstory.

	











	McKinty had written some books but quit writing in 2017 and became a bartender and Uber driver to support his family. Author Don Winslow found out and passed some of his books to agent Shane Salerno, who encouraged McKinty to write The Chain.


RELATED: 2026 TV Series Renewals Photo Gallery


	In 2020, Universal Pictures optioned the book for Edgar Wright to direct it as a movie with Jane Goldman as screenwriter. That never happened, but Media Res subsequently optioned it in 2024 to turn it into a television series.


	The pilot story is by Lindelof, Carly Wray and Breannah Gibson, with Lindelof and Wray writing the pilot script. Lindelof exec produces alongside Michael Ellenberg and Lindsey Springer for Media Res and Shane Salerno with McKinty as co-exec producer.


	“From the moment I heard the wild and original premise of Adrian's book, I was shocked, surprised and angry I hadn't thought of it myself,” Lindelof said. “I've always wanted to try to adapt a great thriller, and this one has all the dark, weird, exhilarating touches that fire up my imagination. I feel so fortunate to reteam with Francesca, Casey and Michael, who first brought me to HBO 15 years ago, and I can't wait to make The Chain a memorable link in their outstanding legacy.”


	Francesca Orsi, EVP, HBO Programming, Head of HBO Drama Series and Films, added: “We are honored by our continued partnership with Damon Lindelof, one of the most singular and distinctive creators of our time. The Chain promises to continue his legacy of dropping us into the pit of the human brain and delivering in ways not only emotionally daring but, ultimately, transformative.”

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Story Kitchen, the production company focused on adapting video games for film and television, is in early development on a Steal a Brainrot movie, alongside the creators of the hit Roblox game.


	Emerging as a breakout phenomenon since its release this past May, Steal a Brainrot sees players attempt to buy, collect, and steal “brainrots” — absurd, meme-inspired characters or items — to build an ever-growing collection, before rebirthing to chase bigger multipliers and rarer drops. With more than 55 billion visits and one of the most engaged communities on Roblox, the game's rise has been fueled by a fast, repeatable loop that turns every session into a mix of strategy, comedy, and chaos. Demonstrating rare event-scale reach, with an all-time peak of 25.8 million concurrent players in October 2025, the its impact has also recently been felt in the real world, by way of a concert this past weekend with Bruno Mars.

	The Steal a Brainrot film will embody the experience's signature combination of chaos, comedy, and competitive mischief, inviting audiences into a fast-paced world where every score can make you rich, every risk can reset your run, and every rival is one move away from taking it all back.

	Story Kitchen is developing and producing the project in partnership with Do Big Studios and Spyder Games. The project is led by Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, Timothy I. Stevenson, and Elena Sandoval, and will be produced in association with Think Influence, which reps the creators of Steal a Brainrot.


	In a joint statement, Story Kitchen co-founders Johnson and Goldberg said, “We're thrilled to bring STEAL A BRAINROT to the big screen.” Signing off with brainrot lingo, they wrote, “Noobini Pizzanini 6-7.”


	Since its launch in 2022, Story Kitchen has quickly become a dominant force in the development of hit games for the screen. Currently, they're spearheading adaptations of Tomb Raider (for Amazon MGM & Netflix), Life Is Strange (Amazon MGM), Teddy Ruxpin (Amazon MGM) and Just Cause (Universal), as well as SEGA's popular '90s games Streets of Rage (Lionsgate), Shinobi (Universal) and Toejam & Earl (Amazon MGM). Additionally, Story Kitchen is shepherding adaptations of acclaimed indie games, including Split Fiction (Amazon MGM), 2021's Game of the Year It Takes Two (Amazon MGM), Sifu (Netflix), and Ruiner (Universal).

	











	Story Kitchen has a first-look deal for television at Amazon MGM Studios and an animated film first-look deal at DreamWorks. The company is repped by WME and Pryor Cashman, and has an exclusive partnership with Moonrock, which facilitated the Steal a Brainrot collaboration.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Amazon accidentally spoils own layoff news","https://www.avclub.com/amazon-sends-layoff-emails-early","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:09:25 GMT","

We'll go out on a limb and say that a big part of having most jobs in the year 2026 is managing the anxiety that you could be laid off at basically any time. The fact that Amazon plans to layoff 16,000 employees is, unfortunately, unsurprising given the state of, y'know, everything. But what would be somewhat novel is the senior vice president of applied AI solutions at Amazon Web Services sending out an email to the staff telling them that some of them had already been informed that they lost their jobs, a day before they actually learned which ones of them lost their jobs. But according to Reuters, that's exactly what happened yesterday. 

The “commiseration email” also came with an invitation to a team meeting, which was promptly cancelled, according to Slack messages viewed by Reuters. The email referred to the layoffs as “Project Dawn” and acknowledged that “Changes like this are hard on everyone,” which was especially true in this case since, reportedly, no one yet knew whether they were among the positions affected. The AWS layoffs would affect the company's retail, Prime Video and human resource departments. The company had previously laid off 14,000 employees in October. 

Amazon did confirm the layoffs in a press release this morning. “We're still in the early stages of building every one of our businesses and there's significant opportunity ahead,” writes senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, Beth Galetti in the message shared to staff, which also details severance pay and things of that nature. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That's not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate. That's never been more important than it is today in a world that's changing faster than ever.”

Court is almost back in session, but this time, it won't really look like court at all. The second season of the quickly-beloved Freevee series Jury Duty will return on Prime Video on March 20, this time titled Jury Duty Presents: Company Retreat. The first three episodes of the series will become available that day, followed by two episodes on March 27, and a three-episode finale on April 6. 

Given that the first season centered on duping Richard Gladden into thinking he was on an actual jury for a real trial, it makes sense to change scenery for the show's second outing. Company Retreat will follow “a corporate offsite event at a family-owned hot sauce company from the perspective of Anthony, a recently hired temporary worker,” according to a synopsis provided in a press release. “Unbeknownst to Anthony, the entire experience is staged, every colleague around him is performing a role, and each moment – whether in conference rooms or during downtime – has been meticulously orchestrated. As the founder prepares to step down, the getaway transforms into a clash between big corporate ambitions and small business values, with control of the company hanging in the balance.”



Prime Video also shared a brief clip promoting the upcoming season, though the streamer is being understandably cagey about what will actually happen in it. The Hollywood Reporter confirms that James Marsden will not be in the cast this season, though he returns as an executive producer. We've also learned that the season was filmed in the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills about a year ago. Otherwise, we'll just have to strap in for whatever ride Anthony is about to go on.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Cairn doesn't hold the answer to sacrifice","https://www.avclub.com/cairn-game-review","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:02:56 GMT","

The latest online trend to cement itself on my Instagram feed is “10/10 bleed out spots.” People, primarily men, record their POV overlooking a lush scenery. A sea of alpine trees. The shore of a lake subdued by snowfall. Riverbanks so clear you can see the fish swimming underneath. You get the picture.

Every video has slight variations. The first few I came across showed the person's feet slowly making their way to the edge of a cliff. They'd then sit down on the ground and adjust the camera's exposure to show the sun in the distance, as “Nutshell” by Alice In Chains accompanied the scene in the background. But others have been taking the bit more seriously, acting out their deaths. Some cough while crawling, or spit fake blood before taking their hand to their chest, simulating a last breath. The acting usually ends the same way: The camera slowly falls to the side, and the frame ends up fixated on the sky or a mountain far away.

Aava, a famous mountain climber and protagonist of the survival climbing adventure Cairn, constantly touts this idea of performative sacrifice. The character is introduced as a devotee of hardships. It is, in her words, all she's ever known—ever since her father put her in front of a climbing wall when she was three, lighting the spark for her lifelong passion. In a moment of seeming stardom after accruing several accolades, Aava sets herself on a journey to climb an expanse known as Mount Kami—a victory that has remained out of grasp for years.

From the moment you leave Cairn's training area, the goal is always in view. You walk on foot until a wall gets in your way, and then begin the ascent. This is done by moving and placing each of Aava's extremities onto the nearest crevice or rock to hold onto, one at a time, with the option to manually do this by yourself or let the game make the selection for you. This repetition pattern is tied to weight and the character's resistance. Grip onto rocks without a solid surface under your soles for long enough, and Aava will start to tremble, eventually losing her grip and falling down.



There are different tools meant to help prevent this outcome. You can place pitons on suitable surfaces, which provide a moment of rest to recover stamina and a checkpoint of sorts in case you do end up falling. When you reach certain areas, usually flat surfaces after a climb or the inside of a cavern, you're likely to find a place to camp. Inside your tent, you can mix ingredients to cook recipes, add tape to Aava's fingers, or sleep to both pass the time and recover health, among other survival-related activities to care for your hunger, thirst, and temperature levels. Depending on your difficulty of choice, interacting with camp sites is the only way to manually save the game, which makes them all the more tantalizing.

Aava's character development occurs in and out of her tent. During particularly exerting climbs, the illusion of tension is almost tangible. Act promptly and correctly to find a stable surface to latch onto, and you can almost picture her muscles relaxing. But the opposite case also yields expression, as she gets audibly frustrated when she falls, proceeding to shout and cuss.

Changing the tape in Aava's fingers in particular became a ritual for me. Half of the time, there wasn't a practical need to do so, as her hands were already set for the most efficient grip. But if I saw just one finger missing tape, I addressed it on the spot. In these moments, the camera changes to first person, and you see the hands up close. You have to select each finger at a time and do a circle animation until it is covered. It's repetitive, but it reveals the physical toll of Aava's efforts, displayed as injuries on her hand.

This cycle represents Cairn as a whole. Once acclimated to the core mechanics, climbs become a series of puzzles to solve, rather than tests of might. Some sections are challenging enough to mirror Aava's frustrations, with me cussing and shouting whenever a foot placement didn't register properly and made me fall to the previous piton—if I had been smart enough to put one, that is. Despite the monotony, however, I remained determined to see it through.

﻿

The problem is that the foundation on which Cairn bases these hardships lacks not only a stronger stability, but purpose, as well. Aava periodically receives voice messages from people back on the surface via an accompanying robot, yet she doesn't actively respond. Her agent asks for updates as sponsors promise deals. Her partner, on the other hand, progressively inquires more about Aava's reasoning to “leave” people behind in order to attempt these dangerous climbs.

One of the first pieces of characterization around the character is a quote from a fictional magazine, in which Aava says, “The best feelings of freedom came to me when I exceeded my limitations.” As you plunge further into the story, it becomes clear that she also finds comfort in the solitude of the climb. Overcoming challenges is important, and it probably is everything she's ever known. Yet, she also shows an impulse to get away from people and pursue an individualistic path, to the point of talking about the thrill of the climb as the only moment she can truly be herself.

My mind first ruminated about Firewatch, recalling protagonist Henry's escapade of becoming a fire lookout after caring for his sick wife. Like Aava, it's a (rather selfish, to put it mildly) attempt to run away from problems. Yet, the theme of death in Cairn becomes ever more pronounced, overshadowing every other lingering thread. Mount Kami has purgatory fame—a newspaper warns of 159 reported deaths on the mountain. Some of these you can confirm during your trek, with skeletons scattered around or people who've recently fallen to their deaths, their bodies dangling from a rock with only their climbing ropes keeping them suspended. You come across letters of people before you find their bodies a couple of hundred meters later.

These sights aren't enough to stop Aava. She spouts a sentence or two before you're given the option to loot a corpse (saying phrases like “you'd have wanted me to take this”). They're less of a warning about a possible fate and more another element that's mere backdrop for her.

But the theme is always a central piece in Cairn, inviting you to think about sacrifice and what it takes to overcome impossible odds. Why do we do things that are bound to cause suffering to us and others? What does it mean to find purpose? As I approached the end, it was clear that Aava didn't know the answer to these questions, nor was Cairn invested in seeing through one of the many threads it unfolded. Instead, this performance of a hero's journey ends just like the others before it, the frame fixated on Mount Kami as the camera slowly falls for the last time.



Cairn was developed and published by The Game Bakers. Our review is based on the PC version. It's also available for PlayStation 5.

Such is the case with Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley's documentary “Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story,” which focuses on a 1) very funny, compelling to watch subject with 2) an open-hearted spirit toward sharing her life and 3) enough ups and downs to frame half-a-dozen documentaries. Add in a litany of talking heads (from Bamford's family to Ted Sarandos, Sarah Silverman to Conan O'Brien, Tig Notaro to Patton Oswalt, and many more), a wealth of archival material, and a final 20 minutes that feel “timely” to the extreme, and the duo's doc feels overstuffed in ways both good and bad.

Think of it this way: “Paralyzed by Hope” is the rare “celebrity” documentary that actually would have benefitted from being split into two parts. What a world!




			Popular on IndieWire		






As a subject, Bamford is a dream: funny (duh), honest, willing to go there, disarming, and genuinely interested in talking about the worst shit she's ever gone through in her life. She never goes so far as to say that the real win of her life has been her ability to share with others, but that's simply baked in to everything she does, from her stand-up comedy to her philanthropy. 

 










Late in the doc, fellow comedian Ron Funches says it best: Bamford's existence is “a true net positive.” She just makes the world better, and Apatow and Berkeley's film endeavors to show just how much that actually means, and how much it really took to get there.

Naturally, the film opens in silly fashion (and that peek-behind-the-curtain breeziness will be missed at certain points), with Apatow rolling up to Bamford's home and slipping her 500 bucks to get chatting. That Bamford might be a bit reticent to share more about her life, despite the open nature of her stand-up act, is understandable, but any nerves are soon put way at ease.

Apatow and Berkeley wisely utilize a raft of talking heads throughout the film — the high stature of many of them makes it plain how important Bamford is in the comedy space (even if, later, they joke about how she's spent decades being painted as the “next big thing”), and their own natural honesty allows them to insightful probe the Bamford mystique. O'Brien remains struck that the anxiety she chats about on stage is real. For Notaro, that level of uprightness is refreshing. Zach Galifianakis similarly marvels at how close Bamford is able to cut to the things that made her. Plenty of comedians can jaw about nerves or bad childhoods, but for Bamford, it's literally not an act.

 










Bamford herself takes us back to her childhood home in suburban Duluth, where she talks about both her relatively “idyllic” childhood and the many facets of it that proved to be very hard indeed. The central four Bamfords — Maria's sister, the also very funny Sarah, is on hand a lot, while archival footage and more recent interviews of their parents are a constant — were a tight group, but her mother Marilyn seemed to loom largest. Marilyn's own mental health struggles not only mirror Maria's (Bamford's eventual diagnoses frame most of the film's second half), but also deeply influence them, particularly the body issues that Bamford developed as a teen.

But Bamford is the last person on Earth to ever cast blame, and so when she opens up about the slow evolution of her various mental health issues, the level of intimacy she affords the audience is staggering. Fans of Bamford's stand-up, of which we are treated to many clips of, spanning decades, will recognize some of her experiences, but she doesn't flinch when talking about everything from suicidal ideation to bulimia, her problems with overspending and the heartbreaking ways in which her OCD rears its ugly head — mostly, through horrific intrusive thoughts that made a very young Bamford worry about what terrible crimes she might commit.

 










The honesty with which Bamford approaches all of this (and, yes, surely you must be sick of reading the word “honesty,” but there is simply no better term for who Bamford is and how she lives) is, as her fellow comedians have told us, real and refreshing and actually unique. Her years of comedy, plus an early foray into violin-based bits, have made Bamford a story- and joke-delivering machine, but it's clear that she still carefully considers what she says and does. And yet, that never makes her feel somehow filtered or at a distance.

You'll laugh! You'll cry! And you'll walk away with a hard-won appreciation for everything Maria Bamford is and hopes to be. Can we get a second part? 

“Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The tension of “Bridgerton” exists, like the tension of all great escapist television, between the push and pull of disappearing into a glamorous world (just for entertainment consumption!) and not worrying too much about some of the darker bits that might flit across our screens. Now in its fourth season, Jess Brownell's smash hit Netflix series (based on Julia Quinn's novels) continues to explore that tension as it tackles its much-anticipated Benedict and Sophie-centric season. This time around: a strong assist by our first leading romantic lady to come from outside the rarefied air of the ton (gasp!).

 










But here's the rub: As former IndieWire editor Erin Strecker wrote last year when Benedict's season was formally announced, the contents of Quinn's novel (her third in the series, titled “An Offer from a Gentleman”) were in need of some, uh, thoughtful tweaking to make it fit for confectionary TV. Just four episodes into this season, the show has mostly stuck to Quinn's original story, with (indeed!) some thoughtful tweaks. Harder to imagine? What will happen in the second half of this season, which is saddled with many of the novel's more, let's just say, uncomfortable twists and turns.

For now, however, the first part of the season mostly succeeds at balancing power dynamics and pulse-pounding romance, with a major assist from the warm and hot chemistry between season leads Luke Thompson and series newbie Yerin Ha. An unabashed spin on Cinderella (with a hearty dash of some “Little Mermaid” for good measure), this season is all about fitting two semi-misfits together, even in the face of annoying politics, wacky misdirection, evil stepmothers, and a cottage literally called My Cottage. (Somewhere, “Heated Rivalry” fans are very confused.)

It's also still wondrously consumable television. (I watched all four available episodes of this season in one go the night before I was set to depart Sundance; I absolutely do not recommend a four-hour-plus binge in the hours before a morning flight, but I couldn't turn the damn thing off.) Most of that is due to the inherent watchability of Thompson and Ha, who manage to feel (and touch) their way through two distinctly different romances, thanks to Benedict's insane inability to recognize the woman he loves when she ventures out without a single scrap of embroidered fabric on her face.

In previous seasons, background Benedict action has set the stage for his long-awaited romance. Something of an odd duck, definitely something of a rake, the sexually experimental (well, for now) second son of the Bridgerton clan has rooted his identity in not quite knowing his identity. He's the spare, essentially, the kind of suitor the debutantes of the ton know by face and by build, if not actual name. (You'd think the Bridgerton naming conventions would help, but alas, everyone seems to know him as just the hot second brother.) It's a champagne problem, but a problem nonetheless.

 










With Anthony (Jonathan Bailey, not yet seen in Season 4) off in India with his wife and newborn son, Benedict is stuck juggling fill-in viscount duties (do we want to invest in copper? who knows!) with his off-hours catting about town. When his beloved, pushy mother Violet (Ruth Gemmell, better with every season) tells him he simply hasn't yet met the right lady, Benedict sighs. But heteronormative and monogamous conventions aside, it's clear something is missing in Benedict's life, and it's not anything that drinks, loose women (and men!), and his artistic aspirations have been able to totally fill. What a perfect time for a masquerade ball!

It's the first big ball of the season (and, notably, the first to be hosted by Violet herself), and Bridgerton House is positively bedecked with finery. Bonus finery: the return of Eloise (Claudia Jessie), Francesca (Hannah Dodd), and John Stirling (Victor Alli) from Scotland (and, yes, their sojourn back to London does get extended, all the better to start queuing up more romantic drama for both sisters). But while all the usual suspects are in attendance, along with newcomers like Lady Araminta Gao (Katie Leung) and her two daughters Rosamund (Michelle Mao) and Posy Li (Isabella Wei), a beautiful stranger approaches. 

While the first half of the season will eventually pile on the Cinderella trappings (even an entire subplot about shoes and how they may or may not fit), the first episode is wisely loosey-goosey on it. We don't even see Sophie (a luminous Ha) without her mask until the second episode, all the better to see her the way Benedict does. 

 










For him? It's love at first sight, as he's instantly taken by the silver-clad lady who seems to be (could this be real?) actually enjoying the ball? That alone is alluring to Benedict, who might act like he's seen it all but can't help but despise that bent in others. And when the two sweep away for a late-night chat on a distant terrace (this unknown lady does not know how to dance, she admits, a pretty important tip as to her actual identity that Benedict never fully processes), the conversation is revelatory for them both.

But when the clock strikes midnight, Benedict's Lady in Silver (as he comes to refer to her throughout the first half of the season) goes running, leaving him forever altered. Half-kissed and unclear about many details of her life (including her name), the second Bridgerton son is so struck by the experience that he dedicates the following weeks to finding this most magical lady. Of course, she is no lady at all, and in the season's second episode, we are granted entry to plucky Sophie's perspective and experience. She's a maid! To the snippy Lady Gao! And while Benedict may have no idea why he can't find the object of his affection nor why they could never be together, Sophie is all too clear on the societal rules that make this all impossible.

Over the course of the series, all of the Bridgerton siblings have struggled to fit into the rigid confines of Regency-era England to various degrees. That nothing is as shiny and flirty and fun as it might seem is baked in, but Season 4 is more comfortable really driving that point home. As Benedict madly searches for his Lady in Silver, Sophie's story unfolds elsewhere, a heartbreaking, decades-spanning tale about power dynamics and class divides. Benedict will learn about all that soon enough, but only when he meets Sophie as herself in the second half of Episode 2.

 










Of the sibs, it's Benedict and Eloise (who, yes, goddamn it, still have a crazy amount of on-screen chemistry for a brother and sister) who can't shake their feelings of being somehow different the most. They're both hung up on not getting married (after three seasons “out” in society, Eloise returns from Scotland to proudly announce she is “on the shelf” and thus committed to never finding her match, while Benedict mostly seems to enjoy the lifestyle of a “rake” too much to give it up), but things keep conspiring against those ideals. Benedict falls in love. Eloise simply can't escape the societal pressures around her (why, she wonders, is everyone always just talking about marriage?). What does it really mean to bilk the system? Is that even possible?

Others in and around the ton are also grappling with such issues, if in private: Violet Bridgerton cannot keep denying how much she wants Lord Anderson (Daniel Francis), Francesca is forced to realize the limits of her carnal (or not so) bond with darling husband John, and even Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) is desperate for a change. Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) worries about being under the queen's thumb. The Mondrichs (Martins Imhangbe and Emma Naomi) are still trying to fit in.

And, yes, if that sounds like a lot of stories, it is. While all of them are in service to the season's bigger questions, they do often detract from time spent with Benedict and Sophie, when the season really comes to life. Benedict's obsession with the fantasy of his Lady in Silver begins to give way to the reality of Sophie the maid (who may not know how to dance, but sure as heck knows way more than any other maid he's ever met), and the pair begin to fall in serious love. But there are secrets between them and some formidable villains lingering (including, yes, society itself), which should add up to some major drama in the second half of the season (hopefully, with the book's ickier situations retrofitted — not just in the name of good taste, but to better develop Benedict as a romantic hero worth rooting for).

 










It ends on a decidedly hot note — the extent of Benedict's sexual escapades may not ever be fully fleshed out here, but we at least get a sense that the man knows a thing or two about another person's pleasure — and with a handful of horrifying revelations and one incredibly ill-conceived request. Benedict doesn't yet know how this world really works, but Sophie does. Can those two worldviews ever really connect? Will Benedict ever realize the two women he's in love with are (luckily!) just one woman? And can the Bridgertons truly buck tradition? 

We may know all those answers (it's a love story, after all), but we can't wait to see what this second half holds, and if “Bridgerton” is ready to mine some darker, deeper tensions in the pursuit of love.

The first four episodes of “Bridgerton” Season 4 will be released Thursday, January 29 on Netflix, with the final four episodes arriving Friday, February 26.

Thundercat is set to release his first album in six years. Distracted is out April 3 via Brainfeeder Records, and includes the single, “I Did This To Myself” with Lil Yachty, along with additional production from Kenny Beats, Flying Lotus, and the Lemon Twigs. The album also features “She Knows Too Much,” a previously unheard collaboration with Thundercat's late friend Mac Miller, plus guest spots from A$AP Rocky, Tame Impala, Channel Tres, and Willow.

Distracted continues the themes of grief explored in Thundercat's fourth album, It Is What It Is, which was partially written about the sudden loss of Miller. “I don't think the heartbreak ever stopped,” the bassist and singer writes in a press release for Distracted. “If it ain't a girl, it's taxes. If it ain't taxes, it's World War III. If it ain't World War III, it's a new update to the phone.”

After much teasing, Jessie Ware has finally announced Superbloom, her first new album in three years. The LP arrives on April 10 via Interscope. Fronting the record is its lead single “I Could Get Used to This,” which came out last week along with a glamorous music video set in a secret garden.

“Since What's Your Pleasure? I've been trying out this fantasy world and escapism,” Ware says of the new album. “I'm not the most by-the-book ‘pop star,' but I do like to play with dress-up, glamour, and fun. While I love dance music, I wanted to dig deeper with this record; to connect with real relationships and appreciate the love I have, and the fears I have of losing it.”

Superbloom follows Ware's 2023 full-length That! Feels! Good!, which was one of the best albums from that year. The tracklist hasn't been revealed just yet, but Ware has shared that Barney Lister and Karma Kid are featured, it's mixed by Ben Baptie, and a still-unreleased track sounds like “Minnie Riperton decided to walk in another Garden of Eden.”

While Superbloom single “I Could Get Used to This” ushers in Ware's grand return as a solo artist, she technically hasn't been silent these past few years. In 2024, she hopped on collaborations with Salute and Romy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Ratboys Are Playing the Long Game","https://pitchfork.com/features/ratboys-are-playing-the-long-game/","Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:54:42 GMT","

Before I can even touch the doorbell, I'm ushered into the warmth of the Ratboys compound, a brick workers cottage from the turn of the century that guitarist Dave Sagan rents with a couple friends and his partner, Julia Steiner, the band's lead singer and guitarist.

Around the perimeter of the living room, all four members of Ratboys are sprawled on sofas and lounge chairs watching Pluto TV's free Vevo channels, a nonstop rotation of music videos not unlike MTV's heyday. From their cushioned islands, they greet me like the close friend who gets a spare key. “You just missed this great Billy Joel live video,” says Steiner. She walks to the kitchen to pour me a glass of water while attempting to relay the piano man's charm. She watched his new docuseries, she explains, and underestimated his sinuous life story. “You gotta admire how he's been at it so long.”

Bassist Sean Neumann and drummer Marcus Nuccio lead the way to Ratboys' longtime basement-turned-practice space, a surprisingly bright room sprouting with gear, a desktop listening area, and a red metallic bunk bed. They've been using the space in Chicago's Montclare neighborhood for eight years, and the memorabilia has piled up: a hasty doodle of Shrek, a banner of Squidward gazing out the Krusty Krab service window. But it's also a time capsule of the band's even longer career: a three-foot-long, handwritten guitar tab for “Go Outside”; a 2022 X-ray of Sagan's elbow, broken while touring in Scandinavia; and Steiner's first-ever amp, a small Roland Microcube that she still busts out.

Ratboys have been making music since 2010, a lifetime in indie rock years. Steiner met Sagan at college in Indiana, where they immediately started writing songs on an old Yamaha nylon-string guitar passed down from her mother; a few months later, the duo tracked the first Ratboys record. After graduating, Steiner and Sagan moved their small operation to Chicago and assembled full-band touring lineups for each album, even if certain members couldn't promise they'd stick around. (For their 10th anniversary, Ratboys published a zine documenting their 10 drummers over the years, including Nnamdï and Dowsing's Mikey Crotty.) Ratboys' longevity feels casually destined; listening back, an old lyric in “Bugs!” reads like the fateful moment it was decided: “The shaman I saw yesterday told me simply, ‘Go.'”

Sixteen years in, Ratboys have passed the usual breakup window for bands with members in their 30s. They can't live off band profits, they've never gotten a big break, they didn't record with a formal producer until just recently—and there's no bitterness about any of it. That's the upside of hearts uncorroded by entitlement or a major label's promise of fame. Around here, Ratboys are known among local bands and stagehands for their Midwestern kindness and good humor, with calloused hands from doing the work. “Nothing is guaranteed in this,” says Nuccio. “That's like rule number one: Rock'n'roll doesn't owe you fucking shit. But anything you can do to stay consistent and grateful, I think that's a winning combo.”

Not only did Ratboys never contemplate breaking up, but the period in which bands with day jobs typically do so—10 to 12 years after forming—was actually a window of rejuvenation. Less than two weeks after releasing Printer's Devil, the COVID-19 lockdown began; the barely used tour backdrop still hangs over a mattress soundproofing their drum kit. But with Nuccio and Neumann officially in the lineup for that LP, Ratboys were hitting their stride and falling in love with being in a band. Trapped indoors, they started a Patreon and a Discord, filmed a livestream series, and rerecorded songs from their debut EP for the celebratory Happy Birthday, Ratboy. “We kept things going in a way that allowed the momentum to build into doing The Window,” says Steiner, “and then luckily that momentum never really stopped coming.”

That pent-up energy comes to a head on Singin' to an Empty Chair, their sixth and best album. These songs have the clarified rush of an emotional pressure change, like the sensation of removing foam earplugs. The first time I spun Empty Chair, I was struck by how strongly their songwriting reminded me of Death Cab for Cutie's ambitious pivot Narrow Stairs: “Light Night Mountains All That” revels in a cacophonous layering process like “Bixby Canyon Bridge,” the jaunty bass introducing “Anywhere” satirizes its lyrics like how “No Sunlight” does, and the ominous progression of “Burn It Down” is the vexed older sibling of “I Will Possess Your Heart.” Maybe it's the dreamlike vocal harmonies between Steiner and Neumann, the freeform guitar solos from Sagan, or the animated prance of Nuccio's drums, but across all 11 songs, Empty Chair sounds like Ratboys finally reaching the truest version of their sound.

To hash out the demos that would become Empty Chair, Ratboys booked a cabin in Richland Center, Wisconsin, in 2024. They tussled with ideas and half-formed songs until finalizing the arrangements, the most divergent of which was the audacious lead single, “Light Night Mountains All That.” After over six hours playing the song nonstop, they'd created a batch of sprawling tendrils they couldn't figure out how to bottle up. Overwhelmed, they started yelling at each other, frustrated and excited to capture the song's potential. “We looked schizophrenic,” laughs Nuccio. “This song felt crazy, but there was something intriguing about it, so we took a day to fully go down the wormhole, mapping it out on papers, figuring out the time change.”

They brought the demos back to Chris Walla, the former Death Cab for Cutie guitarist who's now a coveted producer, to help find their way out of the maze. On Ratboys' previous album, The Window, Walla's attentive and intuitive methods allowed the band to chisel away at its sound to uncover new dimensions. The producer's greatest strength, according to the band, is how he locates the feeling bubbling beneath a song and uncorks its emotional impact. “When writing and demoing songs as the four of us, we're talking about music theory and chord progressions,” explains Sagan, “but Chris refreshed our views by reaffirming our emotional direction.” So Walla shipped some of his personal recording gear from Norway, packed two enormous suitcases, and flew to Chicago promising to help Ratboys capture the Empty Chair they really wanted.

Julia Steiner, Vocals & Guitar

At the urging of Walla, who admired how spacious their demos sounded under the high ceilings, Ratboys returned to the Wisconsin cabin in February 2025. The five of them pushed the furniture out of the living room, loaded in their gear, and settled in for a week of living together while Walla recorded their songs to tape. With no neighbors for miles, Ratboys let it rip. At the time, Sagan was getting antsy to perform live again; Neumann was grieving his dog, who'd just died; Nuccio's full-time job was downgraded to a freelance position, then evaporated entirely; and Steiner had begun seeing a therapist, seeking support amid her parents' recent divorce and cracks surfacing in her family life. The simple rhythm of those Wisconsin days—cooking meals together, fleshing out songs, rattling the windows during rehearsals, watching Kids in the Hall to wind down—became an emotional reset.

Committed to emphasizing live takes, Ratboys learned to appreciate the imperfections in these recordings. A gust of wind howls in the background of “Strange Love,” a demure song fit for an old-timey diner, and makes Steiner and Neumann's harmonized coos even fuzzier. Instead of waiting for the perfect take, they started pursuing fleeting ideas in the moment. After recording “Penny in the Lake” nearly 18 times, it was the first recording of day six—in which Nuccio impersonates a rooster greeting the sunrise—that finally rolled its shoulders back and nailed the lackadaisical twang.

The real magic of Empty Chair was captured at Electrical Audio, the late Steve Albini's studio back in Chicago. Neither Ratboys nor Walla had stepped foot in its hallowed halls before, so they gorged on its offerings: booking time in both studios A and B, jamming extensively to see where loose ideas concluded, working giddily with engineer Taylor Hales. Ratboys planned to record a plump bass note on a synthesizer or a guitar pedal for the intro of “Open Up,” but Walla and Hales brainstormed an alternative method: drag a dozen snare drums into the room and mic them rattling after a bass note instead.

“Using equipment that wasn't an instrument in a musical way was so fun and inspiring,” says Sagan. “Each song has a little element of sound design in addition to its straight-up recording. Maybe we're the only ones who can notice it, but it helped us get the feeling we wanted.” A damaged pocket piano doubles as a shaker in “Light Night Mountains All That,” a wireless radio revolving on a turntable creates a Doppler effect in “What's Right?”, and a microphone spins around the room like a lasso to record an acoustic guitar in “Burn It Down.” Sagan used the ominously labeled “hell guitar” at Electrical Audio—a 16-string guitar with every string tuned to the same note—to pepper chaotic, loud strums into “Light Night Mountains All That,” which were then reversed and treated.

Ratboys sound youthful and raw, like they placed themselves in the moment while tracking each song. A large chunk of that spiritedness rests on the rhythm section, where Neumann steadily adds a flair and Nuccio picks up the pace behind his kit. While there's a little studio trickery, like a drum part taped at a slower tempo but sped up to the BPM in the recording, the rest was due to a perspective shift. “For a couple years in indie rock now, there's been a trend of very dry, dead, low-tuned drums that are quiet and muted,” says Nuccio. “Chris [Walla] saw that and said, ‘Let's be honest to our pop-punk roots.' So we did some unique drum treatments, like replacing the heads on the drum set, which were thin and clear, with these thick and coated heads that give it a snap, a lively sound. Motown is the same way.”

Marcus Nuccio, Drums

Before you can get the perfect take, you have to be able to lock in, and Ratboys are quick to credit Walla as an observant producer who recognizes the parameters of each member's comfort zone and helps them recreate it. Whenever Steiner entered the vocal booth, Walla noticed she would grab an object, usually a wheel of gaff tape, and fidget with it while singing. Rather than joke about it, he encouraged her to use it as a resource. “He was so perceptive and supportive,” recalls Steiner. “Eventually, when it was time to do a vocal take, Chris wouldn't even say anything. He would just hand me the roll of tape, like, Off you go.”

Over email, Walla gushes about his time working with Ratboys. “Some [bands] are fractured and tormented and ultimately unsustainable, and the discord fuels the work until it doesn't,” he explains. “Some are blissful and lucky and just happy to be there. Ratboys work because they work. Dave and Julia's chemistry has a perpetual-motion-machine quality to it, and Julia also knows how to lead a band; she's so clear and consistent, and she's always got the goods. And holy cow she's leading a great band.””

When we resurface outside, we're thrust into Chicago winter: fluffy snow banks covering the grass, sidewalks slicked in ice, sharp wind redistributing the topmost layer of snowflakes back into the air. We shuffle past Ratboys' shiny, newly purchased used camper van—its blinker needs fixing—and toward a well-worn SUV covered in snow. Sagan brushes off the windows and we all squeeze in. On the drive, they trade stories like tour guides, pointing out a neighborhood allegedly run by the Italian mob, a graffitied bridge in the woods where they smoke like high schoolers. In a city with two notoriously ill-fated baseball teams, Ratboys are split down the middle: two Sox fans, two Cubs fans.

We arrive at our destination: Gene & Jude's. The old-school sign glowing atop the building beckons us inside, like some insignia of fast food proselytization. Built in 1950, the retro hotdog joint is the epitome of no-frills: Depression dogs and French fries, with toppings limited to mustard, relish, onions, and sport peppers. No ketchup; no seats. We eat standing up at the wraparound counter and revive our sports convo as a crew of construction workers ambles inside. Apart from her lifelong patronage of the Steelers, Steiner explains, she and her bandmates are Chicago-pilled through and through: Bears, Bulls, Blackhawks. As we talk at length about the Sox, it becomes clear they love the team not despite its foibles or financial pitfalls, but because it can't help but carry on. You can love a losing team knowing there's always next year, or you can be glad they're here hustling in the present.

Sean Neumann, Bass

We relocate to Hala Kahiki Lounge, a sprawling tiki bar down the street that's over 60 years old, and Steiner opens up about some of the wounds she nursed while writing this record. For the past several years, she's been struggling to process the sudden estrangement of an unnamed relative. She attended therapy, a first in her life despite growing up with a psychiatrist father, and found the experience “revelatory”—particularly when her therapist suggested she try the empty chair technique. The premise is straightforward: find a private space, sit down, and talk to an empty chair opposite you while envisioning the person with whom you'd like to have an honest conversation. Back in her bedroom, Steiner blocked out time on her calendar, hit record on a voice memo, and started talking. What spooled out was a frank confession of hurts, cherished memories, and moments when she'd sought clarity. “Listening back, I had this appreciation for the past while also not excusing any transgressions that have happened, and was hoping for possible reconciliation,” says Steiner.

That's the roadmap that would inspire Empty Chair. It begins with “Open Up,” in which a calm Steiner encourages someone to resume a long-paused conversation. “I won't go,” she sings softly. “I'm listening.” It's the most work Ratboys have poured into seeing their ideas through, and the epiphanies—and equally memorable regrets—match the mood of a weight being lifted. Memories flash by in rapid succession in “Just Want You to Know the Truth,” where Steiner lays her heart bare for her estranged relative: “It's not that I don't miss you/Or the way it used to be/It's that I can't live my life/Without sayin' anything.”

Unless her future self thwarts the plan, Steiner will mail a copy of Empty Chair to her estranged relative in hopes of reconciliation. “It feels a little bit strange to admit this, but part of this record, for me, was a bit utilitarian, almost like a communication tool,” she says. “Maybe this is taking the easy way out, but having the opportunity to send it as an olive branch is a way to talk without talking.” Steiner takes a deep breath, flushed with nerves and a dash of guilt, and looks around the table at her bandmates. “I'm grateful that y'all were patient enough with me to let it happen naturally, because it took a long time.”

Steiner's bandmates rush to reassure her that it was never a question, that it was more than worth it; it's a centerpiece of Empty Chair and their long journey of Ratboys overall. For the next half an hour, they share their favorite memories from the album sessions: Sagan's timeless guitar solos, Steiner's idea for the tracklist, Neumann's smooth vocal harmonies, Nuccio's creative use of synth. On Empty Chair, it all comes together to leave the lasting impression that everything will work out if you surround yourself with loved ones. “That building of trust has always been strengthening, and that helps our anxious minds know that it's going to be okay,” says Neumann.

As we pile back into Ratboys' SUV and Sagan once again clears snow from its windshield, Steiner turns the radio to their favorite station, an oldies channel that plays only music recorded prior to 1970, with one exception: Cher's “Believe” on Saturday nights. The conversation turns to the Bears, who play the Rams this weekend following their first NFL playoff win in 15 years. They haven't looked this good in a long, long time. The air in Chicago is charged with a belief that anything can happen. Some would advise against that kind of hope, especially for a sports fan, but why deny yourself the possibility of a dream fulfilled? It's one of the best feelings in the world.

Stephen Miller's tenure as the Trump whisperer is the worst run for a White House aide in American history. 


	The president's most trusted adviser has pushed the country to the brink with his draconian and now tragically deadly policies. America has not seen anything like this in living memory. Miller has turned ICE into a de facto secret police force and unleashed them around the country. He has pushed to have the U.S. military operate in city streets. He has questioned bedrock American jurisprudence by suggesting suspending habeus corpus for migrants — which would effectively allow the administration to haul away and detain anyone without making a case. His conduct inside and out of the White House, where he serves as deputy chief of staff, has made him a fearsome adversary to any who oppose his extremist views. Over the past year, Miller has ushered in a domestic reign of terror like no other unelected official and in doing so has earned a place among America's most loathsome characters. 

	











	Trump was elected, in part, to get a handle on illegal immigration and the border. It must be said that to a large degree, in this, the president has succeeded. Illegal immigration has been curtailed, and stories of chaos at the Mexican border (at least in the northerly direction) have faded from the headlines. Instead of declaring victory, Miller went on a blitz. He, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and the recently cashiered Border Patrol commandant Gregory Bovino deployed masked immigration enforcement operatives on raids to sow fear, loathing, and conflict on America's streets. Now two American citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, lie dead, shot and killed by federal agents in entirely avoidable and unnecessary uses of deadly force. Miller disgracefully slandered both the dead Good and Pretti as domestic terrorists out for blood despite evidence to the contrary. 


	Going back a decade, Miller has always been the most devoted Trump servant. Miller, an Iago-like character, shares one of the president's few core values: a rigid nativist worldview. During Trump's first term, serving as a senior adviser, Miller was the rare aide to survive multiple purges. His unwavering loyalty to MAGA and his penchant for vitriol online or on Fox gave him entree into Trump's inner circle. He seems to have spent the four years of Biden's presidency crafting how to become the ultimate authoritarian apparatchik. Enacting Trump's policies became Miller's goal and personal passion. Thus Trump 2.0 has been “a blast for Stephen,” a fellow White House adviser told Rolling Stone.

	A good time has not been had by all.


	In the aftermath of Renee Good's killing, Miller went on Fox and encouraged ICE agents to have no fear of retribution for their actions enforcing his policies. “To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties, and anybody who lays a hand on you, or tries to stop you, or tries to obstruct you, is committing a felony,” Miller said on Fox. “You have immunity to perform your duties and no one — no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist — can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.”


	Not surprisingly, telling ICE they had a free hand led to more violence, and another avoidable death.


	The damage from Miller's grand designs are plain for all to see. The nation is more divided than ever. Americans' mistrust and hyper-partisanship has grown only more poisonous. The country feels like a tinder box and Miller and ICE are running around with lit matches.


	Miller and Trump's might-makes-right approach is brazen and profoundly un-American. Even as the nation has failed and failed again to live up to its lofty ideals, the arc of its history has mostly bent toward reform and justice. Miller appears willing to throw all that aside to enact his fever dream of an immigrant-free America, an ethno-state that never was.

	In Miller, Trump definitely found what he had long sought: his own Roy Cohn. A man so ruthless and power-mad who is willing to be hated by all, if that means winning. There's now little doubt that like Cohn, Miller will go down in the history books as a deeply weird and unusually vile miscreant, bent on nothing but destroying his enemies and the naked abuse of whatever power he can grab.


	For the past year, Donald Trump has let Stephen Miller loose on the country. It has not gone well. A federal agency has been changed into a Stasi-like police force turned on its own people. Blood has been shed. ICE is now reportedly using sonic weaponry on protesters. Does anyone believe Miller will change his ways after the deaths of Pretti and Good? He is undoubtedly plotting some new action to strike back against his enemies — who he seems to think are his fellow Americans. Whatever else he is, Miller is a fighter. But Donald Trump need not stand behind him. Trust in the administration is broken and can't be fixed with Miller there. For the good of the nation, and the rest of his second term, the president must fire and rebuke Miller. Anything less, and we will continue down this ruinous path, with no end in sight.

	When Travis Scott thinks back on all the music that has helped shape his life, he quite literally thinks about Kid Cudi's “Soundtrack 2 My Life.” The rapper and Rolling Stone cover star sat down to explore the music that has left the most meaningful impressions on him for Rolling Stone‘s My Life in 10 Songs video series, citing Kudi, Björk's Volta track “Wanderlust,” Fun's soaring “We Are Young,” and more. 


	Scott begins his list with Aphex Twin's “Cow Cud Is a Twin,” which he stumbled upon while watching Chris Cunningham videos (who has directed videos for the British musician) with a friend from school who listened to garage and punk music. Next, Scott recalls how the music video for “Wanderlust” changed his life, saying, “It ruined my day in a good way. Nothing got done. I was like, What the fuck?” While he knew of Björk, he credits the song for making him a fan.


	“33 God” by Bon Iver also makes the cut, and Scott calls frontman Justin Vernon, who has inspired him since he was a kid, “one of the greatest artists to ever live.” The rapper points out that Vernon worked on Utopia, which debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200 chart. “You've got to dive in on Utopia,” advises Scott. “There's a lot of my favorite people that I work with or inspire me since day one.”

	Scott also points to Fun's “We Are Young,” reflecting, “I feel like everybody heard it at the same time. … I think that song is the pinnacle of everyone's soul — the beat, everything, is how everyone feels as soon as the sun goes down.”

	











	Scott then moves to “Retrograde” by James Blake, who was one of the first people he met in L.A. “Everything he does, from his live performances, the way he makes music, his beats, vocals, everything — dude is a genius,'” states Scott.


	Before introducing his next track choice, Scott chuckles and says, “Can't Tell Me Nothing” by Kanye West. “That song embodies every young, old, full-of-spirit person that you know got something they want to go for,” he says.


	The beginning to the final part of “Soundtrack 2 My Life” left such a lasting mark on Scott that by the time the song ended, he felt like he and Cudi “were like brothers.” Scott, who was in high school when he first heard the track, says seeing audiences resonate with Cudi's music gave him the confidence to tell his own narrative. “I was like, OK, people will hopefully understand what I got — the story I gotta tell,” Scott recalls thinking at the time. Scott was also drawn to Portishead's “Western Eyes,” which prompted him to question “why rappers didn't rap on that type of rap.”

	Second to last on the list, Scott naturally embraces “Impossible” off his 2015 debut Rodeo, likening the song to ecstasy and DMT (Dimethyltryptamine) — though not the drug, just the feeling that people chase. “When I hear that shit, it's like, that's the release I get,” says Scott.


	To close out his list, Scott tips his hat to “Mo City Don” from Z-Ro. “That our national anthem from where I'm from,” says Scott, a Houston native. “He's a Mo City legend,” adds the rapper, “Never forget that.”

James McAvoy and a recent Emmy winner have been cast in Faith, a supernatural movie helmed by an award-winning director.

Per Variety, McAvoy and Erin Doherty will headline Faith, the seventh movie from Paul Andrew Williams.

“Faith follows Gina, a hard-working and devoted single mother who meets a quietly enigmatic stranger, Michael,” the official synopsis reads. “The presence of someone who appears to care for her brings a new and exciting dynamic to her life, despite the fact she knows nothing about him or what his intentions towards her really are. Is he a friend, a potential lover or something more sinister? When Gina's life is abruptly turned upside down and Michael's extraordinary true identity is revealed, she learns that she might just be able to embrace the beauty of living life fully again.”

Faith also stars Liv Hill (The Little Stranger) and Smylie Bradwell (Hamnet).

Faith is now shooting in the U.K. Bankside Films and Logical will handle international sales. Producers include Dominic Tighe and Danny Page. Blazing Griffin, Logical, and Homefront Productions will finance Faith.

For McAvoy, the X-Men: First Class actor recently made his directorial debut in California Schemin', a music biopic about Scottish hip-hop duo Silibil N' Brains. After premiering at TIFF in September 2025, California Schemin' will be released in the U.K. on April 10, 2026.

As for Doherty, it's been a banner 12 months following the success of Adolescence. For her role as Briony Ariston, Doherty won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for supporting actress. 

Williams is best known for directing 2025's Dragonfly and 2021's Bull. Williams also directed multiple episodes in Season 3 of Broadchurch.

“Faith is a deeply personal story to me,” Williams said in a statement. “Telling a story of strength and hope, set in a known reality yet shadowed by something other worldly that we can't quite explain which is guiding us through life.”

Revolt Gallery cracks open their doors for “Oracles of Repression and Return”, the first solo exhibition by Taos-based multimedia artist Caroline Yezer. The show opens Friday (Jan. 30) from 6–9 pm, with Yezer in attendance and runs through Feb. 27.

Part revenge fantasy, part religious hallucination, “Oracles of Repression and Return” imagines what happens when the so-called “minor” figures of Victorian literature, myth, and folklore return sharpened, embodied, and ready to bite back. Yezer imagines supernatural femmes, queer messiahs, witches, monsters, and human-animal hybrids returning to reclaim power, rewrite history, and dismantle the systems that erased them in the first place.

Moving between ceramic, sculpture, video, and works on paper, Yezer builds thrones and bodies for an alternate order — one that asks who gets to rule the future and which bodies are branded “dangerous” right now. Her cast includes cat ladies, crones, vilified women, and gloriously gender-troubling creatures, avatars for queer, noncompliant lives under increasing attack.

By reworking found objects into vessels of return, Yezer dares viewers to invent their own saviors and deploy them against the dominant scripts of gender, class, race, colonialism, and Western exceptionalism. The takeaway is blunt: we're caught inside systems of extraction, but we're not helpless.

Based in San Cristobal, New Mexico, Yezer folds a background in cultural anthropology and Latin American Studies into her practice. Years of ethnographic fieldwork in Peru's Ayacucho region during the Fujimori dictatorship inform her belief in rumor, folklore, and gossip as quietly radical forces. Pulling references from Victorian novels, Baroque excess, Judeo-Christian and Andean myth, The Wiz, and Pee-wee's Playhouse, she weaponizes wit and spectacle to short-circuit authoritarian logic and lay its absurdities bare.

As an academic and artist, Yezer digs into myth, rumor, and gossip as double-edged forces — capable of destabilizing power just as easily as being weaponized by fascists. If art can sharpen consciousness, she argues, then it can also help us rebuild ourselves and our communities while the ground is still shifting.

Yezer currently works as a non-credit instructor/studio monitor in the Art Department at UNM-Taos where she is also earning her Associate Degree in Studio Art.

FYI

“Oracles of Repression and Return” is the first solo exhibition by Taos-based multimedia artist Caroline Yezer. The show opens Friday (Jan. 30) from 6–9 pm, with Yezer in attendance, and runs through Feb. 27.

AI helped researchers probe the Hubble Space Telescope's archive to find strange celestial objects, including some indescribable by science.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has uncovered more than 1,000 strange cosmic objects in the Hubble Space Telescope's image archive, including some that cannot be explained by science.

After searching with the tool for just two days, researchers found 1,300 oddball objects, including chaotic merging galaxies, stars trailing gas, and even some objects that haven't been classified yet. Of these, 800 had never been spotted before, European Space Agency (ESA) officials said in a Jan. 27 statement. The findings were published Dec. 16, 2025, in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

""Additional discoveries included galaxies with massive star-forming clumps, jellyfish-looking galaxies with gaseous 'tentacles,' and edge-on planet-forming disks in our own galaxy resembling hamburgers,"" NASA officials said in a separate statement. “Remarkably, several dozen objects defied existing classification schemes entirely.""

For the new study, ESA research fellows David O'Ryan and Pablo Gómez developed an AI tool to examine 100 million image cutouts from the Hubble Legacy Archive, which covers the telescope's observations following its 1990 launch. Each of the images was only a few dozen pixels per side, representing a narrow slice of sky barely a thousandth of a degree wide.

""Archival observations from the Hubble Space Telescope now stretch back 35 years, providing a treasure trove of data in which astrophysical anomalies might be found,"" O'Ryan wrote in the paper.

In addition to the ""jellyfish galaxies"" and cosmic ""hamburgers,"" the search uncovered a range of other phenomena. ""Most of the anomalies were galaxies undergoing mergers or interactions, which exhibit unusual morphologies or trailing, elongated streams of stars and gas,"" according to the NASA statement. ""Others were gravitational lenses, where the gravity of a foreground galaxy distorts spacetime and bends light from a background galaxy into arcs or rings.""

 




The researchers' AI tool, called AnomalyMatch, picked up these features after learning patterns from a training dataset. Using tools like this speeds up the traditional means of discovering strange things in the sky, which usually requires manual inspection or a lucky observation.

""While expert astronomers excel at identifying unusual features, the sheer volume of Hubble data makes comprehensive manual review impractical,"" NASA officials said in a statement. ""Citizen science initiatives have helped expand the scope of data analysis, but even these efforts fall short when faced with archives as extensive as Hubble's.""

""This is a powerful demonstration of how AI can enhance the scientific return of archival datasets,"" Gómez added. ""The discovery of so many previously undocumented anomalies in Hubble data underscores the tool's potential for future surveys.""

More datasets where AI may be useful include those from the Euclid space telescope, which is surveying billions of galaxies to create the largest 3D map of the universe ever, and the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Telescope and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which will hunt for exoplanets and moving objects across vast stretches of the night sky. AI could help researchers sort through the ""data deluge"" from these large surveys, perhaps allowing for faster pickups of new objects than ever before, according to the NASA statement.

            President Donald Trump did another social media posting spree on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. As with Trump's previous posting blitzes, this one was filled with wildly inaccurate and often conspiratorial claims about elections and other subjects.
    


            Here's a debunking of two of them.
    


            Trump twice shared a video titled “California Governor PANICS as Walmart Shuts Down 250+ Stores Across State.” The video, echoed by the text in one of the posts Trump shared, claimed that Walmart is preparing to shut down these stores because the retailer can't afford California's “$22” per hour minimum wage.
    


            But California's statewide minimum wage is $16.90 per hour, not $22 – and Walmart told CNN on Thursday morning that it isn't conducting a massive store closure in California for any reason.
    


            “This isn't accurate information,” a Walmart spokesperson said. “In fact, we actually just recently opened a new store in California.”
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office posted on social media on Wednesday night expressing disbelief that Trump had promoted both the false claim about Walmart – “Walmart's 303 stores in California are open,” Newsom's office wrote – and an even wilder but equally fake anti-Newsom conspiracy theory the president also shared during the social media blitz.
    


            Newsom's office wrote: “We cannot believe we have to say any of this out loud. We cannot believe this is real life. And we truly cannot believe this man has the nuclear codes.”
    


            The phony claim about Walmart shutting hundreds of California stores was previously posted on a YouTube account that appears to have been devoted to sensational but inaccurate videos attacking Newsom.
    


            On Thursday, Newsom's office provided CNN with a screenshot from the YouTube account, which an aide said was taken Wednesday night, that showed the account had posted numerous highly similar recent videos making sensational false claims about life in California under Newsom.
    


            By Thursday morning, almost all of the anti-Newsom videos had been deleted from the account.
    


            Multiple posts from Trump on Wednesday night and Thursday morning made false claims about elections, including conspiracy theories about the 2020 election the president wrongly insists was stolen from him. One particularly preposterous post Trump shared outlined a (nonexistent) vote-flipping conspiracy involving former President Barack Obama, the FBI, the CIA, China and Italian officials.
    


            Other posts made claims that were more straightforward, but no less false. For example, Trump twice shared posts claiming that Wisconsin has more than seven million registered voters, millions higher than its total number of adults; one of the posts said, “This is not a glitch; it is election fraud waiting to happen!”
    


            But Wisconsin does not have anywhere close to seven million registered voters. The website of the Wisconsin Elections Commission says, “The State of Wisconsin had 3,602,958 active registered voters on January 1, 2026.”
    


            The commission told CNN on Thursday that the state also has about 4.6 million inactive voters – people who died; moved away and registered in another state; were convicted of a felony; were adjudicated incompetent to vote; or were purged from the voter rolls due to inactivity – but that “inactive voters are not considered registered voters” and “would have to re-register before voting.”

The Senate on Thursday failed to clear a key procedural hurdle on a crucial government funding package, with a shutdown set to begin on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET. 

The procedural vote on the six-bill package was widely expected to fail as Democrats demand that the Republican majority strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security from the measure. Democrats want new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement after agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens this month in Minneapolis. 

The vote was 45-55, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in filibustering it. Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., voted no to reserve a motion to reconsider. The vote increases the likelihood of a government shutdown this week and will likely send Senate Republicans into negotiations with Democrats to find a solution.

In addition to Homeland Security, the package that failed would also fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education. Spending measures need at least 60 votes to avert the Senate filibuster. 

""Democrats are ready to pass five bipartisan funding bills in the Senate,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the floor on Thursday. ""We're ready to fund 96% of the federal government today, but the DHS bill still needs a lot of work.""

Altering the bill, including stripping DHS, would require the House of Representatives to vote on it again. The House is out of Washington on recess.

Republicans on Wednesday began opening the door to avoiding a shutdown, expressing a willingness to strip the DHS bill and continue negotiations while clearing the way for the rest of the package. Thune said Democrats are negotiating with the White House on a way forward.

""Let's hope it lands,"" Thune told reporters Thursday. 

""There's a path to consider some of those things and negotiate that out between Republicans, Democrats, House, Senate, White House, but that's not going to happen in this bill,"" Thune said.

Svalbard's polar bears are showing remarkable resilience to climate change

These polar bears appear to be maintaining their physical health despite the loss of sea ice—their preferred hunting grounds

Polar bears are the poster children of climate change—and for good reason. These giant bears hunt, mate and spend their days hanging out on Arctic sea ice, which is rapidly disappearing as the climate warms. But some polar bears, it seems, are far more resilient than we realized: new research suggests that in one region, the bears are adapting to the declining sea ice.

Researchers took more than 1,000 body measurements from 770 polar bears over 24 years around Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Barents Sea—an area that has seen an especially acute decline in sea ice over the decades. By 2019, the region's annual sea ice season shriveled to more than two months shorter than what it was 24 years prior.

Yet the bears showed no decline in their body condition between 2000 and 2019—even as sea ice in their area disappeared. The findings were published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.

That flew in the face of what Jon Aars, a senior researcher at the Norwegian Polar Institute and lead author of the paper, and his team expected. They hypothesized that the Svalbard polar bears' health would wane over the study period. Tracking each bear over the ice with helicopters and periodically darting them to take body measurements on the ground, the researchers were able to estimate the animals' overall physical health—a metric called body condition index, or BCI.

Researchers record the mouth measurements of an anesthetized polar bear. Recapture of bears marked in previous years is important for obtaining accurate data on survival and reproduction.

To Aars's surprise, the polar bears were in “fairly good” condition, even recovering from a drop in BCI from the 1990s to 2000—the opposite of what he and his team had anticipated.

That's not to say the bears were totally unaffected by the loss of sea ice; some had relocated den areas or shifted their habitats north to follow the receding ice, Aars says. And of course, it's hard to know whether the polar bears would be in even better condition if it weren't for climate change.

While what the team observed on Svalbard may be “useful” for studying other areas with similar ecosystems, Aars cautions that the findings don't mean that all the tens of thousands of polar bears across the Arctic are in equally good shape.

Still, what gives? Why are the Svalbard bears doing so well? Aars and his colleagues aren't sure, but they think it may have something to do with changes in the polar bears' diet. It could be that, with less ice, seals “aggregate” on the ice that remains and are thus easier to hunt or that the bears are relying more on walrus carcasses or reindeer for food.

Three polar bear cubs gather around their tranquilized mother. She had a litter of three cubs — an unusual brood size — and the smallest cub only weighed five kilograms.

Lori Quakenbush, a researcher at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Arctic Marine Mammal Program, who was not involved in the study, says that polar bears are “part of a ‘complex relationship' that includes habitat, multiple prey species, their ability as predators and their ability to store energy.” The new findings are similar to separate observations of a group of bears off Alaska and Russia, the Chukchi Sea subpopulation, which has similarly held strong despite “substantial” sea ice decline, she says.

“With continued monitoring of these and other subpopulations, we will likely learn more about the capabilities of polar bears as a species,” Quakenbush says.

While resilient, polar bears' futures remain uncertain. It's unclear what Svalbard will look like in five, 10 or 20 years, Aars says. Someday the polar bears might hit a tipping point—and with continued sea ice loss, the bears' condition will eventually decline.

“But the good news is that we are not there yet,” he says.

Apple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they've recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.

​As first reported by Reuters, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the live translation capability introduced last year. 

The company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.

The Financial Times reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple's second-largest acquisition to date, after buying Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014. 

​Notably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he sold PrimeSense, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple's transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.

Q.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. ​Its founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.

The news comes a few hours ahead of Apple's first quarterly earnings, in which analysts are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It's also expected to be the company's strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.

Silicon shield will remain with Taiwan.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, has rebuffed claims that the U.S. intends to shift 40% of Taiwan's semiconductor capacity to the U.S., therefore removing the island's silicon shield, reports DigiTimes. He insisted that the global fab construction represents new capacity growth rather than relocation. Haung also said that TSMC must expand worldwide to meet surging AI-driven demand for chips and keep Taiwan as its stronghold.

Huang explained that demand for wafers is now outpacing what Taiwan's power grid can physically support, making overseas production a necessity rather than a political manoeuvre. He said that while TSMC will build and expand fabs in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, a substantial share of its output will remain in Taiwan, as no other region can replace the island's manufacturing ecosystem. According to Huang, spreading production across multiple regions strengthens resilience for both Taiwan and the U.S. and prevents supply bottlenecks as AI hardware volumes rise sharply.

For Nvidia, which sells everything it can produce both in Taiwan and the U.S., vast manufacturing capacities are crucial. Meanwhile, getting enough memory — HBM, DDR5, GDDR7, LPDDR5X, or even NAND — is as crucial for the company as getting enough compute silicon. To that end, production capacities for DRAM and NAND in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and eventually the U.S. are just as important to Nvidia as logic production. Huang said the company is coordinating closely with all major HBM suppliers —Samsung Electronics, SK hynix, and Micron Technology — to secure the volumes required for its next-generation AI accelerators, namely Rubin.

When it comes to geopolitics, Huang said that lawmakers must balance three competing goals: national security, technological leadership, and economic leadership. Therefore, he dismissed remarks by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who compared exporting advanced AI processors to China to 'selling nuclear weapons to North Korea,' and reminded that the current U.S. government has determined that selling Nvidia's H200 to Chinese entities does not undermine national security. However, he noted that it is now up to the Chinese government to let these processors into the country, as the company is awaiting regulatory clearance from Chinese authorities.

During his Taiwan visit, Huang plans to attend internal Nvidia meetings and Lunar New Year events, as well as to meet TSMC founder Morris Chang and chairman C.C. Wei.

International sporting events don't often see teams refuse to participate for a cause – but when it's happened, it hasn't been effective

It was probably fitting that the first call from someone with genuine power should emanate from Germany, long one of soccer's moral centers. “The time has definitely come,” German soccer federation vice-president Oke Göttlich told the Hamburger Morgenpost, “to seriously consider and discuss” a boycott of the 2026 World Cup.

“What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s?” added Göttlich, who is also the president of FC St. Pauli, Hamburg's earnestly countercultural club. “By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”

Meanwhile, Fifa's disgraced former president Sepp Blatter, long the sport's amoral center, now almost 90 years old and never one to pass up the opportunity to take a swing at his successor, further undermined this World Cup. On Monday, he endorsed comments by a former Fifa anti-corruption lawyer – breaks fourth wall to glance directly into the camera with a smirk – to “avoid the United States!”

The heads of about 20 European soccer federations discussed the possibility of a boycott. And between Donald Trump's threats against Greenland, his administration's actions in Venezuela, his various travel bans, and killings by federal agents during his immigration crackdown, clearly some kind of international rebuttal is called for. But whether soccer's authorities are really in any position to do so is questionable. And the cost and ramifications of a potential boycott should be fully thought through.

For one thing, it's worth considering who will actually be punished. It's doubtful that Trump cares enough about the World Cup to save it from a would-be boycott by backing down on the policies mentioned above. If there were no longer a margin in it for him, he'd likely do much the same as he will with the upcoming Super Bowl: dismiss it, ignore it, and move on.

The Trump administration, then, probably wouldn't be materially hurt by a World Cup boycott. It may be embarrassed, but then is that even something it is capable of or cares about? The oligarch class that keeps Trump in power wouldn't really be damaged either, as they have no significant stake in the thing – Fifa gets the lion's share of the proceeds.

Fifa would certainly be affected, but probably not as much as you'd expect. It will surely still make its broadcast income, and the sponsorship money, and it has already collected huge amounts of the ticket revenue it stands to make. It would be egg on the organization's face, sure, but they also seem to have moved on from such quaint considerations some time ago.

In the end, the brunt would be borne by the boycotting teams and their fans, who don't get to play in, or watch, a World Cup with their country in it. And, more directly, the many people who would work the tournament and benefit from the tourism it will generate. This may be a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things, but only if a boycott actually has any sort of effect.

Which, well, let's return for a moment to Göttlich and his deep cut to the Olympic boycotts, when the US and much of the west snubbed the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow over the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The USSR and much of the Eastern Bloc then counter-boycotted LA in 1984. Neither boycott accomplished very much at all, other than political posturing. The Soviets would not withdraw from Afghanistan until 1989. Yet two Olympics were pretty much spoiled. Lots of athletes lost their chance to compete, while others had their accomplishments affixed with a massive asterisk.

To hold up the Olympic boycotts as some sort of paradigm for how withholding participation in a sporting event can be wielded as an effective political tool is ahistorical.

There have hardly been any boycotts in the context of the World Cup. Defending champions Uruguay refused to go to Italy for the 1934 World Cup because so few European countries had showed up when it hosted the inaugural edition four years earlier. In 1938, Uruguay and Argentina sat out after an incident involving Peru at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. African countries boycotted the 1966 World Cup in protest over their continent getting just one-third of a berth, to be shared with Asia and Oceania – successfully, as Africa got a full berth in 1970. And the USSR refused to play a qualifier against Chile for the 1974 World Cup after the overthrow of socialist president Salvador Allende.

For some reason, the community that orbits the global game feels a ceaseless compunction for football to affect the wider world in a positive way. It's a noble notion, a kind of immutable idealism that runs deep through a fundamentally cynical sport. The trouble is that in this case, there really isn't much a hand to be played. An administration unconstrained by convention, aspirations of global leadership, or diplomatic politesse probably won't be bothered about a bunch of countries staying away from a World Cup.

All the better to show up and lodge your protest in person. Nobody will hear you if you're not there to speak up.
