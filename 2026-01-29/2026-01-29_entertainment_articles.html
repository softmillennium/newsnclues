                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Damon Lindelof is getting back into showrunning with a new kidnap thriller at HBO. Lindelof, who signed a two-year overall deal with HBO last year, has served as an exec producer on more recent projects including Peacock's Mrs. Davis and HBO's superhero series Lanterns, which is set to come premiere this year. HBO said Lindelof is “expanding the mythology of McKinty's thriller”. But a cell phone call from an unknown number changes everything: it's a woman on the line, informing her that she has Kylie bound and gagged in her back seat, and the only way Rachel will see her again is to follow her instructions exactly: pay a ransom, and find another child to abduct. This is no ordinary kidnapping: the caller is a mother herself, whose son has been taken, and if Rachel doesn't do as she's told, the boy will die. Rachel is now part of The Chain.The Chain has an interesting backstory. McKinty had written some books but quit writing in 2017 and became a bartender and Uber driver to support his family. Author Don Winslow found out and passed some of his books to agent Shane Salerno, who encouraged McKinty to write The Chain. In 2020, Universal Pictures optioned the book for Edgar Wright to direct it as a movie with Jane Goldman as screenwriter. The pilot story is by Lindelof, Carly Wray and Breannah Gibson, with Lindelof and Wray writing the pilot script. Lindelof exec produces alongside Michael Ellenberg and Lindsey Springer for Media Res and Shane Salerno with McKinty as co-exec producer. “From the moment I heard the wild and original premise of Adrian's book, I was shocked, surprised and angry I hadn't thought of it myself,” Lindelof said. “I've always wanted to try to adapt a great thriller, and this one has all the dark, weird, exhilarating touches that fire up my imagination. I feel so fortunate to reteam with Francesca, Casey and Michael, who first brought me to HBO 15 years ago, and I can't wait to make The Chain a memorable link in their outstanding legacy.” Francesca Orsi, EVP, HBO Programming, Head of HBO Drama Series and Films, added: “We are honored by our continued partnership with Damon Lindelof, one of the most singular and distinctive creators of our time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Here's a problem any comedian would wish for: too much good material. Such is the case with Judd Apatow and Neil Berkeley's documentary “Paralyzed by Hope: The Maria Bamford Story,” which focuses on a 1) very funny, compelling to watch subject with 2) an open-hearted spirit toward sharing her life and 3) enough ups and downs to frame half-a-dozen documentaries. Add in a litany of talking heads (from Bamford's family to Ted Sarandos, Sarah Silverman to Conan O'Brien, Tig Notaro to Patton Oswalt, and many more), a wealth of archival material, and a final 20 minutes that feel “timely” to the extreme, and the duo's doc feels overstuffed in ways both good and bad. Related Stories Sundance 2026 Movies Sold So Far: ‘Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!' with Rinko Kikuchi Sells to Sony Pictures Classics ‘When a Witness Recants' Review: If Justice Arrives 36 Years Too Late, Who Bears the Burden? Think of it this way: “Paralyzed by Hope” is the rare “celebrity” documentary that actually would have benefitted from being split into two parts. As a subject, Bamford is a dream: funny (duh), honest, willing to go there, disarming, and genuinely interested in talking about the worst shit she's ever gone through in her life. Late in the doc, fellow comedian Ron Funches says it best: Bamford's existence is “a true net positive.” She just makes the world better, and Apatow and Berkeley's film endeavors to show just how much that actually means, and how much it really took to get there. Naturally, the film opens in silly fashion (and that peek-behind-the-curtain breeziness will be missed at certain points), with Apatow rolling up to Bamford's home and slipping her 500 bucks to get chatting. That Bamford might be a bit reticent to share more about her life, despite the open nature of her stand-up act, is understandable, but any nerves are soon put way at ease. Apatow and Berkeley wisely utilize a raft of talking heads throughout the film — the high stature of many of them makes it plain how important Bamford is in the comedy space (even if, later, they joke about how she's spent decades being painted as the “next big thing”), and their own natural honesty allows them to insightful probe the Bamford mystique. O'Brien remains struck that the anxiety she chats about on stage is real. Plenty of comedians can jaw about nerves or bad childhoods, but for Bamford, it's literally not an act. Bamford herself takes us back to her childhood home in suburban Duluth, where she talks about both her relatively “idyllic” childhood and the many facets of it that proved to be very hard indeed. The central four Bamfords — Maria's sister, the also very funny Sarah, is on hand a lot, while archival footage and more recent interviews of their parents are a constant — were a tight group, but her mother Marilyn seemed to loom largest. Marilyn's own mental health struggles not only mirror Maria's (Bamford's eventual diagnoses frame most of the film's second half), but also deeply influence them, particularly the body issues that Bamford developed as a teen. Fans of Bamford's stand-up, of which we are treated to many clips of, spanning decades, will recognize some of her experiences, but she doesn't flinch when talking about everything from suicidal ideation to bulimia, her problems with overspending and the heartbreaking ways in which her OCD rears its ugly head — mostly, through horrific intrusive thoughts that made a very young Bamford worry about what terrible crimes she might commit. The honesty with which Bamford approaches all of this (and, yes, surely you must be sick of reading the word “honesty,” but there is simply no better term for who Bamford is and how she lives) is, as her fellow comedians have told us, real and refreshing and actually unique. Her years of comedy, plus an early foray into violin-based bits, have made Bamford a story- and joke-delivering machine, but it's clear that she still carefully considers what she says and does. And yet, that never makes her feel somehow filtered or at a distance.

Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Josef Kubota WladykaDate Acquired: Jan. 29 Buzz: One of the buzzier competition titles at Sundance not because of its star power but because of its playful title and crowd pleasing sentiment, one that earned a standing ovation for director Josef Kubota Wladyka and his mother on whom the film is based, the real Ha-Chan. Shot in Japan, Rinko Kikuchi stars in “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” as a woman who leaves the Japanese ballroom dance scene after tragedy strikes, only to be lured back onto the dance floor after developing an infatuation for a new instructor. It also stars Alberto Guerra, Alejandro Edda, Yoh Yoshida, and Damián Alcázar.

IndieWire hears that Neon, Black Bear, Netflix, Searchlight, and Focus Features — and even Warner Bros. at the 11th hour — were all in the mix for what was Olivia Wilde's third feature as a director. Others may have bid more, but Wilde was determined to get a theatrical deal. Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title. Section: PremieresDistributor: Focus FeaturesDirectors: Daniel Roher and Charlie TyrellBuzz: The “Navalny” director teams up with producer Daniel Kwan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”) on a film that goes deep into the perils and promise of artificial intelligence, all through the lens of Roher debating whether this is a good moment to bring a child into the world. Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirectors: Liz Garbus and Elizabeth WolffBuzz: More than a sports doc, this portrait of Billie Jean King looks at the tennis icon's compulsion to hide her sexual orientation and eating disorders. Section: PremieresDistributor: Searchlight PicturesDirector: Andrew StantonBuzz: Though he's directed plenty on TV, Pixar vet Andrew Stanton is returning to a live-action feature for the first time since “John Carter” dropped way back in 2012. Section: World DocumentaryDistributor: PBS/FrontlineDirectors: Itab Azzam, Jack MacInnesBuzz: This documentary was filmed over 10 years and follows a Syrian refugee girl who travels to Germany and then back to Syria with her family. It stars Midori Francis as a woman who takes part in a bizarre weight loss craze that involves eating human ashes, only to become possessed by demonic forces in the process. Section: NEXTDistributor: Latino Public Broadcasting and ITVSDirector: William D. CaballeroBuzz: This animated film that combines a variety of styles, including 2D, 3D, and live-action, is a deeply personal autobiographical documentary from mixed media filmmaker Caballero, who looks back on his career and examines grief through the lens of his Puerto Rican family in North Carolina. Section: PremieresDistributor: Nat GeoDirector: Sara DosaBuzz: Like her Sundance breakout “Fire of Love” before it, “Time and Water” is a more elevated nature documentary and follows an Icelandic writer eulogizing both a glacier and his grandparents. Section: MidnightDistributor: A24Director: Ian TuasonBuzz: A micro-budget horror movie in the vein of “Paranormal Activity” that first played at Fantasia Fest, the actual producers of “Paranormal Activity” helped give the film a new cut and are hoping for another horror hit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Travis Scott thinks back on all the music that has helped shape his life, he quite literally thinks about Kid Cudi's “Soundtrack 2 My Life.” The rapper and Rolling Stone cover star sat down to explore the music that has left the most meaningful impressions on him for Rolling Stone‘s My Life in 10 Songs video series, citing Kudi, Björk's Volta track “Wanderlust,” Fun's soaring “We Are Young,” and more. Scott begins his list with Aphex Twin's “Cow Cud Is a Twin,” which he stumbled upon while watching Chris Cunningham videos (who has directed videos for the British musician) with a friend from school who listened to garage and punk music. Next, Scott recalls how the music video for “Wanderlust” changed his life, saying, “It ruined my day in a good way. “You've got to dive in on Utopia,” advises Scott. “There's a lot of my favorite people that I work with or inspire me since day one.” Scott also points to Fun's “We Are Young,” reflecting, “I feel like everybody heard it at the same time. Scott then moves to “Retrograde” by James Blake, who was one of the first people he met in L.A. “Everything he does, from his live performances, the way he makes music, his beats, vocals, everything — dude is a genius,'” states Scott. Before introducing his next track choice, Scott chuckles and says, “Can't Tell Me Nothing” by Kanye West. Scott was also drawn to Portishead's “Western Eyes,” which prompted him to question “why rappers didn't rap on that type of rap.” ‘Chaos': Behind the Scenes of Amazon's Melania Trump Doc Ray J Says He's in His ‘Last Days' Due to Deteriorating Heart Health: ‘I F-cked Up' Nicki Minaj Bravely Vows to Protect World's Biggest Bully “He's a Mo City legend,” adds the rapper, “Never forget that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark Media released a video of Walker looking dapper at Churchill Downs, announcing his new movie. They attended the Kentucy Derby in May 2025 for further inspiration. “This film is about honoring Kentucky's history and the people who genuinely love and care for horses,” Walker told EntertainmentNow. “It's rooted in respect and tradition, and it also celebrates all the people behind the scenes who bring Derby Day to life.” Walker's leading lady in the movie is Hallmark newcomer Odette Annable, best known for starring on the TV shows “Walker” and “Supergirl.” The cast also includes Ally Ledford, Peyton Meyer, Brynn Thayer, and Gregg Henry. “In present-day,” the synopsis says, “Sadie Moore (Annable) works in the Churchill Downs greenhouse, dreaming of becoming a florist and one day contributing to the Derby's garland of roses, just like her great-grandmother, Gloria (Ledford).” “As Derby Day approaches,” the synopsis continues, “Sadie meets Ash Taylor (Walker), the son of Churchill Downs' CEO (Henry), who's been asked to do an emergency repair on the iconic Twin Spires after a storm left one damaged. Sparks fly, and their budding romance is complicated by a long-buried connection between their families—a bittersweet love story from the past that threatens to repeat itself.” “Kentucky Roses” was directed by Hallmark favorite Claire Niederpruem, according to IMDb, and was written by Jamie Pachino, whose many Hallmark credits have included 2022's “Long Lost Christmas” starring Taylor Cole, 2021's “Five More Minutes” with Nikki DeLoach, and 2020's “On the 12th Date of Christmas” starring Mallory Jansen and Tyler Hynes. The partnership with Churchill Downs is just the latest collaboration between Hallmark Media and iconic sporting events and legendary venues. During the 2025 holiday season, Hallmark partnered with Nashville's Grand Ole Opry for “A Grand Ole Opry Christmas” with an all-star cast that included DeLoach and Kristoffer Polaha. Meanwhile, Lacey Chabert has been filming a 2026 Christmas movie at Disney World, while Niall Matter and Holland Roden have been filming “A Grand Biltmore Christmas” — the second Hallmark movie set at the historic Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly four decades into Mariah Carey's still-vital career, three goals have remained constant for her: to love, heal and uplift. “I've always tried to incorporate messages into my songs like ‘Make It Happen' and ‘Hero,' ” says Carey, 56, on a day off from her recent December holiday residency at Las Vegas' Park MGM. She will join an illustrious circle of prior honorees that includes the Grateful Dead, Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, Joni Mitchell, Gloria Estefan, Billy Joel and Dolly Parton. “Mariah Carey's influence extends far beyond her remarkable artistry,” MusiCares executive director Theresa Wolters said upon the announcement of Carey as Person of the Year. Her work exemplifies the values at the heart of MusiCares: creating systems of care that lift people up and ensure music professionals and communities can thrive.” But Camp Mariah, the youth initiative she co-founded with the Fresh Air Fund — headed today by CEO Lisa Gitelson — was her first charitable project and is still at the heart of all of her philanthropic endeavors. In December 1994, Carey, a member of the Fresh Air board, performed a holiday concert at The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan — and debuted her now-­classic holiday song, “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” The event raised more than $700,000 to benefit her eponymous annual camp in New York's Mid-Hudson Valley, which launched the following summer, and was further bolstered by a $1 million donation by Carey herself. (Camp Mariah is just one aspect of the work done by Fresh Air, a nonprofit founded in 1877 to provide outdoor experiences for New York children from underserved communities.) “It's such a big thing for me because most of these kids have never been outside their own blocks,” Carey says of her camp, which was also the setting for her 1996 “Always Be My Baby” music video. I go up there and talk to the kids so they can learn about the different things they can do in life.” Most recently, Carey partnered with LGBTQ+ advocacy organization GLAAD in early December to auction off her hot pink, rhinestone-­studded “Protect the Dolls” jacket — which she wore during an August performance at Brighton, England's Pride in the Park festival — to support the trans community (it ultimately sold for $5,500). “All of us should do what we can to give back something,” Carey adds. “And it's also important to do more than that. But it's still an important part of my life.” As is the prolific, record-setting career that in turn has helped foster Carey's philanthropy — and has also made her a powerful business force in the music industry. Carey became a superstar in 1990 with her self-titled debut album, which featured four No. 1 singles, including “Vision of Love” and “Someday.” Since then, she has amassed 19 No. 1s on the Billboard Hot 100, among them “Hero,” “One Sweet Day” and “We Belong Together.” Her 16th studio album, Here for It All, arrived in September, and became her 19th top 10 entry on the Billboard 200. After spending the majority of her career on major labels, Carey released Here for It All independently through gamma. Alongside her MusiCares recognition — and not to mention her five career Grammys, including a 1991 win for best new artist — Carey continues to receive industry accolades. And she capped the year by adding another record-breaking achievement to her already long list of accomplishments. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” scored its 20th week at No. Prior to “Old Town Road” and “Tipsy,” Carey had held the record for more than two decades with “One Sweet Day,” her 1995 smash featuring Boyz II Men that spent 16 weeks atop the chart. (Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber's “Despacito” tied that mark in 2017.) Asked about the strategy behind how she's continued to level up while sustaining such an influential career, Carey credits a team that includes manager Michael Richardson and Rob Light, her agent and CAA partner/managing director. And she's preparing to level up again: Along with Andrea Bocelli, she will headline the opening ceremony for the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on Feb. 6, her first major appearance on that global stage. With the Park MGM holiday residency — which grossed $8 million over 10 shows, according to Billboard Boxscore — now behind her, Carey says she's “thinking about doing residencies in different countries in Europe.” Also on tap for her 2026: continuing work on a documentary she's making with Sony Pictures and a long-teased biopic adaptation of her 2020 best-selling memoir, The Meaning of Mariah Carey, with producer-director Lee Daniels at the helm (the pair previously worked together on Daniels' films Precious and The Butler). As Carey's holiday residency wound down, global music platform Wax Poetics announced its auction of an ultra-rare, original 1988 demo tape by the singer-songwriter-producer had fetched a winning bid of $54,050. It underscores Carey's legendary status — even if she scoffs at that notion. “Everybody has their own little meanings for what things they say,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven newly announced series span medical drama, psychological thrillers and genre fare as Netflix deepens its Taiwan-centered Chinese-language content strategy. Netflix on Thursday unveiled its full Chinese-language content slate for 2026, outlining seven new original series that further cement the streamer's long-term bet on Taiwan as its primary hub for Mandarin-language production amid mainland China's ongoing ban on foreign streaming services. Executives described the slate as deliberately darker, more genre-forward and creatively ambitious than earlier offerings, as Netflix looks to deepen engagement with Chinese-speaking audiences across Asia and the global diaspora. Japan Box Office Roars Back to Record High in 2025, Powered by 'Demon Slayer' and 'Kokuho' “Chinese-language storytelling is singular in its vibrancy, emotional depth, and willingness to explore complex, darker human truths,” said Maya Huang, Netflix's head of Chinese-language content. Leading the slate is Miracles of the ER, a grounded medical drama set inside a major Taipei hospital, headlined by Wallace Huo as an emergency department associate director overseeing a team grappling with relentless crises, ethical dilemmas and internal power struggles. Starring Ethan Ruan and Gingle Wang, the psychological thriller traces how a violent crime in Taipei binds three families across generations, excavating buried resentment and prompting a moral reckoning. Musical drama Dogman charts the rise and psychological collapse of a former rock star now adrift in middle age. Two additional series — How to Survive Med School and supernatural sci-fi thriller Pacify — have already wrapped principal photography and will premiere later this year. How to Survive Med School, a coming-of-age campus drama about a young man who rebels after being tricked into enrolling in Taiwan's top medical school, is written and directed by Giddens Ko and co-directed by Kai Ko and Tsai Jia-yin. Since 2020, the company has launched multiple training and development initiatives with local partners, including writers' room workshops, production training programs and script development schemes aimed at strengthening the local talent pipeline. “As the industry evolves, our focus remains consistent: long-term commitment, creative excellence, and a platform where Chinese-language stories can flourish locally and reach audiences worldwide,” Huang said. “Our ambition is to be the destination for Chinese-language entertainment that takes audiences into unexpected worlds.” The new slate builds on Chinese-language projects Netflix has already unveiled for early 2026, led by Left-Handed Girl, which opens Jan. 30.

It's her first new music since 2023's Portals, which peaked at No. On “POSSESSION,” Martinez tackles the ugly scenario of domestic violence, singing: “He leaves me all alone, from dusk to f—in' dawn / I'll clean up after all his s—, I'm the housekeeper / He comes home drunk at night, of course he picks a fight, I try my best to bite my tongue, but it keeps bleedin'.” 'Be True to Yourself': Mariah Carey Talks Philanthropy, Longevity & Not Calling Herself a 'Legend' 'Cher: Part One,' Tina Knowles' 'Matriarch' & More Audiobooks Nominated for 2026 Audie Awards Martinez's star rose in 2012 as a contestant on season 3 of The Voice. Although she didn't collect top prize, there's little doubt that she's a winner, bagging 30 billion-plus career streams, upwards of 5.5 billion official YouTube views and more than 62 million followers across platforms. Her debut album from 2015, Cry Baby, peaked at No. Later, she partnered with Flower Shop Perfume on a perfume line, the first of which arrived in 2023 — with similar success to its predecessor. The collection has since expanded to include candles, body sprays, and perfume pendants. In 2024, Martinez set out on her first-ever global arena headline trek, The Trilogy Tour, on which she played to sold-out successive nights at Madison Square Garden, and hit the stage at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Corona Capital Festival in Mexico City.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The character debuted more than 60 years ago in 1964's Avengers No. 9 as a supervillain who eventually reformed and sacrificed himself for the team. Now, Wonder Man finally arrives in the MCU but with limited fanfare. The marketing rollout for Wonder Man was even more subdued than Ironheart's, which hadn't seemed possible. Disney+ will release all eight episodes at once, which led to chatter that Marvel is cutting its losses and burying the show with little ceremony. So far, the only Marvel series that worked better as weekly installments were 2021's WandaVision and its 2024 sequel Agatha All Along. As binge viewing, Wonder Man is a pleasant diversion with some unexpectedly moving moments, thanks mostly to engaging performances from its leading men. Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is a struggling Hollywood actor who pursues that elusive big break with the same single-minded purpose as Captain Ahab. Abdul-Matteen (Watchmen, Black Mirror) is often cast in parts that conflict with his obvious leading-man attractiveness. His commitment to his craft is almost too easy a target—the actor takes himself a little too seriously, which costs him work—but Abdul-Matteen's performance is so natural that he avoids cliché. This is where Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) comes in. Trevor is our identification character, who is unwillingly cast into his most demanding role yet: a fun spin on the “one last job” career thief. Abdul-Mateen and Kingsley have great chemistry, and their characters' unlikely friendship, rooted in their mutual unrequited love for acting, provides the show's emotional center. Originally, Simon was a businessman whose company couldn't compete with Tony Stark's empire. That backstory is far too similar to those of past MCU villains, specifically Iron Man 3‘s Aldrich Killian and Spider-Man: Far From Home‘s Quentin Beck. So it makes sense to focus instead on Wonder Man's Hollywood aspirations. In his 1991 solo comic, Simon tried to balance acting with superheroics against a setting that was frequently more bizarre than any Skrull invasion. (Imagine if Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was also publicly a superhero.) There is significant comedic potential in an otherwise successful superhero still struggling to make it in Hollywood, where movie executives are just as diabolical as any villain. The Wonder Man series is similarly offbeat but can occasionally veer too far from escapist fantasy into mundane dramedy, which is bound to turn off audiences who didn't tune in to watch The Studio with superhero references. Decades ago, Buffy, Angel, and more than a few X-Files episodes demonstrated how a series can ground its epic fate-of-the-world stakes with humanizing comedy. Much like She-Hulk, Wonder Man struggles to maintain that balance. This is perhaps not the show for anyone interested in traditional frenzied battles between costumed characters. Of course, fans are admittedly hard to please: Depending on who you ask, heavy continuity in Marvel shows and films can make each installment feel less accessible to new audiences, who must wade through hours of homework to understand what's happening. Other fans complain that the series in particular feel disconnected from any larger narrative and introduce characters and plot points that never pay off. Secret Invasion might as well have never happened, which is probably a good thing. If this ends up the only Wonder Man story ever told onscreen, it's still worth watching. But that would also make this feel like a wasted opportunity, as both Simon Williams and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II have a lot of potential.

Auction house Bonhams Skinner announced the news on Jan. 28 and detailed that Ross' 1990 oil painting “Change of Seasons” surpassed its estimate of $60,000 and brought in $787,900, leading the sales. The other two landscape paintings by Ross included Valley View (1990) and Babbling Brook (1993), which sold for $203,700 and $279,900, respectively — also exceeding their presale estimates. ‘Chaos': Behind the Scenes of Amazon's Melania Trump Doc Ray J Says He's in His ‘Last Days' Due to Deteriorating Heart Health: ‘I F-cked Up' Nicki Minaj Bravely Vows to Protect World's Biggest Bully “I'm hopeful that Bob's work can provide meaningful support to stations nationwide.

A post shared by Henry Cavill (@henrycavill) Cavill posted the photos to his Instagram as a first-look at the film, which reportedly began shooting recently, after months of delays caused by an injury Cavill suffered during pre-production rehearsals. Possibly owing to that recent start date, the photos take the perhaps unorthodox step of not showing Cavill's character Connor MacLeod as, well, a Highlander, i.e., a Scottish warrior from several hundred years ago, and instead showing him as just a sort of guy running around in the modern day in a trench coat. Admittedly, the original film—which starred Christopher Lambert, and became a cult hit after its release in 1986—had a lot of that sort of thing, too, as MacLeod faced off against his ancient enemy The Kurgan in modern day New York. But c'mon, Highlander, you can't give us a little bit of highland action, as a treat? Highlander has a lot riding on it: Cavill, for his part, probably needs a win after the whole shakeout over his role as Superman a few years back, as well as his high-profile departure from his Netflix series The Witcher. Stahelski, in turn, is filming his first movie not set in his incredibly successful John Wick film franchise; Highlander will be a litmus test for whether his highly visceral brand of action can work without Keanu Reeves there to anchor the punches. There's no word yet on when Highlander will land in theaters; Russell Crowe, Dave Bautista, and Karen Gillen are all slated to co-star.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whatever movie stars are made of, Margot Robbie's got it. Robbie, who plays Catherine Earnshaw in the Emerald Fennell-directed film, set jaws wagging with one accessory: Elizabeth Taylor's iconic Taj Mahal diamond necklace. She added custom diamond earrings designed by celebrity jeweler Lorraine Schwartz, who was a close friend of Taylor's. The drop earrings feature 38 carats of old-cut diamonds, set in blackened bronzed gold. She also wore a 19th-century ruby and diamond ring from Fred Leighton to round out the incredible jewelry. As for her outfit, Robbie wore a striking crimson and black Schiaparelli gown, consisting of a strapless black lace corset with a dramatically flared skirt in shades of black and red. If we were to make ‘Wuthering Heights' into a dress, what would it look like? The forthcoming movie, out on Valentine's Day, sees Robbie opposite Jacob Elordi, who plays Heathcliff in the Emily Brontë adaptation, and who also stepped out on the red carpet alongside Robbie. For his part, the “Euphoria” actor looked dapper an all-black Bottega Veneta suit, accented with a black foulard around his neck and a cummerbund. He added all Cartier jewelry including stud earrings, a diamond and ruby tie pin and a diamond ring. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The jaw-dropping look featuring a shell-covered bra, corset and barely-there miniskirt that showed off swaths of thigh and dipped low in the front. She added an enormous pear-shaped diamond choker and wore the Cece Jewellery custom ring that Robbie gifted Elordi featuring two skeletons intertwined. Robbie, who was a pioneer of the method-dressing trend with 2023's “Barbie,” has already begun her “Wuthering Heights” transformation. She's been favoring bell sleeves in tribute to the Elizabethan-era film, also sporting a Roberto Cavalli mini and sky-high Christian Louboutin heels. Stylist Andrew Makumal explained the inspiration behind a duo of feather-covered Victoria Beckham looks — one featuring a black corset and the other a very angelic minidress — quoting from the 1847 book. “Tossing about, she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth…she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species,” he wrote on Instagram.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actress, 59, flaunted her figure in a black plunging body suit and silver bejeweled skirt while at the “Crime 101” premiere in London on Wednesday. She accessorized with black platform heels, a long floral necklace and chunky rings. Berry styled her hair in light waves and wore nude-colored glam. At one point, the “Catwoman” star posed alongside her co-stars Chris Hemsworth, Bart Layton, Monica Barbaro, Jury Member and Mark Ruffalo. The Bart Layton-directed thriller is set for release on Feb. 13. Berry previously told Page Six that it was a “privilege to age” while divulging her must-have skincare product, Lancôme Rénergie C.R.x. The “Gothika” star shared that her skin was “drier than it ever used to be” since entering perimenopause, until she found the peptide-based product.

Berry emphasized that she was embracing aging, adding, “It's not about taking your wrinkles away.” “We've earned every one of these lines, and they're OK,” she said. The “Die Another Day” star has also focused on fitness since entering menopause, and announced her partnership with Peloton in October. Berry often shows off her toned body in tiny bikinis, and admitted menopause has taught her not to “give a f–k” about other people's opinions about what she wears or how she moves.</p>
