                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>International sporting events don't often see teams refuse to participate for a cause – but when it's happened, it hasn't been effective It was probably fitting that the first call from someone with genuine power should emanate from Germany, long one of soccer's moral centers. “By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. Meanwhile, Fifa's disgraced former president Sepp Blatter, long the sport's amoral center, now almost 90 years old and never one to pass up the opportunity to take a swing at his successor, further undermined this World Cup. On Monday, he endorsed comments by a former Fifa anti-corruption lawyer – breaks fourth wall to glance directly into the camera with a smirk – to “avoid the United States!” And between Donald Trump's threats against Greenland, his administration's actions in Venezuela, his various travel bans, and killings by federal agents during his immigration crackdown, clearly some kind of international rebuttal is called for. But whether soccer's authorities are really in any position to do so is questionable. For one thing, it's worth considering who will actually be punished. It's doubtful that Trump cares enough about the World Cup to save it from a would-be boycott by backing down on the policies mentioned above. If there were no longer a margin in it for him, he'd likely do much the same as he will with the upcoming Super Bowl: dismiss it, ignore it, and move on. The Trump administration, then, probably wouldn't be materially hurt by a World Cup boycott. It may be embarrassed, but then is that even something it is capable of or cares about? It would be egg on the organization's face, sure, but they also seem to have moved on from such quaint considerations some time ago. In the end, the brunt would be borne by the boycotting teams and their fans, who don't get to play in, or watch, a World Cup with their country in it. This may be a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things, but only if a boycott actually has any sort of effect. Neither boycott accomplished very much at all, other than political posturing. The Soviets would not withdraw from Afghanistan until 1989. Lots of athletes lost their chance to compete, while others had their accomplishments affixed with a massive asterisk. To hold up the Olympic boycotts as some sort of paradigm for how withholding participation in a sporting event can be wielded as an effective political tool is ahistorical. Defending champions Uruguay refused to go to Italy for the 1934 World Cup because so few European countries had showed up when it hosted the inaugural edition four years earlier. In 1938, Uruguay and Argentina sat out after an incident involving Peru at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. African countries boycotted the 1966 World Cup in protest over their continent getting just one-third of a berth, to be shared with Asia and Oceania – successfully, as Africa got a full berth in 1970. An administration unconstrained by convention, aspirations of global leadership, or diplomatic politesse probably won't be bothered about a bunch of countries staying away from a World Cup. All the better to show up and lodge your protest in person. Leander Schaerlaeckens' book on the United States men's national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the USA's late-March friendlies against European powers Belgium and Portugal in Atlanta now less than two months away, here's how several of the top USA players have fared lately for their clubs: On social media, McKennie's father credited Spalletti for the 27-year-old's sparkling form this season when posted: "Wes is the happiest I have seen him in quite some time. If there's an American in better form than McKennie right now, it might be Aaronson. He's now made seven straight starts for Daniel Farke's side, with three goals and an assist over that span. Pochettino's staff has noticed as chief assistant coach Jesus Perez attended Leeds' 1-0 win over Fulham on Jan. 17. The towering striker continues to excel for Derby County in England's second-tier Championship, with two goals (and a helper) in his last three league appearances. Before missing Augsburg's shocking win over German champs Bayern Munich last weekend because of yellow card accumulation, the 19-year-old Hawaii-born Banks started 13 consecutive Bundesliga games. Assuming he reclaims his place, Banks is in line for a March invite — at least — given the USA's dearth of center-back depth after Chris Richards and 38-year-old Tim Ream. Johnny Cardoso has a strong second half of the season for Atletico Madrid (Photo by Alberto Gardin/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images) Limited to just four appearances for Atlético Madrid in 2025 because of ankle and knee ailments, Cardoso has started the second half of the season strong. The 25-year-old defensive midfielder has made two consecutive La Liga starts, both of them shutout wins. With a goal and an assist in Marseille's last two Ligue 1 outings, Weah is rounding into form at just the right time. D'Agostino will travel to watch Weah at the Stade Velodrome on Saturday, when Marseille hosts Paris FC. He even had an assist in Sunday's 2-0 win over Brest. An ever-present player for Middlesbrough when healthy, Morris has been quietly excellent over his 23 Championship games so far. So what if Tillman hadn't scored for Bayer Leverkusen since November? With the striker sidelined until March, PSV has little incentive not to cash in if the Cottagers — who submitted an improved $38 million bid for Pepi this week — meet their asking price. Wright scored back-to-back game-winning goals for Premier League-bound Coventry City earlier this month, breaking a 14-match goalless streak across all competitions with the Sky Blues. After his 12 goals helped get Cologne promoted to the Bundesliga last season, Downs has yet to score in 17 games split between Southampton and Hamburg so far this term. The 2022 World Cup starter is still struggling to gain traction with Atalanta, where he's on a season-long loan from AC Milan. He's played fewer than 700 minutes across all competitions, though he did earn his fifth start of the season in Wednesday's defeat to Belgium's Union Saint-Gilloise. The defensive midfielder started the USA's October win over Australia and remains a mainstay for Bundesliga side St. Pauli, for which he has played almost 2,000 minutes. He's still probably a World Cup long-shot, though, as his position is easily the USA's deepest. There's still time for Sargent's impasse with Norwich City in time to facilitate his wish to sign with Toronto FC before Europe's winter transfer window slams shut. The London club has now started the veteran right-back in eight straight Premier League games since he finally returned from knee surgery and lately, he's looked gassed: Last Saturday, Jedi was subbed less than an hour into the Cottagers' 2-1 triumph over Brighton. He's been a regular for Celtic since compatriot Cameron Carter-Vickers tore his Achilles tendon in the fall, but the central defender has struggled alongside his team. The defending Scottish champs have won just two of their last five league games, and Trusty was red-carded toward the end of Saturday's 2-2 tie with league-leading Hearts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USWNT's Crystal Dunn opens up about her experience as a mother and athlete, and highlights the importance of representation in women's sports. United States star Crystal Dunn has retired from professional soccer after a decorated playing career to spend more time with her family. “This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished,” she wrote in an Instagram post Thursday. “I'm ready to embrace the life that awaits me on the other side,” she continued. “I look forward to spending more time with my family and being a more present mom.” Dunn was under contract with Paris Saint-Germain, which said Thursday that both sides agreed to end their collaboration. A versatile player who contributed from multiple positions, Dunn had joined PSG in January 2025 after she left Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League. Dunn appeared in 160 games for the United States, scoring 25 goals. “As one of the first Black stars of the U.S. Women's National Team, especially as a field player, Dunn has long been a role model to many young players of color across the country who aspired to reach the highest levels of the game,” the U.S. soccer federation said in its announcement about Dunn's retirement. Before Gotham, Dunn played for the Portland Thorns, taking most of 2022 off for the birth of her son Marcel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fox Sports will air a record 70 FIFA World Cup games on network television, including every game from the round of 16 through to the final, a strong commitment for the 2026 tournament, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Most notably, Fox will put more knockout games on network TV than it did in Qatar, when it aired six round-of-16 games on its main broadcast network. All but two knockout games will air on network television. All 104 games of the biggest-ever World Cup — 48 teams will compete in this version, an increase from 32 in 2022 — will air on either Fox or FS1. All three U.S. men's national team group stage games will air on Fox. “FIFA is putting on the biggest World Cup in history, and Fox Sports is living up to that standard,” Fox CEO and Fox Sports executive producer Eric Shanks said. “Our broadcast schedule affirms Fox is truly going to be America's home for the beautiful game over a span of 39 incredible days. The summer will be dominated by soccer, with games spanning more than a month. Among the group stage highlights on Fox will be a tripleheader on June 16 featuring three of the competition's top stars, with Kylian Mbappé and France taking on African Cup of Nations champion Senegal; followed by Erling Haaland and Norway against the winner of a FIFA playoff; and concluding with Lionel Messi and defending World Cup champion Argentina taking on Algeria. With game times set for a global audience, coverage will typically begin in the late morning or early afternoon Eastern Time and run through the night. That includes FIFA World Cup Live shows on Fox and World Cup Today on Fox and FS1. For the first time ever, Fox will also air a simulcast on its streaming service, Tubi, for both the opening ceremonies and two matches: The tournament's opening game of Mexico against South Africa on June 11 and the U.S.'s opening game against Paraguay on June 12. The full broadcast schedule can be found here. Paul Tenorio  is a senior writer for The Athletic who covers soccer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crystal Dunn was given a preview of what was to come in the SheBelieves Cup during a 1-1 draw with France at Red Bull Arena on March 4, 2018. Everyone, it seems has a different opinion, as to what is Crystal Dunn's best position. In wake of Crystal Dunn's retirement announcement on Thursday, FrontRowSoccer.com is reposting some of her most memorable moments and stories. This story was originally posted during the 2019 Women's World Cup. PARIS — Crystal Dunn was given a preview of what was to come in the SheBelieves Cup during a 1-1 draw with France at Red Bull Arena on March 4, 2018. The Rockville Centre, N.Y. native had replaced forward Mallory Pugh in the 73rd minute and figured she would get an opportunity to be part of the United States attack in an attempt to secure a victory. After all, Dunn had proven to be a most dangerous weapon, tying a U.S. record by scoring five times during an Olympic qualifying win in 2016. As it turned out, by the final whistle, she had much different worries — as a left back to make sure that France wasn't going to score the game-winner. Dunn was forced into defense after Casey Short was stretchered off with a leg injury in the 76th minute Dunn even had to fight her own natural attacking instincts. On one corner kick, she started to retreat a bit toward her goal though the Americans were trying to score. “Story of my life, right?” she said at the time. “I just have to be prepared for whatever. I've been that type of player my whole career. Dunn is arguably the most versatile women's soccer player on this planet. She has played every position but goalkeeper for the USA, which meets France in the Women's World Cup quarterfinals at Parc des Princes Friday. And she has no desire of taking up that position now. “Absolutely not,” she said with a laugh about the possibility of putting on goalkeeper's gloves. “What those keepers are able to is incredible. It's not in my wheelhouse at all.” Like it or not, Dunn has excelled on defense, midfield and forward, so that versatility can be considered a blessing or a curse. “I think it's a blessing, in all fairness,” said Paul Riley, who is Dunn's coach on the National Women's Soccer League champion North Carolina Courage. “I think if she was playing in the 10, she wouldn't play,” said Riley, who was (and still is) the director of football at the Albertson Soccer Club when Dunn played there for his wife Tracey for one of the club's youth teams. For my team, she's not the best left back. We probably miss her a lot, probably more than any other player because she just creates moments that are special. Crystal Dunn (center) trains with Megan Rapinoe and Christen Press. “She scores loads of goals for us. She can make her own chances by dribbling. She's just a production machine, a valuable weapon to have at the World Cup, in case you have to push her forward or higher. “It's not easy in any way,” she said. “There's a lot that goes on in my head before camp if I'm playing a different position that I have been playing. I try to keep it as simple as possible and just try to be at my best. “Playing outside back, I've dibbled and dabbled there, obviously and I have a good gist on what is expected of me. There are definitely times in games where, that I'm like, ‘Ooof, I'm a little unsure of what to do in this situation.' But you know comes down to teammates who will help and support me. Them having my back makes it a lot easier.” When asked what her preferred position was, Dunn did not have to take long to say what spot that was. “Where specifically in the attack, it's hard to narrow down but I do think if I had to pick a position, it would be a wide forward, a wide midfielder. This year I did actually play the 10, which was very much central [and] I got a good feel for that. It also helps who I'm playing with. My teammates literally help and put me in the best position to succeed, then every position is fun.” And by the way, she has 24 goals in 89 international appearances. I feel it makes me so unique and it makes me feel like I'm just in a different category. The more I embrace it and the more I open my heart knowing that this makes me special, makes me unique, and it's awesome. When Dunn attended the University of North Carolina, legendary head coach Anson Dorrance originally used the Long Island as a defender. But after seeing what a dynamo she was, he changed his mind. “When I saw her as a youth player, playing for Albertson, she was an outside winger up front,” he said. Then all of a sudden I was seeing with the youth national teams, and I think in the first youth World Cup she played in, she was actually a center back and I think she was playing for Jill Ellis [the current U.S. women's national coach] in that stretch. She comes to UNC because I had seen her as the youth national team level as a center back, I threw her to center back immediately in the first part of her freshman year. She easily won the start as a center back.” Then Dorrance saw the qualities that made Dunn such a special player. I mean anyone off the dribble,” he said. She could stop people, but then she would get the ball, her first instinct would be to play make. It would be to start penetrating off the dribble. “So, I was thinking this was ridiculous: why have this kid who is so good off the dribble playing as a center back? It wasn't like she wasn't brilliant passer, because no one could stop her off the dribble. Almost every time she got the ball she would beat the other team's six and all of a sudden, we had numbers up somewhere. Now, she has an opportunity to win a world championship. Crystal Dunn: “If I focus on the short-term goals, then the long-term goals are going to be in my favor.” (Michael Chow – USA TODAY Sports) I have another opportunity to fight for a spot on this World Cup roster. I am going in every day just wanting to work hard and get better. If I focus on the short-term goals, then the long-term goals are going to be in my favor.” She has played a vital role for the Courage, whether it has been threading passes to teammates or scoring goals. “She has become a much better player technically and tactically,” Riley said. Great crosser of the ball with both feet. Her left foot is much better today than back then, I'll tell you that. She's had her ups and downs, not getting picked for the next World Cup. Great personality in the locker room, too. She helps the team out a lot. She's just not one of those players who shows up now and then. I think consistency is another thing that people don't notice. She's very consistent in her play, which not always the case.” In both magazines, women can be scantily clad or have nothing on at all. “I did the ESPN Body Issue, which is obviously, you're like naked. What are you doing posing on a beach and having fun?' What is really important, and I want people to realize that we're more than just an athlete. “I always step off the field knowing that it's ok to leave soccer behind and kind of focus on other aspects of your life. I am not just this athlete people see us as. Being part of the Sports Illustrated shoot was just a way to express that we're so much more than what people think we are. “My husband nearly had a heart attack. But I told him, ‘Listen this is a special moment. It's not every day are you asked to be in Sports Illustrated, so he obviously was very supportive.” Crystal Dunn enjoys a little down time with her teammates at the Reims Stadium. Her husband is Pierre Soubier, head trainer for the Portland Thorns (NWSL) and a native of Aurignac, France. The couple were married on Long Island last December. But obviously I'm a part of the family now and they're rooting for me and they want me to go all the way,” Dunn told USA TODAY last month. “They've said it's going to be quite tough if we play France. In what sounds like a familiar story about how many players started their journey in the sport, Dunn began playing soccer with the Rockville Centre Soccer Club when she was four-years-old. “My parents knew nothing about soccer,” she said. “They just felt I had a lot of energy and told me to go run around and run it off. But I am so fortunate to continue playing this sport. Anyone who picks up a soccer ball, regardless of what skill set you're at, it's such a fun sport to kick around with your friends and you're never going to regret that decision.” When it came time for travel soccer in the Long Island Junior Soccer League, Dunn performed with the Rockville Centre Power from Under-10 through U-13, winning an Eastern New York Youth Soccer Association State Cup championship. She was a standout there winning several State Cups title before moving on to college. “That's ultimately what youth soccer does for you. They also had an opportunity to see Dunn play and dominate as a member of the South Side High School squad in Rockville Centre. In the 2009 championship game, she had recorded a hat-trick in the opening 20 minutes, finishing with four goals. And if you were wondering why South Side did not win state honors in 2008, Dunn had a pretty decent excuse. She missed the entire season due to youth national team commitments that fall. Playing outside back, Dunn and the U.S. lost to North Korea in the U-17 World Cup final in New Zealand. Unlike many of her USWNT teammates, Dunn admitted she did not see the USA defeat China via penalty kicks to win the 1999 World Cup. But that certainly did not deter her enthusiasm for the sport. She has joined Northport, N.Y. native and midfielder Allie Long, another product of the Albertson SC, on the squad. “Me and Allie always talk about how great it is to be from New York. We always tell me people that if you can survive in New York, you can survive anything. Dunn comes off as a bubbly personality, always smiling even when a tough question or two is thrown her way. But don't let that fool you. Underneath that shell is one tough New Yorker. “That's what helped me when I was going away to college. I think it's really important to have a set guideline of knowing who you are. Now, Crystal Dunn would love to bring the Women's World Cup trophy home to New York and the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Gunners have a wealth of options at full-back, including Smilla Holmberg, Taylor Hinds, Katie McCabe, and Emily Fox but it appears they have their sights set on the 26-year-old. Batlle began her career at Barcelona but after being unable to break into their first team, she moved to Madrid CFF in 2017. From there, she made the switch to Levante in 2018 before signing for Manchester United two years later. For me, Barca has always been in my heart and it's not easy to say no." Since re-joining Barca, Batlle has made a big impression, helping them win Liga F twice, the Champions League once, and two Copa de la Reinas. But, it seems, this may be her last season at the club. Discussions are ongoing over the Spain international, who can play on either side of defence. Batlle has made 19 appearances in all competitions this season but her days at the club may be numbered. This comes at a time when Barca, due to their financial constraints, may also risk losing star player Putellas as they reportedly don't have the funds to renew these deals. From Arsenal's perspective, McCabe is out of contract this summer, but Batlle is an inverted full-back, rather than an out-and-out left-back. After leading Arsenal to Champions League glory, Slegers took the next step to solidify her position with the Gunners by signing a deal until 2029 earlier in January. Incidentally, new deals like this could attract players, such as Batlle, to the club. The Dutchwoman said: "From playing in the academy and being in the stands watching Arsenal win the Champions League in 2007, to living it with our players, staff and supporters last summer, I'm immensely proud to have shared this journey with Arsenal, a club that means so much to me and to so many people. I'd like to show my gratitude to our supporters for the incredible backing you give us, whether it's at Emirates Stadium, Meadow Park or on the road.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (Jan. 29, 2026) – Crystal Dunn, one of the legends in the history of the Women's National Team and one of the few Americans to win a FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, a FIFA Women's World Cup and an Olympic gold medal, has officially announced her retirement from professional soccer. Her effervescent personality, selflessness for her team and penchant for dancing at the drop of a beat always endeared her to teammates and coaches for club and country. “I leave the game with a sense of peace and deep fulfillment for all that I've accomplished,” said Dunn, who was one of the U.S. National Team's most beloved teammates during her career. “I'm grateful for the incredible people I've had the privilege to work with, from teammates and coaches to family and friends, and all the amazing moments we've shared. I'm very much looking forward to my next chapter ahead.” In the final game of the 2018 SheBelieves Cup against England, she played left back, a position she then held for most of 2018-2021 and the final two years of her career 2023 to 2024. Dunn was off the field in 2022 as she was pregnant and then gave birth to her son Marcel on May 20 of that year. Known as one of the best “big-game players” in U.S. history, Dunn played all but 75 minutes of the 2024 Olympics, played every minute of her six games at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and played every minute at the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, helping consistently shut down world class forwards while contributing to the U.S. attack down the wings in every match she played. She played in seven total Concacaf tournaments during her youth and senior career, winning them all. Dunn grew up in the U.S. Women's National Team youth setup and finished her U-20 WNT career as one of the most capped players all-time at that level with 39 games played. She finished her U-17 career with 13 caps and one goal. From then on, she was a regular call-up for three different USWNT head coaches. Dunn played for six different professional clubs in her career, starting with the Washington Spirit, before heading overseas to Chelsea FC for a stint with now-USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, then coming back to the NWSL where she played for the North Carolina Courage, Portland Thorns FC and Gotham FC. She finished her career in France with Paris Saint-Germain. She won the MAC Hermann Trophy as college soccer's top player as a junior, when she also helped lead UNC to the NCAA title, and finished second to future USWNT teammate Morgan Brian as a senior. For the Tar Heels, she was a four-time All-American, garnering three First-Team selections and one Third-Team. She was the first player to win ACC Player of the Year honors three times since Mia Hamm completed her trifecta in 1993. Crystal Alyssia Dunn was born and raised a New Yorker, hailing from Rockville Centre, N.Y. where she attended South Side High School and had a decorated prep career. She was a Parade All-American and led her team to three New York state championships -- 2006, 2007 and 2009 – losing only two games in three school seasons. In 2008, she was dedicated to National Team commitments for the U.S. U-17 WNT.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spanish media reports have highlighted new developments surrounding Jude Bellingham's future at Real Madrid, with increasing interest coming from the Premier League. According to El Nacional, several English clubs — none officially named — have submitted bids in recent weeks worth more than €100 million for the England international. The report suggests that the surge in interest is linked to a dip in Bellingham's recent performances, a situation that has not gone unnoticed by the Madrid hierarchy. At Valdebebas, Bellingham is still viewed as a cornerstone of both the present and future project. However, the report claims Real Madrid could be open to listening to offers should his performances fail to show clear improvement in the next phase of the season. At this stage, there are no official negotiations or an expressed intention to sell. Since his arrival, Jude Bellingham quickly established himself as one of Real Madrid's standout performers, playing a decisive role in the club's recent success in LaLiga and European competition. That influence, however, has diminished over the past period, fueling speculation both inside and outside the club. While Real Madrid have no immediate plans to part ways with the midfielder, the scale of the Premier League offers could prompt internal discussions if Bellingham's form continues to fluctuate, placing his long-term future under the spotlight.

Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka says United States President Donald Trump “has managed to make us feel not only German, but also European”. Goretzka, who plays club football for Bayern Munich, in an interview with Die Zeit newspaper published on Wednesday, spoke about the World Cup being hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, and he suggested Germany and other European teams will be the favourites. “Others have caught up, but in the most important game in the world, we're still ahead of every continent,” Goretzka said. Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter also weighed in on Monday. In his X post, Blatter quoted Mark Pieth – a Swiss lawyer specialising in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, who called on fans to boycott the World Cup – and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.” Pieth, who also chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago, had initially been quoted in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund. “I'm aware of the political debates,” Goretzka added. “Still, I expect it to be a great tournament.

There's a new tournament at the elite level of women's football - the Women's Champions Cup.

Designed to pit the best club teams against each other, the annual competition will conclude this week in London with Arsenal firm favourites to lift the trophy in Sunday's final.

Facing the Gunners, however, will be a team few expected to make it this far. Corinthians, not Gotham FC, will line up at the Emirates Stadium fresh from a semi-final upset.

Corinthians are the dominant force in Brazilian women's football and Sunday's match gives them the chance to highlight the growth of the domestic game in the country.

This is an opportunity to make an even bigger statement than the one they made by beating Gotham FC.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "Futbol Americas" crew discuss Ricardo Pepi's potential move to Fulham and will it affect his chances of going to the World Cup. With an energy of amicable competition, these sessions are an invaluable boost for those who are setting goals for 2026. Kicking and chasing the ball across the modest public greenery, many are looking for new contracts in the lower leagues, others are seeking to simply stay fit, but as for one prominent player in attendance? "Everyone's basically grinding for something," said the U.S. men's national team's Max Arfsten to ESPN. "For me, it's trying to make the World Cup." Just months out from this year's momentous tournament, Arfsten's 2026 preparations began here with his close circle in his hometown, where the Columbus Crew fullback was stopped a couple of times by kids to take photos after his practices. With his MLS season ending in early November and not beginning again until Feb. 21, the 24-year-old drew upon a potent source of motivation for an athlete at any level: not wanting to lose to your friends. "Every time you play against the guys from your hometown ... you kind of innately want to prove your worth," Arfsten said. In fact, for those who didn't qualify for the playoffs last year, they'll go through a four-month stretch between official MLS matches, with preseason camps now back in full swing. Of course, that break is needed in order to fully recover and regroup, but its timing complicates matters when you consider that weeks after MLS' 2026 season begins, the USMNT will have one last international window before head coach Mauricio Pochettino makes his final World Cup roster decisions. Conversely, the United States' high-profile stars in European leagues will be in the middle of their campaigns, boasting match fitness their domestic-based compatriots are unlikely to equal. With the World Cup around the corner, Arfsten isn't alone when it comes to extra offseason work. Across the country in St. Louis, Missouri, Columbus teammate Patrick Schulte has his own group that has helped him stay sharp. "There's four or five of my buddies that I grew up playing with or went to college with that all live here or base here in the offseason, we get a good group together," said the goalkeeper who, like Arfsten, feeds off a cordial sense of rivalry. "I don't want to get scored on by my friends because I won't hear the end of it," joked Schulte about his lively sessions back home. "As a goalkeeper, some of my buddies are forwards. I just want them to know, 'Hey, if we ever play, you got no chance.'" Schulte and his crew regularly trained this offseason at St. Louis Scott Gallagher SC, where the national team goalkeeper developed his talents at a younger age, but similar to Arfsten's group, they also roamed around local parks. Over in Florida, fellow national team member Alex Freeman spent part of his MLS offseason at Fort Lauderdale's SAT Soccer, a program that specializes in customized training regimens for some of the world's top players. According to the company, other names with MLS experience such as Josef Martínez, Telasco Segovia, Juanjo Purata and Tadeo Allende also traveled there ahead of 2026. While Freeman -- who will leave Orlando City SC and join Villarreal in LaLiga this winter, a source told ESPN's Jeff Carlisle -- discussed fitness, Arfsten noted improvements on specific aspects of his wingback position: "defending, working on crossing, deep crossing." Houston Dynamo and USMNT midfielder Jack McGlynn, who underwent foot surgery in October, centered on a more introspective style of individual improvement. I think when you're injured, you have a lot of time on your own to think and kind of reflect on your season, where you could do better," McGlynn told ESPN in late 2025. In the short term, this could be a disadvantage. For those MLS players who make that World Cup roster, though, could being in midseason form -- rather than coming into the tournament off the back of a grueling European club campaign -- then become an advantage that helps the USMNT? "I think you can take it in both kinds of ways," Freeman said. "Obviously, you would kind of want to be maybe playing a little more going into January, February ... but also it just gives you time to perfect what you need to do." "We might be a little more fresh and not have as many games on our legs, but I think at that point in life, with the adrenaline and everything, it's not going to matter too much." For Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan, a 30-year-old veteran who has been one of the latest surprising X factors for the national team, there's no denying the impact that MLS players could have. "European players will be pretty much done with all their games ... so that is a very difficult place [for them] to be in," he told media over the winter. "You're going to have to rely on your entire squad, and there is an advantage for us [in MLS] to be able to come in fresh leading into the World Cup, taking full advantage of the offseason now and then ramping up slowly ... right when summer hits, you're halfway through the season and you're in a good spot." If you ask Arfsten, it's a case-by-case basis, but it probably wouldn't shock him if someone from MLS garnered an extra edge -- however slight -- at the World Cup. I mean, it just depends on what kind of form you're in," said the Columbus player.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>January 29 – South America's crown jewel tournament in club football, the Copa Libertadores, may be on the brink of its most radical evolution yet and one that could see it challenge the UEFA Champions League not just in prestige, but in global relevance. CONMEBOL President Alejandro Domínguez has publicly left the door open for clubs from the United States and Mexico to join South America's premier club competition, despite their membership of Concacaf. Those comments landed soon after Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas described it as his “dream” for the club to play in the Libertadores. “It's a dream, and obviously I've already had conversations with CONMEBOL to see about our participation,” Mas said. It was only ten years ago that Mexican clubs were a defining part of the tournament, with Cruz Azul, Chivas and Tigres all reaching finals between 1998 and 2016. Their presence added commercial weight, continental intrigue and meaningful cross-border rivalries. Domínguez acknowledged that any return would require coordination with Concacaf. “We are very respectful of the other confederations,” he said, while calling it an “honour that teams from other confederations view the Libertadores as a benchmark for international and world competition”. That benchmark could shift dramatically if MLS and Liga MX champions were granted access. A Libertadores featuring elite Brazilian and Argentine sides alongside Mexican giants and marquee U.S. clubs with global stars in tow would have broadcasters salivating, significantly boosting sponsorship value, particularly in North America's rapidly growing soccer market.

In addition to hosting eight matches, L.A. will be home to a bunch of major fan events across the city. Don't have the cash to score tickets to the FIFA World Cup? While it won't be quite the same as having a seat right on the pitch, the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host Committee has announced a slate of major watch parties for this June and July's matches, as well as a handful of community celebrations that lead up to the 39-day tournament. This summer's World Cup shares its hosting duties across 16 cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada; here in L.A., all eight locally-staged matches will be held at SoFi Stadium, including the United States men's national soccer team opener on June 12. Held from June 11 to 15, the FIFA Fan Festival there will feature live match broadcasts, concerts and food; we don't know yet exactly how the ticketing process will work, but expect more details to be released in early March. If the Coliseum is a trek, there'll also be a rotating slate of fan zones across L.A. County, with official watch parties held from Venice to Downtown L.A. to Pomona. Organizers tell us that some of these events will be free while others will have a nominal fee; in any case, the objective here is to get as many Angelenos swept up in the World Cup as possible. “Ultimately, everyone will naturally remember what happens on the pitch, but really where the memories are created—the experiences are shared—is off the pitch where people come together and to celebrate the game,” said Ross McCall, FIFA World Cup's executive director of commercial operations, at a press conference on Wednesday. “And right here in Los Angeles is going to be the perfect stage for the world to see how incredible hosts they will be.” In the lead up to the tournament, the host committee will also hold a series of community events, including 26 soccer clinics for kids; a “Kick It With Us” mobile bus tour toting merch and games that kicks off on March 3 and is set to visit various high-foot-traffic locations; and a volunteer-run community beautification event at Gloria Molina Grand Park on March 14 (with a second event to be announced). L.A. Tourism will be keeping tabs on all of these official events on a World Cup section of its website. It's been more than three decades since the World Cup has been held in the U.S. (though the FIFA Women's World Cup took place in the U.S. in 1999 and 2003)—and Cobi Jones, the former national team midfielder and current Los Angeles World Cup 2026 community ambassador, looked back fondly on the eight matches held in Pasadena in 1994. “Those matches at the Rose Bowl did more than fill the stadium: They helped changed the trajectory of soccer in the country… creating leagues and creating a passion for this sport,” Jones said. “That's why I'm so excited to welcome the world back into the greatest city on the planet, my hometown of Los Angeles.” The host committee also unveiled on Wednesday that the World Cup is estimated to bring an $892 million increase in spending across L.A. County, and that a projection of $230 million in media value from future tourism will push that total up to $1.1 billion. Of course, this also comes amid mounting fears of a (probably unlikely) World Cup boycott in the U.S. due to aggressive and, most recently, lethal federal immigration enforcement as well as President Trump's threats to take over Greenland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long Beach's most read source for local news, investigative reports, arts & culture, food, business, sports, and real-estate. And despite much hype earlier this month from the mayor, Long Beach is not on it. The international soccer federation announced Wednesday nine World Cup Fan Zones held between June and July — including Downey, Venice Beach and Los Angeles — that will host celebrations to punctuate the 39-day tournament's eight local matches at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The zones are intended as places of national pride and celebration, including a live broadcast and refreshments for fans as the U.S. national team plays its first game against Paraguay on June 12. But an official fan zone will not take place in Long Beach, according to local organizers. When asked, Brenner said he didn't know why the city pulled out. A news release from the mayor's office described it as an “official FIFA World Cup Fan Zone” that was paid for using a $378,000 grant from Los Angeles Metro. Richardson described the event as a “live, two-week activation on Pine Avenue” he hoped would draw thousands of visitors. A spokesperson for the mayor's office later said the Long Beach event is still planned but will be called a “World Cup celebration.” When asked to elaborate, she said she did not have any more information. An approach, he said, that is more flexible and will “maximize community benefit.” Official zones are established through a formal licensing process bounded by agreements between the city, host committee and FIFA to use their likeness for branding. The World Cup begins June 11 with an opening match in Mexico City, followed by matches in Los Angeles and Toronto the next day. It's expected to bring $892 million in increased spending across L.A. County.</p>
