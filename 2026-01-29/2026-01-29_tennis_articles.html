                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Aryna Sabalenka advanced to her fourth straight Australian Open final, defeating Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3. The 2023 and 2024 champion reaches her eighth Grand Slam final overall and will face Elena Rybakina in a rematch of the 2023 Australian Open final. MELBOURNE, Australia -- Aryna Sabalenka has made the Australian Open final a familiar destination. With a 6-2, 6-3 semifinal win over Elina Svitolina, the World No. She has done so without dropping a set, matching her title runs in 2023 and 2024, when she eventually won the trophy. "Right now my mentality is like I'm ready to do whatever -- [whoever] is going to be in that finals -- I'm ready to go out there and fight with what I have and do everything I can," Sabalenka said to press. So that's my approach to the finals this season." She now improves to 6-1 against Svitolina on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz and will meet Elena Rybakina in the final. Sabalenka has also reached the last seven Grand Slam finals on hard court, dating back to 2023. "I think her shots are heavy, deep, flat balls," Sabalenka said of Rybakina. "It's not easy to work with, but yeah, we have a great history. As for Svitolina, she reached her fourth Grand Slam semifinal but is still seeking her first trip to a major final. Sabalenka's power game dominated Svitolina when she was on the return. In the first game, after trailing 15-40, Sabalenka won four straight points -- three of them winners -- to save the break points and hold serve. Other times, Svitolina's returns would go long in an attempt to counter the World No. 1, who finished with 29 winners to Svitolina's 17 unforced errors. It didn't come without some minor controversy, however. On the opening point, the chair umpire called a hindrance violation on Sabalenka -- who requested a video review -- for saying something aloud ahead of Svitolina's return. Despite her argument, the call remained in favor of Svitolina, who shortly thereafter had her shot of the match with a forehand dig after Sabalenka hit a drop shot to spark the Rod Laver Arena crowd. That brief stint would be short-lived after Sabalenka struck with the break, even saving a game point of Svitolina's in the deuce, taking a 3-1 lead. The four-time Grand Slam champion earned her second break after trading holds for three games to secure the first set 6-2. This time, she capitalized and then won four straight points the next game, capped off with a fortunate net cord winner, to hold and have a 2-0 lead in the second set. But that break and hold must've ignited a fire in Sabalenka, who won the next 12-of-13 points, recapturing the set with a 3-2 lead. 1 had five winners in the stretch to seven Svitolina errors, and interestingly, Sabalenka won 8-of-10 points of rallies that went nine shots or longer. "I think my serve was not great at all. She was returning well, quick, and then she had another punch coming, the second shot after her serve. I mean, that's why she's World No. Leading 40-30, it was a must-hold point for Svitolina, but despite matching Sabalenka's power on almost every shot in the intense rally, she knew she mishit her final forehand that went wide-left. "I was not putting enough pressure on her with my serve, so of course, you know, when you play players like that, you don't have too much time to waste," Svitolina said. 1 Aryna Sabalenka advanced to her fourth straight Australian Open final, defeating Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Danilina and Krunic defeated Gabriela Dabrowski and Luisa Stefani in three sets earlier Thursday evening to book their own spot in the championship match. The Australian Open women's doubles final is set, with No. 4 seeds Elise Mertens and Zhang Shuai facing No. Mertens and Zhang, runners-up at Wimbledon in 2022, raced through their semifinal, defeating Ena Shibahara and Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 6-2 in 1 hour and 21 minutes on Margaret Court Arena to reach their second Grand Slam final as a team. “I think we're really there as a team. Communication was there, and I felt like today everything kind of worked. Earlier Thursday evening, Danilina and Krunic outlasted the new pairing of Gabriela Dabrowski and Luisa Stefani 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena, winning in nearly two and a half hours to advance to their second Major final together. They were runners-up at the French Open last year. We just tried to hang in there, especially being a break down in the third, and it worked out for us well.” “We kind of were fighting, at that point, to stay in the tournament, and now we're in the final,” Mertens said. Their path didn't get much easier from there. They rallied from a set down in the quarterfinals to reach the semis, where they were finally rewarded with a more routine victory. After Shibahara and Zvonareva held for 1-1 in the opening set, Mertens and Zhang reeled off four straight games for a 5-1 lead, where they held set point. They tensed up slightly, dropping serve as the lead shrank to 5-3, but held at love to close out the set. 4 seeds surged ahead 5-0, were broken while serving for the match, before quickly regaining their composure. “This is our second time playing together at a Grand Slam and (now) second final,” Zhang said with a smile. “Oh my God, we should keep playing (together) forever.” Danilina and Krunic raced to a 5-2 lead in the opening set, lost it, then regrouped in time to take the tiebreak. They carried that momentum into the third, breaking and consolidating for a 2-0 lead. But shortly after a brief delay to close the roof due to rain, Danilina and Krunic broke back, leveling the set at 3-3. “They were confusing me from the first point,” Krunic said. “I tried to think about my own game; what I'm supposed to do, what comes from my racket, but they're a very energetic team. “Today was a very different match for us, and I'm happy that at the very end we found that extra energy to be in Saturday's final.” There isn't much past history to draw from when dissecting this matchup, but all four players bring significant doubles success to the final: Both pairs enter Saturday's final one win away from their first Major title together, a breakthrough that would cement their rapidly growing résumés. Danilina and Krunic defeated Gabriela Dabrowski and Luisa Stefani in three sets earlier Thursday evening to book their own spot in the championship match.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At an Australian Open where the stakes stretch beyond a place in the final, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev collide in Friday's semi-final with vastly different milestones in sight, and their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry finely balanced at 6–6. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, is chasing his first Australian Open title, with which he would complete the Career Grand Slam, while for Zverev — a three-time major finalist and last year's runner-up in Melbourne — the stakes centre on a long-awaited maiden Slam trophy. Their clash is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. local time / 10:30 p.m. EST inside Rod Laver Arena. 🎾Alcaraz vs Zverev🧐Our comparison shows the players data when playing against each other on the ATP Tour, with how they perform against their 52-week averages📊#TennisInsights | @atptour pic.twitter.com/eSHuWg8Ieq Their paths to the semi-finals reflect that contrast. Zverev has been repeatedly tested, dropping a set in four of five matches, while Alcaraz has been clinical throughout, reaching his fourth straight major semi-final — and first in Melbourne — without dropping a set. Alcaraz has since closely tracked both Zverev's level and the toll required to sustain it. “I've watched his matches through the tournament,” Alcaraz said of Zverev. I'm excited about playing him here [at the] AO in a semi-final. I will be well prepared for that match. Alcaraz's quarter-final win over Alex de Minaur showcased his growing control in Melbourne, lifting his intensity after a tight opening set through heavier ball striking and disciplined aggression. These are traits he will again rely on to drag Zverev into physical exchanges. Zverev's run has been powered by his serve. Against Learner Tien, he struck 24 aces and used his first strike to shorten points, a pattern that has defined his tournament and will be central if he is to avoid extended rallies. The semi-final may hinge on whether Alcaraz can stretch Zverev and prolong exchanges, or whether Zverev can impose his serve and draw on his experience at this stage in Melbourne — including last year's final — in a setting that remains new territory for Alcaraz at the Australian Open. 1 Club history as Career Grand Slam looms at Australian Open “Now, whoever I'm going to play in the semis, Carlos or Alex, they're great players. You just are looking forward to a fantastic match. “Of course, in my case, I'm still chasing that desired Slam. With history beckoning on both sides, a rivalry locked at 6–6, and contrasting strengths poised to collide, this Australian Open semi-final shapes as a test of strategy, stamina and nerve.
