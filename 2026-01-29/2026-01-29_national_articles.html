                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats are pushing for ICE policy changes in negotiations with the White House over a package to fund the government ahead of tomorrow's deadline. • Cabinet meeting: President Donald Trump met with his Cabinet today, declining to take questions from reporters after updates on issues including the economy, Venezuela and Ukraine. • Possible Iran strikes: Meanwhile, Trump is weighing a new strike on Iran after preliminary discussions between Washington and Tehran over limiting the country's nuclear program failed to make progress, according to people familiar with the matter. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today that will launch a new initiative to combat drug addiction, a White House official said. CBS News was first to report on the president's expected order. Discussions about a temporary halt in attacks on energy infrastructure took place during trilateral meetings between US, Ukrainian and Russian officials in Abu Dhabi last week, a person familiar with the discussions said. American officials raised the idea of such a halt. At the time, it wasn't clear whether Moscow would agree to the pause, which comes amid a cold snap that has sent temperatures plummeting. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Russia had agreed to halt attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities for a week, though it wasn't clear when such a pause would begin. “I personally asked President (Vladimir) Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week. And he agreed to do that,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. “And I have to tell you, it was very nice. A lot of people said, don't waste the call, you're not going to get that. Russia has been pounding Ukraine's critical infrastructure over the past weeks and hit a civilian train on Tuesday. Some Republican lawmakers are signaling that they are open to considering reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in light of the recent killings of US citizens by federal immigration officials in Minneapolis. “Democrats are wanting some reforms that make sense to me, body cameras making ICE more like other agencies, but that's a band aid. I'm willing to entertain some reforms to make sure that we rein in ICE appropriately and make it more professional,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. Indiana Republican Sen. Todd Young told reporters he's “perfectly happy to have a conversation about body cameras, very good idea for anyone in law enforcement.” Democrats have demanded changes to ICE as part of talks over how to fund the Department of Homeland Security and other key federal agencies as a government funding deadline looms. President Donald Trump just wrapped a meeting with his Cabinet, where he discussed a host of issues, including government shutdown negotiations, the future of Venezuela, the economy and war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us, catch up on key moments from the meeting: Trump joked about last Cabinet meeting, where he repeatedly appeared to doze off. President Donald Trump declined to take questions during his Cabinet meeting Thursday, a rarity for the ordinarily loquacious commander in chief. After roughly 90 minutes of talking about his administration's accomplishments, and inviting some Cabinet members to speak, Trump wrapped the meeting with a brisk “thank you very much, everybody.” As reporters shouted questions, Trump shook his head to indicate he wasn't interested in answering queries. Neither Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem nor Attorney General Pam Bondi spoke during the meeting. The chamber, which has been on a pre-scheduled recess – is set to return Monday. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Thursday suggested House Democrats would be open to backing a short-term funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security but warned it “cannot be long.” “Any agreement that comes together in the Senate we'll have to evaluate in its totality, including as it relates to, if there is to be a continuing resolution, it cannot be endless, and it cannot be long,” he told reporters during a press conference. CNN reported that the White House and Senate leaders are nearing a deal that would split DHS funding from a larger spending package and temporarily extend funding for the agency, giving lawmakers more time to work through reforms to ICE. Jeffries was supportive of the Senate Democrats' demands for DHS reforms and said that House Democrats' position is that “dramatic change” is needed with the federal agency “before any appropriations bill related to ICE or CBP proceeds.” Jeffries also said he spoke to Speaker Mike Johnson yesterday about the spending bill and reiterated that Democrats intend to proceed with impeachment proceedings for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem if she's not fired. And on top of all that, she's presided over the cold-blooded killings of American citizens like Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. She's needs to put on ice permanently,” he added, also calling for White House aide Stephen Miller's firing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he expects a strong bipartisan vote once a government funding deal is reached, after seven of his conservative senators voted against advancing the critical package. Some GOP senators were unhappy that Democrats walked away from the spending deal they had already negotiated, he said. “When we have something to actually talk about, I'm hopeful that we'll have a good, strong vote on both sides,” Thune said. But talks are continuing with the White House to reach a deal that satisfies Democrats – who are demanding policy changes to ICE in the bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security – and funds five remaining key agencies. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he'd personally reached out to President Vladimir Putin to request the Russian leader not fire on major cities within Ukraine, including Kyiv, citing plummeting temperatures in the region. “Because of the cold, extreme cold — they have the same that we do — I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this, it's extraordinary,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday. “It's not just like cold, it's extraordinary cold, record setting cold over there too… and I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that.” CNN has asked Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment. Speaking Thursday, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration was “making a lot of progress” in negotiating a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, adding that following a meeting with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi last week he believes “the people of Ukraine are now hopeful and expectant that we're going to deliver a peace deal sometime soon.” All Democrats, who are pushing to force changes to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies in the wake of Alex Pretti's fatal encounter with federal agents in Minneapolis, voted not to advance the six-bill funding package. If the Senate cannot get all 100 senators to consent to splitting the DHS funding bill from the remainder of the package, as Democrats are demanding, then several significant agencies, including Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, will face a lapse in funding Friday at midnight. If a deal is reached, however, the bill would have to be approved by both chambers, meaning the narrowly divided House would have to return to Washington and final approval could be delayed until Monday. These ongoing efforts are about intimidation and distraction, not facts.” We do know, like I said, we have the 700 boxes, but I do know other documents were looked into to that we did not believe had anything to do with 2020,” Allen said. Pitts said that although Fulton County made a strategic decision to comply with the FBI's demands on Wednesday, they've spoken with county attorneys and outside counsel regarding next steps. “I don't want to disclose what our legal strategy is, but we will be fighting with every inch of our body, with every resource that we have,” said Pitts. “Everyone has told us that we will prevail in the final analysis.” President Donald Trump said he spoke to Acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodríguez and informed her that the United States would be “opening up” the commercial airspace above Venezuela even though it is not technically considered closed. It's under very strong control,” Trump said at a meeting of his Cabinet. “I've instructed Sean Duffy and everybody else concerned, including the military, that if you would, by the end of today, I'd like you to have the airspace over Venezuela – planes can go to Venezuela – opened up.” Even after Maduro was deposed, the State Department urged Americans to “not travel or remain” there. Trump also said the leadership in Venezuela is doing a “good job” even though earlier this week, Rodríguez said she had had “enough” of Washington's orders. Trump also said that major oil companies will be going to Venezuela and picking locations, without providing any details. Analysts have said it would take years for oil companies to re-enter Venezuela. In a moment of levity and self awareness, President Donald Trump said his Cabinet meeting today will be shorter than the last one, which he acknowledged “got pretty boring.” “We're not going to go through the whole table, because the last time we had a press conference, it lasted for three hours, and some people said ‘he closed his eyes,'” Trump said. Trump insisted, though, that he wasn't sleeping during the last Cabinet meeting. It was a little bit on the boring side, but I didn't sleep,” Trump said. “I don't sleep much, but, you know, it's funny, some of them got me in a blink,” Trump said referring to photos of the meeting. Context: See CNN's analysis of Trump's demeanor during his Cabinet meeting in December. President Donald Trump said Thursday he was optimistic that Congress would avert a government shutdown, saying negotiators were “working on that right now.” The Democrats, I don't believe, want to see it either.” Still, talks are continuing between Capitol Hill leaders from both parties and the White House to reach a deal to address funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE. Federal funding for the key agencies is set to lapse Friday at midnight. President Donald Trump said he held a “productive” call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum this morning focused on the border, trade and ending drug trafficking. “I had a very productive telephone conversation with President Claudia Sheinbaum, of Mexico. “We will be speaking again, soon, and ultimately, setting up meetings in our respective Countries. Mexico has a wonderful and highly intelligent Leader — They should be very happy about that!” “We agreed that both teams will continue working together. This comes as Trump has traded barbs with Canadian President Mark Carney, threatening 100% tariffs if the country makes a deal with China. “The initial phase involves continued deployment of temporary duty personnel to Caracas. In addition, to support increased temporary duty personnel and the potential resumption of embassy operations, the Department of State may also need to open an interim or temporary facility in Caracas, Venezuela, to accommodate temporary duty personnel or operations while the existing facilities are brought to serviceable condition,” said the notification, which was sent to 10 relevant Senate and House committees. “Over a period, personnel and functions of the Venezuela Affairs Unit in Bogotá, Colombia, would be transitioned to Caracas, operating out of the embassy compound or other interim or temporary facilities,” the notice said. “These functions may include but are not limited to consular, political, economic, management, security, and public diplomacy,” the notice said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that there were already 70 locally employed staff that helped maintain the embassy while it was shuttered. “We have a team on the ground there assessing it, and we think very quickly we'll be able to open a US diplomatic presence on the ground,” he told lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said talks were progressing on a funding deal as Republican and Democratic leaders and the White House try to come to an agreement to avert a costly government shutdown. My hope and expectation is that if the White House and Senate Dems work this out they will able to produce the votes that are necessary to get it passed,” Thune said on his way to the Senate floor. He would not say if he would back some of the proposal offered by Democrats on ICE and said that would be subject to talks by all of the parties involved: the White House, House and Senate. He doesn't yet know, he said, a date for a continuing resolution for funding the Department of Homeland Security. As he left the floor a short time later, Thune said he and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer spoke on  Wednesday and that he has also spoken with House Speaker Mike Johnson about how to get the needed votes to pass the House, though he did not elaborate on details of the conversation.

Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, 61, pleaded not guilty to five counts of unlawfully transmitting the national defense information to the reporter through an encrypted messaging application and a single count of unlawfully retaining the defense information. Her devices were seized in a pre-dawn FBI raid on January 14 pursuant to a warrant related to the investigation into Perez-Lugones. Government seizures of reporter records are exceedingly rare in the US. Perez-Lugones previously acknowledged he mishandled classified information, prosecutors said, according to a court hearing transcript obtained by CNN. Perez-Lugones told federal investigators he was angry about “recent government activity,” Assistant US Attorney Patricia McLane said during a detention hearing earlier this month. Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins told reporters that it's good the White House is engaging with Democrats on a possible government funding deal ahead of Friday's shutdown deadline.</p>

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Justice Department has charged a man who squirted apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar at an event in Minneapolis, according to court papers made public Thursday. The man arrested for Tuesday's attack, Anthony Kazmierczak, faces a charge of forcibly assaulting, opposing, impeding and intimidating Omar, according to a complaint filed in federal court. Authorities determined that the substance was water and apple cider vinegar, according to an affidavit. After Kazmierczak sprayed Omar with the liquid, he appeared to say, “She's not resigning. It was unclear if Kazmierczak had an attorney who could comment on the allegations. A message was left with the federal defender's office in Minnesota. The attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa earlier this week, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.” Omar blamed Trump on Wednesday for threats to her safety. Trump accused Omar of staging the attack, telling ABC News, “She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.” Kazmierczak was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings. In another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers' families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?” Officials said they investigated nearly 15,000 “concerning statements, behaviors, and communications directed against Members of Congress, their families, staff, and the Capitol Complex” in 2025.

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins ‘America's Newsroom' to report on Democratic leaders pushing DHS changes as the deadline to fund the government approaches. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called White House deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security advisor Stephen Miller a "hateful bigot," but the White House fired back, labeling the lawmaker a "buffoon." "Stephen Miller is one of the malignant architects of the violence and brutality DHS has unleashed on the American people," Jeffries asserted in a Wednesday post on X. "He slandered hero nurse Alex Pretti as a would-be assassin. Why is this hateful bigot still Donald Trump's chief immigration adviser?" Left: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Dec. 12, 2025; Right: White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller listens as President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney speak to reporters in the Oval Office on May 6, 2025. In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson slammed Jeffries. "Hakeem Jeffries is a buffoon who has repeatedly lied about and smeared federal law enforcement officers, including inciting violence against them by encouraging his supporters to ‘fight' President Trump's agenda ‘in the streets.' No one should take anything he says seriously," Jackson said in the statement. A senior DHS official told Fox News Digital that Miller "has been instrumental in delivering on the President's agenda." "At neck-breaking speed, President Trump has achieved the most secure border in American history — Stephen has been a lynchpin in those efforts," the official added. The official went on to say that Miller's "passion, patriotism and persistence helps fuel this administration in our efforts to carry out the largest deportation of criminal illegal aliens in the history of our republic." Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen, was fatally shot in Minneapolis on Saturday. "A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists," Miller asserted in a Saturday post on X.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has gathered his Cabinet for a video broadcasted meeting that's expected to be another lengthy, praise-heavy affair. During the meeting, Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday. Trump's Cabinet meeting has been going on for an hour. Here's who has given updates on their work so far: At Trump's cabinet meeting, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner said that home sales in December “rose sharply to their strongest pace in three years” — but that's not quite what appears to be happening in the housing market that has been a persistent source of frustration for U.S. consumers. More importantly, it could have been a monthly blip as the Realtors separately said that pending home sales in December had fallen 3% from a year ago. Trump has said that he wants to keep home prices high to increase people's net worth, but doing so will likely keep construction levels low and price out possible first-time buyers. Religious leaders in Washington called the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers “a profound moral failure” and condemned the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics. “We affirm the sacred worth of every human life,” they said in a joint statement Thursday, adding they “stand with immigrants” and “condemn … the use of indiscriminate and lethal force against civilians.” The administration's operations, they said, flout “our nation's deepest moral commitments” and “values of human dignity.” The group includes Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop Robert McElroy; Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde; Rabbi Abbi Sharofsky of the Jewish Community Relations Council; and Zoroastrian Head Priest Berham Panthaki, among others. Budde drew Trump's ire after she asked at his inaugural prayer service to “have mercy” on migrants and LGBTQ+ people. The president said he'd read coverage suggesting that his health chief might outpace Trump's own impact in November. “So, I have to be very careful that Bobby likes us,” Trump joked. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gave an update on TrumpRx, a government website in development that's intended to help people buy drugs directly from manufacturers. The website is part of the administration's larger push to lower drug prices and give Americans options to buy medications at lower prices by cutting out middlemen. Trump's administration had said TrumpRx was coming in January 2026, but Kennedy didn't commit to that timeline at a meeting of cabinet officials. “That's going to be happening sometime probably in the next 10 days,” Kennedy said. Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies Thursday as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday. As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands on Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest. If those are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown. Trump said at his cabinet meeting that “next week” he'll announce his choice to replace Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve. Even though Powell's term as chair ends in May, he could stay on the board of governors until 2028 and block Trump's ability to appoint someone new to the board as chair. Trump said his pick will do a “good job” and that he wants the Fed to cut rates when there are signs of economic growth. President Donald Trump said Thursday he has asked Russian President Vladimir Putin not to target the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv for one week as the region experiences frigid temperatures. “I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. After a nearly half-hour recap of administration accomplishments including on drug prices and the economy, Trump turned to envoy Steve Witkoff — not technically a Cabinet member — to give the meeting's first report. “Your policy of peace through strength that's what delivered them home,” Witkoff told Trump. Recalling being seen as struggling to keep his eyes open during that gathering, Trump insisted, “I didn't sleep. The comment drew laugher, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has made a trademark of laughing loudest during Cabinet meetings.

Asked to explain, a senior administration official said in a statement that “Gabbard has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, and election infrastructure.” Trump has long insisted that the election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden was stolen from him even though courts, his own former attorney general and audits have concluded that there was no widespread fraud that could have altered the outcome of the 2020 contest. Trump said he informed Venezuela's leader Delcy Rodríguez on Thursday that he's going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela and Americans will soon be able to visit. Watch live as Democratic senators block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies. “We're working on that right now,” Trump said while declining to go into specifics. He touched on his administration's efforts on crime before moving to Venezuela, where he thanked staff involved with the military operation to end the presidency of Nicolás Maduro. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026, in Washington. They say such changes could lead to widespread problems for voters. For example, they say prior Republican efforts to require proof of citizenship have disenfranchised married women whose last names on their photo IDs don't exactly match their birth certificates or other proofs of citizenship. The GOP election rules legislation has a long road ahead in the narrowly split Congress, where Democrats have rejected similar ideas as disenfranchising Americans' ability to vote. House Republicans are proposing sweeping changes to the nation's voting laws before Americans get their say in this fall's midterm elections. The package to be released Thursday, a long-shot Trump priority, includes requirements for photo IDs before people can vote, proof of citizenship and prohibitions on universal vote-by-mail and ranked choice voting. “These reforms will improve voter confidence, bolster election integrity, and make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat,” said Rep. Bryan Steil, chairman of the House Administration Committee, in a statement. Majority Leader John Thune opened the Senate as Republicans and Democrats eye an emerging deal to consider immigration enforcement changes and prevent a federal shutdown. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said immigration changes must be included in any deal to fund the government. Schumer decried the “thugs roaming our streets” during immigration enforcement. The center is navigating a wave of artist cancellations in protest of Trump‘s new leadership, which added his name to the venue. In just the past week, composer Philip Glass called off a world premiere of a symphony about Abraham Lincoln, and Grammy-winning soprano Renée Fleming withdrew from two scheduled appearances. White House border czar Tom Homan holds a news conference as Marcos Charles and Rodney Scott, listen, at the Bishop Whipple Federal building on Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026 in Minneapolis. Homan also blamed “hateful rhetoric” for ratcheting up attacks on his officers who he called “American patriots.” Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, left, and FBI Deputy Director Andrew Bailey, enter a command vehicle as the FBI takes Fulton County 2020 Election ballots, Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Union City, Ga., near Atlanta. The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee wants to know why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard joined an FBI search of a Georgia election office that was featured in bogus conspiracy theories over Trump's 2020 election loss. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia said that if Gabbard believes a foreign intelligence service tried to swing the election she is obligated to inform his committee. Otherwise, “she is simply attempting to inject the non-partisan intelligence community into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy,” Warner said at a committee hearing Thursday. Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to questions about Wednesday's action, which involved the FBI executing a search warrant and taking away many boxes of ballots cast by voters. Trump's claims of a stolen election have been repeatedly rejected by courts and state and federal officials, who found no evidence of fraud that would have altered the outcome. ICE has historically relied on cooperation from local and state jails and prisons with immigrants in custody who've committed or are accused of crimes to alert ICE so that agents can pick them up before they're released. Many urban areas don't have such cooperation agreements, saying that keeping detainees beyond their release dates or otherwise working with ICE makes victims or witnesses to crimes more reluctant to support prosecutions. The Hennepin County Jail, which serves Minneapolis, and the Ramsey County jail, which serves St. Paul, don't honor such “detainers,” but both do hand over prisoners if there is an arrest warrant signed by a judge. ICE argues that arresting immigrants while they're still in custody is safer and better for immigrant communities by avoiding street operations that might result in detentions of other people who are in the country illegally but haven't committed any crimes. Trump and his Cabinet have a meeting set for 11 a.m. Eastern. Anyone planning on tuning in should be prepared for a long haul. While officials defended this as a sign of the president's active listening, he recently suggested in an interview with New York Magazine that he did so because the meeting was boring. December's still fell short of an August meeting that went more than three hours and 15 minutes. Mayor Frey's office says he'll attend the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Thursday to advocate for an end to the immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis. “I'm going to Washington to make the case for ending this strategy and replacing it with approaches that build trust, improve safety, and put our residents first.” He said he's made some progress while meeting with elected officials and law enforcement leaders across the city and state, seeking common ground. White House border czar Tom Homan holds a news conference as Rodney Scott, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, listens, at the Bishop Whipple Federal building on Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026 in Minneapolis. Homan also seemed to suggest a renewed focus on what Immigration and Customs Enforcement calls “targeted operations” designed to focus their arrest efforts on apprehending immigrants who've committed crimes. He also called on local jails to alert immigration enforcement when they have someone in their custody who is an immigrant about to be released, saying that transferring people over to ICE while they're still in jail is safer for the officers and means they aren't out on the streets. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the subject has been a matter of serious discussion but stressed that a final decision has not yet been made about where the board's administrative staff will be located. Trump unveiled the board last week in Davos, Switzerland, and it currently has 27 “founding members,” whose first task is to oversee the Gaza peace plan. The order calls for the immediate release of refugees detained in Minnesota and release within five days of those transferred to Texas. Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz warned the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that it had violated 96 court orders in 74 cases this month. “This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law,” he wrote. Law enforcement officers prepare to make arrests after declaring an unlawful assembly during a noise demonstration outside the Graduate by Hilton Minneapolis hotel on Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Minneapolis. Trump's border czar says the administration is open to a drawdown of agents in Minneapolis but only after he sees cooperation from state officials. Trump sent Tom Homan to Minneapolis after the shooting of two U.S. citizens by federal immigration officers. At a Thursday news conference, Homan doubled down on the need for local jails to alert Immigration and Customs Enforcement to people in their custody who ICE can remove from the country. If there's been a soundtrack to life in Minneapolis, it's the shrieking whistles and honking horns of thousands of people following immigration agents across the city. Their network is sprawling, often anonymous and with few overall objectives beyond helping immigrants, warning of approaching agents or filming videos to show the world what is happening. “There are currently no ongoing or planned large-scale ICE operations here,” Collins said in a statement. Jeff Landry, Trump's envoy to Greenland, says in a New York Times op-ed that the framework of an agreement on Arctic security that Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte agreed upon last week builds on existing defense agreements between the U.S. and Denmark. U.S., Danish and Greenland officials held their first technical talks on Wednesday aimed at securing an Arctic security deal. As a continuation of Trump's pitch to Americans on affordability and the economy under his administration, the U.S. Treasury and White House are celebrating the upcoming launch of a program they view as a key milestone: Trump Accounts. A provision of Trump's tax legislation, Trump Accounts are meant to give $1,000 to every newborn, so long as their parents open an account. A U.S. Treasury event brought together an assortment of politicians and celebrities — from Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to rapper Nicki Minaj and NBC's “Shark Tank” judge Kevin O'Leary — to discuss the program and its potential impact on the economy. Backers of Trump Accounts have said they're a way to help children from low-income households build wealth. Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis. The attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, speaks during a field hearing on immigration Friday, Jan. 16, 2026, in St. Paul, Minn. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr) U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Thursday she is running for governor of Minnesota, promising to take on President Donald Trump while unifying a state that has endured a series of challenges even before the federal government's immigration crackdown. Klobuchar's decision gives Democrats a high-profile candidate and proven statewide winner as their party tries to hold onto the office occupied by Gov. The 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Walz abandoned his campaign for a third term earlier this month amid criticism over the mismanagement of taxpayer funding for child care programs. Klobuchar cited Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota, federal officers killing two Minnesotans who protested, the assassination of a state legislative leader and a school shooting that killed multiple children — all within the last year. She avoided direct mention of ongoing fraud investigations into the child care programs that Trump has made a political cudgel. A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans. The 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti. The country's TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3. Senate Democrats are threatening to block legislation that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies, potentially bringing the government a step closer to a partial shutdown if Republicans and the White House do not agree to new restrictions on President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. If those are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown at midnight on Friday. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that Democrats won't provide needed votes until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “reined in and overhauled.”</p>

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats voted to block legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies Thursday as they continued to negotiate with Republicans and the White House on new restrictions for President Donald Trump's surge of immigration enforcement. Thursday's 45-55 test vote came as Democrats have threatened a partial government shutdown when money runs out on Friday. As the country reels from the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis, irate Senate Democrats laid out a list of demands on Wednesday, including that officers take off their masks and identify themselves and obtain warrants for arrest. If those are not met, Democrats say they are prepared to block the wide-ranging spending bill, denying Republicans the votes they need to pass it and triggering a shutdown. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said that Democrats won't provide needed votes until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “reined in and overhauled” and that this is “a moment of truth.” They do not support ICE terrorizing our streets and killing American citizens,” Schumer said. In the deal under discussion, Homeland Security would still be funded but for a short time to allow for negotiations on the Democrats' demands. Still, with no agreement and an uncertain path ahead, the standoff threatened to plunge the country into another shutdown just two months after Democrats blocked a spending bill over expiring federal health care subsidies, a dispute that closed the government for 43 days as Republicans refused to negotiate. That shutdown ended when a small group of moderate Democrats broke away to strike a deal with Republicans, but Democrats are more unified this time after the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents. Kicking off a Cabinet meeting, Trump said his administration is speaking with congressional Democrats. “We're working on that right now,” Trump said while declining to go into specifics. He added: “We don't want a shutdown.” There's a lot of “unanimity and shared purpose” within the Democratic caucus, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith said after a lunch meeting Wednesday. “Boil it all down, what we are talking about is that these lawless ICE agents should be following the same rules that your local police department does,” Smith said. Earlier Thursday, Tom Homan, the president's border czar, said during a press conference in Minneapolis that federal immigration officials are working on a plan to begin drawing down the number of agents in Minnesota but that it would depend on cooperation from state authorities. It's unclear how far those assurances will go in satisfying Democrats. Amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, Schumer said Democrats are asking the White House to “end roving patrols” in cities and coordinate with local law enforcement on immigration arrests, including requiring tighter rules for warrants. Democrats also want an enforceable code of conduct so agents are held accountable when they violate rules. Schumer said agents should be required to have “masks off, body cameras on” and carry proper identification, as is common practice in most law enforcement agencies. The Democratic caucus is united in those “common sense reforms” and the burden is on Republicans to accept them, Schumer said, as he has pushed for the Homeland Security spending to be separated out to avoid a broader shutdown. As the two sides negotiated, it was unclear whether they could agree on anything that would satisfy Democrats who want Trump's aggressive crackdown to end. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, has said that Congress should not send “another penny” to ICE until Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is fired. And across the Capitol, House Republicans have said they do not want any changes to the bill they passed last week. In a letter to Trump on Tuesday, the conservative House Freedom Caucus wrote that its members stand with the Republican president and ICE. Just ahead of the Senate vote, Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, called for Democrats to vote to move forward on the bill so they could negotiate the changes ahead of final passage. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he is opposed to the Democrats' proposal to require the immigration enforcement officers to show their faces, even as he blamed Noem for decisions that he said are “tarnishing” the agency's reputation. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham posted on X that he was putting his Senate colleagues “on notice” that if Democrats try to make changes, he would insist on new language preventing local governments from resisting the Trump administration's immigration policies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn, speaks during a field hearing on immigration Friday, Jan. 16, 2026, in St. Paul, Minn. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Thursday she is running for governor of Minnesota, promising to take on President Donald Trump while unifying a state that has endured a series of challenges even before the federal government's immigration crackdown. Klobuchar's decision gives Democrats a high-profile candidate and proven statewide winner as their party tries to hold onto the office occupied by Gov. The 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Walz abandoned his campaign for a third term this month amid criticism over mismanagement of taxpayer funding for child care programs. “These times call for leaders who can stand up and not be rubber stamps of this administration — but who are also willing to find common ground and fix things in our state.” Klobuchar cited Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota, federal officers killing two Minnesotans, the assassination of a state legislative leader and a school shooting that killed multiple children — all within the past year. She avoided direct mention of ongoing fraud investigations into the child care programs that Trump has made a political cudgel. The other races are in Alabama, Colorado and Tennessee. Among them are MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, a 2020 election denier who is close to Trump; state House Speaker Lisa Demuth; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator who was the party's 2022 gubernatorial candidate; and state Rep. Kristin Robbins. The Minnesota contest is likely to test Trump and his fellow Republicans' uncompromising law-and-order approach and mass deportation program against Democrats' criticisms of his administration's tactics. Federal agents have detained children and adults who are U.S. citizens, entered homes without warrants and engaged protesters in violent exchanges. On Saturday, federal officers fatally shot ICU nurse Alex Pretti during an encounter. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill, in turn, have voted against spending bills that fund Trump's Department of Homeland Security. Trump and other Republicans also will try to saddle Klobuchar — or any other Democrat — with questions about the federal investigation into Minnesota's child care programs and its Somali community. Trump also has made repeated assertions of widespread fraud in state government, and his administration is conducting multiple investigations of state officials, including Walz. Demuth was quick to release a new video and a web page that illustrate what's likely to be another main line of her campaign: that Klobuchar cannot be trusted to end the fraud in public programs or curb the growth of government. “Minnesotans only need to look at her record to know that she simply cannot deliver the change that our state needs, and would be nothing more than a third term of Tim Walz,” Demuth said in a statement. Now in her fourth Senate term, Klobuchar is a former local prosecutor and onetime presidential candidate who positions herself as a moderate and has demonstrated the ability to win across Minnesota. She won her 2024 reelection bid by nearly 16 percentage points and received 135,000 more votes than Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Harris outpaced Trump by fewer than 5 percentage points. Klobuchar gained attention during Trump's first term for her questioning of his judicial nominees, including now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. At Kavanaugh's acrimonious confirmation hearings, she asked the future justice, who had been accused of sexual assault as a teenager, if he ever had so much to drink that he didn't remember what happened. Kavanaugh, who was confirmed by a single vote, later apologized to Klobuchar. As Senate Rules Committee chair, she pressed Capitol Police, administration officials and others for details of what authorities knew beforehand and how rioters breached the Capitol. “It's our duty to have immediate responses to what happened,” she said after helping write a report focused not on Trump's role but on better security protocols for the seat of Congress. But Biden, then a former vice president, trounced her and others in the South Carolina primaries, prompting her to drop out and join others in closing ranks behind him. After Biden's victory, Klobuchar would have been well-positioned for a Cabinet post, perhaps even attorney general. But the Senate's 50-50 split made it untenable for Biden to create any opening for Republicans to regain control of the chamber. Klobuchar announced in 2021 that she had been treated for breast cancer and in 2024 announced that she was cancer-free but undergoing another round of radiation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Border czar outlines plan: White House border czar Tom Homan said he has ordered federal immigration authorities to work on an eventual drawdown plan for law enforcement in Minnesota. • New potential guidelines: The administration is considering new guidelines for federal immigration officers in Minnesota, including plans to avoid engaging with “agitators” and only focusing on immigrants with convictions or facing criminal charges, officials familiar with the talks told CNN. • Alex Pretti shooting: Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said footage showing a clash between Pretti and federal agents over a week before he was killed did not justify the protester's killing. Federal officers involved in the shooting are on administrative leave per standard protocol, DHS said. The letter blasts Bondi for making demands this weekend of Gov. Tim Walz that they said “are without lawful basis and inconsistent with fundamental principles of our federal system.” Border czar Tom Homan tried to turn the page in Minnesota on Thursday. But despite his pragmatic rhetoric and focus on how to move forward, it remains unclear what the future looks like. Eyes are now back on Washington, DC, where President Donald Trump is convening his Cabinet officials for a meeting Thursday morning. It'll be Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's first public appearance since her controversial press conference on Saturday in the immediate aftermath of Alex Pretti's killing in an encounter with federal agents. The president and his top officials have publicly and privately maintained that Trump still has full confidence in Noem, even as he has moved to sideline one of his top officials on the ground, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino. Similar questions have swirled around deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller's standing. Like Noem, he was quick to malign Pretti in the wake of his death. Miller has since sought to suggest Customs and Border Protection may not have been following proper protocol. But Miller is viewed as the mastermind of Trump's immigration agenda — and new questions have emerged as to whether the administration's shifting strategy will ultimately impact how he operates moving forward. Increased cooperation between county jail systems and immigration authorities would be key to the Department of Homeland Security drawing down on the number of federal agents posted in Minnesota, ﻿White House border czar Tom Homan said in a news conference this morning. Homan said he spoke to Minnesota officials, including state Attorney General Keith Ellison, who “clarified for me that county jails may notify ICE of the release dates of criminal public safety risks, so ICE can take custody of them upon their release from the jail.” ICE and Customs and Border Protection staff are working on a draw down plan for Minnesota “based on the cooperation” of local officials, Homan said. By the way, we do that now,” Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said in a CNN town hall last night. The opinion also notes that county sheriffs may not unilaterally set up cooperation agreements with ICE without approval from their board of commissioners. When kicking off his news conference in Minneapolis, border czar Tom Homan said he would be “staying ‘til the problem's gone,” but added that he has ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a “drawdown plan” for law enforcement in Minnesota following two fatal shootings. “I didn't come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” Homan said. Sharing details about his conversations with Minnesota officials, Homan said state Attorney General Keith Ellison told him county jails “may notify ICE of the release dates” of “criminal public safety risks” so ICE can take them into custody. While Homan stressed that immigration operations are focused on criminal undocumented immigrants who pose public safety or national security threats, he said anyone who has crossed the border illegally remains at risk of deportation. Homan said he that neither he nor President Donald Trump wants anyone to die, but stressed that “the hostile rhetoric and dangerous threats and hate” against immigration enforcement agents “must stop.” Homan refused to talk about the shootings by federal agents in Minnesota — which killed two US citizens — citing ongoing investigations. CNN's Chris Boyette, Kaanita Iyer, Michael Williams and Kit Maher contributed reporting. He used his first public appearance since arriving in the state to do something many top administration officials have so far been reluctant, and at times unwilling, to do: acknowledge mistakes have been made in how federal immigration authorities have been carrying out the president's agenda. And he said changes are in the process of being enacted. Upholding “public safety should be paramount,” he said, is a higher priority than the administration's deportation agenda. Homan also emphasized that he is working on a “draw down plan” — something Minnesota's Democratic leaders have relentlessly requested. But he cautioned that such a reduction in federal resources would be dependent upon cooperation with local leaders. It was a remarkable shift in tone from the aggressive and defiant language the president's top immigration officials used after Alex Pretti was fatally shot in an encounter with federal agents. Homan notably did not mention Pretti's name and quickly redirected questions about his killing by maintaining the administration is going to “let the investigation play out.” White House border czar Tom Homan thanked local and state officials in Minnesota whom he had already met with as well as those he has yet to meet with during a news conference on Thursday. Border czar Tom Homan refused to talk about the shootings by federal agents in Minnesota — which killed two US citizens — citing ongoing investigations. When asked at a news conference about a new video that surfaced of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot Saturday, Homan said, “I'm not going to comment on any shootings.” “I'm not going to come out and make any comments.” Earlier this month, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by a federal agent. Homan said the rhetoric has caused an increase in assaults on immigration agents and forced the administration to send in additional resources to Minnesota. Homan said he has spoken with local law enforcement leaders about keeping agents safe as a way to ultimately draw down the amount of federal agents on the ground. White House border czar Tom Homan on Thursday acknowledged that Americans have a right to protest federal immigration enforcement. “You have your First Amendment rights — I support that,” Homan said during a press conference in Minneapolis today. His comments represent a notable departure from how other top officials had referred to protesters. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino had repeatedly called those protesting federal immigration operations in the city “agitators,” “rioters,” or “insurrectionists.” Homan added that threatening, impeding or assaulting law enforcement is “never okay” and there will be “zero tolerance” for doing so. When asked by CNN's Shimon Prokupecz how the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota was allowed to proceed in the manner it has and create fear among residents, White House border czar Tom Homan said the extra resources were brought in to provide security. Tim Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, the border czar said. Trump border czar Tom Homan shared details during a press conference about his conversations with Minnesota officials, saying state Attorney General Keith Ellison told him county jails “may notify ICE of the release dates” of “criminal public safety risks” so ICE can take them into custody. However, what they disagreed on was the officials' involvement in immigration enforcement. While President Trump's border czar Tom Homan stressed that immigration operations are focused on criminal undocumented immigrants who pose public safety or national security threats, he said anyone who has crossed the border illegally remains at risk of deportation. “We got a lot of them to keep us busy.” Federal officers who don't act with professionalism will be “dealt with, like any other federal agency,” White House border czar Tom Homan said while highlighting the challenging environment ICE officers and CBP agents are working in amid immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota. They put their selves on the line for this nation every day,” he added. White House border czar Tom Homan said on Thursday that he has ordered federal immigration authorities to work on a “drawdown plan” for law enforcement in Minnesota following two fatal shootings. Homan, who was deployed by the Trump administration to Minneapolis to replace Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino following Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, said officers would be more focused on working in jails and prisons, and less focused on the street operations that have drawn heavy criticism for their severe and sweeping tactics. “This is common-sense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here.” “Yes, I said it,” he added, “draw down the number of people here.” President Trump's border czar Tom Homan acknowledged that federal immigration operations have not been “perfect.” That's exactly what I'm doing here,” Homan said Thursday at a press conference in Minneapolis. Homan, who has a long history in immigration enforcement and previously served as a Border Patrol agent, said he didn't come to Minnesota looking photo ops or headlines. “What we've been working on is making this operation safer, more efficient, by the book,” Homan said. “I didn't come to Minnesota for photo ops or headlines,” Homan said. Tim Walz, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “One thing we did agree on … was that community safety is paramount,” Homan said. Starting his press conference in Minneapolis, border czar Tom Homan said he would be “staying ‘til the problem's gone.” Homan replaces Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official whose tactics across several American cities have garnered criticism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, right, welcomes UN Secretary General António Guterres to 10 Downing Street, London, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026. UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump's latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution. The board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president's ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security. The board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership. But Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials. “In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.” In Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump's latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.” “If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said. The four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany. Letters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump's vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump's demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable. “No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China's U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday. He called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council's status and role “are irreplaceable.” India did not attend Trump's signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation. “It's hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump's wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. Eight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump's global peacemaking plan. The Crisis Group's Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump's ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks. “I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.</p>

Former presidential speechwriter Bill McGurn analyzes President Donald Trump's speech in Iowa and the messaging heading into the midterm elections on 'Fox & Friends.' House Republicans are rolling out a massive election overhaul package ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, including new voter ID requirements as well as limitations on how and when votes are cast. The Committee on House Administration is unveiling new legislation on Thursday called the Make Elections Great Again (MEGA) Act, which would impose new federal standards on national elections across the U.S. It comes as the Senate sees a renewed pressure campaign led by Elon Musk and others to take up that legislation. "Americans should be confident their elections are being run with integrity — including commonsense voter ID requirements, clean voter rolls, and citizenship verification," Committee on House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said in a statement. He said the bill's guardrails "will improve voter confidence, bolster election integrity, and make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat." Progressive Democrats and groups like the League of Women Voters have argued that photo ID laws disenfranchise minority voters, while the Heritage Foundation pointed out that it's shown to be popular across multiple public polls. Rep. Bryan Steil sits at a Trump rally in Wisconsin. Steil's elections bill would also ban ranked-choice voting in federal races, require states to use auditable paper ballots rather than electronic slips, and impose stronger requirements on voter list maintenance to ensure rolls are up to date. The new legislation comes ahead of what's expected to be a difficult midterm election season for Republicans. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Oct. 20, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Fox News Digital reached out to the White House to ask whether it supports Steil's bill but did not hear back by press time.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy joins 'America's Newsroom' to weigh in after extreme turbulence forced a Delta Airlines flight to divert to Minneapolis and as NTSB hearings begin on the deadly Washington, DC crash from January. Not all flight routes are created equal when it comes to turbulence. The organization analyzed nearly 10,000 flight routes connecting more than 550 of the world's largest airports — using recorded flight tracks and turbulence forecast data, the analysis said. Turbulence was measured using eddy dissipation rate (EDR), a standard aviation metric that captures how rough the air is during a flight. Routes were ranked based on their average turbulence levels, with EDR values categorized as light, moderate, moderate-to-severe, severe and extreme. Trips from Denver to Jackson Hole were ranked the most turbulent route in North America in 2025. It recorded an average turbulence score of 18.18 as well, placing it in the light turbulence category. In 2024, this route ranked the highest average turbulence with a score of 17.45, Turbli said. This route covers roughly 205 miles and recorded an average turbulence score of 17.68, according to the data. That places it within the light turbulence range based on eddy dissipation rate measurements. Flights along this roughly 391-mile route drew an average turbulence score of 17.54. That reading falls within the light turbulence range. Flights between Bozeman and Denver logged an average turbulence reading of 17.22 over a distance of about 524 miles, placing the route in the light turbulence category. Outside the U.S., Turbli's rankings showed turbulence was most pronounced on routes in South America and Asia, with several of the bumpiest flights crossing mountainous regions in Chile, Argentina and western China. Outside the U.S., the bumpiest routes were largely in South America and Asia, often over mountainous regions. Routes in Europe, Oceania and Africa generally recorded lower average turbulence levels, though certain short-haul flights still ranked high within their regions. While turbulence can feel alarming, the Federal Aviation Administration has noted that it is a normal part of air travel and is often unpredictable, even when skies appear clear. The FAA advises passengers to keep seat belts fastened whenever they are seated, as most turbulence-related injuries occur when travelers are not buckled in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MINNEAPOLIS — The top White House official handling negotiations with Minnesota officials about Immigration and Customs Enforcement‘s presence in the state said “great progress” has been made during talks this week, and federal agencies are now working on a “drawdown” plan. “I have staff from CBP and from ICE working on a drawdown plan,” White House border czar Tom Homan said during a press conference on Thursday. Still, he committed to staying in town until the city, state, and federal government agree on how to move forward following the deaths of two U.S. citizens who protested and interfered in ICE operations. “This is common sense cooperation that allows us to draw down the number of people we have here,” Homan said. “What we did agree about is not to release public safety risks back in the community,” Homan said of the conversations he had with local leaders. Homan touted that the state prison system under the Department of Corrections has been honoring ICE requests to detain illegal immigrants in custody for them to be transferred in a secure jail setting rather than allowed to be released. “The Minnesota state prison system, under the Department of Corrections, has been honoring ICE detainers, and we appreciate that important collaboration, and we're going to expand upon that,” Homan said at an early press conference inside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. “[Ellison] has clarified for me that county jails may notify ICE of the release dates of criminal public safety risks so ICE can take custody upon their release from the jail,” Homan said. Homan arrived in Minneapolis on Monday evening, two days after protester Alex Pretti was killed in a Border Patrol-involved shooting during immigration enforcement actions on Jan. 24. Since arriving, Homan has met with Walz, Ellison, Frey, police chiefs, and sheriffs. Bovino was replaced by Homan, who will oversee the operations from Washington, but will be in the Midwest this week, meeting with local and state police and elected officials to try to strike a deal about working together to apprehend illegal immigrants with criminal histories.</p>

White House border czar Tom Homan vowed Thursday to remain in Minnesota leading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations there "until the problem is gone." White House border czar Tom Homan vowed Thursday to remain in Minnesota leading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations there "until the problem is gone." Homan made the statement during a Thursday morning news conference, his first since President Donald Trump sent him to the Twin Cities earlier this week. He said the administration is working on a "drawdown plan" to decrease presence of federal agents in the state. The border chief said he had a "very productive" meeting with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Wednesday. Ellison agreed to notify ICE when local jails were releasing violent illegal aliens, a major request from federal law enforcement. "One ICE agent can arrest one bad guy when he's behind the safety and security of a jail when he's behind bars and we know he doesn't have weapons," Homan said. "But when you release that public safety threat illegal alien back into the community--We have a job to do. Border czar Tom Homan speaks during a news conference about ongoing immigration enforcement operations on January 29, 2026 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. "So now what happens is now we've got to arrest somebody on his turf where he has access to who knows what weapons. Now we've got to send a whole team out," Homan explained. Homan went on to demand that the "hostile rhetoric" and threats against ICE officers has to stop, vowing that agents will remain in the Twin Cities to do their jobs. "President Trump wants this fixed and I'm going to fix it with your help," Homan said. Trump deployed Homan to Minnesota after heated clashes between anti-ICE agitators and federal agents across the Twin Cities. Tim Walz, right, have faced criticism from the Trump administration. The Trump administration has accused Minnesota leaders of encouraging harassment of federal law enforcement, singling out Ellison, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Members of the Chicago Teachers Union filmed themselves protesting federal immigration enforcement and anti-DEI measures at a local Target on Friday, sparking criticism both online and from experts who spoke to Fox News Digital. In a video posted on Tuesday by the union, members can be seen entering a Chicago area Target holding anti-ICE signs, harassing employees and demanding answers about whether Target will "protect" its employees from ICE. "They can use their Fourth Amendment rights and post signs that demand ICE show warrants to enter their building. Chicago Teachers Union members showed up on a Friday to harass Target shoppers and employees. "The CTU can't help itself — they feel compelled to weigh in on every political issue," Teacher Freedom Alliance posted on X. "And they bankroll these so-called ‘protests' with your tax dollars." Erika Donalds, America First Policy Institute's chair of education opportunity, told Fox News Digital that the statement made by the union "tells you everything about the goals of today's teachers unions." "They're harassing retailers and pushing radical politics instead of doing the job they're paid to do: advocate for the best education for our nation's children. Nicole Neily, founder and president of Defending Education, told Fox News Digital the union priorities aren't in line with what's best for students. "Union thugs bullying hourly employees in Target stores isn't brave or just — it's naked intimidation of people who are simply trying to earn a paycheck," Neily said. Thousands of people gather in Union Park, Chicago, to demonstrate against the Trump administration's labor and immigration policies, in May 2025. "The Chicago Teachers Union lost the plot a long time ago, and this is yet another example of their skewed priorities. While the CTU clout-chases on X, two-thirds of Chicago Public Schools students can't read at grade level, and four out of five children can't do math at grade level." Fox News Digital reached out to the union for comment. Earlier this month, CTU faced blowback from the Washington Post for pursuing social justice initiatives in its school district even as student reading and math proficiency continues to decline. In an editorial, the Post took aim at the CTU's New Year's resolutions posted to X on Monday. The union stated that its resolution is to "speak truth to power," and it committed to "defending Black and brown and immigrant communities who are targeted by federal agents," as well as "fighting back against an administration trying to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and roll back civil rights protections." "Those are lofty goals in a school district that can hardly teach kids to read and write," the Post quipped. Fox News Digital's Marc Tamasco contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TRUMP'S LATEST PUTIN CALL: President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social last night that he had an hour and 15-minute phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it a “good conversation,” but not one “that will lead to immediate peace.” In the call, Putin apparently complained about Ukraine's latest audacious coordinated drone strike deep into Russia against five airfields that hit 15 warplanes that were parked on the ground, including bombers, fighter jets, and helicopters, according to videos posted on social media. While Putin groused about Ukraine hitting legitimate military targets, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine is bracing for another massive Russian drone and missile attack, which in recent days have hit civilian targets, including apartment buildings and a passenger train. “We also know that the Russians are preparing a new strike — our intelligence indicates this,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address. “Now the United States, Europe, and all our partners have to understand how this discredits diplomatic talks. Putin, Rubio said, has boxed himself in by telling the Russian people his army is having great success, when in reality it's making only slow incremental gains at the cost of horrific casualties. “In the case of Russia, they've been telling their people for two and a half years that they're winning this war overwhelmingly, so people are going to wonder, ‘Why are we giving up land if we're winning so strongly?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Amy Klobuchar launched a Democratic bid for governor on Thursday, pledging to unify her state and move beyond a deadly battle with the federal government over immigration. “These times call for leaders who can stand up and not be rubber stamps of this administration,” Klobuchar said in an announcement video. “But who are also willing to find common ground and fix things in our state.” Klobuchar, who has served in Washington for two decades, is seeking to govern Minnesota during an extraordinarily fraught moment. The state has become the epicenter of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has sparked waves of outrage and protest from residents, particularly after two fatal shootings of protesters by federal agents. “We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is,” she said, “but in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom, and simple decency and good will.” Her formal entry into the race comes after Gov. Tim Walz ended his reelection bid in the wake of a deepening federal investigation into widespread fraud of social service programs in Minnesota. Nearly a dozen Republicans were running for governor in hopes of challenging Walz, though one candidate left the race to protest what he called “retribution on the citizens of our state,” two days after a Border Patrol agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti. In a four-minute campaign video, Klobuchar did not explicitly mention Trump by name or the broader immigration challenges facing the state, but she denounced the “3,000 ICE agents on our streets and in our towns, sent by an Administration that relishes division.” As she debated whether to stay in the Senate or run for governor, friends say, she often talked about the appeal of serving as a chief executive without the limitations of a dysfunctional Congress. She joins a long list of lawmakers from both parties who are retiring or seeking an office away from Washington, though she is not planning to resign as she embarks on her campaign. If she wins in November, Klobuchar could resign and allow Walz to appoint her successor or choose her own replacement after being sworn in as governor. Two days later, an ICE agent killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman. Klobuchar began considering jumping into the governor's race long before unrest rocked Minnesota in the wake of Good's death and intensified after Pretti was killed. She is expected to largely clear the Democratic field, party strategists say, even though some progressive leaders have not ruled out recruiting a candidate to challenge her in the primary. Klobuchar, who previously served as Hennepin County Attorney in Minneapolis, won her first US Senate race in 2006 with 58% of the vote. The closest challenge came in 2024, when she still won by 16 points. Klobuchar's ability to reach voters across the political spectrum will be tested anew in this highly polarized moment. “I'm asking Democrats, Independents, and Republicans to join our campaign,” Klobuchar said in her announcement video. It is for people who believe in something bigger than ourselves.” While Klobuchar has not entirely ruled out running for president again, as she did in 2020, aides acknowledge it would be difficult to enter the 2028 Democratic primary because she would have to launch a campaign during the first year of her term as governor if she wins her race. Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and a right-wing conspiracy theorist, is also running. No Republican has won a statewide election in Minnesota since 2006, a point that Chris Madel, the Minneapolis lawyer who dropped his gubernatorial bid in protest of the federal immigration crackdown cited in his critique of the national GOP. The world is watching,” Klobuchar said in a social media post after Pretti's death. Some progressives are calling for the abolishment of ICE and other Democrats like Klobuchar have advocated a more nuanced approach, even as many Republicans blame local Democratic officials for encouraging protestors to confront federal immigration agents. The White House has signaled a retreat from some of its hardline positions on the Minnesota immigration operation, mindful of being on the wrong side of public opinion with what advisers acknowledge Americans are viewing with their own eyes. When Walz dropped his reelection bid, he said he did not want to be a distraction amid that deepening fraud probe in the state from social service programs intended to feed children during the pandemic. He is not accused of wrongdoing but faces criticism for failing to swiftly respond. More than 90 people have been charged in prosecutions that began during the Biden administration. Many of those charged are of Somali descent, which allies of Trump have cited as grounds for launching “Operation Metro Surge” even as many Somali community members in the Twin Cities are US citizens. “I don't like fraud or waste in government – that's why I went after crime as county attorney,” Klobuchar said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chatty, bright-eyed children surrounded US Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon as she walked with them through an airy building in Texas. Part of a 50-state tour, this stop last year was at an unusual institution: the Austin campus of Alpha, a chain of private schools that educates students from grades K-12 using AI to speed-teach core academic subjects in just two hours a day. They emphasize learning through AI rather than human teachers. There's no homework and no textbooks — just software that students use each morning to learn, with human “guides” for motivation and classroom support. Students then sit down in front of laptops, plug in headsets or even virtual reality sets, and learn academics through an AI tutor. The two-hour curriculum includes four 30-minute sessions in math, science, social studies and language, and 20 minutes of additional learning concepts, like test taking skills. “There is so much to do, so much opportunity that I'm just seeing here,” McMahon declared during her visit, at a roundtable with students and MacKenzie Price, one of Alpha's founders and its public face. The Trump administration has said that it wants to pioneer new uses of AI in schools, and McMahon has held up Alpha, whose network spans over a dozen locations across the US, as an exemplar of where education should be headed. Amid this, parents across the country are seeking out alternatives to traditional public schools. With AI already increasingly common in education — 6 in 10 teachers used an AI tool in the 2024-2025 school year, according to a Walton Family Foundation and Gallup poll — turning to AI-led learning would seem to be one cutting-edge option. Some parents say their experiences with Alpha have lived up to the promise of providing a new, exciting and better education for their children. She withdrew her two daughters from the school in 2024. “I realized that the school is not the right fit for us,” she wrote to Price at the time, noting issues such as the reliance on apps as sole teachers, lack of support for students from human teachers and punishing hours children were keeping in order to keep up with AI-set metrics as points of contention she and other parents had raised. “There is no accurate or fair way” to hold the Brownsville experience from those early years “as representative of the current Alpha student or school experience,” the school said, adding that Alpha now has many families across all of its campuses who have positive experiences. More broadly today, though, experts say there is little outside scrutiny of Alpha's model and how successful it really is at teaching children. “What has been a big concern amongst scholars and researchers is that Alpha is refusing to allow for any independent research to evaluate the claims or to really scrutinize what's going on from disinterested parties,” said Victor Lee, an associate professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education. In lengthy replies to CNN's request seeking comment, Alpha defended its methods and results, and insisted that characterizations from critics who spoke to CNN were “false” or “misrepresentative.” Outside experts who question the school's transparency and results “are people unfamiliar with Alpha's approach and it should be presented as such,” the school said. However, Alpha declined several months of requests from CNN reporters to visit its campuses or speak to Price, its co-founder, for this story. (The company told CNN last autumn that they had “paused” non-essential visits as they “fielded 15-20 requests per day from not only media but national and international academic institutions, school leaders around the world” and others, though some media coverage has surfaced since then.) A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Alpha School is reimagining K–12 education by equipping students with practical AI skills and preparing them for a rapidly evolving technology-driven workforce.” Alpha bills itself as an alternative model for education, with a twist. “What if I told you this school has no teachers, and students learn academics through an AI tutor, on AI apps that give each students a one-to-one personalized mastery-based academic journey that guarantees success,” Price says in a 2024 promotional video. Since opening its doors to a few dozen students in Austin, Alpha has expanded to major cities like Miami and San Francisco, as well as smaller cities and towns like Brownsville and, more recently, Chantilly, Virginia. Some of its campuses are selective to focus on sports or high academic achievers. CNN attended a prospective parent information session in Chantilly where Alpha leadership described its teaching model, as well as some of the projects students have engaged in, including second graders running 5Ks and third graders competing in triathlons. Jennifer Gabler, a Brownsville midwife and former math teacher, says that her children — aged 7, 11, and 13 — have thrived at Alpha since they enrolled in March 2023, after previously being homeschooled. Her youngest rapidly improved her reading skills, Gabler said, telling CNN: “She went from zero to 100 in four or five weeks, and she loved it. Alpha motivates students by offering the children “incentives,” which they are either given or asked to propose as rewards for performing well. Students' progress is tracked through Alpha's online platform on a daily basis, and these metrics are used to measure performance. Gabler has seen incentives ranging from hosting a pajama and movie day, stopping by the local cafe or spending a day at the trampoline park. But they have also included more lavish prizes like money or even funding for overseas field trips. Alpha told CNN children have access to human teachers for handwriting, reading specialists and specialists for diverse learners, who are credentialed in those areas. According to Alpha, the two hours of AI learning is on par with the amount of screen time US students in traditional schools get across a day. According to job postings for guide roles — which can pay up to six figures a year — the guide “won't grade papers or follow a curriculum.” Instead, “you'll lead workshops, ignite curiosity, and prove that learning knows no bounds when students own their education.” Guides are not required to have post-graduate or education degrees — only a bachelor's in any field is required — and can have varying amounts of experience with children or education, depending on the role. Two former guides told CNN that non-disclosure agreements were part of their employment contract with Alpha, which the school says are used to protect proprietary information. One of the guides, who CNN agreed not to name because they signed an NDA, described a relaxed, informal environment with no classrooms. Gabler said she appreciated the way Alpha is “always kind of trying to change and improve things, and so the children have learned to be very flexible.” “I would say there have been several learning curves because Alpha is not a static school,” she said. “I think it's challenging for children when things suddenly change, but it's a great life skill for them to learn the sort of resilience to that sudden changing.” When a student is struggling with a lesson, the guide is there to encourage the child to figure it out on their own, oftentimes through YouTube links or Google searches, but, according to Gabler, no teaching from the guides takes place. “Alpha has a very strong policy that they will have zero teaching from their staff. Gabler, whose children continue to attend the Brownsville school, says she has noticed improvements to the AI apps last year that she felt helped cut down on stress. Alpha says that its approach to academics is successful, claiming its students learn twice as fast as their peers at schools across the country. It backs the claim by measuring results against a national test, the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test, which tracks knowledge acquisition across subjects by grade level. A report Alpha provided to CNN measuring its students from fall 2024 to spring 2025 shows the schools' students outperformed their peers nationally on subjects like math, science and reading over grades K-12. Reich, a former middle school teacher, expressed skepticism of the hyper-individualized learning method being used by Alpha. “I think if you ask most people about the kinds of experiences that they have in schools that meant the most to them, they are more orchestral than individual,” he said. “What kinds of neighborhoods will we have if each kid is trained to optimize their own individual, you know, accomplishments? The advocates Alpha has attracted include billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a supporter of President Donald Trump, who has called Alpha a “breakthrough innovation in K-12 education,” and Trump's Department of Education secretary. This month, first lady First Lady Melania Trump delivered remarks at a virtual event on “how artificial intelligence can be used responsibly, creatively, and confidently,” that also featured an Alpha student as a speaker. Elon Musk has reposted favorable press coverage on X, and, according to a 2024 promotional video, half of the students who attended the Alpha school in Brownsville were children of SpaceX employees. AI does have a role to play in education, but, he said, “I'm really hesitant for Alpha school to be the sort of mascot of AI and education.” Besides expanding its private schools, Alpha has also attempted to gain some footholds in public education through a public-charter network called Unbound Academy, which offers a virtual version of its school, completely online. “There's a concern that what works in one context, we don't know if it works in another context,” he said. The move to Alpha's school in Brownsville in 2022 was supposed to be a positive one for Jessica Lopez's two daughters — and a chance for her older daughter, who is autistic and had always excelled academically, to reach new academic heights. The fact that students could learn at their own pace and have specialized lessons seemed like an appealing model for her needs, Lopez said. But Lopez said she almost immediately noticed a change in both her girls after they started at Alpha. In a 2023 town hall with parents and Alpha employees seen by CNN, several parents expressed their concern with how the daily data-driven metrics seemed to supersede learning. Some children were staying up late into the night or logging extra hours on their apps to boost their metrics, sometimes leading to anxiety and tears, some parents said. After their second year, Lopez decided to withdraw her children and enroll them in public school, where she says she discovered that the girls had fallen behind. “They were doing what the school wanted them to do. In the end, it really wasn't out of joy,” Lopez said, adding that she felt that, by the end of their time at Alpha, her children had turned “zombie-like.” In text messages from the group seen by CNN, some suggested their children were being pressured to engage in school activities they didn't want to do, under the guise of building grit and testing their limits.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Democratic leaders frame their proposals as a civil liberties safeguard, immigration enforcement veterans warn that it would collapse the administrative warrant system that underpins nearly all ICE arrests. Judicial warrants are tied to federal criminal offenses and require a judge's approval. Those warrants allow ICE to arrest and remove noncitizens who are unlawfully present or subject to final orders of removal, even if they have not committed a standalone federal crime. Democrats now want ICE to use judicial warrants for arrests instead. Jonathan Fahey, who briefly served as Trump's acting director of ICE in his first term, told the Washington Examiner that such a requirement would make immigration enforcement functionally impossible. “The only judicial warrant you can get is for a federal crime,” Fahey said. “There is no judicial mechanism to arrest someone solely for being here illegally. If you impose that standard, ICE simply cannot do its job.” Fahey said the result would be de facto amnesty for most illegal immigrants, including those convicted of serious state crimes such as domestic violence, sexual assault, or repeat drunk driving. “So if you have any legal alien, and say they commit domestic violence in wherever Minnesota, wherever they get released on bail or get released after their sentence, ICE couldn't arrest that person under a judicial warrant,” Fahey said. Republicans argue that the outcome is not theoretical but inevitable if Democrats' demands are enacted. “It would effectively provide amnesty to illegal immigrants who have not committed a federal felony.” Democrats' push intensified after media reports about a May 12 internal ICE memo from acting Director Todd Lyons stating that officers may rely on administrative warrants to arrest individuals subject to final orders of removal inside their residences. The memo says DHS lawyers concluded that neither the Constitution nor immigration statutes prohibit that practice, even though ICE historically exercised caution in doing so. The guidance was immediately portrayed by Democrats as lawless overreach. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who received the memo from whistleblowers, has argued that requiring judicial warrants for immigration enforcement is a basic constitutional safeguard. Blumenthal said Democrats are seeking to “take back control of a rogue agency” and insisted the proposed restrictions would not prevent ICE from carrying out its mission. “They should be eager to adopt constraints and reforms on ICE that the American people want.” Chad Mizelle, a former chief of staff to Attorney General Pam Bondi, said this week that the memo reflects settled law, including binding appellate precedent that Democrats are now attempting to override through appropriations. Read the en banc court's decision in US v Lucas. The ruling is especially significant because illegal aliens are recognized to have a lesser privacy interest than U.S. citizens under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, a point immigration hawks say Democrats gloss over. However, some constitutional law experts say the specific case, settled by an opinion weighed by the full 8th Circuit, might have been too fractured to establish any conclusive precedent. But he warned, “There are problems, and those problems lead me to think that the plurality opinion in Lucas doesn't help the Administration as much as it would like.” The fight over ICE authority has unfolded amid heightened political pressure following two fatal enforcement encounters with protesters in Minnesota this month, which Democrats have cited as evidence that federal immigration operations require new statutory limits. Federal agents shot and killed Renee Good earlier this month during an enforcement operation, followed weeks later by the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti during another federal encounter on Saturday. While the circumstances of both incidents remain under investigation, Democratic lawmakers have pointed to the cases to justify new restrictions on ICE tactics and arrest authority. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) told the Washington Examiner that requiring judicial warrants would paralyze routine ICE operations and embolden interference with federal agents carrying out the law. Schmitt warned that Democratic rhetoric surrounding the Minnesota shootings has helped create a volatile environment. Republicans argue that the judicial warrant demand is not an isolated reform but part of a coordinated effort to tie ICE's hands operationally. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday that Democrats are unified around a package of DHS restrictions, including ending roving patrols, altering warrant rules, imposing a uniform code of conduct and accountability standards, banning masks, and mandating body cameras for agents. All of those proposals had already been gaining traction inside the Democratic caucus earlier this week. Critics say they are designed to cripple enforcement while appearing reasonable on paper. An analysis by MS NOW found that in 61 detention challenges last week, judges ruled against the administration in all but one case, despite a mix of Republican- and Democratic-appointed jurists. Layering a judicial warrant requirement on top of existing legal resistance would effectively shut deportations down altogether, Fahey argued. Blumenthal, however, has dismissed Republican warnings as fearmongering and accused the GOP of blocking reforms for political reasons. “On the merits, they have to be for what we're advocating.” Sen. King says he would accept a CR on DHS funding to avert a partial shutdown and give Congress more time to put in restrictions on ICE Angus King (D-MN) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-CT) are open to passing DHS funding through a short-term continuing resolution to avert a shutdown while Congress debates restrictions on ICE. “This always gets sold as a reasonable middle ground,” Fahey said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were given two new critical directives on Wednesday that will change how they conduct operations in Minnesota. The new orders instruct ICE officers to focus only on arresting illegal immigrants who have criminal charges or convictions. The updated information came in an email from Marcos Charles, the chief of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division, Reuters reported. “We are moving to targeted enforcement of aliens with a criminal history,” read the new directive. The policy change comes after a tumultuous month in Minnesota in which two civilians, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were shot and killed while confronting ICE officers engaged in illegal immigration enforcement operations. “DO NOT COMMUNICATE OR ENGAGE WITH AGITATORS,” officers were advised in an email, Reuters reported. As part of the operational pivot, ICE officers will be supplied with megaphones to communicate loudly and clearly during their operations. Officers will use them to issue commands to protesters, demonstrators, and others in public, while ensuring they “verbalize every step of the arrest process.” The most significant change so far has been the appointment of border czar Tom Homan as a de facto replacement in Minnesota for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Commander-at-Large of the Border Patrol Gregory Bovino. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday and posted on social media that it was a “productive” meeting. Homan is scheduled to hold a press conference on Thursday morning, during which he is expected to announce some of the changes being implemented in Minnesota. However, large groups of protesters have targeted ICE operations throughout the country even before the incidents in Minnesota, beginning after President Donald Trump ordered illegal immigration enforcement operations to commence. ICE officers have endured an “8,000% increase in death threats against them and a more than 1,300% increase in assaults against them,” said the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
