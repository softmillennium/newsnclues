                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former CIA insider has thrown open one of the most controversial files in UFO history. Scotty Newton Miler, an FBI whistleblower and Church Committee witness, claims that the majority of the MJ-12, also called Majestic-12, documents are authentic. These papers, first surfacing in the 1980s, have long been dismissed by mainstream sources as hoaxes or disinformation, yet new declassified material from the Trump-era JFK releases has reignited debate over their credibility. The mysterious documents first appeared in mid-December 1984 when Los Angeles television writer Jamie Shandera received an unmarked package containing an undeveloped 35mm film roll. Bearing a New Mexico postmark but no return address, the film revealed what appeared to be classified briefing documents concerning an alleged government programme studying extraterrestrial phenomena. It was not until 1987 that the wider public became aware of the documents, when British ufologist Timothy Good received a copy from an alleged intelligence source. Moore and Shandera then released their versions to the press. Despite mainstream scepticism, some of the original insiders now argue the papers may have been partially genuine, though possibly mixed with disinformation. Newton, also known as 'Source S-1,' was closely aligned with CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton and testified alongside him during the Church Committee hearings of the 1970s. Newton has now confirmed he leaked the MJ-12 documents, asserting their legitimacy. He claims that certain previously doubted files, including the A.A.W.S.A.P. His statements suggest a deliberate suppression and disinformation campaign orchestrated by the CIA's Office of Global Access, aimed at discrediting genuine evidence of extraterrestrial visitation. Within these declassified records, researchers uncovered supporting evidence for the MJ-12 files. Dr James Lakatski, who had access to the original S.A.P. documents, confirmed that the 'Kona Blue' report referred to historical events rather than a future plan. This lends credence to Newton's assertion that the MJ-12 papers are not mere fabrications but part of a highly controlled intelligence programme. They suggest the US government maintained a sophisticated suppression programme to control information about extraterrestrial activity on Earth, dating back thousands of years. References within the files indicate interstellar visitation may have occurred as far back as 12,000 years ago, challenging conventional historical narratives. However, Newton's whistleblowing and recent corroborations indicate that these denials may have been part of a broader cover-up. With the MJ-12 files now resurfacing and further corroborated by credible insiders, the conversation about UFOs and government transparency is far from over. The documents continue to stir debate among ufologists, historians, and intelligence professionals, suggesting that the story of extraterrestrial encounters may be more than just myth or legend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The marriage of Donald and Melania Trump is reportedly shifting into a strategic power alliance, with the couple prioritising 'career goals' and brand-building over romantic connection in 2026. Speaking on behalf of Psychic Chat, astrologer and tarot reader Inbaal Honigman suggested the President and First Lady are moving away from 'fantasies of love' to focus on their collective influence as a meticulously managed global brand. This assessment follows a high-profile first year back in the White House, where the couple has been seen presenting a united, if professional, front at major state events. Honigman argues that the energy around them is far more calculated than hearts-and-flowers, saying the focus will be on enhancing their 'value' as a couple instead of nurturing their 'love connection'.​ 'They each want to fulfil their career goals as a married couple, but they're not looking for any fantasies of love,' she insisted, suggesting their priorities are firmly rooted in power and influence. Honigman also foresees a hectic and lucrative year for Melania in her own right. One revenue stream, Honigman claimed, will come from Melania's philanthropic interests, positioning her as a high-profile figure across several charitable causes. Beyond that, the psychic believes there is a more discreet commercial layer to Melania's image.​ Those claims arrive as Melania steps further into the spotlight with MELANIA, a feature documentary produced with Amazon MGM Studios that recently held a private black‑tie screening at the White House ahead of its worldwide cinema release. The film tracks the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's latest presidential inauguration, with Melania describing that period as a 'rare and defining moment' requiring 'meticulous care, integrity and uncompromising craftsmanship'. She said the Emperor 'major arcana' Tarot card shows how the former model is 'in complete control of her family', suggesting a commanding presence behind closed doors.​ That same card, she added, underpins a pivotal year for the couple's only child together, Barron Trump, 19. According to reports from People Magazine, the two continue to maintain independent quarters within the White House, coming together primarily for ceremonial duties and shared interests like interior design. Their New Year's Eve appearance prompted similar chatter, with viral clips sparking debate over whether the couple actually kissed at midnight and viewers describing the moment as 'awkward'.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI helped researchers probe the Hubble Space Telescope's archive to find strange celestial objects, including some indescribable by science. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has uncovered more than 1,000 strange cosmic objects in the Hubble Space Telescope's image archive, including some that cannot be explained by science. After searching with the tool for just two days, researchers found 1,300 oddball objects, including chaotic merging galaxies, stars trailing gas, and even some objects that haven't been classified yet. Of these, 800 had never been spotted before, European Space Agency (ESA) officials said in a Jan. 27 statement. "Additional discoveries included galaxies with massive star-forming clumps, jellyfish-looking galaxies with gaseous 'tentacles,' and edge-on planet-forming disks in our own galaxy resembling hamburgers," NASA officials said in a separate statement. “Remarkably, several dozen objects defied existing classification schemes entirely." "Archival observations from the Hubble Space Telescope now stretch back 35 years, providing a treasure trove of data in which astrophysical anomalies might be found," O'Ryan wrote in the paper. "Most of the anomalies were galaxies undergoing mergers or interactions, which exhibit unusual morphologies or trailing, elongated streams of stars and gas," according to the NASA statement. "Others were gravitational lenses, where the gravity of a foreground galaxy distorts spacetime and bends light from a background galaxy into arcs or rings." The researchers' AI tool, called AnomalyMatch, picked up these features after learning patterns from a training dataset. Using tools like this speeds up the traditional means of discovering strange things in the sky, which usually requires manual inspection or a lucky observation.

"While expert astronomers excel at identifying unusual features, the sheer volume of Hubble data makes comprehensive manual review impractical," NASA officials said in a statement. "Citizen science initiatives have helped expand the scope of data analysis, but even these efforts fall short when faced with archives as extensive as Hubble's." — 'This doesn't appear in computer simulations': Hubble maps chaotic history of Andromeda galaxy, and it's nothing like scientists expected — Hubble telescope discovers 'Cloud-9,' a dark and rare 'failed galaxy' that's unlike anything seen before — NASA's Hubble telescope reveals most detailed photos of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS to date AI could help researchers sort through the "data deluge" from these large surveys, perhaps allowing for faster pickups of new objects than ever before, according to the NASA statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Probably the most exciting part of low-budget horror filmmaking is that the films tend to latch themselves onto one singular gimmick and take it to extreme, terrifying levels. In the case of Ian Tuason's directorial debut with Undertone, he taps into something that is far more primal. With a premise centering around a podcaster listening to creepy audio files, Undertone thrives in its simplicity, as it careens to us as this undeniable, exciting new voice in horror. Our podcaster is Evy (Nina Kiri), who has recently moved home to care for her dying mother (Michèle Duquet). Her mom hasn't eaten or drank anything for days, and the nurse has already prepped Evy for her mother's imminent death via a “death rattle” sound she will make. In between taking care of her mother, Evy runs “The Undertone Podcast” with Justin (voiced by Kris Holden-Ried). Each episode sees them listening to a new creepy recording, which is typically sent to them by a listener, and they debate or debunk what they've just heard. Justin, being a superstitious believer in old folk tales and the occult, would often lean in on the recordings and try to connect them with real urban myths. Things go up a notch when they receive a mysterious email containing ten audio files, which depict a married couple named Mike and Jessa (voiced by Jeff Yung and Keana Lyn Bastidas), who begin to experience… ahem… paranormal activity in their home. What starts off as simply Jessa talking in her sleep soon escalates into something far more disturbing in each succeeding file, as Evy begins to fear that this sinister presence has seeped over to her home. The audio recordings Evy and Justin listen to are very much an audio-recorded version of the first Paranormal Activity film, while much of the second act of the film bears similarities to Sinister (Justin even uncovers a demonic connection later on, identifying a figure that's essentially Bughuul from Sinister). Evy has to climb a flight of stairs up every time to get to the bedroom, and even the lighting from the lamp has a similar cold blue hue where you can imagine Max von Sydow and Jason Miller squaring off Linda Blair. Through these creative inspirations, Undertone is very familiar in its content. Where Undertone truly excels is in its form, specifically the work of sound designer David Gertsman and cinematographer Graham Beasley for how they create an ultimate immersive experience. Much like the best of found footage films, where the footage makes you look really hard to see if something is there, Undertone wants you to listen closely. But Tuason's sensibilities with the sound go beyond just designing the creepy sound itself, but knowing how to incorporate them with cinematography and where to deploy them in a theatrical setting. Tuason favors wide shots in moments where we expect close-ups. And the shot stays on the mother's face for just a few seconds too long – enough time for our brains to suspect whether she's going to move. “I swear those wall bang sounds were coming from the left speaker, but that last one just came out of the speaker on the right.” Combine those kinds of thoughts with camera framing that makes you expect something in the background, you start to wonder whether those sounds are coming from the audio recording Evy's listening to or if they're coming from her house. Perhaps the biggest achievement in Undertone is the way it “conditions” us to start imagining things that may or may not be there. When we're not sure whether something is actually standing in the dark, and we can't know for certain whether the sound we're hearing is just an audio file from a computer or actually happening in our physical space, our minds play tricks on us. Reminiscent of the best urban legends and creepypastas, Undertone knows how to do a lot with very little. The best thing I can say about Tuason as a filmmaker is that he fully understands that the audience is capable of freaking themselves out. It all builds to a riveting climax in which time and time again, Tuason cuts to black and we can only listen – a smart inversion of our gut reactions to “look away” when the film is too frightening. Here, when there's nothing to look at, our imagination makes everything worse. That the end result feels like something I shouldn't be listening to in the first place is an achievement in and of itself. As Undertone comes to its (quite literally) spellbinding end, you can't help but feel like Ian Tuason has just cursed all of us. This review is from the 2026 Sundance Film Festival where Undertone had its world premiere.</p>
