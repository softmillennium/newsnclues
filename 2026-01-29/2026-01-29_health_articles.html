                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID experience a disruption to their brain connectivity during a mentally demanding task. Professor Sonya Marshall-Gradisnik from Griffith's National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases said there were common symptoms experienced by people with ME/CFS or Long COVID with this study focusing on neurological features. "The symptoms include cognitive difficulties, such as memory problems, difficulties with attention and concentration, and slowed thinking," Professor Marshall-Gradisnik said. Lead author and PhD candidate Maira Inderyas said the study saw participants undertake a cognitive test while inside the MRI machine to gauge their brain activity. The scans show changes in the brain regions which may contribute to cognitive difficulties such as memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and slower thinking." Maira Inderyas, lead author and PhD candidate The research supported what many people with ME/CFS and Long COVID experience which was that cognitive effort was not just tiring but could have real neurological impacts, and adequate rest was not optional but essential. The ultra-high field MRI used in the study was one of only two available in Australia. The paper 'Distinct functional connectivity patterns in myalgic encephalomyelitis and Long COVID patients during cognitive fatigue: a 7 Tesla task-fMRI study' has been published in the Journal of Translational Medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease may be linked to impairment in how the brain replays our recent experiences while we are resting, according to a new study in mice by University College London (UCL) scientists. The researchers say their findings, published in Current Biology, could help scientists develop drug treatments targeting this impaired brain function, or help design new tests for early diagnosis. Co-lead author Dr Sarah Shipley (UCL Cell & Developmental Biology) said: "Alzheimer's disease is caused by the build-up of harmful proteins and plaques in the brain, leading to symptoms such as memory loss and impaired navigation - but it's not well understood exactly how these plaques disrupt normal brain processes. "When we rest, our brains normally replay recent experiences - this is thought to be key to how memories are formed and maintained. We found this replay process is disrupted in mice engineered to develop the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's, and this disruption is associated with how badly animals perform on memory tasks." Later, when we rest, these cells reactivate in the same sequence, helping memories become ingrained. For the study, the researchers were testing how well mice performed in a simple maze task, while monitoring their brain activity with sets of electrodes that could simultaneously track roughly 100 individual place cells. In mice with amyloid pathology, the replay process was fundamentally altered. The normal, coordinated patterns of place cell activity that should reinforce memories were scrambled. The researchers also found that place cells in affected mice became less stable over time, with individual neurons no longer reliably coding the same locations, particularly after rest periods - precisely when replay should be strengthening these representations. This disruption had consequences on memory tasks: affected mice performed worse in the maze, appearing to forget where they had already been and revisiting corridors that led nowhere. What's striking is that replay events still occur - but they've lost their normal structure. We hope our findings could help develop tests to detect Alzheimer's early, before extensive damage has occurred, or lead to new treatments targeting this replay process. We're now investigating whether we can manipulate replay through the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is already targeted by drugs used to treat Alzheimer's symptoms. By understanding the mechanism better, we hope to make such treatments more effective." Professor Caswell Barry, co-lead author, UCL Cell & Developmental Biology Shipley, S., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But Ankit Bharat's patient did for 48 hours. Reporting January 29 in the Cell Press journal Med, surgeons describe how they removed a patient's infected lungs and built "artificial lungs" to keep him alive until a double lung transplantation was available. We had to perform CPR," recalls Bharat, the lead author and a thoracic surgeon at Northwestern University. The patient, a 33-year-old man, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening condition in which inflammation and infection overwhelm the lungs. Eventually, his lungs, heart, and kidneys started to fail. A double lung transplant became his only chance of survival. The heart and lungs are intrinsically connected. When there are no lungs, how do you keep the patient alive?" Ankit Bharat, lead author and thoracic surgeon at Northwestern University His blood pressure stabilized, organ function recovered, and the infection subsided. Two days later, donor lungs became available, and the surgeons performed a double lung transplant. More than two years later, the patient has returned to daily life with good lung function. "Conventionally, lung transplant is reserved for patients who have chronic conditions like interstitial lung disease or cystic fibrosis," says Bharat. "Currently, people think if you get severe ARDS, you keep supporting them and ultimately the lungs will get better." These are signs that the tissue had reached an irreversible stage and could not recover on its own. "For the first time, biologically, we are giving molecular proof that some patients will need a double lung transplant, otherwise they will not survive," says Bharat. For now, the approach remains limited to highly specialized centers with the expertise and resources to carry it out. Bharat hopes that over time, the concept will be adopted into more standardized devices that can keep patients alive while awaiting new lungs. "In my practice, young patients die almost every week because no one realized that transplantation was an option," Bharat says. "For severe lung damage caused by respiratory viruses or infections, even in acute settings, a lung transplant can be lifesaving."

Welcome to the Medscape InDiscussion podcast series on secondary hypertension. Today's episode focuses on Cushing syndrome, an often overlooked cause of secondary hypertension. We'll discuss why this condition is frequently missed, how clinicians can screen for cortisol excess in patients with hypertension, and what to consider when managing blood pressure in those found to have hypercortisolism. And with the 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology multi-society high blood pressure guideline emphasizing routine screening for secondary causes, especially in resistant or early-onset hypertension, this topic is more relevant than ever. First, let me introduce my guest, Dr Lewis Blevins. As the medical director of the California Center for Pituitary Disorders at UCSF Medical Center, he guides a team that provides comprehensive, state-of-the-art care. He has a special interest in Cushing syndrome, also known as hypercortisolism. He has edited a book on the subject and written a book on the topic directed toward patients and physicians. Welcome to the Medscape InDiscussion Secondary Hypertension podcast. Abdalla: Why do you think hypercortisolism is still such an underrecognized cause of secondary hypertension? People don't think about rare diseases as often as they do the common things that come into the clinical practice. Another potential reason is the fact that no two patients with Cushing syndrome are alike. We all learned about Cushing syndrome in medical school and residency, and patients who look like Harvey Cushing's patient, Minnie G, but it turns out most patients don't look that way. So it's not like you can say, "There's a zebra. These patients have the zebra diagnosis, which is rare, but they don't look like zebras at all, most of the time; only about 20%-30% of people do. The remainder are less than that, or they have a different constellation of symptoms and signs than this typical textbook case. So they don't scream, "Here I am. A zebra in your waiting room," as many other diseases would, or as we might expect Cushing syndrome, too. But people have, in their mind, that's what the Cushing patient looks like, so they miss it. Abdalla: Are there certain patient populations where you think it's especially easy to overlook? Blevins: I think patients with adrenal hypercortisolism are probably easy to overlook because they are the ones that most often don't look cushingoid. But by and large, most people with the adrenal adenomas have mild autonomous cortisol secretion. And we recognize this is probably an emerging cause of...well, not an emerging cause — it's been there all along — but it's an increasingly recognized cause of hypercortisolism. And it used to be thought that about 65% of people had a pituitary tumor, 10% had a tumor elsewhere, and the remainder were adrenal disease. The other half have either ectopic ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) production or a pituitary tumor. Abdalla: How much of this underrecognition do you think is actually related to terminology? So, mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), hidden hypercortisolism, Cushing's. How do you think these labels may contribute to confusion amongst clinicians? Blevins: I think they certainly contribute to confusion because people haven't heard them before. But I think that we're on the right track to sort of advertise and broadcast that there are more subtle occurrences of this disease process that we think of as hypercortisolism; whether it's pituitary disease or adrenal disease, both can present with hidden hypercortisolism. And what's meant by that is someone has something like hypertension, osteoporosis, or uncontrolled diabetes, and then when they're worked up, they're found to have Cushing's. I don't really like the term hidden. Mild autonomous cortisol secretion is a good term. I like to think that those people wouldn't have symptoms and signs unless they had relative hypercortisolism. That group of people have a normal urine cortisol level. So that's why it's called autonomous cortisol secretion. Because you can detect that with certain dynamic diagnostic tests, but the truth of the matter is, they wouldn't have hypertension or diabetes if they weren't producing more cortisol for their body. Everybody has their own normal cortisol production rate. So if my normal level is 20 +/- two standard deviations, maybe it goes down to 7-27 or something like that, and I'm sitting at 40, which is still in a normal range, I'm making double the cortisol that my body needs — and that can cause hypertension, diabetes, insomnia, weight gain, and things like that. The big trap out there is that someone thinks of Cushing's, and they do a urine cortisol, it's normal, and they dismiss the diagnosis because the cortisol level is normal. But that patient may actually be producing double or even triple the cortisol they should be producing for their body, and they're getting those clinical manifestations as a result of that. I like the mild autonomous cortisol secretion thing, but those people probably have relative hypercortisolism. As cortisol secretion, it defines it as abnormal cortisol secretion, whether the patient is frankly hypercortisolemic or normal cortisolemic, I think that term is a good one. I like to use the term Cushing syndrome for people who look like the patient that Harvey Cushing described. If it's due to the adrenals, we'll talk about ACTH-independent adrenal hypercortisolism, for example. I think that the terminology is evolving, and hopefully, will evolve at a rate that we can keep up with it and educate people about it so that everybody's on the same page. Abdalla: For clinicians managing hypertension in busy practices, what early or less obvious clinical features should prompt us to consider cortisol excess as a driver of high blood pressure? Blevins: I'll answer that question talking about my own clinical practice. I see a lot of people with Cushing's. Many of them are controlled, so that you can't really say, oh, it's just the people with uncontrolled hypertension or multidrug resistant hypertension, or those with hypokalemia, for example, and edema. You need to recognize that anybody with hypertension can have Cushing syndrome or hypercortisolism. In that case, you want to look for other clues like abnormal weight gain, insomnia, and things of that nature. Some of the more mundane things that you can see in hypercortisolism in a patient that doesn't look like they've been taking high doses of prednisone, for example. Typically, if you had to pick out a group of people to screen and wanted to sort of catch those who were the most treatment-resistant, requiring multiple drugs, who had hypokalemia, had a low renin and a low aldosterone because it's a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, those would be the ones to think that they might truly have Cushing's. In fact, if you had to do a blood test to screen, probably looking at the renin and aldosterone and interpreting that in conjunction with the drugs the patient is taking, because a lot of these drugs affect renin and aldosterone levels. But most of the drugs for hypertension raise renin. And if they're surprisingly both low, then think about hypercortisolism in that setting. There are other reasons they could be low, but that's a nice screen for that resistant patient in a hypertension clinic, for example. Abdalla: After you see that, what then should be the next steps for a general clinician? Is there weight gain, premature osteoporosis, stretch marks, or easy bruising? A person off the street with no pretest likelihood, because they don't have any of those things, the abnormal test results are more likely to be incorrect. And the screening test can be any number of things. Since many people have normal 24-hour urines, that's not always going to pick up the disease. The late-night salivary cortisol test is not always great because some people have normal levels, but they're still producing cortisol throughout the day instead of in a diurnal variation. You're more likely to see an abnormal salivary cortisol in a Cushing's patient with a pituitary tumor than you are with early adrenal disease. So none of these screening tests is perfect, but I think they're all very useful in the context where you have a high pretest likelihood of having the disease. Some people will do a 2-day dexamethasone suppression test. Obviously, an ACTH level helps you figure out if this is ACTH-dependent due to pituitary ectopic disease, or low, in which case it would likely be due to adrenal disease. So do patterns like nocturnal hypertension or non-dipping also potentially raise a flag that there may be cortisol-related hypertension. Blevins: I have not used those monitoring devices in my patients, but I'm aware of the literature that indeed, you do lose your variation in blood pressure when you have hypercortisolism because you're making cortisol throughout the day. And nocturnal hypertension seems to be a real problem. So the adrenal incidentaloma is showing up more often. There's a great 2024 paper in Nature Reviews Endocrinology noting that about 20%-50% of these patients have some mild autonomous cortisol secretion, and hypertension is usually the leading clinical consequence. How should clinicians think about these incidental adrenal nodules in the context of evaluating secondary hypertension? Studies have shown that most people don't get an evaluation. And when we look at those people in long-term studies, we see that they acquire additional morbidity and even some mortality over time with an increase in hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, progression of osteoporosis, neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs as well. So it's believed that they need to be treated. Chiodini and others in Italy recently presented at the Endocrine Society a paper showing that these patients actually benefit from adrenalectomy, or some other treatment. They didn't study that, but you could treat medically as well, and you would see benefit in improvement in these cardiometabolic parameters of disease that are related to these adrenal incidentalomas in people with MACS. So I think it's critical to evaluate all of these patients, especially when they have a background of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or osteoporosis, and maybe you use those gateway diagnoses as the reason to evaluate a person with an adrenal incidentaloma. You probably get away with not evaluating that person, but as an endocrinologist, I feel the buck stops with my colleague and me. Everybody should be tested for hypercortisolism and hyperaldosteronism, even if they don't have hypokalemia and hypertension that's uncontrolled, in my opinion, and certainly if it's an adrenal medullary tumor for pheochromocytoma. Abdalla: It'd be great to have unified diagnostic criteria, as well. I think one of the things that's for the lung nodules that really helped is the Fleischner's criteria, or people sort of pushing folks to evaluate a disturbance at a screening level. So another challenge I think clinicians often have is distinguishing true Cushing's from pseudo-Cushing's states caused by conditions like depression, pregnancy, alcohol use, and uncontrolled diabetes. So how do you think clinicians should approach these cases diagnostically when hypertension is part of the picture? I have seen patients referred to me by other endocrinologists, who said the patient had pseudo-Cushing's and they ended up having an adrenal tumor that we removed, and they recovered. I have seen people that I labeled as having pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, who three years later developed a pituitary tumor and had pituitary disease all along. My overarching conclusion is that whenever you think a patient has pseudo-Cushing's, you should refer the patient to another qualified opinion from an experienced clinician. What can we do better as clinicians to sort of prepare our patients for the workup and the journey they may go through while undergoing testing, seeing subspecialists and, for some, undergoing surgery? Because it's like now there's hope that they can get controlled and maybe come off a group of medications. I think it's important as a clinician to tell patients that we need to take our time and proceed in a logical, stepwise fashion: Evaluate them, first confirming that they have the disease, and then second, try to establish the differential diagnosis and work through that before we can even arrive at a treatment plan. I've seen people present to me who have been evaluated off and on for 15 years, and you know, it was obvious to me they had Cushing's all along, but the clinicians evaluating them weren't entirely sure. That's not anything against the clinician because experience matters in this arena. And it's important to get people to physicians who have experience so that they can, if you will, accelerate that workup. And sometimes a tincture of time is what we need — 6 months to repeat tests, 6 months later, maybe a year later, just to see. Not always the adrenal adenomas, but with pituitary disease it will. Abdalla: It sounds like an important step is really having a great clinician-patient relationship. Especially if they're going to go back and forth through things in order to get them through this journey. So, why don't we wrap up now by talking about management pathways. Is there a need to modify antihypertensive medication strategies while evaluating or treating hypercortisolism? If patients haven't been on those drugs, it's good to think about them. Some of the ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) work, but not as well. Or not going to work well, I should say. Treatment really comes down to identifying the disease state and treating that disease state, whether it be with medication to block adrenal corticosteroid production, or adrenalectomy, or removal of a pituitary tumor, or say a carcinoid in the lung causing ectopic ACTH. It really comes down to treating that underlying diagnosis. And on that line, I think the people who look like Harvey Cushing's patients are the ones who probably have the multigenic condition that leads to what we call metabolic syndrome. I just sense that based on 35 years of doing this and seeing a large number of patients and figuring out why some people look like they have Cushing's and other people don't. When their families start coming in, you can see these people have metabolic syndrome. And then it's just compounded by the Cushing's. I've seen four people this year, but maybe usually 1 of the 40 or so people I see every year would have that pattern. It is interesting that they all came at the same time. It's probably 50 people I see with Cushing's per year, and one or two might have hypokalemia, but this year it's been four of them. And then usually if you are going to come off medications, it's a period of 3-4 weeks for people to resolve their medication. So think about Cushing's in anybody with hypertension, and especially if they're on more than one drug to try to get control. It doesn't take a lot of energy to think about it and decide whether you're going to do a test or to think about whether they have some of the other symptoms and signs. And when you think about all the other things we do, it's less energy to do some diagnostic tests than it is to arrange for some other things that we do for our patients. Once you find a case or see something else that might be related to Cushing's, like that adrenal adenoma that's detected instantly on a scan, refer a patient to an endocrinologist for a bona fide workup, and let them do all the thinking for you and share in the care of your patient.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A six-month produce prescription program in Los Angeles clinics shows how food-as-medicine strategies can meaningfully improve access to healthy foods for patients with diabetes, but reveals why affordability remains a stubborn barrier. Study: Nutrition Security Among Medicaid Patients With Diabetes or Prediabetes After Completing a Produce Prescription Program. A recent study in Annals of Family Medicine evaluated the effectiveness of a produce prescription program in improving short-term nutrition security among Medicaid patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes using a pre–post observational design and self-reported survey measures. The food-as-medicine strategy involves using dietary interventions to prevent, treat, and manage diet-related diseases. The United States spends roughly $1.1 trillion annually on treating chronic conditions like hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Produce prescription programs (PPRs) provide patients experiencing food insecurity with vouchers to purchase fruits and vegetables. These programs focus on increasing produce consumption, supporting food security, and improving health outcomes, including glycemic control, with modeling studies suggesting the potential to prevent hundreds of thousands of cardiovascular events. It is imperative for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), as well as for other federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to understand how PPRs can shape a patient's experience with access and availability to healthy foods. Existing research assessing the effectiveness of PPRs has focused on food security or food sufficiency. However, focusing solely on food sufficiency and dietary quality misses critical barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption, including affordability, grocery store access, transportation, cooking knowledge, and awareness of food assistance programs. Nutrition security, distinct from food security, encompasses consistent access, availability, and affordability of healthy foods. Population studies show nutrition insecurity affects 18 % to 44 % of people and is linked to diabetes and poor mental health. While measurement methods are still evolving, researchers increasingly recognize nutrition security as essential for optimizing health outcomes and for capturing barriers not reflected in traditional food security metrics. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health partnered with three Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to implement a produce prescription program during 2020–2024. This before-and-after observational study assessed changes in nutrition and food security among participating Medicaid patients without a comparison group. The study also identified barriers to healthy eating, including participants' perceptions of the price of healthy foods in their community and their ability to identify healthy foods. Eligible participants were FQHC patients aged 18 or older, enrolled in Medicaid, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, and screening positive for food insecurity. During 2021–2024, 2,374 patients enrolled across the three FQHCs. Selected participants received $40 per month for 6 months to purchase fresh produce with an electronic debit card. All patients completed a 20-minute self-administered baseline questionnaire and received their activated debit card. The study assessed household nutrition security using a two-item screener developed by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Kaiser Permanente, and Tufts University as the primary outcome. The screener assessed difficulty accessing healthy foods over 12 months, with responses categorized as secure or insecure, and 12 barriers to healthy eating rated as “never,” “sometimes,” or “often true.” Food security was measured using the six-item short form module, with scores of 0–1 considered secure and 2–6 considered insecure. The study used McNemar tests to identify changes in nutrition and food security from baseline to follow-up. Binary multivariable logistic regression models tested these changes. Model 2 adjusted for baseline covariates and security status. The program distributed $575,820 in produce benefits, of which participants spent $404,025, or 70.2 %, on fresh fruits and vegetables at participating stores, although redemption data were not available at the individual participant level. Most participants, 80.4 %, had a high school education or less, and 25 % lived in households with five or more members. Nutrition security increased significantly during the six-month program, rising from 23.2 % to 38.7 % of participants. Food security also improved substantially, increasing from 25.2 % to 42.9 %. Beyond the overall increases in nutrition and food security, participants reported improvements across most specific barriers to healthy eating. Participants also reported an enhanced ability to identify healthy foods and improved access to stores that offer healthy options. Additionally, the difficulty making culturally appropriate foods healthy declined from 62.0 % to 55.7 %, suggesting the program helped participants navigate cultural food preferences while improving nutrition. The Los Angeles County produce prescription program was associated with significant improvements in both nutrition and food security among Medicaid patients with diabetes or prediabetes over six months. Nutrition security increased by 15.5 percentage points and food security by 17.7 percentage points, with participants also reporting reduced barriers to healthy eating. Overall, the results suggest that food-as-medicine interventions can be feasibly integrated into clinical settings to address fundamental social determinants of health, particularly access to affordable, nutritious foods, although longer-term and controlled studies are needed to assess sustained and causal effects. et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals how Parkinson's spreads from the gut to the brain, with the help of immune cells – offering a new potential therapeutic strategy – in a study in mice led by scientists at the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL (University College London). Scientists have long theorized that Parkinson's may start in the gut. The new study identifies a key role for gut macrophages – a specialized immune cell that acts as a first responder, eating or 'engulfing' and destroying harmful invaders – in helping toxic proteins travel from the gut into the brain. The research showed that reducing the number of gut macrophages led to reduced spreading of toxic protein, and improved motor symptoms in mice. Published in the journal Nature, and funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the study suggests a new potential therapeutic approach for Parkinson's that could enable intervention long before onset of motor symptoms. Previous research has found that between 50-90% of people with Parkinson's had gut symptoms long before their movement symptoms began, for example experiencing chronic constipation decades before diagnosis. Patients are grouped into 'body-first' and 'brain-first' depending on where disease starts, with the former accounting for around two thirds of people affected by Parkinson's. They showed that gut macrophages engulfed alpha-synuclein, and began to show signs of dysfunction in their lysosomal systems, responsible for breaking down the cell's waste material. Importantly, when the researchers depleted the number of gut macrophages before injecting alpha-synuclein into the small intestine of mice, they found this resulted in reduced levels of toxic alpha-synuclein in the brain, compared to healthy controls (mice in a comparison group) – suggesting a possible therapeutic avenue: targeting these immune cells and preventing them from reaching the brain. They will also investigate how to exploit markers of inflammation in the blood as early diagnostics for Parkinson's. Our study shows that immune cells are not bystanders in Parkinson's; these gut macrophages are responding, albeit in a dysfunctional way. This presents an opportunity to think about how we can boost the function of the immune system and these cells, so that they respond in the correct manner and help to slow or stop the spread of disease." Co-lead author Dr Tim Bartels, Group Leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL, said: "Neurodegenerative diseases have slow trajectories over decades. Understanding how Parkinson's begins in the body could allow us to develop simple blood tests to screen for it, enabling diagnosis long before damage to the brain starts. Having the ability to detect and manage Parkinson's before it even reaches the brain could have a huge impact for those affected." Intestinal macrophages modulate synucleinopathy along the gut–brain axis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While scientists have long known that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with biological symptoms of accelerated aging, emotional distress accounts for a significant portion of these effects, researchers found in a recent study. Consistent with a chains-of-risk framework - the theory that later-life health conditions are triggered by sequential, linked exposures earlier in life - the findings support our hypothesis that prolonged exposure to contextual socioeconomic disadvantage accelerates one's biological age, and that some but not all of this effect operates through increases in psychological symptoms." The study's sample population comprised more than 1,440 people living in Wisconsin and included two factors - cumulative exposure to neighborhood disadvantage and overall emotional distress - that prior studies have not explored. Co-author Wei Xu, a professor in the Institute for Health and Humanity at the Medical College of Wisconsin, has led a number of studies investigating links between health disparities and neighborhood conditions. Engelman and Malecki were the co-principal investigators for the Researching Epigenetics, Weathering, Aging and Residential Disadvantage project that contributed to this work. While much of the prior research on accelerated aging, neighborhood factors and residents' emotions focused on depression, the current study also explored stress and anxiety, "and how each of the psychological factors mediated the relationship between cumulative exposure to neighborhood disadvantage and epigenetic aging," Xu said. "What we found is that anxiety appeared to be a really significant mediator between exposure and the outcome." Kamis said the research used three epigenetic "clocks" that measure an individual's state of biological aging based on patterns of epigenetic changes in the genome. "These epigenetic clocks have different algorithms and assumptions," Kamis said. The team used two-second generation clocks, the PhenoAge and GrimAge, which, when regressed on chronological age, produce residuals indicating epigenetic age acceleration; along with the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which can be interpreted as the rate of biological aging per one year of chronological age, Kamis said. Six census-tract socioeconomic indicators - including median household income, the percentage of rental households and the proportions of residents with a high school education or less - were used to characterize neighborhood disadvantage. The researchers also created a composite measure of cumulative exposure by tracking each individual's residential history since the age of 18 - a unique level of exposure that prior neighborhood-biological aging research has rarely been able to consider due to data limitations, Kamis said. The team obtained participants' residential data for up to five decades, Xu said. "That allowed us to make more accurate inferences about the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and biological aging, as well as the role of psychological symptoms in that relationship, because we accounted for their cumulative life course exposure, not just that associated with their current neighborhood." By clinical measures, about 24% of the individuals in the study had above-normal scores for depression, while 21% had elevated levels of anxiety and 15% had above-normal stress scores, the researchers found. Cumulative neighborhood disadvantage was a significant predictor of greater overall distress across all three models, and it predicted accelerated aging across all three clocks directly and indirectly through increases in distress, Kamis said. "Cumulative neighborhood disadvantage and overall distress were both significant predictors of accelerated aging for all three clocks," Kamis said. "One-unit increases in cumulative disadvantage were associated with .187 and .219 additional years of age acceleration by the PhenoAge and GrimAge clocks, respectively, and a .006 increase in the pace of aging by the Dunedin PACE." For each accelerated epigenetic aging measure, cumulative neighborhood disadvantage had both a significant direct and indirect effect through overall distress, Kamis said. "When we looked at each of the psychological symptom subscales separately, most of the indirect effect on accelerated aging occurred through anxiety," Kamis said. Amy Schultz, a scientist at the UW-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, and then-postdoctoral scholar Joseph Clark also were co-authors of the current study. Kamis, C., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taking certain antidepressants at the time of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not associated with an increased risk of death, brain surgery or longer hospital stays, according to a study published on January 28, 2026, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. For the study, researchers looked at serotonergic antidepressants, which treat anxiety and depression by increasing serotonin activity in the brain. These included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Concerns have previously been raised that serotonergic antidepressants might increase the risk of bleeding in the brain or complicate early recovery after traumatic brain injury. However, our study found no evidence to support those concerns." Jussi P. Posti, MD, PhD, study author, University of Turku, Finland The study included 54,876 people in Finland who were 16 or older when hospitalized with a TBI. Researchers reviewed national prescription records for preinjury antidepressant use and medical records to determine how many people died within a month, whether they needed emergency brain surgery, and how long they stayed in the hospital. After adjusting for factors such as age, sex and other health conditions, researchers found people taking antidepressants before injury were no more likely to die within a month than those not taking them. Antidepressant users were slightly less likely to require emergency brain surgery to relieve pressure or bleeding in the brain and prevent further damage. After adjustments, antidepressant users had an 11% lower risk. "These findings provide reassurance for people who take antidepressants that antidepressant use does not appear to worsen early recovery after traumatic brain injury," said Posti. "Future studies should examine whether these results hold true for long-term recovery and across different health care settings." A limitation of the study was that it was conducted only at hospitals and health care centers in Finland, so results may vary in other areas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have identified a targetable driver of brain metastases in patients with aggressive inflammatory breast cancer. The study uncovers a novel role for soluble E-cadherin (sEcad) in promoting tumor invasion while resisting cancer cell death and triggering brain inflammation via the CXCR2 signaling pathway. The study, published in Neuro-Oncology, was led by Xiaoding Hu, M.D., Ph.D., instructor of Breast Medical Oncology, and Bisrat Debeb, D.V.M., Ph.D., associate professor of Breast Medical Oncology. This readily measurable blood biomarker plays a key role in driving brain metastasis. Brain metastasis is a common complication of advanced breast cancer, with a particularly high risk in inflammatory breast cancer. However, there are no effective therapies because the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previous work by the Debeb lab showed that patients with elevated levels of sEcad in their blood tend to have an increased risk of brain metastasis, earlier metastasis and poorer overall survival. In this study, preclinical models of inflammatory breast cancer overexpressing sEcad showed higher metastatic burden, reduced survival and increased metastasis to the brain. The researchers found that sEcad activates the CXCR2 pathway, which creates a feedback loop that helps cancer cells evade cell death and fosters an inflammatory, pro-metastatic environment. This study identifies sEcad and the CRCX2 pathway as essential for brain metastasis, suggesting that blocking any part of that pathway could slow or prevent cancer spread.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A detailed lipidomic comparison reveals that EPA and DHA are packaged very differently across marine sources, challenging the idea that all omega-3s are nutritionally equivalent. Study: Omega-3 Source Matters: Comparative Lipid Signatures and Quantitative Distribution of EPA/DHA Across Marine Resources. In a recent study published in the journal Marine Drugs, a group of researchers compared how different marine sources store eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) across lipid classes and evaluated their comparative nutritional characteristics. Heart disease remains the leading global cause of death, yet something as simple as choosing the right dietary fat can meaningfully reduce risk. Traditionally, seafood has been the primary dietary source of EPA and DHA. This shift raises questions about why these sources are increasingly favored. It is important to note that the structural form of fat molecules may influence digestion, transport, and metabolic handling, rather than absorption alone. Further research is needed to determine which lipid forms and class distributions of omega-3 fatty acids matter most, not just total quantity. A lipid analysis was conducted on various marine omega-3 sources, including 12 microalgal species, 1 heterotrophic marine protist (Schizochytrium species), 4 oily fish species, and 9 commercial omega-3 supplements derived from fish, krill, and algae. Lipids were extracted from dried biomass or oil samples using standardized solvent-based methods to preserve lipid integrity. Researchers used high-performance thin-layer chromatography to separate complex lipids into classes such as phospholipids, glycolipids, and neutral lipids. Individual lipid bands were isolated and converted into fatty acid methyl esters. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was then used to quantify EPA and DHA content in each lipid class. Nutritional indices were calculated from fatty acid profiles to assess relative lipid quality and cardiometabolic relevance. The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids was evaluated, with higher values considered favorable. These measures serve as comparative indicators rather than direct health outcomes. All analyses were conducted in triplicate, and results were expressed on a dry-weight basis to support reliable cross-source comparisons. Substantial differences were observed in both the amounts and the structural distributions of EPA and DHA across marine sources. Notably, EPA in microalgae was predominantly embedded within glycolipids and phosphatidylglycerol, key components of photosynthetic membranes, rather than stored as energy lipids. This structural positioning suggests a biological role beyond energy storage and may influence downstream metabolic handling, although this was not directly evaluated in the study. The heterotrophic protist Schizochytrium species showed the opposite pattern, with high DHA content (approximately 33% of total fatty acids) and relatively low EPA levels. More than 85% of its lipids were stored as triacylglycerols, indicating an energy-reserve profile that closely resembles refined algal oil supplements. Fish species typically contained more DHA than EPA, although both were present in nutritionally meaningful amounts. Anchovies and sardines emerged as efficient dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids, thanks to their favorable lipid profiles and small serving sizes. While temporal trends could not be assessed, measured EPA and DHA levels were lower than values reported in earlier literature, aligning with reports of declining omega-3 content linked to climate change and shifts in aquaculture feed composition. Commercial omega-3 supplements varied substantially in lipid structure. Refined fish oil capsules contained high levels of EPA and DHA, stored almost entirely as triacylglycerols, with phospholipids largely removed during processing. Krill oil supplements differed structurally, with nearly one-third of total lipids present as phosphatidylcholine. This phospholipid-bound form has been associated in prior research with altered digestion and tissue distribution, although the present study focused on compositional differences rather than physiological effects. Like fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids were primarily stored as neutral lipids. Health-related lipid indices reinforced observed compositional patterns. Krill oils showed more variable results, while fish and fish oils generally fell within moderate but acceptable index ranges. These findings demonstrate that omega-3 sources are not nutritionally equivalent. Beyond total EPA and DHA content, the lipid structures carrying these fatty acids represent an additional layer of nutritional differentiation. Microalgae primarily deliver EPA within membrane-associated glycolipids, whereas fish and refined oils store omega-3 fatty acids mainly as energy-dense triacylglycerols. Krill oil lipids contain a higher proportion of phospholipids, distinguishing them structurally from triacylglycerol-dominated oils, although overall lipid quality indices were more variable. As sustainability concerns increase and dietary patterns evolve, evaluating omega-3 sources by lipid class, rather than only by quantity, may enable more nuanced nutritional comparisons and guide future research, rather than serving as direct dietary guidance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A large cohort study suggests that melatonin from everyday foods may mark dietary patterns associated with lower rates of obesity and depression, while showing no clear links to other chronic diseases. Study: The Content of Dietary Melatonin in 119 Food Items and Its Relationship With Chronic Diseases: Results of the CUME+ Study. In a recent study published in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, researchers analyzed melatonin content in food items and its associations with several health outcomes using cross-sectional data from a cohort of Brazilian university graduates. Although melatonin concentrations are lower in foods compared to supplements, melatonin-rich diets can elevate circulating levels within physiological ranges. Increasing melatonin intake through diet may provide physiological doses that more closely align with endogenous rhythms than pharmacological supplementation and may avoid suprapharmacological exposure, according to prior evidence. Given the burden of obesity, depression, and sleep disorders, dietary melatonin has been examined as a potential marker of dietary patterns associated with these conditions, rather than as a therapeutic intervention. Observational studies also report inverse associations with liver cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. However, few studies have directly examined melatonin intake within habitual diets or its associations with chronic conditions in adults. In the present study, researchers analyzed melatonin concentrations in foods and their relationship with various health outcomes. Participants were included from the Cohort of Universities of Minas Gerais (CUME+) study, an open, prospective cohort assessing the impact of dietary patterns and nutrition transition on noncommunicable diseases. The baseline questionnaire was administered in two parts, one assessing sociodemographics, clinical history, lifestyle, anthropometrics, and morbidity. The second part included a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and items on dietary habits, supplements, and cooking practices. Nutrient intake was determined using food composition tables, and dietary melatonin content was estimated from the literature and adjusted for total energy intake. The study outcomes included obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension, metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes (T2D), sleep duration, dyslipidemia, and depression. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m². Depression and OSA were based on self-reported medical diagnoses. Dyslipidemia was defined as at least one abnormal lipid parameter, including total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) < 40 mg/dL (or < 50 mg/dL for females), or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 130 mg/dL. MetS was defined as central obesity plus any two of the following: elevated triglycerides or treatment, reduced HDL-C or treatment, increased blood pressure (BP) or treatment for hypertension, and elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or T2D diagnosis. Sleep duration was classified as short (less than 7 hours per day) or normal (7 hours or more per day). Logistic and Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations between dietary melatonin intake and health outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, family income, binge drinking, smoking, screen time, physical activity, medication use, and sleep duration. The study included 8,320 participants with a mean age of 35.9 years. Dyslipidemia, depression, obesity, and hypertension were the most prevalent health conditions. Melatonin content was estimated for 119 of 144 food items in the FFQ, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 169.9 ng/g. No significant associations were observed between dietary melatonin intake and OSA, hypertension, MetS, or T2D. In contrast, dietary melatonin intake was inversely associated with obesity and depression. Individuals with daily melatonin intake of 14,900 to 34,400 ng and 14,900 to 25,000 ng were less likely to have obesity and depression, respectively, with the strongest associations observed in intermediate intake quintiles rather than at the highest levels. Dietary melatonin intake was inversely associated with depression and obesity in this population, while no significant associations were observed for other chronic conditions or sleep duration. Overall, the findings support hypotheses regarding a potential role of dietary melatonin in metabolic and neurobehavioral regulation, possibly via anti-inflammatory pathways. However, due to the cross-sectional design, causal inferences cannot be drawn, and further experimental and longitudinal studies are required to confirm these associations and clarify underlying mechanisms.
