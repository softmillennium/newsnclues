                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The New York Stock Exchange is 234 years old and its grand stone edifice stands as one of the world's most enduring symbols of capitalism. According to Professor Omid Malekan, who teaches a blockchain course at Columbia Business School, NYSE's press release suggested the exchange was seeking to reap publicity, while providing little in the way of specifics. And I always find that telling, because there has been a tendency over the years with crypto where you have established incumbents announce something very exciting, but then years later, nothing comes of it,” said Malekan. He pointed out that the NYSE lacked serious technical specifications and failed even to state which blockchain the exchange planned to use for its grand plans. Also worrying, said Malekan, is that the plan appeared designed to include all of its current business partners, some of which have direct financial ties to NYSE. This plan to preserve all existing partners is problematic since the nature of blockchain is that it can eliminate a raft of financial middlemen, and let parties transact directly in an instant and transparent manner. This poses threat to a legion of auxiliary service providers on Wall Street like transfer agents and settlement houses that are essential to the current system of stock-trading. That didn't work out, of course, and now Internet natives like Google have become 20 times larger. Malekan explained that NYSE appears caught in a classic innovator's dilemma where an incumbent tries to embrace the way of the future, but is hampered by a need to preserve its existing business model. In this context, it is often new players that rise up to define the next era of an Industry—as Google and Facebook did in the world of communications and media. And indeed, NYSE's blockchain announcement comes at a time when a number of startups and newer financial players are already making fast strides in tokenizing stock. All of this will mean NYSE, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, will have a hard time keeping up. Malekan points out that moving stocks to the blockchain isn't going to happen overnight and that NYSE—which was created in 1792 when 24 traders signed an agreement under a buttonwood tree near Wall Street—enjoys a reputation as one of the oldest and most venerable financial institutions in the world. You can hear more of Malekan's comments on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube, along with a conversation between hosts Jeff and Leo about other hot topics, including the fate of an important crypto bill and the failure of social media network farcaster.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's price dipped hard on Thursday to a low of $83,757 as the crypto market experienced a sell-off sparked by investor fears around AI spending. The biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was recently priced slightly higher at $83,788 after dropping over 6% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko. Over the past week, it has dropped by 6% and is down year-to-date. The crypto sell-off came as big tech stocks dipped on news that Microsoft earnings showed the software giant had reported record spending. Investors are worried that AI expenditure is too big and results are taking too long to bear fruit. Bitcoin and the wider crypto market has in the past moved along with US equities — particularly tech stocks. Traders betting on the future price of digital coins had their positions fast closed Thursday following the sell-off. And $313.7 million in positions betting on the future price of Bitcoin going up have today been liquidated. Bitcoin was largely unmoved after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged and its chair signalled no urgency to begin cutting them. The asset has typically performed well in a low-interest rate environment. But market observers this week are largely paying attention to what earnings from major tech companies will do to the asset class. Apple, Meta Platforms and Tesla will also report earnings this week. Experts told DL News that strong results could lift risk-on assets like Bitcoin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Senate's Agriculture Committee is holding its first markup hearing on crypto market structure legislation, giving lawmakers a chance to debate and vote on amendments and possibly advance the actual legislation. ET): After less than an hour of debate and just a handful of amendments, the Senate Agriculture Committee voted to advance its market structure legislation to the full Senate on a party-line vote (12 lawmakers voted for it, 11 against). All eyes are now back on the Senate Banking Committee, which postponed its own markup hearing earlier this month and has yet to set a new date. ET): Unmentioned so far in Thursday's hearing: The crypto markets themselves, which were down heavily between 4% and 7% over the past 24 hours of trading. ET): We moved from Democrat amendments to a Republican one that's meant to block foreign adversaries of the U.S. from meddling in the U.S. crypto markets. But Tuberville agreed to withdraw his amendments with an understanding of "what we're trying to accomplish today," he said. So he asked that the ideas can come up again later. "What I and so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle see is that we are standing on the cusp of extraordinary humanity, changing breakthroughs that could give Americans a financial system that is faster, cheaper and more inclusive," he said. "I have seen in my own community that the system we have right now often screws customers, hurts their ability to access financial markets. There is a democratizing force, or at least potential that is moving across our country and across the world." Senator Adam Schiff of California likewise commented that Democrats had a working group to support crypto legislation, likening crypto to artificial intelligence: "We want these jobs. We want this industry to stay in the United States, and that means that we need to have rules of the road where we're not essentially making decisions through litigation." ET): The opening Democratic amendments went down, as expected, in party-line votes, including the standout issue meant to target President Donald Trump's crypto business interests. It's been a cordial disagreement so far today, with Democrats gently accusing that Republicans abandoned negotiations and Republicans gently suggesting that disagreements can be resolved later. ET): The second amendment offered, this time by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, would prohibit the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department from "providing digital commodity intermediaries with a taxpayer-funded bailout" in the event of banking failures, pointing to Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank. ET): The first amendment, offered by Senator Michael Bennett, a Colorado Democrat, addressed Democrats' concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's profiting off of his family's various crypto interests and businesses. "I think this issue strikes at the core of our democracy," Bennett said. While the Senators were working on bipartisan legislation, Committee Chairman John Boozman said in a statement last week that "fundamental differences in policy" remained and the members of the committee had not come to an agreement on the text that was published. Senator Cory Booker, the Democrat leading negotiations on the bill, said in opening remarks that lawmakers were close to an agreement on key issues, pointing to U.S. President Donald Trump and his family's crypto ties as one outstanding area of concern, as well as the lack of a firm agreement on quorum at federal agencies. "In football parlance, we moved from our own goal line all the way down 70 yards. We're almost in the red zone on this bill, and that frustrates me, because I see a bipartisan glide path to land this plane, to punch through the end zone," Booker said. "Advancing this bill is the first step, and there are many steps to come in achieving those goals," he said. Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture Pudgy Penguins is building a multi-vertical consumer IP platform — combining phygital products, games, NFTs and PENGU to monetize culture at scale. Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token. While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

Click here to join the bubble by eFinancialCareers, our new anonymous community. It's now 2026, and the NFT world has collapsed, for lack of better term. From a peak market size of $1.6bn in 2022, research from CoinLedger last year suggested it's barely a third of that now. Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini was planning to close its NFT marketplace by March. In the OFF SCRIPT podcast yesterday, he said that his NFT style – Rekt guy – was launched during the NFT decline anyway. "I could never go [back]”, he said. “If everything failed in my life and I needed to get a normal job, so to speak, I would do something different. I couldn't go back to it." Despite leaving finance, Faruq has fond-ish memories of the experience. He told the OFF SCRIPT podcast that he loved the excitement of taking risks and credited the bank and his mentors there for teaching him a lot – and noted that he learned a lot about ethics, regulation, macroeconomics, and risk management. Eventually however, the risk-aversion made him quit. “If something didn't go well for you, people would be quick to say you need to cut your losses. We've mentioned their energy drink offerings before, which once upon a time sold for £60 for a case of 12 – now only £47, but still. If you're curious to know how Faruq's NFTs are doing, we found an artwork in 2022 of a self-portrait (of sorts) was on sale for $3.4k (USD).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For almost a decade, over 75,000 ETH involved in TheDAO has remained unclaimed. Now, Ethereum OGs and Vitalik are using it to create an ecosystem security fund. The 2016 DAO hack, in which a hacker obtained 4.5% of what was then all ETH in existence, was Ethereum's defining moment. It caused an existential crisis for the fledgling network, led to a hard fork that spawned an evil twin, Ethereum Classic, and became a turning point for the community. Some unclaimed money from the whole DAO debacle is being used to help establish a $220 million endowment to shore up Ethereum's security called TheDAO Security Fund. (However, some funds will stay untouched so they can still be claimed.) The capital will be granted to projects working on Ethereum security, with funding distributed mostly through DAO processes. A portion of the ETH will also be staked so as to create an ongoing source of funding for security projects. “It's 2026 and we never touched any of those funds. It's time to put them to work to make Ethereum safer and more secure,” said Griff Green, one of TheDAO's “curators” or maintainers who was an employee of Slock.it, the company that coded up the original DAO. Aside from the pool of money for ongoing claims (yes, even a decade on, Green is still contacted for claims), TheDAO saga created other stashes that can be used for the security fund. Any capital left unclaimed in the Curator Multisig of 4,600 worth of ETH (actually mostly DAO tokens) totaling $13.5 million, will be allocated to Ethereum security initiatives. (Many of these tokens were often accidentally and erroneously sent either to TheDAO or Withdraw Contract, and while many such funds had already been returned, not everyone requested that these tokens be sent back.) Additionally, another stash of money will be used to stake to create an ongoing stream of funds for security initiatives. Back during TheDAO crowdsale, as it inched closer to its closing date, the price ticked up — first, to 1.05 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens and finally finishing at 1.5 ETH for every 100 DAO tokens. Of that ETH, 69,420 (a very crypto number) will be staked, with the yield being used to create an endowment. The group plans to use tactics such as quadratic funding, in which larger grants go to projects that have received many small donations vs. ones that have received few large donations; retroactive funding, which funds projects or expenses that have already occurred; and RFP ranked-choice voting, in which security proposals are requested and voters rank them in order of preference. Nowadays, Ethereum is much bigger and more diverse than it was at the time TheDAO was launched, when it became pretty much the only application generating much interest on the less-than-one-year-old blockchain. For infrastructure, it could support groups like L2Beat, which does research on layer 2s, and Safe, a multisig wallet service. For operational security, it could fund Yubikey, which can be used to secure servers, or Signal, a popular encrypted messaging app. '” (He was referencing news like that Eigenlayer, Apecoin DAO, Jupiter DAO, and Scroll DAO had closed or paused operations; meanwhile others like the Cronos blockchain have had their communities overruled by centralized entities or whales, such as, in this case, Crypto.com, in controversial votes.) “For me at least,” he went on, “this is what was exciting about Ethereum, that we could build something better than governments. And we could use this tool — this amazing blockchain technology — to do something that makes it easy for people to signal their decisions and have more whatever level of participation they want into the decision making in society.” Ten years after he began working on TheDAO, the new fund that Green is helping to spin up may finally achieve the goal he'd had a decade ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This legal action, reported by CoinDesk, centers on claims that Cere Network made false statements about insider token lockups and its business prospects, followed by alleged insider sales that precipitated a sharp decline in token value. The plaintiffs' complaint presents a detailed narrative of alleged deception. These representations primarily concerned two critical areas: the lockup schedules for tokens held by company insiders and the project's overall business outlook and partnerships. The lawsuit asserts these statements were knowingly false or misleading, designed to inflate investor confidence and the subsequent token price at launch. Furthermore, the complaint makes a direct connection between these alleged misrepresentations and subsequent market activity. The plaintiffs claim that shortly after the token became publicly tradable, insiders associated with Cere Network sold a large volume of their holdings. This substantial sell-off, allegedly contrary to promised lock-up periods, is cited as the direct cause of a severe price crash, resulting in significant financial losses for the investors who purchased tokens based on the original representations. It arrives amid a pronounced tightening of regulatory and legal frameworks governing digital assets in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has consistently increased its enforcement actions against cryptocurrency projects it deems to have conducted unregistered securities offerings. Legal experts often analyze cases like this through the lens of the “Howey Test,” a standard used to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and thus a security under U.S. law. The allegations against Cere Network mirror claims made in other high-profile crypto cases. This case also highlights the critical importance of transparency in tokenomics, particularly the disclosure of vesting schedules and potential market overhangs from insider holdings, which are major concerns for sophisticated investors. Industry analysts note that the Cere Network lawsuit reflects a maturation phase in crypto investing. The 2021 ICO occurred during a peak market cycle characterized by intense fundraising activity. Subsequently, the 2022 market downturn, known as the “crypto winter,” exposed numerous projects with weak fundamentals or questionable practices, leading to a wave of insolvencies and, now, litigation. This lawsuit may signal the beginning of a legal reckoning for projects that raised substantial capital during the bull market but are now facing accountability from disillusioned investors. A successful lawsuit for the investors would likely compel other projects to adopt more conservative and transparent disclosure practices. It would serve as a stark warning to founding teams about the legal perils of misstating token release schedules or business milestones. Consequently, we may see more rigorous legal vetting of whitepapers and public communications by blockchain startups seeking to avoid similar litigation. While not named in this particular suit, platforms may face increased pressure to conduct more thorough due diligence on the projects they support, particularly regarding tokenomics and insider vesting plans. The broader impact is a potential shift towards greater professionalism and accountability, aligning the crypto industry closer to traditional capital market standards, albeit on its own technological terms. This Cere Network lawsuit underscores the escalating consequences for projects that fail to uphold transparency, especially concerning foundational elements like token distribution and insider commitments. As the case progresses, it will be closely watched by investors, legal experts, and project founders alike, potentially reshaping best practices for future token-based fundraising and reinforcing the application of traditional securities law to digital asset offerings. Q1: What is the Cere Network lawsuit about?A group of U.S. investors is suing Cere Network for $100 million, alleging the project made false statements about its token lockups and business outlook during its 2021 ICO, and that insiders then sold tokens, causing a price crash. They are crucial for aligning incentives and preventing immediate mass sell-offs that can destroy a new token's market price. A successful outcome for the plaintiffs could set a legal precedent, forcing other projects to be more transparent and cautious in their fundraising communications and tokenomics design to avoid similar litigation. They should be skeptical of overly optimistic projections and understand that legal recourse, while complex, is becoming a more common tool for aggrieved investors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee has urged investors not to let the rally in gold and silver divert attention from Ethereum. BitMine chairman Tom Lee urged investors not to overlook Ethereum (ETH) despite a powerful rally in precious metals, reiterating his long-held view that Ethereum is the “future of finance.” The comment was made in response to a post by BitMine, which said sharp year-to-date gains in gold and silver were drawing investor attention away from other “structurally strong” macro themes such as AI and crypto. “Our advice: own what works, but don't abandon structurally strong ideas (hint: Ethereum is the future of finance),” BitMine wrote. BitMine, which describes itself as the largest Ethereum treasury holder, said in a recent press release that it acquired an additional 40,302 Ether over the past week, worth about $440.5 million at current prices. As of Jan. 25, the company said its total crypto, cash and “moonshot” holdings stood at $12.8 billion. Its crypto holdings include approximately 4.24 million Ether, valued at $2,839 per token. Lee said Ethereum's price ratio relative to Bitcoin has been rising steadily since mid-October. He added that major financial institutions are increasingly positioning Ethereum as a core settlement and tokenization layer. “When fundamentals go ‘up and to the right,' it's only a matter of time before price follows,” Lee said. Lee said discussions among policymakers and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year reinforced his view that financial institutions are embracing crypto and blockchain assets. Despite Ethereum and Bitcoin trading well below their all-time highs, Lee has maintained a bullish long-term outlook. While Lee argues that the surge in gold and silver is distracting investors from crypto's longer-term potential, near-term price action suggests Ethereum is still in a consolidation phase rather than an immediate breakout. According to CCN analyst Victor Olanrewaju, if ETH can hold above $2,800, the current structure favors base-building that could support a recovery toward $3,172 and $3,512. A breakdown below that level, however, would expose deeper support near $2,622, Olanrewaju said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Single-chain NFT marketplaces, where users buy and sell NFTs on a single blockchain, may deal with problems such as network congestion, high transaction fees, and limited scalability. Cross-chain integration is one way to alleviate congestion by distributing traffic across chains. Transaction Backlogs : If the maximum throughput for a blockchain network is reached, transactions can fail. Fixed Network Capacity : Each blockchain has a maximum transaction throughput; exceeding this creates performance degradation.. Performance Bottlenecks : Slow transaction confirmation times have frustrated users and decreased site reliability. Growth Limitations : Platforms that do not run multiple chains face an upper bound to their scalability that cannot be overcome. High gas fees (the transaction fees charged to log and thus validate an Ethereum blockchain transaction such as the minting or trading of an NFT) are often cited as the main barrier to entry to NFT marketplaces, and reducing costs can allow for a wider pool of creators, buyers and sellers. Reduced Marketplace Liquidity : Users trade less when they face high costs. Barrier for Emerging Creators : Artists with limited funding may be effectively locked out. Cross-chain NFT marketplace development is the process of creating a marketplace for selling NFTs that can be deployed and run on a variety of other blockchain networks. With this type of marketplace, NFTs can be transferred and traded on a variety of blockchain networks, while still maintaining their unique properties and ownership. Cross-chain platforms improve user experience across chains through interoperability frameworks and synchronized management of smart contracts. Interoperability Frameworks : Protocol provides for asset transfers across networks. Multi-Chain Support : NFTs can be minted and traded on multiple chains. Smart Contract Synchronization : Ownership and transaction histories on both networks are identical. User-Friendly Platforms : Single interfaces allow users to trade across multiple chains. Adding in optimized fees as well as automatic cross-chain and DeFi protocol routing would create an extremely efficient market for a set of digital assets, solving one of the biggest problems in digital asset trading today. Affordable Transaction Routes : Platforms choose chains based on which have the lowest fees. Avoid Congestion Spikes : Traffic is instead sent to less expensive, lower-priority networks. Accessible for All Users : Lower prices may induce more market activity. Cross-chain platforms are tools that allow for ecosystems to be built on them, where assets from these ecosystems can move across chains, making the platform more adopted and active. Access to Multiple Communities: Users on different blockchains can interoperate through the same platform. Unified Asset Listings : NFTs can be viewed and traded on multiple networks. Higher Trading Volume : Large pools of users create liquidity and an efficient market. Security is a major consideration in cross-chain NFT marketplaces, and rules must be followed to ensure the ownership of an asset is correct on the different chains. Bridge Encryption : Secure protocols enable assets to flow interoperably. Decentralized Verification : Validators prevent fraudulent transactions by reviewing them. Real-Time Monitoring : Platforms may monitor activity to identify risks. For example, one leading NFT marketplace interoperates Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon into a cross-chain NFT marketplace to offset chains' scalability and gas fees limitations and enable services to a larger audience. Improved Scalability : To ease scaling, the platform seeks to process transactions in parallel across multiple blockchains, at thousands of transactions per minute. Broader Market Reach : Connections to other networks increased the user base and attracted international buyers. Enhanced User Experience : There was to be one interface coordinating all assets, allowing for cross-chain trading and swaps. Cross-chain NFT marketplaces aim to improve upon the limitations of customary NFT marketplaces based on a single blockchain, addressing scalability and gas issues. Cross-chain NFT marketplace solutions are intended to provide interoperability, lower transaction costs, better liquidity, and an easier browsing, buying, and selling experience for users across different blockchain networks. NFT marketplaces are now providing the infrastructure needed to trade NFTs. A cross-chain NFT marketplace will be needed to scale the economy of digital assets. A successful NFT project is often defined by the strength and activity of its community. Discord has emerged as the go-to platform for NFT creators and collectors, providing tools for direct interaction, real-time updates, and immersive experiences. Building an engaged community on Discord goes beyond simply opening a server it requires strategic planning, consistent engagement, and meaningful communication. This guide explores actionable strategies to create and nurture a thriving NFT community while leveraging the benefits of professional discord marketing services to maximize growth and retention. Japan has once again found itself at the center of a global energy debate after suspending operations at the world's largest nuclear power plant just hours after it was restarted. The unexpected halt has reignited concerns about nuclear safety, operational readiness, and Japan's long-term energy strategy as it balances climate goals with public trust. The music industry has always been shaped by innovations in technology and distribution. Yet despite the growth of digital distribution and global audiences, many music creators still face systemic challenges: unequal revenue splits, delayed royalty payments, lack of transparency, and limited access to monetization streams beyond traditional licensing structures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent post on X, Pillows pushed back against the popular belief that gains from Bitcoin and traditional safe-haven assets will naturally rotate into alts. Many crypto market participants have been waiting for many months for a capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins, a trend that played out in previous market cycles, most especially in 2021. However, this has yet to play out as expected, as the crypto industry's dynamics have matured from speculative inflows from investors since then. Particularly, Pillows pointed to the current 2024/2025 market cycle as a clear example of misplaced expectations among altcoin holders. According to his assessment, the rotation into alts never materialized because the dominant buyers of Bitcoin were institutions, not retail traders. Institutional participants, he noted, tend to accumulate Bitcoin as a long-term asset and do not actively rotate capital into altcoins the way retail investors did in previous cycles. This market behavior from the new cohort of investors has contributed to a strong Bitcoin dominance even during periods of corrections. The analyst extended this logic to current expectations around gold and silver. Right now, gold and silver are trading near record highs, with social media interest in these precious metals also at remarkable highs. Silver is also pushing to new highs, currently trading around $113 per ounce. Some market participants believe that strength in these precious metals could eventually translate into Bitcoin inflows and then into altcoins. However, according to Pillows, this won't happen again, which might leave altcoin holders disappointed. He pointed to the fact that the primary buyers of gold and silver today are central banks, not retail investors. Despite the skeptical outlook, Pillows did not claim that altcoins are permanently sidelined. The Clarity Act, however, is currently facing delays in Congress. Without those conditions in place, only a small subset of altcoins will manage to perform well, while many others will gradually lose relevance and slowly dump to zero.
