                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First Brands Group founder Patrick James and his brother Edward have been indicted in New York for allegedly defrauding lenders out of billions of dollars before the auto parts supplier collapsed into bankruptcy. An indictment was made public on Thursday in Manhattan federal court. The nine-count indictment contains charges including running a continuing financial crimes enterprise, bank fraud, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. Both defendants could face decades in prison if convicted. Patrick James had been First Brands' chief executive, while Edward James was a senior vice president. Prosecutors said the defendants "perpetrated a series of fraudulent schemes" against First Brands' lenders and financing partners. These schemes allegedly included inflating invoices, double- and triple-pledging loan collateral, falsifying financial statements, and concealing substantial liabilities. "These schemes yielded billions of dollars in financing to First Brands and enabled Patrick James and Edward James to reap millions of dollars in proceeds derived from their fraud," the indictment said. First Brands was founded in 2013, and by last year had become one of the world's largest suppliers of auto parts such as brakes, filters and lighting systems, with about $5 billion in annual sales. Prosecutors said First Brands financed its growth by borrowing billions of dollars that were secured by inventory and physical assets such as plants and equipment. First Brands imploded quickly in September, when it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors. Despite borrowing $1.1 billion after filing for bankruptcy, First Brands said earlier this month that cash on hand had shrunk to $190 million. At a Thursday hearing in Houston bankruptcy court, First Brands received a judge's permission to obtain short-term financing from General Motors and Ford. The automakers will prepay $48 million for parts deliveries over the next week, and perhaps more financing week-to-week, to allow First Brands to continue operating businesses that serve them. Those businesses employ 17,000 people in North America. First Brands has already shut operations at its Brake Parts, Cardone and Autolite units, which employed 4,000 people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate on Thursday failed to clear a key procedural hurdle on a crucial government funding package, with a shutdown set to begin on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Democrats want new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement after agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens this month in Minneapolis. The vote was 45-55, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in filibustering it. The vote increases the likelihood of a government shutdown this week and will likely send Senate Republicans into negotiations with Democrats to find a solution. In addition to Homeland Security, the package that failed would also fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education. Spending measures need at least 60 votes to avert the Senate filibuster. "Democrats are ready to pass five bipartisan funding bills in the Senate," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the floor on Thursday. "We're ready to fund 96% of the federal government today, but the DHS bill still needs a lot of work." Altering the bill, including stripping DHS, would require the House of Representatives to vote on it again. The House is out of Washington on recess. Thune said Democrats are negotiating with the White House on a way forward. "Let's hope it lands," Thune told reporters Thursday. "There's a path to consider some of those things and negotiate that out between Republicans, Democrats, House, Senate, White House, but that's not going to happen in this bill," Thune said. — CNBC's Karen Sloan and Caleigh Keating contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alphabet-owned Waymo has informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that one of its driverless vehicles "struck a child near an elementary school" in Santa Monica, California The Waymo collision occurred within two blocks of an elementary school during normal school drop-off hours, while other children, a crossing guard and several double-parked vehicles were nearby. The vehicle was running on Waymo's 5th Generation Automated Driving System with no human safety supervisor in the vehicle. NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigations plans to assess "whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users." The agency's investigation will include analysis of the "intended behavior" of Waymo's driverless vehicles in school zones and neighboring areas, especially during normal school pick-up and drop-off times, as well as the company's post-impact response. "Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made," Waymo said in a statement on their blog. The company wrote that a fully attentive human driver in the same situation would have likely "made contact with the pedestrian" at a higher speed of 14 miles per hour. Waymo was involved in a separate incident on Jan. 25 in Los Angeles, where one of its Zeekr vehicles sped through a one-way residential street near Dodger Stadium. The vehicle struck several parked cars, including one that had a person in it. There were no reported injuries, Waymo said in an emailed response. Waymo did not respond to questions about how the vehicle ended up speeding in the incident. Waymo is already facing regulatory scrutiny for the behavior of its robotaxis around school buses. Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board initiated an investigation after reports of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing stopped school buses in several different locations. In a statement posted on X on January 23, the NTSB said it "opened a safety investigation to examine the interaction between Waymo vehicles and school buses stopped for loading and unloading students in Austin, Texas." The Austin Independent School District previously identified at least 19 incidents where Waymo vehicles passed its school buses, and demanded that Waymo stop using its driverless vehicles during school bus hours in Austin until the safety concerns could be resolved. NHTSA had earlier started "to investigate the performance of the Waymo ADS around stopped school buses and the system's ability to follow traffic safety laws concerning school buses," it said in a letter the agency sent to Waymo. While both the NTSB and NHTSA are vehicle safety watchdogs in the U.S. government, their roles are distinct.The NTSB investigates accidents to determine underlying causes of damaging or concerning incidents. -- CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Software stocks on Thursday slid deeper into an ongoing intense sell-off  this year as investors recoiled from the sector on growing fears that artificial intelligence could upend many firms' business models. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dropped about 5% in morning trading, on pace for its biggest one-day decline since last April during the tariff-triggered downturn. The fund is now down about 21% from its recent high, pushing the software industry into bear-market territory and underscoring how quickly sentiment has turned against one of Wall Street's former favorite industries. The concern about the AI threat outweighed solid earnings from bellwether names like ServiceNow, whose shares plunged more than 12% Thursday. The enterprise software maker topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations and issued better-than-expected guidance. "In an environment of heightened investor skepticism on incumbent application vendors, stable growth, in line with expectations, likely falls short of shifting the narrative." The pressure has deepened across the sector as investors question whether AI competitors and automation tools could erode demand for traditional software licenses and workflows. Valuations once justified by steady subscription growth are being recast as investors assess the possibility that AI could permanently shrink long-term revenue potential. Megacap Microsoft  added to the pressure, sliding about 10% after reporting a slowdown in cloud growth for the fiscal second quarter, putting the stock on track for its steepest one-day drop since March 2020. Investor unease has been amplified by the rapid pace of AI development itself. Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5 late last year, its third major model launch in just two months. The company said the model excels at coding, operating computers and assisting with complex enterprise tasks, with ideal users including professional software developers and knowledge workers such as financial analysts, consultants and accountants. "It is a little embarrassing that in 10 days, Anthropic was able to invent, co-work, put it out and everybody ... could look at it and go, 'Wow, why isn't Microsoft doing that? And that is a narrative they need to fix," Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "I think patience is going to run thin on the Street." Also on Thursday, SAP slid as much as 14% after the German software giant reported weaker-than-expected growth in its cloud contract backlog for the fourth quarter. Current cloud backlog rose 16% to 21.1 billion euro (US$25.3 billion), falling short of expectations for about 26% growth, which UBS analysts called a "disappointment." ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott sought to counter investor fears on the company's earnings call Thursday, saying concerns that AI will displace software vendors are misplaced. "The real payoff comes when trillions of tokens move beyond pilots to be embedded directly into the workflows where business decisions are made," McDermott said. He added that because AI systems are probabilistic, companies still need workflow software to ensure consistent business outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta Platforms surged more than 8% after showing signs that AI investments are boosting the bottom line, while Microsoft shares dropped as the company struggled to justify recent spending plans to investors and showed a slowdown in its cloud segment. The money flowing into AI and new technology has been a major source of debate on Wall Street as investors increasingly want to see that companies are reaping rewards from the massive spending over the last year. The social media giant issued strong guidance and said it plans to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion on its AI build-out this year. In past quarters, investors have raised concerns over the company's ambitious spending. However, the company's 24% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled primarily by online advertising, seemed to ease previous worries about its AI strategy. CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested the company is working on a range of new products this year and said investments would support his mission for "building personal super intelligence." But while investors seemed to reward Meta's spending plans, Microsoft's stock plummeted more than 11% and headed for its worst day since March 2020. Investors closely watch the segment as a stand-in for measuring enterprise AI demand. At the same time, capital expenditures and finance leases in the quarter jumped 66% to $37.5 billion, surpassing the $34.31 billion expected by analysts polled by Visible Alpha, as Microsoft supports demand for its cloud and AI segments. The company also said its struggling with compute capacity constraints as demand continues to outweigh supply. Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said Azure would have grown 40% if the company had funneled all of its new graphics processing unit chips in the first and second quarter into its Azure business. She also said the company is balancing having "incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand" with product innovation and growing first-party AI usage in services like GitHub Copilot and M365 Copilot. The company's demand backlog rose to $625 billion, up 110%, which included a $250 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI during the period. The ChatGPT maker accounted for 45% of its commercial remaining performance obligations. Analysts at Evercore ISI said "concerns about OpenAI's ability to meet funding commitments" likely contributed to the post-earnings stock spiral but called the sentiment "overblown." IBM gained a wave of confidence from investors in its AI strategy, with shares popping 8%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the software and infrastructure growth, coupled with market share gains in consulting, put the company on "track to complete its pivot to long-term growth." That growth seemed to justify the company's investments. Analysts at JPMorgan called IBM a "relatively defensive name with increasingly favorable exposure to Software and AI tailwinds." Yet ServiceNow shares dropped 11% as concerns that AI is eating away at the broader software sector's business model overshadowed the company's better-than-expected earnings. The sector has sold off in recent months on worries that new AI tools will deteriorate demand for their workflows and licenses and put a dent in long-standing revenue models. During an earnings call with analysts, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott defended the company's business model and recent multibillion acquisition spree, which some investors had flagged as a sign that the company is trying to restart growth. "Let's clear it up with the facts," he said. WATCH: Meta jumps on earnings beat, strong Q1 guidance Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. border czar Tom Homan on Thursday said federal immigration enforcement agencies are working on a plan to reduce their massive presence in Minnesota, while broadly acknowledging problems with the Trump administration's activities there. "I'm not here because the federal government has carried its mission out perfectly," Homan said at a press conference in Minneapolis, where an aggressive surge in federal deportation efforts has stoked major civil unrest. Homan said he and President Donald Trump, "along with others in the administration, have recognized that certain improvements could and should be made." Trump on Monday sent Homan to Minneapolis to manage U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's operations. The announcement came two days after federal agents killed a second U.S. citizen, Alex Pretti, in the city during altercations that were caught on camera. Homan on Thursday said he is in conversation with state and local officials, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. "This is common sense cooperation that allows to draw down on the number of people we have here. Yes, I said it, draw down the number of people here," Homan said. ICE and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency are "working on a drawdown plan," he said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I started shopping at Costco about nine years ago. Back then, I had only one child, but Costco's price for bulk diapers was reason enough to sign up for an executive membership. Here's what I buy at Costco to keep my family of six happy and full. I'm typically exhausted after grocery shopping, but a delicious rotisserie chicken makes dinner easy. I love making the Imperial Garden frozen edamame as a side dish with dinner. An added bonus is that it's one of the few plants my kids will actually eat. This big bag is full of smaller portions that go from frozen to ready-to-eat in just three minutes in the microwave. My kids love berries, and though I'm happy they reach for a healthy option, the price tag for these fruits can be high. Everyone in our house, from my 7-month-old baby to my 34-year-old husband, loves the creamy and delicious Kirkland Signature organic Greek yogurt. I always snag a few bags of the Kirkland Signature dried beef steak strips. My husband usually eats these jerky snacks with his lunch, and I often grab a handful on my way out the door for school dismissal. My husband and I rely on Kirkland Signature protein bars for a macro-friendly snack or breakfast. Costco's large box of Goldfish, which includes three bags of the snack, is the only size that makes sense for my family. Costco has a great selection of nut butter, and I usually find myself buying more than one kind. In an opinionated household of six, everyone has a favorite spread, and they don't often overlap. It may not come as a surprise, but babysitters aren't exactly lining up at my door to watch my four kids. Instead, my husband and I like to get creative with date nights at home using Costco's beef loin New York steaks. I can typically find a pack of five for about $50. We usually grill or reverse sear steaks on Friday nights after the kids are in bed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbucks is reintroducing tiers to its North American loyalty program in a bid to encourage coffee drinkers to visit more frequently as part of its broader turnaround strategy. Executives across the business are sharing more details on Starbucks' plans to drive future sales growth and profitability, including through its all-important loyalty program. The company, long seen as a leader in restaurant technology, relies on its loyalty program to encourage members to visit more frequently and spend more money. But the coffee chain also has to balance offering members enticing rewards with maintaining profit margins. The company now feels that system does not appropriately reward its most loyal customers. "Our very best customers are coming 200 times a year, and we were treating them the same as someone who comes once a year," Starbucks Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman, who joined the company in November 2024, told CNBC's Kate Rogers. The tiered program will return on March 10, this time with three levels. Starbucks Rewards members with fewer than 500 "stars" — or points — will belong to the green tier. They can enjoy a free drink or food item on their birthday, receive early access to select menu items and get personalized offers. Green-tier members' stars won't expire for six months, and they can keep them from expiring in several ways, like redeeming a reward or making a purchase. Once a customer earns 500 stars over a 12-month period, Starbucks upgrades them to the gold tier. Members can level up to reserve tier after earning 2,500 stars over a 12-month period. Customers at this level get access to exclusive merchandise and events, and they earn 1.7 points per dollar spent. The current Starbucks Rewards program gives members two stars for every dollar they spend when they pay with a preloaded Starbucks gift card. If they pay with a credit or debit card, members earn just one star per dollar spent. The rewards available for redemption are largely staying the same, although Starbucks is adding the option for a $2 discount on any order in exchange for 60 stars. The company is also adding "Free Mod Mondays," which give loyalty program members a complimentary modification to any drink on a select Monday, once per month. For the first time in nearly four years, Starbucks saw traffic from both Rewards members and nonmembers grow during the quarter. "You have to win both with your Rewards customers and — call it — the light or infrequent customer," CEO Brian Niccol said on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT — General Motors is proving to be a star tightrope walker when it comes to balancing its profits, vehicle portfolio and political whiplashing under the Trump administration. The Detroit automaker's 2025 results propelled GM's stock Tuesday to a fresh record high as the company beat earnings expectations and projected an even better 2026, including a 20% increase in its dividend and a new $6 billion stock buyback authorization. Those kinds of results are nothing new for GM, but Wall Street analysts say the company is drawing more investor interest than its peers amid the U.S. auto industry's slowing sales, political turmoil and tariffs. "GM stands out for strong execution, proven resilience, high earnings quality (i.e. strong [free cash flow] amid inventory de-stock), capital allocation and a unique NA Truck Franchise sporting far better fundamentals vs. traditional passenger auto," TD Cowen analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a Tuesday investor note. Shares of GM are up more than 70% during the past year, with multiple Wall Street analysts raising their price targets to record levels after earnings, including TD Cowen, which hiked its target Tuesday by 10% to $122 per share. GM is also increasingly standing out from its closest U.S. rivals Ford Motor and Stellantis when it comes to earnings performance and capital execution, according to many analysts. "We rate GM Overweight for its best-in-class execution amongst North America–based auto OEMs, consistent management team and strategy, and strong product portfolio allowing for above-industry pricing and margin," JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a Tuesday investor note. Ford's shares are up more than 35% during the past year, but its adjusted earnings forecast for the year is roughly half of what GM reported for 2025. Its adjusted free cash flow expectations also are billions below GM's in recent years. U.S.-listed shares of Stellantis, which is going through a major restructuring, are off roughly 27% over the past year. The company's results have largely disappointed Wall Street recently, as it attempts to focus on a U.S. turnaround. GM's 2025 results included $2.7 billion in net income attributable to stockholders, or earnings per share of $3.27; adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $12.7 billion, or $10.60 per share; and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10.6 billion. Part of what's set GM apart has been its ability to navigate through political uncertainty under U.S. President Donald Trump. But GM plans to mitigate some of that. The automaker expects to offset those costs with $500 million to $750 million in regulatory savings under Trump policies, narrower EV losses of $1 billion to $1.5 billion from lower production, and billions of dollars in other benefits such as pricing and warranty expenses. "For '26, commodity and onshoring headwinds could be offset by regulatory benefits, warranty improvements, narrowing EV losses, and lower tariffs resulting from USMCA negotiations," RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan said in a Tuesday investor note. More broadly, the automaker's EV retreat, including $7.9 billion in write-downs last year, means it's going to continue to sell more profitable traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. And GM can now produce as many gas-guzzling vehicles as the company would like without federal penalties, which were eliminated by the Trump administration. It will also save billions of dollars on purchasing credits to offset such penalties. GM CFO Paul Jacobson said on a call with investors Tuesday that no matter what changes come to the auto industry, GM's success depends on its ability to adapt to new environments and the profitability of its vehicles. GM's balancing act is easier when it can fall, if needed, onto piles of cash. The Detroit automaker has been able to increase its average annual free cash flow generation from $3 billion to $10 billion over the past five years. "This robust cash generation enables us to execute confidently across all pillars of our capital allocation framework," Jacobson said. That has helped boost the company's stock price by eliminating more than 465 million shares, or nearly 35%, of its outstanding shares that are now at about 930 million. GM was among the first major automakers to report its fourth-quarter and 2025 earnings. Its performance puts pressure on others to prove their tightrope-walking ability as well. GM seems on track to return to the same robust earnings level achieved in recent years, even with tariff costs in its cost structure," Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a Wednesday investor note.

Is upgrading from coach to business class on Amtrak actually worth it? Here's how the two travel experiences compare — and why I'd definitely splurge on business class again. Moynihan Train Hall opened in 2021 after a $1.6 billion renovation. Amtrak passengers traveling in coach or business class can purchase a single-visit pass to the New York City lounge for $50. The waiting area had its own bathrooms on either side, which helped me avoid the long lines often found at Moynihan Train Hall's public restrooms. Many passengers immediately claimed an entire row to themselves by putting their bags on the seats next to them and studiously avoiding eye contact with those still walking through the aisles. For some, facing one direction while moving in another can disrupt coordination between the brain, eyes, and inner ear, leading to dizziness and nausea. I'm prone to motion sickness, so sitting backward on the train as it swayed and jerked along the track made me feel nauseous after a few minutes. When the conductor came along to scan my ticket, I told her that I wanted to change seats before she issued my seat check, and she waved me along. There were a few empty backward-facing rows left, but I decided to sacrifice the extra space to avoid feeling sick on my trip. I sheepishly asked another passenger in a forward-facing window seat to move his backpack so that I could take the aisle seat next to him. I then realized I had hit another snag — both seat outlets for our row were located next to the window seat. If I wanted to charge my phone or computer, I'd have to reach over my seatmate and string the cord over his lap or under his legs. No wonder the window seats were all taken. I decided to forgo charging my devices for the time being. The menu included breakfast items ranging from $4 to $8, sandwiches costing between $10 and $11.50, and drinks such as soda, juice, Starbucks coffee, beer, wine, and hard seltzer ranging from $3.50 to $16. I was pleasantly surprised to find an outlet in the bathroom, as well. I originally paid $150 for my Acela business-class seat. After I received a travel alert about possible weather-related delays and cancellations, I paid an extra $63 to switch to an earlier train, bringing the total cost of my business-class trip to $213. Acela also makes fewer stops than Northeast Regional, shaving about 45 minutes off the trip between Providence and New York City. When booking a business-class ticket, the seat-selection tool indicated the direction of travel, allowing me to choose my preferred forward-facing window seat. In my Northeast Regional coach seat, the overhead bins were uncovered, allowing luggage and coats to spill out over the edges. I preferred the simplicity of having a reserved seat in business class over the rush of trying to pick a good spot on the fly while boarding in coach. In business class, the bathrooms were large enough to move around easily or even change outfits if needed. I also appreciated the bathroom's frosted window, which helped with my motion sickness while still providing privacy. I was able to refill my water bottle instead of paying for one from the café car. On the Northeast Regional train, more basic sandwiches were $10. Even some of the same items were more expensive. The ability to reserve my seat ahead of time, combined with the extra perks of more spacious seats and bathrooms, made my business-class trip more enjoyable than traveling in coach. An Amtrak representative told Business Insider that "Business Class provides an enhanced level of comfort as well as a few additional perks during your journey." For a shorter train ride, I'd probably just try my luck at finding a good seat to save money. For a four-hour trip like this one, business class was definitely worth the upgrade.</p>

Season four is based on the third novel in Julia Quinn's "Bridgerton" series, "An Offer from a Gentleman," which tells the story of Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson), the second-eldest Bridgerton and the family's resident free spirit who's determined not to live a conventional life like his siblings — that is, until he meets a mysterious lady in a silver dress, Sophie (Yerin Ha), who makes him rethink his worldview. Sophie's not the only new face we'll get to know this season. Here's where you may recognize the cast of "Bridgerton" season four from. After three seasons of waiting, "An Offer from a Gentleman" fans will finally get their Benedict Bridgerton season. "Bridgerton" is Thompson's biggest project to date, but you might recognize him from a background role in "Dunkirk," the 2020 film "Misbehaviour," or the Netflix series "Transatlantic." Sophie is Benedict's love interest this season — he meets her first in disguise at a masquerade ball, and then again when she's back in her normal life as a servant for one of the families of Mayfair. After leading season three, to the delight of Polin fans everywhere, Newton and Coughlan are back in supporting roles as Colin and Penelope Bridgerton. Newton is best known for "Bridgerton," but Disney fans may recognize him from "The Lodge." After getting married and heading off to Scotland in season three, Francesca and John are back in London for the social season — because, according to Francesca, it was getting a little crowded with the two of them, her sister Eloise, and John's cousin Michaela. It's explained during the first episode of season four that Anthony and Kate are still in India after the birth of their first child. Per Netflix, Bailey and Ashley will appear at some point in season four. Four years after their season, Bailey has become a true A-lister. 1 highest-grossing male actor at the box office in 2025, thanks to "Jurassic World Rebirth" and "Wicked: For Good," per Variety. Ashley was already known to fans of "Sex Education" before "Bridgerton." Since then, she starred in the Prime Video film "Picture This" and is set to appear in "The Devil Wears Prada 2" this summer. Baduza was introduced at the end of season three as John's cousin, Michaela, replacing the (male) character of Michael Stirling from Francesca's book, "When He Was Wicked." She only pops in at the very end of part one of season four, so we can be sure to expect more in part two. Eloise decided to get a change of scenery from the Ton at the end of season three to join her sister and new brother-in-law in Scotland, but when we pick up season four, Eloise is actually quite happy to be back among the rest of her family in London. Jessie has appeared in classic British series such as "Doctors," "Call the Midwife," and "Doctor Who." She also starred in an ITV adaptation of "Vanity Fair." Gemmell has been part of "Bridgerton" since season one and also appeared on the spin-off, "Queen Charlotte." We've only known Violet as a single mom, but this season, she has her eye on Lord Marcus Anderson (Francis), who just happens to be Lady Danbury's younger brother. Gemmell is best known for her performance opposite Colin Firth in the 1997 rom-com "Fever Pitch." She's also known to British audiences for roles in "EastEnders," "Tracy Beaker," and "Home Fires." Leung is most famous for playing Cho Chang in the "Harry Potter" films. Posy (Wei) is the nicer of the two sisters and has a less adversarial relationship with Sophie than her sister Rosamund and her mother. Wei has appeared in the Netflix series "1899" and "Black Doves." Mao most recently appeared in the film "A Big Bold Beautiful Journey." She's also been in "Goosebumps," "Metal Lords," and "FBI: Most Wanted." Sophie is close with the other servants at Penwood House, including Alfie (Moorst) and Irma (Marr). This is Moorst's first major role, though he has had small roles in "Killing Eve" and "Grantchester." Marr will be familiar to fans of "My Fault: London." Mrs. Wilson, John, and Celia have all been background players in the first three seasons of "Bridgerton" (and "Queen Charlotte), but this season, since Sophie is also a maid, the staff will play a larger role. Alexander is a staple on British TV: She's appeared in "EastEnders," "Doctors," "Coronation Street," and more. Now that her daughters have all married and had children, Portia should be able to relax this season, but a conflict with her housekeeper, Mrs. Varley, may prevent that. Fans may recognize Walker from her appearances in Gwyneth Paltrow's "Emma," "Clash of the Titans," or "John Carter." But this season, Varley is in high demand as a housekeeper. Ashbourne has been in British series such as "Grantchester," "Midsomer Murders," and "The Crown." Fun fact: Ashbourne has been married to Andy Serkis since 2002. The first season of "Bridgerton" introduced audiences to Queen Charlotte, a real-life monarch who reigned in England in the late 18th and early 19th century, as played by Rosheuvel. Rosheuvel has a long TV résumé, appearing in British shows including "Luther," "Coronation Street," and "EastEnders." On the big screen, Rosheuvel played Shadout Mapes in "Dune." Lady Danbury has been a fan-favorite since season one, largely due to the performance by Andoh. This season, Lady Danbury seems to have tired of society and has even ceded the first ball of the season to Violet Bridgerton. Like Rosheuvel, Andoh has been acting in British TV for decades. Viewers have seen that he cares deeply about the Queen, even if she doesn't always treat him well. Sachs is best known for his role in the British sitcom "Benidorm." Will and Alice were introduced in season one as friends of Simon's (Regé-Jean Page). By season four, Lady Danbury has high hopes for Alice and a potential friendship with the Queen. "Bridgerton" is the biggest role for both Imhangbe and Naomi. Before the show, Imhangbe was mainly a stage actor, and Naomi had appeared in British TV shows. This year, she appeared in "What It Feels Like for a Girl." Mr. and Mrs. Crabtree are the caretakers of Benedict's country home, charmingly named My Cottage (any "Heated Rivalry" fans know that a cottage in a romance story means business). Brown is best known for playing Septa Mordane in the first season of "Game of Thrones," though she is a well-known theater actor. Boyle has been in projects since the '70s, including films like "Barry Lyndon" and "A United Kingdom." He's also been in many theater productions and British TV series.</p>

Dimko Zhluktenko, now an analyst with Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, spoke to Business Insider about the items that he considers key to staying alive, comfortable, and as effective as possible against Russia. He still carries a lot of the gear with him, even though his role has changed. He said the military largely trusts soldiers to choose what works best for them. Zhluktenko, who worked in tech before the war, said his gear comes from a mix of state funding, items he bought himself, and crowdfunding.

This war has seen low-tech solutions fielded against cutting-edge weapons, such as wire mesh and cages used to stop advanced drones, or wooden decoy tanks designed to fool expensive munitions. As a drone operator, Zhluktenko carried a pair of scissors to sever the cables of fiber-optic drones that now litter the battlefield as these jamming-resistant drones become increasingly prevalent. Cutting the cables "became a part of our standard operating procedure" in areas saturated with fiber-optic drones, he said. Units are sometimes instructed to cut "each and every" cable they see, just in case. Zhluktenko said that they don't even worry about friend or foe concerns. Zhluktenko said that he bought retractors for all his team so they wouldn't lose their scissors. He carried an issued firearm — an old Soviet-designed weapon — which is good enough for his role because he doesn't operate in areas with much direct fighting. He replaced some internal components and the handguard, adding one from Ukrainian manufacturer Kpyk to improve grip. He said its primary use is targeting drones that can't be stopped in other ways. He also carried extra magazines and a pouch for empty ones. The grip provides "extra sensitivity" for precise movements and prevents slipping. He carried a mechanical compass because Russia's electromagnetic warfare throws off the ones in his iPhone and Garmin. And Zhluktenko also had sunglasses, since spotting his own drone in a crowded sky is critical and the "sun is a big factor." Zhluktenko had a pair of shoes he brought with him that resemble the American-designed footwear Crocs, but his are made by a Ukrainian company, M-Tac. He said they are "absolutely essential" because it's impossible to wear combat boots all the time. He also carried hand sanitizer — "you probably remember those from COVID era, but I still use them at war," he said, — a multitool that includes a knife and spoon to eat with, and a cap to protect him "from excessive sun" in the field. Zhluktenko said he carried a drone detector, an electronic system that scans radio frequencies to detect incoming drones. He said it can alert him if a drone is flying toward him and sometimes show the video feed from the enemy drone, revealing what it is seeing. Even if they don't get a warning from command posts, "there might be just some random FPV drone that just flew in and might damage us." He put a GoPro on his chest so he can rewatch his actions for improvements, almost like sports teams do with replays. Zhluktenko also has a Ukrainian-made MITLA anti-drone gun, which shoots nets to stop drones flying toward him by snagging their propellers. It's a single-use product that was released this year. And he carried electrical tape "because there is always something that you could fix" when it comes to his technology and other gear. "I didn't use whatever the government gave to me," he said. He chose a system that allows for extensive customization. Most of the injuries in battle come from shrapnel, so he wanted to protect as much of his body as possible without limiting his ability to move quickly. He customized his armor with additional panels to protect areas like his stomach, spine, ribs, and hips, areas where a tourniquet can't easily be applied. He also wears glasses with ballistic protection to shield against shrapnel. He uses a "very lightweight" helmet from Team Wendy, which supports his night-vision goggles. He said weight is important to him so that it doesn't strain his neck. The first, on a battlefield where medical evacuation and trauma care are likely not readily available, is crucial for staying alive. He also uses a carabiner to carry extra gear. He also carried a flashlight with red and white modes made by a friend's company, Syaivo, which gives them to Ukrainian soldiers for free.</p>

Amodei said that at the current rate of progress, "it cannot possibly be more than a few years before AI is better than humans at essentially everything." Replacing human labor with AI could supercharge economic growth and productivity, but the "short-term shock will be unprecedented in size," he wrote. Amodei said he was worried that workers displaced by AI "could form an unemployed or very-low-wage 'underclass,'" and a tiny minority could capture most of the financial gains from AI, creating a "level of wealth concentration that will break society."

Amodei noted that he and Anthropic's other cofounders have pledged to donate 80% of their wealth to good causes, and the company will match individual donations from its staff worth billions of dollars at its current valuation. It could be replaced by a "large universal basic income for everyone," or a "capitalist economy of AI systems" that distributes "huge amounts" of resources to people as the "overall economic pie will be gigantic," he added. They urged Americans to keep saving for retirement just in case Musk is wrong — and said that even if he's right, making sure everyone reaps the rewards of AI will require immense planning and coordination.</p>

Susan Collins of Maine said that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ended its "enhanced activities" in the state.After Andy Gerry and his business partners put a "No ICE" sign in the window of their lobster roll shop in Portland, Maine, backlash followed quickly. Gerry said dozens of bad reviews flooded the restaurant last week after lists circulated online of area businesses that had hung "No ICE" posters following the federal government's announcement that it would increase immigration enforcement in the state. For Gerry and his co-owners at The Highroller Lobster Co., it was one more challenge of running a small business. "The posters are up, and they're not coming down," Gerry said. Business Insider spoke with a half-dozen local business owners, including Gerry, about their decision to take a stance on immigration agents' presence in Portland, including whether to post signs.

Also on the table: Should they go along with calls for shutting businesses and schools on Friday as part of what organizers hope will be a nationwide campaign. Already this week, Gerry said, he's flip-flopped over whether to keep the restaurant open on Friday. The question has felt especially urgent lately in Portland, a seaside city of about 70,000, where immigration officials have had a more visible presence over the past week. While some of corporate America's top executives have weighed in with statements about the immigration actions, some small-business owners — answering phones and facing customers directly — are making personal choices about whether to publicly take action. Some workers and owners at more than a dozen businesses Business Insider visited didn't want to discuss the immigration issue because they said it didn't pertain to their day-to-day operations. Others said they didn't want to upset neighboring businesses or draw attention. Gerry said he saw putting up the sign, created by a Portland artist, as a way to amplify his staffers' voices and support anyone who might be fearful of getting caught up in the immigration sweep. He shared with Business Insider screenshots of commenters encouraging people to "review bomb" the restaurant. Earlier this month, Eden Millecchia hung a "No ICE" poster in the window of her airy shop, called Flowers & Candy. What is tangible, she said, is the drop in sales she's seen since word spread that immigration agents were focusing on Maine. For the long weekend that included Martin Luther King Day — which also included some unforgiving winter weather — her sales were down 91% year-over-year, Millecchia said. "They killed my three-day weekend, and I think that it's going to keep people from coming here," she said, referring to the presence of federal officers. That could mean fewer people will pick up the CBD products whose sales she relies on to help make rent. An ICE spokesperson told Business Insider that it doesn't comment on immigration enforcement operations. US Customs and Border Protection didn't respond to a request for comment. On the steps outside Arcana Maine, a shop that sits opposite a small park and sells jewelry and works by area artists, a circular table recently displayed free business-card-sized guides to rights enshrined in the Constitution. An employee named Nico, who declined to give his last name, said that giving the cards a prominent spot was a way to help the community. Proceeds from its sale will go to charities supporting immigrants' legal expenses, he said. For some business owners, concerns go beyond the risk of alienating customers. Ordinarily, she said, her employees would run the restaurant, which has an entirely Spanish-speaking staff.</p>

During an interview with "BBC Newsnight" that was released last week, Hinton was asked for an example of a good AI use case that makes him feel proud about his role in developing generative AI. The Alpha School is a network of private institutions that embrace AI-based learning for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The schools use a two-hour learning model, where students complete their core subjects in just a couple hours through the use of AI, freeing up their afternoons to work with teachers on life skills and hands-on workshops. Hinton said this model, where students can learn with AI instead of classroom lectures and where teachers can focus their time with students on projects and social interaction, was "a much better use of a teacher's time." Hinton said the Alpha School was expensive because AI is expensive, but said he expects it to become much cheaper as the technology becomes more affordable. Tuition at many Alpha School locations, which can be found in California, Florida, and Texas, among other state, can range from $40,000 to $75,000 a year. While he was optimistic about the uses of AI in education, Hinton told "BBC Newsnight" he didn't feel the same about AI generally. "It makes me very sad that I put my life into developing this stuff and that it's now extremely dangerous and people aren't taking the dangers seriously enough," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After signing the paperwork and moving on, I began thinking about what was next. I enjoyed some time off and dipped my toes back into the job market. Suddenly, headlines about a softening job market began to stack up. A year later, many of those same concerns still dominate the conversation. As coverage of layoffs, hiring freezes, and longer job searches became more common, I put my foot on the accelerator. I now work as a compensation analyst in the tech sector, but I had to expand my search to find this job. Previous job searches had taught me the importance of patience and resilience.

When I encountered the familiar dance of recruiters who seemed enthusiastic and then went silent, I was prepared for it. Even an especially eye-roll-worthy sequence with an exciting tech company didn't throw me off: an interview scheduled and canceled at the last minute, a later request to reschedule, a coding assignment completed, and then no response. What proved far more difficult was the uncertainty behind it all. Was the job market softening because of tariffs? Was white-collar work itself undergoing a more permanent shift? Even if there were millions of job seekers in New York, I thought there would be millions of jobs to match them. I began to wonder whether that assumption actually held. I read an article that said New York City hadn't added any new jobs in the first half of the year. Having just left a role analyzing job gains and losses across the country, I was aware of how uneven labor markets could be. I also found myself thinking about my parents and how often they had moved for work. First from Nigeria, and then multiple times within the US, they had never anchored their decisions to a single city. I still had no desire to leave New York. It was time to run a labor market experiment. I looked at Philadelphia, where rent was cheaper, and Chicago, which seemed like New York lite. Interview invites began to come from companies in Phoenix, Houston, and Nashville. I continued applying in New York, but the priority had shifted. I hadn't initially included Washington, D.C., in my expanded search because I knew firsthand how many federal employees were newly seeking work. D.C. wasn't just a government town anymore; it was home to a rapidly growing concentration of banking and technology jobs, both within the city and in Northern Virginia. After years of analyzing jobs and wages across industries and regions for the federal government, I would now be applying that lens inside a single organization, focused more narrowly on how compensation decisions play out in practice within a fast-moving, technology-driven business. Many of the articles I'd read about the job market focused on how difficult things had become for new college graduates. Having just gone through a challenging search myself, I could appreciate that reality. What stood out to me was how central geographic mobility had been to my own outcome, even with several years of experience at a well-respected government agency, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to lean on. Moving isn't an option for everyone, and I resisted it at first, but it struck me as a lever that younger workers could consider. Data shows people move far less frequently than they once did, even as opportunities have spread across more regional labor markets. Historically, going where opportunity is has been one of the most reliable ways to create a new path forward, and it turned out to be the key to my search. I live in D.C. and commute to Northern Virginia. I found the cost-of-living adjustment relatively manageable compared with New York. Citywide salaries are only modestly lower, while rents are noticeably lower, and the rental market feels much more favorable to tenants. Finding an apartment was relatively easy for me. I plan to spend most of 2026 getting settled into my new job and life in D.C.</p>

First, I should admit that ordering Starbucks' new "Iced Caramel Protein Matcha" was an obvious mistake. I'm not a huge matcha fan, and combining it with caramel and protein (part of Starbucks' push into trendy wellness drinks)? Still, I had to see what's been working so well at Starbucks lately. Starbucks' latest earnings report on Wednesday showed sales up for the second quarter in a row. This is a reversal of a downward trend over the last 18 months, ever since Brian Niccol, former Chipotle CEO, took over at Starbucks. This has meant some small but meaningful changes: trimming the chaff from its drink menu, upping efficiency and speed, requiring baristas to doodle cheerful messages on cups, and refurbishing some locations to be more appealing for sitting and spending time — even adding more power outlets.

The location I went to in suburban Connecticut was completely new inside. There were a few tables with padded chairs or stools, and a back seating section with three different styles of leather chairs. It didn't look like the Starbucks of the late '90s (when I worked at one as a teen), but it also didn't look like a copy of the minimalist, trendy coffee chains like Blank Street or Blue Bottle that usurped it as the preferred coffee destination of the discerning coastal urban office worker. The ambient bustle is nice, although I couldn't help notice the woman next to me was playing YouTube videos at full volume on her laptop with no headphones, which is fairly unpleasant. Perhaps Starbucks is trying to get back into the coffee shop/"third space" glory days, but some customers are still treating it like a public restroom that serves milkshakes — they're not yet following independent coffee shop norms and etiquette (where this kind of behavior would merit a good shaming from the workers or other customers. The menu (aside from the screen promoting the Iced Caramel Protein Matcha) had been redone to list "Coffeehouse Classics" — a smaller, manageable list of drinks that resembled things recognizable as coffee-related. That was a nice relief from two years ago, when I found myself staring at a Starbucks menu, bewildered by all the newfangled drinks and feeling like an out-of-touch grouch. Sure, many of those weird, sweet drinks are available by customization, but I think the slimmed-down menu makes sense. Yes, the barista wrote on my cup — a practice that I loathe. on my cup, and offensive to me that the assumption is I'll be charmed by this saccharine mandatory gesture. I'm sure some people might like it, but next time, I'll stick to ordering something that's more to my taste. For now, I can see why Starbucks is doing well again.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Minnesota Star Tribune is the state's biggest newspaper, and has been doing an excellent job of covering every angle of "Operation Metro Surge" — the federal government's mass deportation effort that started in December. But it is also competing in a real-time news environment where everyone is a reporter, and cellphone videos and social media posts are widely distributed. I first saw the killing of protester Alex Pretti via a Reddit post someone sent to me Saturday morning. That poses a challenge for Kathleen Hennessey, the paper's top editor: In a world where everyone can see everything — or, at least, lots of things — in close to real time, what can her publication do to set itself apart? I talked to Hennessey about what her outlet does well — and what it's not doing, at least yet — earlier this week for my Channels podcast. Below is an edited excerpt from our conversation. Peter Kafka: This is a story that's being covered by lots of different sources, including lots of individuals posting videos from their phones. How do you handle reporting on a video that lots of people have already seen, and seems quite clear? How many checks do you have to do before you can say "This is what happened" as opposed to "There's a video that appears to show this?" Kathleen Hennessey: We are very careful. What do you say to readers who say, "I'm seeing this thing on Reddit or Instagram. Why don't you guys have it?" As a journalist, it never feels good to have somebody send you an account and say, "See? And you have to say, "Yeah, I guess we're not quite reporting it that way. You've mentioned that your staff spends time chasing "ghosts" — stories that might be real, or not. A lot of the story, as everyone knows, is being reported through these Signal channels that various activists and neighborhood groups are on. And they maybe were there, or maybe it was just somebody else in a rental car … I just think that's the nature of this. It's a hard story to cover that way. I think we're better positioned than some outlets because we're just closer to the community. We have had some luck in getting ahead of that and getting better and more solid information first. Have you thought about saying, "Look, if this stuff is going to exist on social media, why don't we find some way of collecting it for our readers, because most normal people don't see all of the videos? I don't think people come to us for unverified information. And we've all had that experience where we've seen a video on social media and then we ask, "Wait, what is that?" And then we go Google the real thing. To really paint the fuller picture. So we are not yet at the point where we're trying to just gobble up all the [user-generated video], and throw it on our site and say "Here." But we are collecting a lot of it, for the production of journalism, going forward.</p>
