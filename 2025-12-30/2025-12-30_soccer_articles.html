Atlanta will join the league as its 17th team, having paid a record-high $165 million for expansion rights. The league also garnered record-breaking TV audiences this year for its Championship game on platforms like ESPN. Crucially, two of the United States women's national team's brightest stars, Sophia Wilson and Trinity Rodman, are seemingly choosing to remain stateside. On December 16, Sportico first reported that Wilson officially became the league's highest-paid player as she exercised her $1 million player option with the Portland Thorns. It serves as a counterpoint to the narrative about the league's difficulty retaining elite American players, like Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Illustration: Demetrius Robinson / The Athletic; Photos: Jamie Squire, Julian Finney, Robin Alam / Getty Images Compared to the accelerated track to Olympic gold that was 2024, this year has been one of transformational adjustments within the U.S. women's national team. This meant time to tinker with the development pipeline within U.S. Soccer, which led to the inaugural Futures Camp in January as well as a record-setting 16 new players called up to the senior team, which makes the USWNT's 2025 record of 12-3 even more impressive. Throughout the year, players spoke of steep learning curves, exceptional challenges, and confidence building as they attempted to wedge their way into the core group Hayes plans to hone in on when the intensity of World Cup preparation increases further in 2026. She kicked the summer off in surprising fashion by offering a break to players based in Europe who had just completed their seasons abroad; only center-back Naomi Girma, who was working her way back from injury, was called in to camp that summer. Everyone else featured came from the NWSL and included a slew of new faces, many of whom had been named to the January Futures camp or had recently impressed at the U-23 level, like midfielder Sam Meza and defenders Jordyn Bugg and Lilly Reale. They faced tests against China, Jamaica, Ireland, and Canada, and aced all four emphatically, scoring a total of 18 goals without conceding a single one. Given the volume of fresh faces who played during that window, this summer offered a glimpse of Hayes' program in motion. Portugal, despite having the weaker roster in terms of individual talent, was assertive and unafraid, bouncing back after conceding in the opening minute of the match to claim a massive 2-1 victory. That said, at the risk of sounding aggressively glass-half-full, this felt more like a one-off moment rather than a pattern in 2025. Hayes has been adamant all year that she would not prioritize winning over development, which is why the USWNT's other losses to Japan and Brazil that preceded this match are not “worst moment” candidates. Those games, which took place in February and April, respectively, were experimental for younger USWNT players like Ally Sentnor, Claire Hutton, and Lily Yohannes, who were going up against teams ranked among the top 10 in the world for the first time at the senior level. That was less the case in October and with a more experienced lineup, which is what made the Portugal match so confounding and disappointing. After missing out on the 2024 Olympics due to irritation in her knee, Macario started 2025 with a bang that refused to dull. Her awareness and movement off the ball are singular in the USWNT's attack, and her ability to combine with younger players like Yohannes (whose two assists this year both led to Macario goals) and older ones like Lavelle makes her a critical link between generations on the pitch. She started all 10 of the matches she appeared in and recorded two assists on top of her eight goals on the year. Hayes is good for a quirky metaphor; she's quoted Robert Frost and made culinary references to putting players in the frying pan and slow-cooking her development plans like a winter stew. My favorite line from Hayes, however, was in response to a question the former Chelsea manager is likely tired of being asked about USWNT players moving abroad to play in Europe. It's a question she thinks exposes a subtle gendered assumption about where female athletes can and should be, rather than celebrating that they have viable options. Now, all of a sudden, women get the opportunity to choose. Like, we can have an incredible league and still have incredible U.S. women's national team players that played both here and abroad and is celebrated instead of, like, picking it apart. “It doesn't mean we're always going to lose people forever, and it doesn't mean we're going to lose everyone. On a scale of 1-10, if someone had told me Sam Coffey would be in a three-way tie for second place on the USWNT's list of top goalscorers by the end of 2025, my surprise would register somewhere at around an eight. Before this year, the 26-year-old defensive midfielder had one goal to her name from a 2023 friendly against China. This year she scored four (including in another friendly against China), along with forwards Lynn Biyendolo and Ally Sentnor. “I miss plenty of them in practice, so it was about time I made one,” Coffey joked after this year's China match. I tend to play it too safe, and think too ‘worst-case scenario,' so I was just trying to join.” The USWNT hasn't seen a goalscoring No. 6 since Julie Ertz, who was known for her aerial prowess. 2025 was marked by a Triple Espresso-shaped hole in the USWNT as Wilson and Mallory Swanson were absent on maternity leave and Trinity Rodman's ongoing back injury forced her into sporadic appearances on the national team. Wilson gave birth to her daughter Gianna in September, and by November was traveling with her to the NWSL Championship in San Jose, Calif. and the USWNT's final games of the year in Florida. When she announced that she would exercise her player option with the Thorns and return to Portland in 2026, Wilson mentioned the importance of returning to a familiar place after such a significant life change and long break from soccer. We all remember the panic that set in after the USWNT fell to Portugal at Subaru Park in Philadelphia. But what stood out from this window was the team's ability to bounce back. The U.S. returned to the pitch at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn., just three days later, where they faced Portugal again. Both games started with an early goal from the U.S., but the players kept their pace in their much-needed redo. Rising star Olivia Moultrie played a key role in their 3-1 win with her second-ever career brace — a symbolic nod to the team's next generation. As Tamerra pointed out in her dispatch from Florida earlier this month, a record 16 players earned their first senior national team caps with the U.S. in 2025. Hayes' pipeline was put into motion this fall when Rodman had to miss the USWNT camps in October and November after sustaining a mid-season injury with the Washington Spirit. Paris Saint-Germain's Eva Gaetino, who was called up to train with the U.S. U-23 camp, was called up mid-window to fill in that vacancy on the senior side. This fluidity between the two teams was also highlighted by Gotham FC's Jaedyn Shaw. This was punctuated further by her dominance with Gotham, which she joined in September, and later helped lead to their second NWSL Championship win in three years. The beloved frontline of Wilson, Swanson and Rodman would be absent from the team's first camp of 2025, as they continued offseason rest and injury recovery. No one could have predicted that we would go the entire calendar year without the trio together on a pitch, especially after they won the hearts of global soccer fans with their Olympic gold medal run in Paris just the summer before. Wilson and Swanson took time away from soccer in 2025 to start their families, while Rodman's long-anticipated return to the USWNT this fall was delayed by an injury sustained during the NWSL season. To say the national team has moved on from Triple Espresso would be wrong. Sure, multiple players have stepped up in their absence, and these players will all have to earn their way back into the team's starting lineup, but as the USWNT eyes the 2027 World Cup in Brazil, this next year will be critical in identifying the tournament's final roster.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Howard sites Matt Freese's rapid ascent for why he is U.S. Soccer's Breakthrough Male Player of the Year while Landon Donovan focuses on Diego Luna's impact on the team's culture shift. For the United States Men's Soccer Team, 2025 will likely not be remembered as a year of tremendous on-field success. Yes, they did end on a high note going unbeaten in 5 consecutive friendlies capped off by their 5-1 win over Uruguay. But those results are at best neutralized and at worst overshadowed by the team's 3rd place finish in March's Nations League and their runner-up finish in the summer's Gold Cup. Howard identified a number of viable candidates, but ultimately, it was a player at the position closest to his heart whose rise was so extreme that it stood above the rest. “If we sat here six months ago and someone would have said to both you and I, ‘the starting goalkeeper is going to be this kid Matt Freese from New York City,' we'd have been like ‘caller, get off the line, you're stupid. Freese didn't emerge as a regular starter at club level in MLS until 2024 when he was 25 years old. He didn't receive his first call up to the national team until this past January. “He's gonna play every game in the World Cup,” said Howard. In Donovan's eyes, however, there was a player even more deserving than Freese. In the summer of 2024, Diego Luna wasn't able to land a place on the U.S. Olympic team, a roster primarily comprised of up-and-coming players under the age of 23. “When Diego Luna broke his nose during that January friendly and refused to come off the field," said Donovan, "[Mauricio] Pochettino gravitated to him and said, ‘okay, he's like me.” And if the coach loves a guy who's doing a certain thing, you're like, ‘I'm going to do more of that because I want to get on the field.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City could keep one eye on a sell-on clause included in their deal that took James McAtee to Nottingham Forest in the most-recent summer transfer window. McAtee decided to part ways with his boyhood club on a permanent basis this summer in the backdrop of a 2024-25 season wherein the 23-year-old struggled for regular minutes in his first full season back in the Manchester City senior ranks after successive loans at Sheffield United. Guardiola handed McAtee a new lease of life in the business stages of the 2024-25 campaign as the midfielder made his first set of Premier League starts, notably scoring on his full debut in the English top-flight as Manchester City came from two goals behind to claim an emphatic 5-2 triumph over Crystal Palace in April. However, it was too little, too late in terms of a show of faith as McAtee decided to captain England at the FIFA U-21 World Cup in the summer over a chance to represent Manchester City at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. Clubs across the Bundesliga expressed varying levels of interest in the Englishman, who toured suitor clubs' facilities in Germany before deciding to stay in England and join Nottingham Forest for £30 million. The Blues remain in an embryonic stage of their transition under director of football Hugo Viana, who made sweeping changes to Guardiola's ranks in the summer, and while the jury remains out on whether they can sustain their recent purple patch, City could well finish the season with silverware. Meanwhile, McAtee has so far struggled to establish a regular starting place in the east Midlands following major upheaval at the City Ground, where Ange Postecoglou was sacked as manager in October 39 days into his reign and replaced by Sean Dyche. Now, according to the information of Mail Sport's Simon Jones, both Leeds United and Chelsea have checked on McAtee's situation at Nottingham Forest, while Bournemouth, Fulham, and Sunderland have varying degrees of interest in a loan deal for the player. It is explained that while Dyche and the club's hierarchy think highly of the 23-year-old and maintain he has a bright future at the club, his 10 appearances so far this season with several from the substitutes' bench has alerted interested clubs. Further afield, it is pointed out that Bundesliga sides Stuttgart, Red Bull Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt have maintained a watching brief on McAtee, while Porto and PSV Eindhoven are also among the player's admirers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James has embarked on a nomadic career since leaving Real Madrid at the end of 2020. During his time with the Liga MX club, he made 34 appearances, scoring five goals and registering nine assists. Oscar Orstos reports that the Columbus Crew are hoping to seal a deal, despite being without a manager following the departure of Wilfried Nancy to Celtic. James is also said to be of interest to Orlando City, and there had been links with Santos, although the Brazilian club have denied their interest in the ace. James has 122 caps for Colombia and is eyeing a spot at the 2026 World Cup; he has already revealed he dreams of bringing the trophy back to his homeland, in what is likely to be his final tournament. He will turn 35 in 2026 and has yet to win a major trophy with his country. He has been a runner-up in the Copa America but has not tasted international success since Colombia's youth team won the Toulon Tournament back in 2011. He said: “Playing in the World Cup is always a great joy. I'm in very good spirits for that World Cup. A World Cup, and we want to win it.” Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Rodriguez became the first player since Ronaldo in 2002 to score five or more goals at a World Cup. He was left in tears after their defeat to the Selecao, and claimed a "great team has been born" after the game, although Colombia have struggled since and have not scaled such heights, even failing to qualify for the 2022 tournament in Qatar. If he does settle at a new club in MLS, James may help play a role in changing that next summer. He also played a key role at the Copa America in 2024, but Colombia were beaten by Lionel Messi and Co in the final after extra time.

"My passion for football hasn't changed, no matter how old I get," he said. "I'm very grateful to be given this opportunity. Nicknamed ‘King Kazu' in his homeland, Miura's journey began far from Japan. He started his professional career with Santos in 1986, immersing himself in Brazilian football culture at a time when few Japanese players ventured abroad. Miura would go on to play club football in Italy, Croatia and Australia, building a global resume long before such moves became commonplace for Asian players. This latest switch to Fukushima United marks his fourth loan move since 2022. Last season, Miura spent time on loan at fourth-tier Atletico Suzuka, where minutes were limited.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Napoli star Rasmus Hojlund has been hailed as the "strongest striker in Serie A" alongside Inter's World Cup-winning talisman Lautaro Martinez, as the Denmark international continues his impressive goalscoring exploits following his summer loan move from Manchester United. Hojlund joined Napoli on loan with an obligation to buy in the summer, and has already gone on to score six Serie A goals, netting a brace last time out in a 2-0 win over Cremonese. The Denmark star's exploits may come as something of a surprise, given his well-documented struggles at Old Trafford. During his first two seasons at United after joining from Atalanta, he made 95 appearances but only scored 26 goals, of which only 14 came in the Premier League. Now, though, he has been hailed as one of the best centre-forwards in Italy's top-flight. He has already eclipsed his league goal tally at United last season, doing so in 22 fewer games. Giampaolo Pazzini, a former striker with Fiorentina, AC Milan and Inter, has also waxed lyrical about Hojlund, while giving Napoli boss Antonio Conte credit for bringing the best out of him. Pazzini told Sportsmediaset: “At the moment, Hojlund, under [Antonio] Conte, is the strongest striker in Serie A alongside Lautaro [Martinez]. “He has always been a good player, but with great instinct, great power, he was a wild horse.

He said: “Hojlund is a player who is very young, he's still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal. “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.” A member of Hojlund's entourage, Luca Nigriello, revealed his motivations, adding: “When we were closing the operation with Napoli there was great enthusiasm. Rasmus arrived from a complicated period at Manchester United, but he never experienced Napoli as a stop-gap (ripiego). He is a chameleon who adapts to what the team asks.” Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Napoli play Lazio on Sunday as they bid to continue their title defence. Conte's side are third in Serie A, two points behind current leaders Inter. Hojlund won the Suppercopa Italiana this year, and is now gunning for his first major trophy in Italy. He did lift the FA Cup during his time at United, having also won the league with Copenhagen in 2020-21.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Only one had reached the knockout rounds in Qatar. That same team, the U.S., would go on to win consecutive Concacaf Nations League titles. At the start of this World Cup cycle, the Americans were rising, whereas Mexico was in decline and Canada's trajectory was murky. Canada went furthest at the 2024 Copa América but, unlike its rivals, hasn't won a trophy of any kind. All three have spent time as the region's highest-rated team (per Elo). After bossing Mexico at the 2023 Nations League finals, newly re-hired head coach Gregg Berhalter said: “If we continue to develop in the way that we have, if this group continues to go where we think they can go, the sky's the limit.” A year later, they were losing to Colombia 5-1 and crashing out of the Copa América. Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino brought hope, then a barrage of pessimism and doubt, and then — now — the mood has swung again, back to where it was at the start of the cycle. It crept, cautiously, toward optimism again as the U.S. won friendlies against Japan, Australia and Paraguay this fall, with a draw against Ecuador in between. Then a team of reserves — Pochettino would hate that description, but it's accurate — smoked Uruguay, 5-1. Rationally, such a lofty goal still seems far-fetched. The team that will likely take the field on June 12 has, due to injuries and other absences, hardly played together under Pochettino. Pochettino's masterplan, to light fires under “regulars” who'd grown too comfortable, has seemingly worked. The question, now, is whether Pochettino can add an extra story and take the USMNT to a place it's never been. At the very least, its ceiling now seems higher than Mexico's and Canada's. This will be Mexico's third opportunity to host a World Cup, and the three host cities (Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey) should leave a wonderful impression on the world. But folklore and culture won't propel Mexico towards a World Cup semifinal. Life was good for head coach Javier Aguirre. Since then, Mexico has fallen back down to earth. Against two World Cup-caliber opponents, Mexico was outplayed, both tactically and physically. Aguirre was dumbfounded by his team's performances in those friendlies, which caused great concern among the fanbase. Today, Aguirre remains unsettled on a preferred starting XI. Yet, there will be few surprises in the teamsheet when Mexico kicks off the World Cup against South Africa on June 11. And that's where the problem lies for Mexico. The 2026 squad will have some new faces, like 17-year-old midfield prodigy Gilberto Mora of Club Tijuana and Toluca's central midfielder Marcel Ruíz. Santiago Giménez (AC Milan) and Germán Berterame (Monterrey) will compete with Fulham's Raúl Jiménez at the No. But beyond those names, this summer's World Cup squad will resemble the 2022 team that failed to progress from the group stage in Qatar. Aguirre must hope that playmakers like Diego Lainez and Alexis Vega, two players who have not lived up to expectations with the national team, deliver top-tier performances next summer. In recent friendlies against Ecuador, Uruguay and Paraguay, Mexico competed but lacked an attacking edge in the opponent's final third. Draws against Japan (0-0) and South Korea (2-2) in September left Aguirre grasping for solutions in several key areas of the field, namely both fullback positions and goalkeeper. On paper, Mexico's Group A opponents won't cause too much concern. There isn't a tournament contender among South Africa, South Korea, and the UEFA playoff entrant (either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czech Republic or Republic of Ireland). And yet still, there's a fear in Mexico that Aguirre's side could flop on home soil. On the other hand, there's hope that national pride and partisan crowds in Mexico City and Guadalajara will inspire Mexico in 2026. That could either spell disaster or push Aguirre and Mexico to do what no other Mexican national team has done in the past – in a good way. Both Canadian players and Canada Soccer genuinely hope that this tournament irrevocably changes the sports landscape at home. But more children play soccer than any other team sport, and have for a generation. When you couple soccer's rise with a shift in demographics and hockey nursing a black eye in the court of public opinion – numerous scandals will do that – you can understand why Canada hopes this tournament becomes a historical inflection point. Canada's World Cup group features Switzerland, Qatar and the winner of a UEFA playoff (Italy, Wales, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Northern Ireland). Manager Jesse Marsch has done well to prepare his team for this opportunity. Whereas Pochettino spent 2025 rotating players for the United States to better understand his player pool, Marsch narrowed in on a pool of around 30 players and relied on them heavily through the final three international windows. That's fewer regular time losses than Mexico and the U.S. What was lacking, however, and what was a focus of Marsch's work late in the year was the cunning and strategies that will help Canada close out games. Canada lost its cool against lowly Guatemala (106th in the world) in the Gold Cup quarterfinals and suffered an early exit from a tournament it had designs on winning. Canada was a lot of fun through Marsch's first year in 2024. To his credit, Canada's identity became solidified through 2025: Marsch's version of Red Bull soccer evolved with his player pool. Canada became the most defensively resolute team in Concacaf, allowing just one goal through its final six games – and that's without stalwart defenders Alistair Johnston and Moïse Bombito. Canada was at its best playing European teams; easily handling Ukraine at home then getting back-to-back wins in Europe for the first time (against Romania and Wales) were highlights. That experience should serve them well at home this summer, where two European teams will be waiting in the group stage. The most inspiring snapshot of Canada's World Cup readiness came in October. In an intense stadium in New Jersey filled with Colombian fans, Canada held Colombia, then ranked 13th in the world by FIFA, to a 0-0 draw and dominated play for long stretches. This game suggested Canada could grind out a result against a superior team with newfound resoluteness and confidence. Canada still has to create and score in a way its co-hosts can, so it will still feel like an underdog in a way that Mexico and the United States won't. Yet just as much, its opportunity to surprise and change the way soccer is viewed at home feels like a much bigger motive is at play than that of their co-hosts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reece James celebrates Chelsea's Club World Cup win Luke Hales/Getty Images Three days later, he lifted his first trophy as captain when Chelsea won the Conference League, and on July 13, he added another with victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final. October 18 saw James reach 200 appearances for his boyhood club on their trip to Nottingham Forest. Tonight, when Chelsea host Bournemouth, will mark another milestone: one year injury-free. After a hamstring injury in November 2024, James returned to Enzo Maresca's matchday squad on December 30 for their 2-0 defeat away at Ipswich Town and, bar a brief illness in March, has been fit ever since. Given how injuries have disrupted the 26-year-old's career to date, that is a huge achievement — for which both player and club deserve credit. “The fact that he's been able to sustain a good period without injury is definitely a positive sign for him going forward,” says physiotherapist Luke Anthony, who has not worked with James but provided The Athletic with a general view from his time at Watford, Reading, and Norwich City. “What may have happened is either that he has just been able to develop that consistency of training and develop strength in his body, (or) whether he has changed his approach.” Two statistics from Chelsea's festive fixtures highlight the improvement in James' availability. Hamstring and knee problems have particularly plagued James, and across the past three full seasons, he has averaged 22.3 appearances in all competitions per campaign. He has already made 22 appearances this season with five months remaining. The club's medical team, led by Bryce Cavanagh, have managed James carefully. Ben Macdonald, one of Chelsea's rehab physios, has been tasked with working closely with James on his fitness and the two have developed a strong rapport. James is also an example of how Chelsea believe their approach to load management can pay off. As The Athletic have reported, this season has seen a deliberate strategy of carefully managing players' minutes, led by the medical and performance team. Previously, steep drops were followed by sharp peaks as he was introduced to a heavy load quickly after returning. “Sometimes with these soft-tissue injuries, you don't necessarily get the warning signs, and the player plays and feels OK. Then the temptation is to use him again, especially if they're an important player in your team.” “It takes a period of time to develop that, especially when you're coming back from injury. A tweak to James' position could also have helped his continued fitness. The central positions will generally have less distance of sprints and high-speed running. “As a midfielder, you'll have more distance covered, but you'll likely have fewer offensive and defensive sprints, which are again, slightly more attritional for a soft-tissue injury.” The individual work he has done includes working with his own external physiotherapist, in addition to the support he is given by Chelsea. James' maturity was evident in his post-match interview with Sky Sports on Saturday, when he said Chelsea “have ourselves to blame” for errors that cost them in the 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa. “Absolutely, yes,” Maresca said when asked in his press conference ahead of the Villa match if James was now playing and behaving like the captain he wanted. And then because we know that he can behave as a leader.” Chelsea have supported their captain throughout his injury troubles. In September 2022, he signed a contract that runs until 2028. Even if James travels to the World Cup in 2026 with England as expected, that does not necessarily mean an agreement could not be reached this summer; Cole Palmer, for instance, signed a new deal in August 2024 after the European Championship. At a time when Chelsea need strong leadership, James' continued fitness and growth are surely one of the biggest positives to take from 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gianni Infantino has overseen several major rule changes in soccer, a sport traditionally resistant to altering how the game is played or officiated. With the 2026 World Cup now less than six months away, the FIFA president has again hinted at potential modifications, including a possible adjustment to the offside law long advocated by Arsène Wenger. Some measures were fully implemented while others were trialed, but collectively they provided valuable data ahead of the 2026 tournament. Speaking during the inaugural World Sports Summit in Dubai, Infantino reflected on the evolution of officiating in recent years: “We introduced VAR to make football fairer, to give referees the chance to correct a mistake that millions of people, both at home and in the stadium, might have seen. We are continuously improving VAR with increasingly advanced technology to help referees make the right decision.“ Perhaps in the future the attacker would have to be completely ahead to be considered offside,” he added. Arsene Wenger, FIFA Chief of Global Football Development. The offside law has been a frequent source of debate in recent seasons, with former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger emerging as the leading proponent of reform. Now serving as FIFA's Chief of Global Football Development, Wenger's proposal has gained renewed momentum, with Infantino publicly acknowledging its growing relevance. FIFA president Infantino makes bold claim about Cristiano Ronaldo's Saudi Pro League growth ahead of 2034 World Cup During the 2022 World Cup, matches regularly featured extended stoppage time to compensate for delays, a measure that later fell out of favor. Still, FIFA continues to explore solutions aimed at improving game flow. “We are also evaluating measures to prevent time-wasting. It is important for the game to flow properly, so interruptions must be minimized,” Infantino concluded. Since then, the rule has largely remained intact, even as VAR has shifted decision-making from the assistant referee to technology, fueling ongoing controversy. An attacker would only be offside if their entire body were ahead of the second-to-last defender, meaning that any overlap would keep the player onside. If implemented, the new interpretation would favor fast, attacking players and challenge teams that rely on a high defensive line, while sides defending deeper would be far less affected by the change.
