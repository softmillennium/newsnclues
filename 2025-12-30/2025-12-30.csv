            New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's inauguration will feature Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the two most prominent leaders of the Democratic Party's progressive movement.
    


            Mamdani, who will be publicly sworn in at a City Hall inauguration ceremony on New Year's Day, will be introduced by fellow New Yorker Ocasio-Cortez, his transition team told CNN.
    


            “For the many New Yorkers who have long felt betrayed by a broken status quo, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies a new kind of politics that puts working people at the heart of it,” Mamdani said in a statement. “I've been so proud to count her as a partner across the many stages of our people-powered movement—from the primary campaign to our Forest Hills rally in October to the very first day of the transition—and I'm honored that she'll be a part of our historic City Hall inauguration.”
    


            Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed Mamdani early in the primary and campaigned alongside him on several occasions, is expected to deliver opening remarks at the ceremony, which is open to 4,000 ticketed guests.
    


            Mamdani's transition is also organizing a “watch party” set to take place alongside Broadway, part of an effort to make the celebration accessible to any New Yorker who wants to attend.
    


            Sanders will administer Mamdani's oath of office during the City Hall ceremony. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, will technically take office at midnight on New Year's Day.
    


            As thousands of revelers usher in the new year in Times Square, Mamdani and his family will be in Lower Manhattan where a private swearing-in ceremony is expected to take place at an old, now defunct subway station underneath City Hall Plaza.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed deep concern after Russia reported an attempted Ukrainian drone attack on President Vladimir Putin's state residence.

Kiev launched 91 long-range strike drones in an attack on Putin's residence in Novgorod Region on the night of December 28-29, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. All the UAVs were intercepted and there were no casualties or material damage involved, he added.

”Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation,” Modi posted on X on Tuesday in English and Russian. “Ongoing diplomatic efforts offer the most viable path toward ending hostilities and achieving peace.”

Earlier on Tuesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called on both sides to “avoid further escalation” after the attack, while Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “reported targeting” of Putin's residence.

Deeply concerned by reports of the targeting of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation. Ongoing diplomatic efforts offer the most viable path toward ending hostilities and achieving peace. We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any…

“Pakistan expresses its solidarity with the President of the Russian Federation, and with the government and people of Russia,” Sharif said on X.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov told Russian media that during a phone conversation with Putin on Monday, US President Donald Trump said he was “shocked by this news and expressed outrage, stating that he could not have imagined such crazy actions on the part of Kiev.”

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has denied the attack, claiming Moscow is only seeking a pretext to jeopardize the “progress” made by the US and Ukraine on peace talks and to attack the government quarter in Kiev.

In his post on X, Modi pressed for the US-mediated peace process to continue.



”We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them,” he said.

India has consistently called for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, while refusing to join Western sanctions on Russia. Modi visited both Moscow and Kiev in 2024.

Russia's cutting-edge nuclear-capable Oreshnik hypersonic missile system has entered service in Belarus, the Defense Ministry in Moscow has announced.

In a statement on Tuesday, the ministry said the medium-range system has officially “assumed combat duty.” It also released the first-ever official footage of the system, showing its delivery and installation in Belarus, along with a ceremony marking the commencement of its combat duty.

“All conditions for combat duty and accommodation of Russian personnel were prepared in advance in Belarus,” the ministry noted, adding that crews responsible for launch, communications, security, and power supply “underwent retraining on modern facilities” before entering service. The personnel are now exploring new patrol areas and conducting reconnaissance.

Unveiled in November 2024, an Oreshnik carrying conventional warheads struck a major military plant in Ukraine in what Moscow called a successful “combat test.” It is capable of delivering multiple independently targetable warheads (MIRVs) at hypersonic speeds, with each warhead maintaining guidance and maneuverability even during the final approach, making interception extremely difficult.

Russian officials have likened its conventional destructive power to that of a low-yield nuclear strike, highlighting its dual strategic and tactical potential. By comparison, Western militaries currently lack a directly equivalent hypersonic MIRV-capable system, giving Oreshnik a unique edge in speed, maneuverability, and multi-target strike capability.

Up to ten systems are slated for deployment in Belarus under an agreement reached between Minsk and Moscow shortly after the missile's initial combat test.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced in a parliamentary address this month that the Oreshnik systems had arrived in Belarus on December 17. Deputy Defense Minister Pavel Muraveyko said last week the combat patrol areas are set and the system is fully operational and ready for use.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a mid-December address to the Defense Ministry, said the Oreshnik will also enter combat in Russia before the end of the year. He emphasized that the system is part of Russia's new weaponry meant to “ensure strategic parity, security, and global positions of Russia for decades to come.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced plans to award the Israel Prize, the country's highest civilian honor, to US President Donald Trump – the first time the accolade will be bestowed upon a non-Israeli or a sitting foreign head of state.

Speaking after a meeting at Trumpэs Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday, Netanyahu said the decision reflects “overwhelming sentiment” in Israel regarding the US president's support for the nation. The announcement breaks a 72-year tradition of honoring Israeli citizens for excellence and follows Trump's exclusion from the Nobel Peace Prize shortlist in October.

“President Trump has broken so many conventions,” Netanyahu remarked, adding that Israel had therefore decided to “break a convention, too.”

Trump, a close ally of Netanyahu and staunch supporter of Israel, called the award “surprising and very much appreciated.” While the Israel Prize typically requires recipients to be citizens or residents of Israel for at least three years before nomination, there is an exception for those who have made a “special contribution towards the Jewish people,” according to Jerusalem Post.

In October, Netanyahu lauded Trump as Israel's “greatest friend ever” following Hamas' release of the last 20 surviving hostages taken during the October 7, 2023 attacks, as part of a Gaza peace deal facilitated by the US leader and his team.

Ahead of his meeting with Netanyahu on Monday, Trump claimed that “almost every hostage released was due to my efforts… none were released during the Biden administration.” However, 107 hostages were freed in 2023 while Joe Biden was president, with another 33 returned in early 2025 under a deal negotiated before the end of Biden's term.

In various speeches and interviews, Trump has asserted that he has “stopped eight wars,” positioning himself as uniquely capable of imposing order on global conflicts through his personality and negotiating skills.

MOSCOW, December 30. /TASS/. The dialogue between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US leader Donald Trump remains based on mutual trust, and Kiev's provocations cannot undermine it, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, commenting on Kiev's attempt to attack Putin's state residence.

""The leaders maintain a trusting dialogue and continue to engage in talks. Such provocations, such acts of state terrorism, cannot undermine this level of mutual trust between the two presidents,"" he stressed.

Spanish woman's attempted restoration of church artwork was widely mocked but became lucrative tourist attraction

Cecilia Giménez, the woman who achieved unwanted international fame for her botched “Monkey Christ” restoration of a 19th-century mural in Borja, north-east Spain, has died aged 94.

In 2012, Giménez, an amateur artist, decided to restore Ecce Homo, a mural by a local artist, Elías García Martínez, that hung in the Santuario de Misericordia church in Borja. However, her talent as an artist was not equal to her good intentions and she produced what was described as the worst restoration in history.

Amid the storm of mockery and bad publicity over what became known as the Monkey Christ, Giménez took to her bed with an attack of anxiety, losing 17kg (37lb) in the process. However, she soon found that notoriety had an upside as people began bidding to buy her own art, which she sold on eBay, and she later donated the proceeds to a Catholic charity.

The botched restoration became first an internet sensation and then a tourist attraction and the church began charging for admission. Ryanair laid on special flights to Zaragoza, the nearest airport, and today thousands of people continue to visit the village to see her work.

Not only has the picture's fame provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum's two caretakers, but the €600,000 it has brought to the village helps fund places at Borja's care home for elderly people.

In 2023, Behold the Man (English for Ecce Homo), an opera based on the story written by Andrew Flack, a US public relations expert, with music composed by Paul Fowler had its world premiere at Opera Las Vegas.

Giménez was not well enough to attend but her niece was there on opening night to represent the family.

Eduardo Arilla, the mayor of Borja, said in his tribute to Giménez that she had lived a hard life. She was widowed while still young with two disabled children, one of whom died of muscular dystrophy.

Arilla said the greatest homage that could be paid to anyone was what they had done with their life, emphasising the benefits she had brought to Borja. He said the Ecce Homo centre would be named after her, and perhaps a street or a square.

The local church said in a statement: “Cecilia was a devoted mother and a fighter, a strong woman, but above all we should talk about her generosity which has won her the whole world's affection.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Isaac Herzog's spokesperson says he has not spoken to Trump since US president wrote to urge him to stop trial

The office of Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, has denied a claim by Donald Trump that Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial on corruption charges, would soon receive a pardon.

Speaking shortly before his meeting in Florida with the Israeli prime minister on Monday night, Trump said he had been told by Herzog that a pardon was “on its way”.

“How can you not?” Trump said. “He's a wartime prime minister who's a hero. How do you not give a pardon?”

Trump added that he “spoke to [Herzog] and he tells me it's on its way. You can't do better than that, right?”

Netanyahu, Israel's first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime, denies bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges brought in 2019. His supporters have dismissed his trials as politically motivated.

The 76-year-old could be sent to prison if convicted, and a lengthy ban on holding public office would be part of any sentence. Given Netanyahu's age, this would end his political career, Israeli analysts say.

Trump has repeatedly raised the prospect of a pardon for Netanyahu, in social media posts and during a speech to Israel's national assembly in October. A month later, the US president wrote a formal letter to Herzog urging him to grant clemency and describing the case as “political, unjustified prosecution”.

Asked on Monday about Trump's remarks, Herzog's office said the Israeli president had not had any conversations with Trump since receiving the letter in November.

“There has not been a conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted,” Herzog's office said in a statement issued a few minutes after Trump's comments.

Responding to that earlier request, Herzog's office said the Israeli president appreciated Trump's “unwavering support of Israel, his immense contribution to the return of the hostages, the transformation of the Middle East and Gaza and the safeguarding of Israel's security” but stressed that “anyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures”.

Many in Israel were outraged by Trump's intervention, saying it infringed national sovereignty.

Herzog's office said the Israeli president had spoken to a representative for Trump then and it was explained that any decision would be made in accordance with established procedures.

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, is reported to have met Herzog earlier this year to discuss cancelling Netanyahu's trial. Herzog delivered a lengthy lecture explaining why this was not in his power, a Jerusalem Post columnist reported.

“The cases are proceeding at an infuriatingly slow pace but they are closing in on the defendant. Therefore, a pardon is required. Actually, not a pardon. For a pardon, you have to admit and step down. As far as Netanyahu is concerned, the trial must be cancelled. At any cost,” Ben Caspit wrote.

Netanyahu himself submitted a formal pardon request to Herzog on 30 November, arguing that frequent court hearings impaired his ability to govern and that clemency served the national interest by acting to “lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation”.

The request by the six-time prime minister drew fierce criticism from opponents, who said pardoning him mid-trial would be a total breach of the rule of law.

Experts say that although presidential powers of pardon can be exercised with some flexibility, they are intended to be used after conviction of an individual and there is no precedent for cancelling an ongoing trial, as Netanyahu and Trump are demanding.

Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 (£198,000) worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine has denied the claim and accused Russia of trying to undermine diplomatic progress – so who believes what?

Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates

Russia alleges Ukraine tried to hit Vladimir Putin's residence in a mass drone attack on Monday. The foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Russian air defences shot down 91 drones and he called the attack an act of “state terrorism”.

Ukraine has denied the claim and Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Lavrov of spreading “typical Russian lies” to try to undermine diplomatic progress between Kyiv and Washington after a bilateral meeting with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Sunday.

The claim, as so much of geopolitics in 2025, seems to have been primarily targeted at an audience of one, Trump, and he seems to have bought it. “It's one thing to be offensive, because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that,” Trump said on Monday.

The allegation comes at a delicate diplomatic moment as Trump insists a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is “95% done”. Zelenskyy is desperately trying to keep the US president onside while Russia has persuaded Trump it is ready for negotiations but appears unwilling to give up on its maximalist war aims.

Absolutely none, and on Tuesday Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there would be none forthcoming. “I don't think there should be any evidence if such a massive drone attack is being carried out, which, thanks to the well-coordinated work of the air defence system, was shot down,” he told journalists in a phone call.

In a word, no. The Kremlin and the defence ministry often make fantastical claims about the war in Ukraine. Moscow still insists it never targets civilians in its drone and missile raids on Ukraine, despite regular evidence to the contrary. Russian authorities also have a long history of fictitious stories about Ukraine, stretching back to the 2014 annexation of Crimea when Putin claimed the Russian special forces annexing the peninsula were in fact local people.

It's hard to say for sure. Ukraine certainly has a history of carrying out strikes deep inside Russia, including assassinations of military figures, drone attacks on oil refineries and, most spectacularly, Operation Spiderweb, in which camouflaged drones launched from trucks destroyed numerous Russian strategic bombers deep inside Russia. Certainly, Putin's residence would be seen by Ukrainian planners as a legitimate and tempting target. Making the move just at a key point in negotiations with Trump would be an odd choice, however.

There are a couple of possibilities. Zelenskyy has claimed the accusation is a cover story to allow Moscow to strike government buildings in Kyiv, especially as Lavrov has said “retaliatory targets” have already been selected. But as the last four years show, Moscow does not really require cover stories to hit all kinds of targets in Ukraine.

A more likely scenario would be that Putin, well aware of the theory that Trump is often swayed by the last person he spoke with, was wary of Zelenskyy's in-person visit to Mar-a-Lago and what might be achieved in the talks. By accusing the Ukrainians of escalation, both publicly and to Trump on the phone, Putin may have been hoping to change the calculus in the US president's head one more time and stave off any decisions the Kremlin would consider overly friendly to Kyiv.

The early indications are Trump believed the claim and was angered by Ukraine's supposed actions. When a reporter suggested the claim could have been fabricated, Trump appeared to be considering the possibility for the first time. “You're saying maybe the attack didn't take place? That's possible too I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did,” he said.

The CIA could presumably give Trump a decent analysis on whether or not it believes the claim is true, but reports suggest the president often ignores the findings of his own intelligence agencies.

In European capitals the claims have been met with huge scepticism, but elsewhere there are signs that the accusation has landed. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, wrote on X in English and Russian that he was “deeply concerned” by the reports. “We urge all concerned to remain focused on these efforts and to avoid any actions that could undermine them,” he added.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on X on Tuesday: “We were disappointed and concerned to see the statements by Emirati, Indian and Pakistani sides expressing their concerns regarding the attack that never happened.” He said none of the three issued a statement when a Russian missile hit a Ukrainian government building in September.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Iran's president urged his government to listen to the “legitimate demands” of protesters, state media reported yesterday, amid the country's largest protests in three years after it currency plummeted to a record low against the US dollar and the head of the central bank resigned.

State TV reported the resignation of central bank governor Mohammad Reza Farzin, while traders and shopkeepers rallied in Saadi Street in downtown Tehran, as well as in the Shush neighborhood near Tehran's main Grand Bazaar. Witnesses reported similar rallies in other major cities including Isfahan in central Iran, Shiraz in the south and Mashhad in the northeast.

Photos from the Fars News Agency had shown tear gas being used to disperse protesters, but by yesterday, most shops and cafes in the city center were open and anti-riot police were keeping watch on the main squares.

The US dollar was trading at about 1.42 million rials when the shutdown began — compared with 820,000 rials a year ago — and the rial strengthened only slightly by yesterday.

Monday's protests were the biggest since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations. She was arrested by the country's morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.

Witnesses said that traders shut their shops and asked others to do the same. On Sunday, protests were limited to two major mobile markets in downtown Tehran, where the demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans.

A trader, who did not give his name, told the Etemad that officials had offered no support to storekeepers battling soaring import costs.

“They didn't even follow up on how the dollar price affected our lives,” he told the daily. “We had to decide to show our protest. With this dollar price, we can't even sell a phone case, and the officials don't care at all that our lives are run by selling mobile phones and accessories.”

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian urged the government to take the protests seriously.

“I have asked the interior minister to listen to the legitimate demands of the protesters by engaging in dialogue with their representatives so that the government can do everything in its power to resolve the problems and act responsibly,” he wrote on social media.

Parliamentary Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf also called for “necessary measures focused on increasing people's purchasing power,” state television reported.

The rapid depreciation is compounding inflationary pressure, pushing up prices of food and other daily necessities, and further straining household budgets, a trend that could worsen with a gasoline price change introduced in the past few days.

State media praised Peng Peiyun (彭珮雲), former head of China's National Family Planning Commission from 1988 to 1998, as “an outstanding leader” in her work related to women and children.
The reaction on Chinese social media to Peng's death in Beijing on Sunday, just shy of her 96th birthday, was less positive.

Shamans in Peru on Monday gathered for an annual New Year's ritual where they made predictions for the year to come, including illness for US President Donald Trump and the downfall of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

“The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill,” Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, dressed in traditional Andean ponchos and headdresses, and sprinkling flowers on the sand.

The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords and burned incense, some of which they stomped on.

In this year's event, the shamans said that Maduro would be removed from office, and added that global conflicts such as the war in Ukraine would continue.

“We have asked for Maduro to leave, to retire, for President Donald Trump of the United States to be able to remove him, and we have visualized that next year this will happen,” shaman Ana Maria Simeon said.

Garcia added that Maduro would flee Venezuela and not be captured.

In addition to Trump and Maduro, the shamans waved posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Closer to home, Garcia predicted that Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori, would emerge victorious in Peru's presidential election after three failed bids.

“The woman who dreams of ruling Peru, I have been able to see through the wachuma [ancestral plant] that Keiko Fujimori will be president in 2026,” he said.

The shamans also foretold the end of Russia's war in Ukraine, which it previously predicted to happen in 2023.

“I see that the conflict will end; they will raise the flag of peace,” Garcia said.

The group has a mixed record with its annual predictions.

Last year, they warned a “nuclear war” would break out between Israel and Gaza, where a ceasefire is currently in place.

In December 2023, the group correctly predicted that Alberto Fujimori, who had been imprisoned for human rights abuses, would perish within 12 months. He died from cancer in September last year at the age of 86.

Before Monday's ceremony, the shamans met to drink hallucinogenic concoctions derived from native plants — including ayahuasca and the San Pedro cactus — which are believed to give them the power to predict the future.

The prayers to the gods on Monday, performed amid flowers and incense, as well as dances, are intended to encourage leaders to make good decisions.

The shamans also predicted natural disasters, such as earthquakes and climatic phenomena.

The reaction on Chinese social media to Peng's death in Beijing on Sunday, just shy of her 96th birthday, was less positive.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine cannot simply withdraw from its territories as part of any peace deal with Russia, emphasizing that the issue goes beyond legal constraints and affects people's lives, during an interview on FOX News Channel's ""Special Report with Bret Baier"" aired on Dec. 29.

""We can't just withdraw, it's out of our law. We can't just withdraw from our territories. (But) it's not only the law,"" Zelensky said. ""People live there, 300,000 people... We can't lose those people.""

Zelensky's remarks follow a Dec. 28 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence, which he described as productive.

""I'm thankful to President Trump, really, it was a very productive meeting and in Mar-a-Lago maybe another mood here,"" Zelensky said following what looked like one of the better face-to-face meetings between him and Trump this year. 

The Ukrainian president added that a 20-point draft of the revised peace plan to end Russia's full-scale war is now almost complete: ""...When I said (that) 90 percent (of the plan is complete) it's true because there are (issues) with only with two points,” Zelensky said, adding that the remaining unresolved issue centers on territories.

""Yes, this is difficult question,"" he added. 

Zelensky stressed that while Ukraine and Russia hold opposing views on territorial issues, the United States understands the positions of both sides and ""tries to find a compromise.""

Zelensky said Ukraine has demonstrated concrete steps toward peace over the past month and raised the possibility of a referendum on the peace plan. At the same time, Zelensky said a referendum could not be used to justify withdrawing from Ukrainian territory under current conditions.

""We can't go out because 100,000 have been wounded, dozens have been killed there,"" he said, referring to Ukrainian losses. ""And also our army (is) there.""

The Kyiv Independent can't immediately verify the figures. 

Instead, Zelensky said Ukraine has proposed establishing a demilitarized free economic zone as a compromise, under which both sides would take reciprocal steps and pull back their forces by several kilometers.

Zelensky said Russia's recent territorial gains, estimated at roughly 3,000 square kilometers per year, have come at a staggering human cost, with about 400,000 Russian casualties over the past year and roughly 31,000 killed each month.

While Trump claimed on Dec. 28 that ""Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,"" speaking alongside Zelensky, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""working with Ukraine"" to open the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Zelensky remains skeptical that Putin genuinely seeks peace.

""I don't trust Russians and... I don't trust Putin and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,” Zelensky added, saying that pressure from the United States remains critical.

""Sanctions, dialogue, he has some instruments,"" he said.

Asked whether Ukraine could win the war without U.S. support, Zelensky answered bluntly.

""No, because we can't,"" he said. ""Without American support, we can't defend the sky.""

He said U.S.-supplied air defense systems and ammunition remain essential as Russia continues to launch hundreds of drones and missiles.

Zelensky also discussed security guarantees, saying Ukraine is seeking long-term, legally binding commitments from the U.S., ideally with congressional backing.

""Today we spoke with the president and there is a proposition. The first proposition is a security guarantees for 15 years,"" he said. ""It's good proposition with possibility of continuation."" He added that while the proposed guarantees would not constitute NATO membership, they would be ""NATO like.""

Zelensky acknowledged war fatigue among Ukrainians but said public support remains clear: ""People want this, 87% support peace. At the same time, 85 percent against to withdraw from east, from the Donbas.""

Asked whether peace on acceptable terms is possible, Zelensky said Ukraine has no alternative but to pursue it: ""We have to do (it), we don't have other way. Other way will be the war.""

U.S. President Donald Trump said Dec. 29 that Russian President Vladimir Putin told him Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in northern Russia, an allegation Kyiv has denied.

""I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it.""

""It's a delicate period of time,"" he added. ""This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive, because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that,"" he said.

When asked whether there was any evidence of such an attack, Trump said, ""We'll find out.""

President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Putin's claim as ""another lie,"" warning that Moscow could use the allegation to justify potential strikes, most likely targeting Kyiv.

Putin relayed the allegation during a phone call with Trump, which came after Trump's recent meeting with Zelensky in Florida. Trump described his call with Putin as a ""very good talk.""

Trump's remarks came as Russia has continued near-daily attacks on non-military targets in Ukraine's capital and other cities. In its latest mass attack on Dec. 26-27, Russia launched nearly 500 drones and 40 missiles targeting Kyiv's energy infrastructure, killing two civilians and injuring 32 others.

Ukrainian forces struck a Russian drone storage facility at Donetsk Airport in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian Unmanned Systems Forces commander Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi said on Dec. 30.

Ukrainian forces regularly strike military facilities in Russian-occupied areas that supply weapons, fuel, and equipment to Russian troops.

Russian forces have set up a base at the airport to train and launch Shahed, Geran, and Gerbera drones, according to Brovdi. Satellite images from August 2025 also showed Russia repairing the runway, likely to expand attack drone operations from Russian-occupied territory.

The Ukrainian strike hit a drone logistics hub, warehouses with combat units, drone storage facilities, a preflight training center, and a location housing military and technical personnel, Brovdi said.

Brovdi noted that the operation was planned by fighters from the 414th Separate Brigade, known as ""Madyar's Birds,"" in coordination with the newly created Deep Strike Center, and that Ukraine's 1st Separate Center of the Unmanned Systems Forces carried out the strike. 

Donetsk Airport ceased operations in May 2014 following the beginning of the Russian occupation of parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Ukrainian forces defended the airport for 242 days before withdrawing completely on Jan. 23, 2015, after Russian troops destroyed the control tower and one of the terminals. According to Ukraine's  Ministry of Defense, 97 Ukrainian soldiers were killed during the battles for control of Donetsk Airport.

Since the Russian occupation began, the airport has remained closed to civilian air traffic.

Amber Sandy's 'The Mary' Birchkin Bag is made of birch bark, home-tanned deer hide, dyed porcupine quills, seed beads, cotton lining and artificial sinew.Supplied

From the moment it was introduced, the Hermès Birkin bag has been synonymous with peak luxury. The tony, top-handle accessory, which celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, was conceived of by Jean-Louis Dumas, former head of the French house, after a fabled encounter on a plane with British actor-singer Jane Birkin. 

On the flight, Birkin, a jet-setting working mother, lamented the lack of a bag that could carry all of her essentials. She sketched out an ideal purse on a sick bag for Dumas and he came up with a design that addressed her needs – space for baby bottles included – while possessing the poshest of pedigrees. 

Today, the Birkin is more of a status symbol than a stylish statement of doing-it-all progressiveness. And the lavish lifestyle it signifies has become thematic fodder for several contemporary sculpture artists looking to amplify, examine and even reinterpret what it represents.

During Mayfair Art Weekend in 2020, London-based sculptor, painter and installation artist Kalliopi Lemos debuted the monumental work, Bag of Aspirations, as part of her sculpture series Tools of Endearment. The outsized steel recreation of Hermès's coveted carry all, weighing a whopping 380 kilograms, was exhibited on Bond Street – a destination itself synonymous with luxury goods. 

The artist, in an interview with Women's Wear Daily, described the piece as a reflection on “how society deals with femininity, women's rights and the condition of women within society.”

Where Lemos's piece navigated the intersection of politics and design, Yonkers, N.Y.-based sculptor Barbara Segal takes a historical route with her interpretation of Hermès's hallowed pieces.

Segal crafts Birkins (along with other luxury fashion bags from Chanel and Louis Vuitton) out of opulent marble. They're the kinds of pieces Paris Hilton would buy if she was a Borghese. In a recent Instagram post about a new Birkin-inspired work, Palazzo Ducale, Segal wrote that the piece was carved “from the same Verona marble and Ischia limestone that adorn the Doge's Palace in Venice, this piece features a brass quatrefoil detail. It's a beautiful fusion of Venetian heritage and contemporary luxury symbolism.”

Amber Sandy, an Anishinaabe artist, synthesized the above themes with her clever wearable sculpture, The Mary. The piece, completed last year and presented at the Vancouver-based gallery Ceremonial / Art's booth at Art Toronto in October, is a take on the Birkin and composed of birch bark, home-tanned deer hide, dyed porcupine quills, seed beads, cotton lining and artificial sinew. The sculpture is priced at $25,000 – not too far off from what a Birkin bag sells for.

Sandy, a member of the Neyaashiinigmiing, Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation, told me that The Mary is a play on how Hermès and other luxury brands tout savoir faire – the vaunted techniques behind their bag production and the mythical quality of the materials used to make them.

“I've spent years developing strong relationships with [my] community to be able to learn these traditional skills,” Sandy said, adding that intergenerational skills including tanning, beading and working with wood have been imperilled by colonization, specifically the residential school system. “I feel an immense sense of pride in being able to carry on and hold and share this knowledge with people.”

The concept for her “Birchkin bag” materialized because of her love of “awful” reality television. Watching shows such as Real Housewives, she saw “these people with all of this money, doing things that are just projections of wealth.” 

The Mary wearable sculpture is priced at $25,000.Supplied

She thought about what made her feel “extremely wealthy” and concluded it was her access to the ancestrally respected materials and skills she employs in her artistic practice. 

To source the birch bark used in The Mary – so named after a beloved community member – Sandy used her long-forged connections, infusing her craft with the same connotations of dedication and attention as any so-called couture piece. 

“It's not as simple as going out and harvesting bark off of a tree by peeling it off. It's about knowing where to go at exactly what time of year, how to ask for it before taking it and putting the time into your practice of developing relationships,” she said. 

“When we want to learn something, we don't just call someone up and say, I want to learn this thing for myself. We find somebody with the knowledge and we dedicate our time to helping them do their work so that we can learn through a reciprocal relationship. I think that's a beautiful way that we do things as Anishinaabe people.” 

The Birch tree, Sandy said, has particular significance because its bark is traditionally used in her community to make carry-all items: baskets, baby holders, even the original canoes they used to travel in. Her own art practice involves making pieces that are wearable, including earrings and, of course, bags.

“When I'm creating, I want it to be something that's usable. Birch bags are meant to be used, and they get better with age.” Here, there is another parallel with the Birkin bag and the patina it's said to develop over time as its leather softens.

“The Mary exemplifies everything that I love about Indigenous contemporary art: continuance, resilience, humour and creativity,” said Jake Kimble, the gallery director and curator at Ceremonial / Art. “Amber not only brings the past to the present but also the future.” 

But what is it about the Birkin, I ask Kimble, that makes it such a compelling subject for artists? 

“I think for quite some time Hermès has held tight onto the cultural significance and status symbol of what a Birkin is and what it means,” he said. 

“It has for so long enforced archaic class systems that I think, how could you not critique, challenge or make fun of these systems as an artist? What Amber does so successfully with The Mary is really put Hermès on its head – you can make the same style of bag but you can make it with community, care, knowledge and sustainability.” 

And what of the original Birkin bag? The prototype was purchased at a Sotheby's auction in Paris this past July for US$10.1-million. A result, some would argue, befitting any bona fide work of art.

Germany's perennial debate over safety has flared up once again as fireworks sales resume ahead of New Year. Meanwhile, a spate of black ice has caused numerous accidents across the country. Follow our updates.

Below is a roundup of the main headlines from Germany during the Christmas and New Year week:

We'll be back with the latest news once again on December 30. 

The chairman of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) has defended plans to invite politicians from the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) to the 2026 event, after excluding them for the last two years. 

""As large a spectrum of opinions as possible, including contrary ones, should be made clear. That is the very DNA of the Security Conference,"" returning chairman Wolfgang Ischinger told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, in comments that will be printed in full on Tuesday. 

Ischinger is a veteran diplomat and former ambassador to the US.

He was understood to disagree with the more restrictive policies of the man who succeeded him, Angela Merkel's longstanding foreign and security policy adviser Christoph Heusgen.

Heusgen had not invited representatives from either of Germany's populist parties that are most critical of Ukraine, the AfD and the left-wing BSW, citing concerns among other things about a walkout or boycott of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's appearance.

The AfD's absence was criticized explicitly by US Vice President JD Vance in his speech at the event in 2025.

Ischinger argued that it was not for the MSC to preserve the so-called ""firewall"" excluding the AfD from governance in Germany, a term describing the other major German parties' refusal to form coalitions or confidence and supply agreements with the party. 

""We are not tearing down any firewalls, as some assert, by inviting AfD politicians,"" Ischinger said. ""The firewall is supposed to keep the AfD away from participation in government. It is up to the political parties to ensure that the AfD no longer sits in the Bundestag [lower house of parliament].""

Polls vary but the AfD is currently at least the second-strongest party in the country, and is vying with the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) for the top spot in some surveys, albeit only on around one-quarter of public support. 

The 2026 MSC runs from February 13-15. 

The Berliner Stadmission protestant charity has praised the response after two of its three ""cold buses"" providing winter assistance to the homeless in the German capital were put out of action by a fire, with arson suspected. 

""We are overwhelmed by the people's solidarity,"" spokeswoman Barbara Breuer told Germany's DPA news agency, a day after the news of the fire first broke in the city. ""Other organizations and businesses from Berlin have offered their assistance.""

Breuer said initial donations had already come in, though she could not yet provide a precise tally. 

""The cold bus trips are assured again, and we are utterly grateful,"" she said.

The Berliner Stadtmission provides various assistance from more than 70 sites in and around the Berlin diocese, particularly to those in more extreme need or poverty.   

One of the minibuses was found totally burned out on Sunday, with another one parked next to it sustaining minor damage that will put it out of service temporarily. 

Police said they had launched an investigation on suspicion of arson. 

Volunteers use the vehicles on cold winter nights to tour the city, providing hot food and drinks and other assistance like sleeping bags and blankets, as well as transporting some of them to shelters for the night. 

Berlin is typically one of the colder cities in northern Germany, and freezing temperatures are currently forecast overnight on Monday and Tuesday, with the possibility of snow in the early hours of Wednesday.

City authorities estimate that just over 53,000 people were in homeless accommodation or other shelters in Berlin as of the start of 2025. The less reliable estimates for the number of people sleeping on the streets have not yet been published. But in 2024, that figure stood at just over 6,000.

Police in northern Germany are investigating vandalism of a local AfD office in the town of Wismar, after damage was reported on Monday, the first working weekday after the Christmas period. 

""The incident took place during the course of the Christmas holidays, between December 23 at around 2 p.m. and December 29 and 11 a.m.,"" the police precinct in nearby Rostock, which is the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania's most populous city, said in a statement. 

Two windows had been smashed by as yet unidentified suspects, causing damages worth in the region of €2,000 (roughly $2,350), according to police. 

Officers had gathered evidence that was being examined, with investigations ongoing, police said. 

Rostock police have reported thieves targeting fireworks deliveries to supermarkets in the run-up to New Year in three locations innorthern Germany. 

Police said in a statement on Monday that ""as yet unknown perpetrators"" had ""forcibly secured access to a total of three freight containers"" — in Sievershagen on the outskirts of Rostock, in Kritzow to the west of Rostock, and in Lübz to the south. 

The fireworks were being stored in containers ready for distribution to local supermarkets for the annual New Year's exemption on sales restrictions, police said. 

Citing preliminary investigations, police said they believed the materials had been stolen during the Christmas bank holiday period. 

They said that details on the costs in terms of stolen materials and damaged property were not yet ready, but cited the affected company in Lübz as saying that the fireworks stolen at that location had been worth at least €12,000 (roughly $14,150) by themselves.

Police appealed for potential witnesses at any of the three locations to come forward.

Police have seized 330 kilograms (about 730 pounds) of fireworks from a man's cellar on Berlin's Landsberger Allee after he bragged about the stash at a Christmas party.

According to a Facebook post by police, the man told guests he kept large quantities of fireworks in his basement and occasionally sold some of them.

Germany's top criminal police official has warned that a possible role in state government for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could jeopardize the flow of sensitive information between police agencies.

Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) President Holger Münch told the newspaper Tagesspiegel that if the party entered government, it could gain access to protected data, with consequences for cooperation between federal and state criminal police offices.

Münch said the issue was not about drastic steps such as deleting files. ""But we have to think about how openly we could then share information within the network,"" he said, raising questions about risks and how authorities would deal with them.

His comments come as five state elections are due in Germany in 2026, including in the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the AfD is polling close to 40%. It is not ruled out that the party could produce its first state premier by the end of next year.

In the same interview, Münch warned that Germany's role as a strong supporter of Ukraine has put it increasingly in the focus of Russian intelligence efforts aimed at weakening democracy. Münch said the number of investigations involving Russian actors at the federal prosecutor's office has risen sharply.

Germany has approved far fewer arms exports this year after two consecutive record highs, government data show.

Between January 1 and December 8, 2025, export licenses for weapons and other military equipment totaled €8.40 billion ($9.88 billion), according to a response from the Economy Ministry to a parliamentary query from the socialist Left Party.

That's a big drop compared with €13.33 billion in 2024 and €12.15 billion in 2023.

The sharpest fall has been in approvals for Ukraine. Licenses for exports to Kyiv amounted to €1.14 billion this year, down from €8.15 billion in 2024. However, the Economy Ministry said the decline does not signal a pullback in support.

A spokesperson said some aid is still being delivered under licenses granted earlier, while other funds are tied up in long-term projects that will only show up later in export approvals. Not all military assistance requires export licenses, and Ukraine is also investing more in domestic arms production, the ministry said.

Of the total, €5.39 billion in export approvals fall under the current government's tenure. Norway ranks first among recipient countries with €1.31 billion, likely driven by large orders for tanks and submarines. Turkey follows with €726 million, ahead of Ukraine at €483 million.

Medical representatives, police officers, the German Children's Fund, environmental and animal welfare groups, and other organizations are calling for a general ban on the use of pyrotechnics.

Among others, the president of the German Medical Association, Klaus Reinhardt, has pointed to the serious injuries many people suffer every year from exploding fireworks and to overcrowded hospital emergency departments. However, the interior ministers of the federal and state governments have recently failed to agree on a ban on private pyrotechnics.

Germany's GdP police union warned of having too few emergency personnel on New Year's Eve and called for more firework bans and protected zones in cities. Emergency services fear that officers on duty could once again be attacked with fireworks. ""Increasingly, people are becoming reckless and are misusing legal items such as firecrackers or rockets,"" GdP chairman Jochen Kopelke told the DPA news agency.

Reckless use of fireworks cost five men their lives in Germany on last New Year's Evealone. Numerous people suffered, in some cases, severe injuries. Particularly devastating effects were caused by homemade explosive devices and illegal spherical fireworks.

Animal welfare groups warn of the negative effects on animals. Cats and dogs are put under stress, wild animals are startled and use up valuable energy that they need to survive the winter.

Environmental groups, in turn, criticize the littering of the environment and the waste of resources.

Germany's largest listed companies are still feeling the strain of the weak economy, with profits falling sharply despite slightly higher revenues.

An analysis by consultancy EY (Ernst & Young) shows that operating profit at the 100 highest-revenue companies dropped 15% year on year to €102 billion (about $120 billion) in the first nine months.

More than half of the companies earned less than a year earlier, marking the third consecutive decline in profits.
EY said the negative trend has become entrenched, even as turnover offered a rare glimmer of relief.

EY partner Jan Brorhilker said 2025 had been ""another crisis year"" for Germany's economy.

Weak growth, geopolitical tensions, US trade policy, and rising competition from Chinese firms were weighing on investment decisions, he said, hitting export-oriented industrial groups particularly hard.

The difficult environment is also showing up in employment figures. Between January and September, the combined workforces of the top 100 shrank by about 17,500 jobs, a decline of 0.4% to roughly 4.24 million employees worldwide.

The sale of rockets and firecrackers for the New Year period has begun again — for a limited time only.

Pyrotechnics for New Year's Eve may be sold for a few days only at the end of December, with sales this year beginning from the moment shops opened on Monday. Online retailers are allowed to deliver pre-ordered fireworks to customers' homes during the last three working days of the year.

The sales are not universally popular, with an unusual coalition of medical experts, police officers, environmental and animal rights activists calling for a general ban. After a New Year's Eve marked by deaths and injuries last time around, 270,000 Germans signed an online petition calling for a nationwide ban on private fireworks.

Despite this, the Association of the Pyrotechnics Industry (VPI) expects 10 to 15% more goods to be available in stores compared with last year. In 2024, the industry reported sales of €197 million (up from €180 million in 2023) and hopes to increase this figure slightly.

The firecracker industry has said it sees growing demand for ""visually impressive display fireworks, especially compound fireworks and firework batteries."" These products now account for more than 50% of total industry revenue.

Welcome back to our coverage.

It's been a quiet few days as the ""turn of the year"" (or ""jahreswechsel"" in German) usually is. 

We'll continue to bring you the latest news from Germany in this blog as they happen.

Black ice created hazardous road conditions across Germany overnight, leading to numerous traffic accidents.

By early Sunday, police in the eastern state of Saxony had recorded 32 accidents, with further incidents reported nationwide.

The icy conditions also strained medical facilities. In Berlin, hospital emergency departments were overcapacity due to an increase in patients with fractures caused by icy conditions, according to newspaper Tagesspiegel.

The German Weather Service said slippery conditions were expected to continue until mid-morning, with freezing drizzle possible in central regions, before warmer temperatures melted the ice.

Several serious crashes were reported in Saxony and Hesse, including vehicle rollovers and collisions caused by loss of control on icy roads. Police also reported many accidents on Friday night and Saturday, particularly in northern Germany.

Welcome back to our coverage of all things Germany.

Bonn is wrapped in mist this Sunday morning, and as tradition goes, it's a ""ruhetag"", a day for slowing down and taking it easy.

Peace talks to end the war in Ukraine were dealt a setback after Russia claimed that Ukrainian forces launched a drone strike on one of Vladimir Putin's residences. Follow DW for the latest.

Below is a roundup of the top headlines and analyses on Russia's war in Ukraine on Tuesday, December 30:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that he will meet with leaders of allies in the Coalition of the Willing in France on January 6.

According to Zelenskyy's post on X, the summit will be preceded by a meeting of security advisors from allied countries on January 3 in Ukraine.

""I am grateful to President Trump's team for their readiness to participate in all effective formats,"" the Ukrainian president added.

Russia launched drones to attack port infrastructure and civilian ships in Ukraine's southwestern Odesa region, military and officials said.

According to the Ukrainian navy, two Panama-flagged civilian vessels, Emmakris III and Captain Karam, were attacked by Russian drones as they entered a Ukrainian Black Sea port to load wheat.

Russian troops also struck the Black Sea ports of Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk, hitting oil storage tanks in the process, said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba.

Despite the attacks, both ports continued to operate, he added.

Over the past several months, maritime warfare between Ukraine and Russia has escalated. Both countries have attacked naval and commercial assets in the Black Sea and beyond.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the most recent developments in the negotiations on ending the war between Ukraine and Russia ""give grounds for hope.""

""Peace is on the horizon, there is no doubt that things have happened that give grounds for hope that this war can end, and, quite quickly,"" he said at a government meeting, adding this is still ""hope, far from 100% certain.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, too, spoke about the current state in the negotiations, saying all sides of the negotiations need ""transparency"" - including Moscow.

Merz spoke after a conversation with European and Canadian leaders. 

""Now we need transparency and honesty from everyone, including Russia,"" Merz posted on his X account.

Ukraine ordered the evacuation of 14 villages in the Chernigiv region in the country's north, close to the border with Russian ally Belarus.

The region has been frequently targeted by Russian bombings.

""The border area is under daily shelling. Despite the real threat, 300 people still live there,"" regional leader Viacheslav Chaus said.

The Kremlin said it would not provide any evidence for an alleged Ukrainian drone attack on President Vladimir Putin's residence.

""I don't think there should be any evidence if such a massive drone attack is being carried out,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding Moscow would ""toughen"" its stance in the negotiations on ending the war due to the alleged attack.

Ukraine denies the attack, saying Russia failed to provide ""plausible evidence"" the attack took place.

Ukraine says Russia's accusations of a drone attack on President Vladimit Putin's residence included ""no plausible evidence.""

""Almost a ​day ​passed, and Russia still hasn't provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine's ‍alleged 'attack on Putin's residence'. And ​they won't. Because there's none. No such ⁠attack ​happened,"" Andrii Sybiha said ‌in ‌a post on X. 

Kyiv has dismissed Russia's allegation ​as baseless and designed ‌to ‌undermine peace negotiations.

Polish Prime MinisterDonald Tusk will hold a conversation with other European leaders over the situation in Ukraine, a Polish government spokesperson said.

This comes as Russia accused Ukraine of trying to carry out an attack on President Vladimir Putin, with Kyiv rejecting Moscow's accusations and said their intention is sabotaging the peace talks.

Russia's Oreshnik missile system, which has nuclear capabilites, has entered active service, the country's Defense Ministry said, without adding how many missiles had been deployed or any other information.

The system has been deployed in Belarus, where soldiers held a ceremony for the occasion. According to Russia's missile forces chief, Oreshnik missiles have a range that allows it to reach all of Europe.

This comes as the negotiations over ending the country's war in Ukraine continue, without a breakthrough so far, despite US President Donald Trump saying the two countries were ""close than ever before"" to ending the war.

DW's correspondent based in Washington, DC, Misha Komadovsky, posted to X a response to a question about whether US intelligence detected the alleged strike on Vladimir Putin's residence.

""Maybe the attack didn't take place, that's possible,"" said Trump.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Fox News that Ukraine cannot win the war without US support.

""Can we win without American ‌support? No,"" Zelenskyy said.

""I don't trust Putin and he doesn't want success ‍for Ukraine,"" he added.

Earlier on Monday, the Ukrainian president said that two main issues in a 20-point peace ⁠proposal remained to be resolved: control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which is ​in Russian hands, and the fate of the Donbas area.

Welcome to our coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine.

On Monday, Russia said it would review its stance in peace talks following what Moscow described as a Ukrainian drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences. 

Moscow has not put forward evidence to back up its claim.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphatically denied the claims, calling it ""a complete fabrication"" and accusing Russia of preparing the ground to strike government buildings in Kyiv.

US President Donald Trump said he was ""very angry"" about the news, saying, ""I don't like it. It's not good.""

Plus, underlining Russia's intention of standing firm on its territorial ambitions, Putin said his generals should push on with efforts to secure all of Zaporizhzhia region, of which Moscow already controls around 75%.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia — once praised for restoring democracy and empowering millions of women — has died at the age of 80.

Khaleda Zia, who served as prime minister of Bangladesh for three terms, died on Tuesday morning at the age of 80.

Zia and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) were once hailed for playing a crucial role in transitioning the South Asian nation from military rule to democracy.

She served as prime minister between 1991 and 1996, and again from 2001 to 2006, becoming the first woman to serve as prime minister of Bangladesh.

Zia had been sentenced to several years behind bars prior her death for alleged involvement in corruption charges that her party said were politically motivated.

Zia entered politics after her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in May 1981 during a military coup. Rahman had fought for Bangladesh's independence war from Pakistan in 1971, and formed the BNP a few years prior his assassination.

Zia, who was a housewife at the time with no experience in politics, soon became one of the country's top leaders for her civilian political resistance against the then military regime. She established a solid political alliance by joining political parties from both the left and the right with her center-right party, and successfully forced the military regime to give up power by leading nationwide movements for democracy.

On February 27,1991, Zia's party won 140 of the 300 directly-elected seats during the national election, making her the country's new prime minister.

During her time in office, Zia helped increase literacy rates among girls and boosted job opportunities for women by providing free education and scholarships. She introduced daily free meals for students at schools across the country with help from foreign donors. Those efforts saw millions of girls enrolled in primary and secondary schools. 

Zia also contributed to expanding the country's export-oriented garment industry. Barbara Crossette, in a profile of Zia in The New York Times in October 1993, wrote that ""in contrast with Benazir Bhutto when she first became prime minister of Pakistan [Zia] is aggressively promoting education and vocational training, especially of girls, and expanding small-scale, no-collateral lending to increase the self-sufficiency of women."" In 2005, Forbes magazine included Zia in its list of the world's 100 most powerful women during her last term in office.

Laila Noor Islam, a professor at the University of Dhaka, told DW Zia will be remembered for changing the social and political landscape of Bangladesh.

""People will remember her for introducing the parliamentary system of democracy in her country, for creating export-oriented ready-made garment factories where hundreds of thousands of women got jobs, for introducing free primary education for all, and developing the caretaker government system for conducting free and fair national elections,"" said Islam.

Soon after entering politics, Zia became the archrival of Sheikh Hasina, the top leader of the center-left Awami League (AL) party who was in power from 2008 until her ouster in 2024.

They were often called ""the Battling Begums"" — ""begum"" refers to a Muslim woman of high rank — for their long-standing rivalry, which split the country's political arena into two, one led by Hasina's AL, the other by Zia's BNP.

""When I hear the name Khaleda Zia, what comes to mind is 'Hasina's rival,'"" Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told DW before her death. ""Zia and Hasina have had such a long and bitter rivalry, and it's been amplified by the fact that they've dominated Bangladeshi politics for so long.""

""And given that their respective families comprise the country's two political dynasties, the rivalry also is embedded in the core political history of Bangladesh,"" he added.

Zia was convicted in a graft case in February 2018 and later in a separate corruption case. She was accused of misusing her power by embezzling some $250,000 (€240,000) in donations meant for an orphanage trust.

The BNP maintained the cases were fabricated to keep Zia out of politics, allegations denied by Hasina's government.

Over the past decade, more than 180,000 legal cases have also been filed against nearly 4 million BNP members, according to the party's count. The data shows that more than 600 party members have been abducted, and around 3,000 were victims of extrajudicial killings at the hands of authorities during the same period.

In 2020, Zia's prison sentence was converted to house arrest before she was released again in 2024 after the fall of Hasina's government.

Zia, an advocate of democracy, slowly lost her ground by failing to form solid political resistance against the Hasina government.

""Khaleda Zia has made a lot of mistakes in the last decade,"" said Kugelman. ""Boycotting elections led to missed opportunities. More importantly, she opted to play the role of a disruptive and confrontational opposition without seeking a middle ground, and this led to a lot of burned bridges.

""It also led to her party resorting to violence at times, which didn't help its cause. Additionally, her decision to align herself with Islamist political parties [at times], especially those with hard-line elements, cost her and her party support from those that uphold the idea of a secular and moderate Bangladesh,"" he added.

Asif Nazrul, a law professor at the University of Dhaka, believes Zia's downfall should also be attributed to her unwillingness to gain the confidence of India and foreign diplomats who could have pushed Hasina to conduct a fair and inclusive national election.

""Zia's decision not to meet Indian President Pranab Mukherjee in Dhaka in 2013, and refusing the offer of Sheikh Hasina regarding election-time government in the same year, heavily cost her political career,"" Nazrul told DW. 

""She failed to win the heart of Dhaka-based elite intellectuals and Western diplomats,"" he added. ""Her failure to stop the people in BNP and its allies in harboring separatists fighting the Indian government in the past also made her weaker over time.""

But Zia's fight for democracy will be remembered for years to come, said Nazrul.

""Zia could have flown to other countries during political uncertainties in 2006 and 2007, and during her trial in the last years,"" Nazrul said. ""She was aged and very ill, and despite knowing the likelihood of her suffering, she did not bow to the Hasina government and take any chance of leaving the country.""","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

It was all smiles at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, when Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump met the press and spoke of a possible peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The security guarantees necessary to end the war were “95 per cent done”, Trump said. Zelensky appeared to agree, at least in public.

It was a false hope.

Trump desperately wants a deal, and he may have convinced himself that Putin will ultimately agree to one. But there is no chance the Russian president will accept anything more than a ceasefire masquerading as a peace deal. Actually, Putin is unlikely to agree even to that.

Some of Putin's obstinacy is ideological. He has always considered Ukraine part of Russia, not an independent, sovereign nation. The whole of Ukraine was part of the USSR and acquiring its territory is now integral to Putin's goal of building a “greater Russia”, as well as serving as a protective glacis against Western forces.

But Putin also doesn't seem to think he is losing. True, his army's gains on the ground have been minuscule. But in a war of attrition, he appears to believe that he can outlast the Ukrainians, who are running out of soldiers, and outlast Kyiv's Western backers, especially the Trump administration, who are running out of patience.

Most importantly, Putin will fear that he cannot survive – in power and in life – if he takes a deal offering only modest gains after such a huge sacrifice of Russian men and money. Put differently, the terms minimally acceptable to Putin are flatly unacceptable to Ukraine, which has already paid an enormous price to defend its land against an unprovoked assault and which won't surrender any territory essential to its future defence. Indeed, it may not be willing to surrender any territory that Russia hasn't already conquered.

The territory at issue is especially significant: a series of fortified cities on the western edge of the Donbas. They serve as a military barrier against another Russian invasion. Why does Putin want those fortifications so badly unless he plans future attacks?

Zelensky must know all that, and so will his countrymen. They will figure, rightly, that if Putin does strike a deal with Trump, it won't be a durable, long-term compromise. It will really be a Potemkin treaty, a mere pause in the hostilities as far as the Kremlin is concerned. Putin won't bend his swords into ploughshares. He will be forging new swords and rebuilding his treasury to pay for them.

There are solid reasons for Ukraine's scepticism. Putin has broken every deal he (or his predecessors) entered into.

Since Zelensky must understand these problems, why the smiles in public? Why is he nodding agreeably when president Trump says a deal is on the horizon?

First, because Zelensky learned a painful lesson in the Oval Office last February. A public fracas with Trump – or even a fierce private one – would be a serious tactical mistake. It's far smarter to play nice.

Second, it makes sense to play nice because he wants Trump to pin the blame on Putin when a potential deal collapses, as Ukraine evidently expects. Trump needs to see that Putin, not Zelensky, is the obstacle to peace.

Why is this attribution of blame so important to Ukraine? Because the country is far smaller than its military foe, has already suffered enormous losses, and cannot sustain its war effort without tangible, on-going support from the US and its Nato partners. That means American satellite surveillance and targeting data plus a flood of military equipment, built in America and paid for by the Europeans. That means more American economic sanctions on Russia and its economic lifelines, such as the Chinese firms buying Russian oil. And if the Kremlin does agree to a deal, that means a commitment to provide Western troops and American air support for Ukraine.

Putin will never accept such a commitment from the West – and Zelensky must know it. The Russian president's strategic incompetence has already put Nato on Russia's doorstep in Scandinavia. He certainly doesn't want to compound his humiliation by agreeing to Western troops in Ukraine, even if they come without a Nato Article 5 guarantee (an attack on one member is considered an attack on all). That is why the Russians will, in turn, be seeking every opportunity to pin the blame for the collapse of peace talks on Ukraine, most recently by making a fuss over a supposed Ukrainian drone strike on one of Putin's residences.

The Kremlin doesn't need Washington to side with Russia. It would be happy if Trump concludes that both sides would rather fight than compromise. That would give the US president a reason to wash his hands of an endless war and appease the isolationist wing of his party.

So Zelensky has to make certain – absolutely certain – that Trump and his administration pin the blame on Putin for the failure to strike a compromise deal. Zelensky may be smiling publicly. But that is surely what he is thinking privately.

 A New Era of Statecraft Demands a New Kind of Strategist

 Navin Girishankar

For the greater part of the last decade, the United States and China have been locked in a cold war, fought as fiercely over economic and technology advantages as over military advantages. In Washington, there has been bipartisan support to respond to China's dumping of subsidized goods, its acquisition of dual-use technologies, its rampant intellectual property theft, and its coercive practices. As a result, the last three U.S. administrations have deployed a slate of economic security policies to safeguard U.S. markets, supply chains, and assets, and to rebuild the U.S. industrial base to gain the upper hand on Beijing.

The first Trump administration, for instance, levied tariffs on China to rebalance trade and halt discriminatory policies related to technology transfer, Internet Protocol, and innovation. The Biden administration then dramatically expanded export controls—tools originally designed to prevent weapons proliferation—to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors that are critical to the artificial intelligence race. Upon returning to office in 2025, President Donald Trump has more aggressively used tariffs to reset economic relations with China. All three administrations, meanwhile, embraced industrial policy, with varying approaches to state intervention in markets to promote supply chain resilience: President Joe Biden used subsidies and tax cuts to encourage the reshoring of chip making and Trump has taken government equity stakes in a number of companies in strategic sectors, including chip making and critical minerals.

Despite these dramatic shifts in economic policy, however, Washington has struggled to achieve its stated economic security objectives. Trump's current tariff strategy has extracted investment commitments from allies, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, but it has also produced widespread economic uncertainty, Chinese retaliation against U.S. industries, and a long list of trading partners looking to hedge their bets. Neither did his first-term tariffs reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. Biden-era incentives under the CHIPS and Science Act did expand domestic chip making in several states, and export controls appeared to temporarily preserve the United States' advantage in leading-edge chips. But these measures also fueled China's drive to develop domestic advanced chips and inspired Beijing to deploy its own export controls on rare-earth minerals as a coercive tool against the United States and its allies.

Washington's mixed track record reflects more than simply individual policies gone awry. It reflects a competition between one rival that struggles to play the long game and another that has mastered it. The United States has deployed existing tools to new challenges, often without fully anticipating the consequences. It has yet to demonstrate its ability to systematically connect dots across policy domains, develop economic war games, and devise strategies as part of a comprehensive and effective approach to economic security.

The United States, in other words, has improvised piecemeal policies and hoped for the best, while China has fused strategic vision with institutional coordination and dedicated resources to developing the human capital needed to pull off such an approach. Washington needs to raise its economic security game. To do so, it needs to nurture a new class of economic warriors adept in the new tools of national power, resilience, and global influence.

Beijing is prepared. China has matched U.S. tariffs and export controls move for move. It has weaponized its dominance on rare earths processing, exploited U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities, and poured immense resources into dominating strategic sectors, including shipbuilding. China's fingerprints are on offensive cyber campaigns such as Salt Typhoon, which mapped Western telecommunications networks, and Volt Typhoon, which pre-positioned malware in U.S. critical infrastructure. Beijing also outspends the United States and allies in industrial subsidies and basic research in emerging fields, and it bundles infrastructure finance and technology transfer with guaranteed market access as part of an attractive offer to the global South—as the United States begins to withdraw.

What many in Washington often overlook is that China's competitive success is a function not simply of party diktats but of the resourcefulness of its trained personnel, as well. China's 2023–2027 National Cadre Training Plan calls for officials to master global economics, supply chain resilience, dual-use technology, and financial risk via mandatory training programs using online self-study and in-person “collective training” sessions. At the Central Party School, cadres study international political economy, the Belt and Road Initiative, and China's framework for assessing national strength. Elite universities extend the pipeline: the Seven Sons of National Defense, a grouping of public universities affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, trains technologists for strategic industries. Tsinghua University and Wuhan University offer research, advisory, and training activities related to BRI. The China University of Labor Relations trains foreign trade union leaders on Chinese economic and labor theory and practice to build solidarity among BRI partners.

This institutional architecture embodies what Dan Wang, currently a research fellow at the Hoover History Lab at Stanford, has called China's “engineering state”—a system that channels technical talent toward national economic objectives, forming an ecosystem designed to produce officials who can “win wars without fighting” by mastering markets, logistics, and technology. Chinese decision-makers have long understood that winning the geoeconomic long game requires cultivating a pipeline of top talent with breadth and depth across technology, economics, and investment.

Building economic security capabilities for a complex market economy is more challenging than Beijing's task. When U.S. efforts have combined technology and markets expertise, actionable economic intelligence, and the right policies, they have been successful. In 2019, for example, the first Trump administration successfully pressed the Dutch government to block the chip equipment maker ASML from selling advanced chip-making equipment to China. But as the chips race accelerated, applications of the same tools produced uneven outcomes. Biden administration officials, for instance, did not fully anticipate that Nvidia could (and would) engineer a workaround when it announced semiconductor controls in 2022; within months, the company had rolled out export-compliant chips that it continued to sell to China.

Building and retaining economic security capacity is a challenge for the U.S. government in part because of civil service rules and difficulties attracting top private-sector talent with relevant skills. To implement the manufacturing components of the CHIPS and Science Act, the Biden administration had to work around civil service pay rules in order to rapidly recruit technologists and investors into the Commerce Department. The second Trump administration tried to improve some of these operational inefficiencies in federal agencies with its so-called Department of Government Efficiency, but it ultimately undermined its own goals with a chaotic launch.

Neither bespoke nor sweeping reform efforts have yielded a coherent economic security apparatus or, as H. R. McMaster and Andrew Grotto have pointed out, a professional corps with a distinct identity. This basic insight is not lost on U.S. decision-makers. Government job postings advertise open positions that would form the backbone of an economic security corps: export-control officers, technologists, and investment officers across the bureaus of the Commerce Department, sanctions analysts and economists at the Department of the Treasury, and scientists at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. But without the right mix of skills, institutional setup, and esprit de corps among economic security professionals, business-as-usual recruitment will not meet the moment.

Washington urgently needs to build competencies in these areas, but the talent pipeline from universities and the private sector is weak. At the undergraduate and graduate levels annually, U.S. universities award about 6,000 degrees in public policy, more than 250,000 in engineering, and 550,000 in business with about three percent year-on-year growth over the past decade. U.S. degree programs that explicitly combine economics, technology, and national security are few and far between. Without intervention, the United States is doomed to repeat its mistakes: leaky export controls, evaded sanctions, and industrial policies that miss their mark. Building an economic warrior class should be a national priority among government, business, universities, think tanks, and philanthropies. The challenge is not unprecedented; the United States government has mobilized expertise to meet national challenges before. The question is whether Washington will provide direction, mobilize support, and marshal resources to do so again.

Washington need not model this effort on Beijing's. In fact, it should take some solace in the advantages that the United States' decentralized knowledge ecosystem affords: its ability to adapt quickly, encourage debate, and weed out bad ideas. When faced with major national challenges, the U.S. government and independent research institutions have reinvented policy research and training time and time again. During the New Deal, the Social Security Administration established training programs for administrators managing a novel national social insurance system. After World War II, the RAND Corporation pioneered systems analysis for complex defense problems, methods that Defense Secretary Robert McNamara introduced to the Pentagon. By 1970, universities were offering graduate programs training policy analysts in these approaches.

Universities have also incubated creative approaches to policy challenges, particularly in response to moments of crisis. After the Cuban missile crisis, the political scientist Graham Allison developed the decision sciences, which are now taught at policy schools. Similarly, the oil shocks of the 1970s spurred the development of energy economics expertise; the post-Soviet transition created demand for market reform specialists; the 2008 financial crisis elevated systemic-risk analysis; and most recently, COVID-19 highlighted the need to study supply chain resilience.

China's top-down system may appear more efficient, but America's distributed innovation has proved more adaptable—as long as leaders set clear priorities and mobilize resources. At its best, the U.S. ecosystem benefits from the relationships between the public and the private sectors. Government funding, foundation support, and market demand create conditions for universities to respond and redesign curricula. Federal agencies signal workforce needs, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency partnerships train scientists, and grants from the National Institutes of Health develop the research workforce.

There are, to be sure, early signs that this is happening already with economic security. The graduate school at Johns Hopkins University, for instance, offers a concentration in economic security. And Georgetown, Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and Yale offer courses linking technology, energy, and statecraft. George Mason University offers an M.B.A. in national security, Purdue offers a certificate in Innovation for Public Service, and Carnegie Mellon offers advanced degrees in engineering and public policy. The National Defense University provides training on economic security topics including political economy for security practitioners and modern economic warfare. And among U.S. allies and partners, Korea University, Yonsei University, the University of Tokyo, and Sciences Po offer graduate-level courses in energy security and economic statecraft.

But much more must be done. Business and engineering schools that teach familiar frameworks—cost-benefit analysis, systems modeling, scenario planning, finance, microeconomics, and national security—should encourage students to apply those frameworks to pressing practical questions; for example, how tariffs affect strategic supply chains or how export controls affect innovation. Philanthropic organizations and corporations should also step up and fund economic security scholarships with the same urgency that they have at times devoted to climate change and public health. Think tanks can convene researchers across allied countries to share insights on economic security topics including modern industrial policy, technology protection, and national security investing. These platforms can advance allied coordination without the need for new multilateral structures.



Government must also lead here. Trump should issue an executive order establishing a professional corps of economic statesmen. It would include the creation of a standing Economic Security Committee, modeled after the Deputies' Committee within the National Security Council, to direct strategic economic security priorities and coordinate across the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, Energy, and Defense and the intelligence community. The Economic Security Committee, working with the Office of Personnel Management, should define economic security competencies, tag federal jobs accordingly, and prioritize filling those vacancies, sending clear signals to the labor market about the government's needs. The executive order should also direct departments to partner with universities on curriculum development, offer faculty sabbaticals in government, and create rotational programs with industry.

Of course, executive action without legislative backing (and dedicated resources) will not work. Congress should establish an Economic Security Brain Trust Foundation, modeled on the Department of Energy Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation (FESI) authorized by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, to more effectively leverage private resources. It should also direct the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy to designate economic security as a research priority, making grants available to create incentives for universities. A pipeline of approximately 1,000 new graduate students per year would respond to demand for economic security talent in government and the private sector. At an annual cost of roughly $180 million, congressional appropriations and private matching funds could help mature economic security as a field of study by supporting graduate fellowships, endowed chairs, paid internships, and applied research in areas such as supply chain resilience, investment screening, sanctions, industrial policy, and economic intelligence.

To be sure, building government capacity faces political headwinds in an administration seemingly hostile to expanding government or funding research. But the Trump administration has demonstrated an appetite for ambitious economic security initiatives, typically by leveraging private sector resources to meet public ends. For instance, the administration's recently announced Genesis Mission aims to double U.S. scientific productivity within a decade by mobilizing scientists and federal scientific data across the Department of Energy's 17 national laboratories, alongside industry and university partners, to meet grand scientific challenges, including in AI and quantum computing. The administration has downsized the federal workforce and dismantled several federal technology units, but it has also floated plans for a U.S. Tech Force of 1,000 early-career technologists, who would serve two-year stints in government through partnerships with 25 tech companies. In some areas, the administration has even expanded funding. The Department of War's Office of Strategic Capital has grown from a $984 million pilot in the Biden administration into a $200 billion lending powerhouse.

Economic security is here to stay. The United States must prepare to win an economic contest worth trillions of dollars. China has prepared itself with cadres and systems to follow through on its economic warfare strategy; the United States has not. Just as the Cold War was won by strategists who mastered deterrence, today's economic competition will be won by professionals who can leverage interdependence in service of national strength and resilience. It's time to train them to wield economic power as skillfully as their predecessors wielded military power.

 How Four Years of War Have Remade Society

 Nina Khrushcheva

After February 2022, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his so-called special military operation—a full-scale invasion of Ukraine—the popularity of George Orwell's 1984, a dystopian novel about a totalitarian regime built on mass surveillance and constant propaganda, soared in Russia. As Christmas approached that year, one St. Petersburg bookstore tied together copies of 1984 as a garland above the cash register. Another set up an entrance display of patriotic books—along with a mug depicting Orwell's face and a caption referring to the novel's shadowy, supposedly omnipotent leader. “Let Big Brother think that there is tea in this mug,” it read.

The trendy Moscow bookshop Respublika placed Orwell's works all over the store. In a quiet protest against the Kremlin's demands to reject all cultural products from “unfriendly countries”—including France, the United Kingdom, and the United States—Respublika continued to sell Ed Sheeran's new album and the Rolling Stones' old vinyl. Its bestsellers included American and British authors, along with Russians who had fled the country, such as Boris Akunin and Dmitry Bykov. But in the years since the war began, Akunin and Bykov have been accused of “extremism,” their works added to an official list of 5,000 banned titles. Respublika took those books off the shelves and relocated the not-yet-forbidden Orwell to the second floor, in case a government inspector checked in.

Restrictions of all kinds have expanded over the past four years—not just book bans but reduced access to social media, crackdowns on protest, and measures to render the LGBT community invisible and feminism illegitimate. Russia's “foreign agent” law, established in 2012 to identify individuals and organizations that received international funding, has become a tool to criminally prosecute and ban from public life anyone who disagrees with the state. In early 2022, 300 people and organizations were on the notorious list of foreign agents; now, the number is over 1,100. But even as the screws have tightened, Russians haven't stopped reading. One bookstore chain reported that 1984 was its most stolen book in 2023. In the first half of 2025, according to the same bookstore, it was surpassed only by theft of copies of the Russian constitution, which forbids censorship and guarantees freedom of thought, the right to speak, and access to information. “We read Orwell for his reflection of reality, and the constitution as a beautiful utopia,” Russians grimly joke.

To visit Russia over the past four years has been to observe the consolidation of a dictatorship in real time—to answer the question readers confront in 1984, wondering how Big Brother's gaze became so penetrating and relentless. At the start of the invasion, the state lacked the means to quell all possible opposition, and so it suppressed selectively. People self-censored, even as many found ways to express their distaste for Russia's path. But in the time since, Moscow has built a larger repressive apparatus. It has cultivated a climate of fear and uncertainty that encouraged many Russians to silence not just themselves but also one another. The accumulation of subtle changes on the part of both the state and society has led Russia deeper and deeper into tyranny—a cycle that seems unlikely to break as long as Putin's regime pursues the kind of total control that until recently seemed to exist only in Russia's communist past or in Orwell's fiction.

Before February 2022, Russian society was fairly open. Official media was under state control, but independent outlets flourished, the Internet had no restrictions, and people could read or watch what they wanted. When the war broke out, mass protests ensued; people were dumbfounded that Russia would launch an invasion of a neighboring country.

Dissent was immediately met with retaliation. In the first few months, more than 15,000 antiwar protesters, including more than 400 minors, were detained. Russian citizens found themselves under de facto martial law. Access to Meta, Instagram, and Twitter (now X) was criminalized. Foreign news sites offering opposing views, such as the BBC and Radio Free Europe, were blocked. Russia's own independent media outlets, including the radio station Echo Moskvy, Dozhd TV, and the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, were banned within weeks. Sharing anything about the war other than the official Ministry of Defense's narratives was immediately made punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

In the spring of 2022, there were many incidents in which the state responded with full force to mild displays of disobedience. One Muscovite, Konstantin Goldman, was detained for holding a copy of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace at a stone memorializing fallen soldiers from Ukraine during World War II in the Alexander Gardens, near the Kremlin. He was accused of potentially planning to overthrow the Russian government, detained, and fined. In St. Petersburg, a young artist, Aleksandra Skochilenko, was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes against the armed forces because she replaced store price tags with hand-drawn antiwar messages. (She was released in 2024 and flown to Germany as part of an international prisoner exchange.)



These protests failed to move Putin. The president continued his fight on behalf of what he calls Russia's “distinct civilization”—the idea that Russia, although partially located in Europe, must keep its distance from the West. Many writers, journalists, scholars, artists, IT specialists, and other white-collar workers who disagreed with the Kremlin's interpretation saw no point in protesting and fled the country. Most everybody else pretended to fall in line. In December 2021, according to the independent pollster Levada, less than 50 percent of Russians believed the country was going in the right direction. In March 2022, 70 percent tamely reported their support.

Initially, the Kremlin made efforts to pacify the public without resorting to near-total suppression. Putin expected a small, quick, and successful war to keep Kyiv in Moscow's orbit, so he used the term “special military operation” to avoid the word “war.” Any fighting, Russians were assured, would happen elsewhere. The government's system of control was not yet prepared to handle widespread discontent, so it settled on a social contract of sorts: citizens who submitted to the state, even just by tacitly accepting its war, could go on about their daily lives. Soon, everything should return to normal. This created a dual reality: Stalinesque oppression awaits those who step out of line, but those who do not protest can read Orwell and carry on with their lives.

Yet war became an ever-expanding presence in Russians' reality. Shelling has increased, Ukrainian drones fly all the way across the country, oil refineries are attacked, airports are closed, trains are blown up and delayed. In stores, prices are up and choices are down because of sanctions and other international restrictions. Many people have been hiding in bookstores to dissociate, or escaping to museums, where visitors can stay for the whole day and pretend that normality persists. Moscow's GES-2 art center, redesigned in 2021 by Italian architects, makes Russians believe they are still part of the West. This year, GES-2 was able to circumvent the Kremlin's call for patriotic art, installing Pop Art founder Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen's famed sculpture Plantoir—a giant red garden trowel—which the exhibition announcement proudly notes was first displayed at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Such duality is not unusual in Russia, a country that sprawls all the way from Germany to Japan. Even on its coat of arms, the double-headed eagle looks both east and west. People have lived before with Orwell's doublethink, holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously and accepting both as true. The Soviet Union was deemed a “paradise” while people were dying in the gulags. In 1935, amid mass arrests of the perceived enemies of communism, Stalin declared, “Life has become better, comrades, life became more joyous.” In such an environment, people also become well versed in doublespeak—saying one thing and thinking another.

The same contradictions pervade Putin's Russia, yet Russia is not the Soviet Union. It has no ideology to bring the public together. The government continued to placate its citizens with capitalism and Western lifestyles only because the fighting was supposed to be brief. When the conflict turned into a multiyear war, Moscow began demanding that the population make sacrifices. A new 22 percent value-added tax hurts small businesses to fill state coffers. There are tariffs on everything. Even a study by the state media conglomerate RT admits that at least 70 percent of Russians are cutting back on groceries, travel, or dining out.

But few want to make sacrifices without a reason, and so there are attempts at developing an ideology that can provide one. In 2022, Putin signed a decree to “preserve the traditional spiritual-moral values,” essentially rejecting everything related to Western civilization. Russia promotes those “traditional values”—nuclear families, Orthodox religion, gender inequality, opposition to abortion, and so on—and smears social progress as a Western plot against it. In the Soviet Union, too, the lack of personal freedom and dismal quality of life were explained as part of the struggle against the injustices of capitalism and for communist equality. But the Soviets' oppressive ideology had a recognizable origin; it grew out of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, when workers and peasants fought aristocrats and the bourgeoisie for a more equal world. Putin's quest for a traditional, religious civilization, in which girls are encouraged to procreate as early as high school and priests advise women to give up careers to become men's “helpers,” harks back to the preindustrial era. Such outdated mandates make little sense for contemporary Russians who have lived with technological progress, traveled the world, and in recent years excelled in the service economy. The widening gap between the message and reality is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.

Putin wants an unreserved devotion to the war, and patriotic slogans glorifying Russian and Soviet heroism have filled TV screens, giant billboards, online ads, and the Kremlin's own statements. Digital displays all over Russian towns feature camouflaged soldiers defending the motherland, with captions demanding potential fighters to “join ours”—pitting ours, the patriots, against those who are not ours, the unpatriotic. Putin has declared that “unity, support for the army from the people, makes Russia victorious.”



Yet his propaganda has not entirely caught on. Fewer and fewer Russians want the conflict to continue, because the longer it goes, the less it remains in the background and the more it consumes their lives. People are worried about experiencing another shock like the “partial mobilization” in the fall of 2022, which required 300,000 men to join the army. After the announcement, many prospective soldiers fled abroad. That October, 66 percent of Russians told Levada that they feared a total mobilization, and 57 percent wanted to start peace talks (today this number stands at 66 percent). The government, wary of overplaying its hand, instituted a nominally volunteer-based recruitment system instead.

All over Russia, young men have been recruited to go to the front. Their families receive the equivalent of $2,000 to $20,000, or more, depending on the region. In three years, the government spent almost $38 billion, or 1.5 percent of Russia's GDP, on these payments. The defense ministry said the army received almost 500,000 new recruits in 2024, and 450,000 in 2025. Some are coerced; some are criminals who would rather go to war than to prison. In addition to getting paid, they are absolved of their crimes. Thousands die, but thousands more come back. As the years pass, more and more maimed and wounded men are seen on the streets of Russian towns. Passersby treat them with apprehension, as mercenary soldiers of fortune.

Putin has tried to fashion the campaign in Ukraine as a defensive war, putting it on par with World War II, in Russia known as the “Great Patriotic War.” But that effort has failed. Bellicose rhetoric from Kremlin apparatchiks and pundits has not created a national fervor. Rather, the more militarism is pushed on the public, the more actively people resent the message. Last year, I heard two teenagers mocking a recruitment poster in Moscow's subway. It featured soldiers asking the viewer, “Who if not you?” “Who if not you? Putin, of course,” the boys laughed.

No one in Russia quite knows what is forbidden and what is still allowed; the Orwellian reality is full of holes. The West is canceled, yet this Christmas season most shopping malls greet visitors with the English word “JOY” in giant letters. The weekend culture guides regularly review episodes in the latest season of White Lotus, explain why the film Conclave is worth the hype and Avatar: Fire and Ash is not, highlight an Italian brunch at the Four Seasons hotel near the Red Square, and promote English-language education in Moscow's British School—while mixing in patriotic poetry or an advertisement to download a video game called Ask Stalin. Some religious organizations and members of the Duma, meanwhile, have demanded a ban on the Harry Potter stories on the grounds that they promote black magic; those calls grew louder this summer, when Russia's Supreme Court declared Satanism a forbidden “international movement” (no such movement exists). Yet on the travel page on Yandex, Russia's answer to Google, Russians are offered trips to Harry Potter theme parks and museums around the world. This December, a favorite event is “Harry Potter, or the Hogwarts New Year” in Moscow's Art Club. In Kazan, the capital of the remote region of Tatarstan, a cute Harry Potter–themed café sells gingerbread with the faces of popular characters.

Other targets of the traditionalists, however, have not been able to escape such attacks. Last year, the LGBT community was deemed an “international extremist movement”—as with Satanism, it doesn't exist—and acknowledgment of these identities was purged from public discourse. Same-sex couples are barred from marrying or having children. Roberto Carnero's biography of the beloved Italian poet and director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who was openly gay, ran afoul of the new LGBT policy. Its brave Russian publisher circumvented censorship and released it in 2024. Instead of simply cutting the forbidden parts, the publisher made the book look like a Cold War–era CIA dossier, with hundreds of pages blacked out, showing the reader the ridiculousness of the regime.

The gray area leaves people in a state of perpetual uncertainty and becomes a form of oppression itself, encouraging individuals to police their own behavior. In the theater, there is an informal guideline—the result of a suggestion from the top—against presenting foreign authors' works on stage, so few dare to put them on. Some theaters delete names of actors and authors deemed “unpatriotic” from playbills. Renowned director Dmitry Krymov left the country in protest of the war, so the production of his drama Seryozha—a take on Tolstoy's Anna Karenina—at the Moscow Art Theater excluded his name from publicity materials. The credit in the program read: “Director: Director.” Last year, one young director staged Hans Christian Andersen's Thumbelina at the Moscow Satire Theater. In the story, the young heroine wants to fly to warm southern countries, seeking freedom. But the director was told not to mention “southern countries”—Ukraine is to the south of Russia. The word “freedom” was to be avoided, too, so as not to give people the wrong idea. The director proposed to end the performance with a Latin choral. “Is Latin from a friendly country?” the theater administrator inquired.

Some examples are even more farcical. The ancient Roman marble statues of naked human figures in Russia's museums now violate Russia's “deep moral traditions,” according to the Kremlin. Even under Stalin's brutal regime, antiquity was not a threat to the state. Meanwhile, the popular plush toy Labubu, created by a Hong Kong–born artist who was raised in the Netherlands, has been painted as an enemy of the homegrown Soviet-era cartoon character Cheburashka. One Russian lawmaker suggested in all seriousness that “those following traditional values at the Ukraine front would choose Cheburashka.” His audience nodded as if this was a reasonable statement.

People are not in control of their own lives anymore. That much became clear in December 2023, when the telecommunications company MTS held an “almost naked” Christmas party in Moscow. Celebrities on the guest list showed up in skimpy outfits, as they had done in previous years, still thinking their private lives were private. But Putin's patriotism took that protection away. The attendees were accused of lacking national pride, “disgustingly” mimicking the West while the country fights for its “traditional soul.” Since then, parties and performances have been raided all over Russia in search of LGBT “criminals,” “Satanists,” or music and plays written by “foreign agents.”

In his 1993 article “Working Towards the Führer,” the British historian Ian Kershaw explained how authoritarianism takes over: through the use of ideology to justify individual and collective actions, through voluntary societal complicity, and through state repression. The leader outlines repressive requirements, then everyone else—starting with his entourage but extending to businesses, governmental and political organizations, schools and universities, and volunteer groups and individuals—make up the rules of behavior. The uber-patriotism of Putinism follows the same script. Ordinary citizens are not just passively complicit but co-authors of repression as they attempt to please their leader and police members of their communities. Officials eager to outdo each other become ever more aggressive in their crackdowns. The result is absurd spectacles as apparatchiks hone the craft of making the abnormal seem normal, and vice versa.

It is not that the authorities stopped recognizing absurdity. They see it when it suits them. Ella Panfilova, the head of Russia's Central Election Commission, was incensed when a concerned lawmaker reported that the official symbol associated with the 2024 elections was similar to the logo of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, once headed by the late Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's main nemesis. Panfilova reprimanded the lawmaker for his “paranoid imagination.” He was later declared a foreign agent for his comments.

In his more than 25 years in power, Putin has instilled in the Russian collective the idea of Russia as a “besieged fortress”—pundits on television have pushed this message for years. People in villages and small towns, living paycheck to paycheck, can draw inspiration from belonging to the great nation that stands up to Western pressure. Wielding the Great Patriotic War slogan “Victory will be ours,” Putin justifies to this public the losses and cruelties they suffer along the way.



In return, Duma members and regular people alike invent suppressive rules as if consumed by collective madness. When the communist system collapsed, the practice of denouncing one's friends, family members, or coworkers for subversive thinking died down, but it reappeared in 2022. In fact, it became normalized, even encouraged, within the broader society. By 2024, proud patriots produced well over 3,000 reports accusing others of discrediting the armed forces, supporting LGBT rights, or criticizing the Kremlin.

Some inform out of conviction, some want to get recognition for assisting the state, and some squeal on others out of fear of becoming victims themselves. Ivan Abaturov, an undistinguished Ph.D. student from Yekaterinburg, became known for making up fantastic accusations against journalists who, for instance, used the word “war” instead of “special military operation.” Within six months in 2023, he wrote 1,357 denunciations under the pseudonym Anna Korobkova.

Others, such as the Russian Commune, an ultra-right pro-war group, fight domestic enemies outright. Originally a vigilante movement, since 2022 it has been aiding official security forces, participating in raids that target ethnic communities or “undesirables” at university lectures or music concerts. Volunteers interrupt talks at Moskva, a bookstore minutes from the Kremlin; they promise trouble for speakers they disapprove of and threaten to burn books and break windows. When the store calls the police asking for protection, officers often refuse, citing limited resources.

It came as a surprise in July when the Ministry of Internal Affairs sought to put a stop to amateur vigilantism. In an indirect reference to the Russian Commune, the ministry issued a warning to Russian citizens about nationalist groups that “use patriotic slogans as a coverup, searching for false enemies, and inflaming ethnic conflicts.” Since then, even the most nationalistic apparatchiks, such as Kirill Kabanov, a member of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights (a name that is now an oxymoron), insist that such organizations must be fully incorporated into “government structures.”

These moves are part of a new phase of repression and control that targets not only the opposition but also the superloyal. Levada pollsters found in December that only 26 percent of the population somewhat agrees that Ukraine's “military operations should continue,” the lowest level of support since the war began. The proportion of those who insist that Russia should fight until complete victory has fallen from 29 percent in 2022 to 15 percent at the end of 2025. The current mood is a threat to the Kremlin. It has responded by leaving less of its authoritarian project to citizens, shifting the burden of suppression to the state. It aims to eliminate all independent political activity—anything that could slip from its control.

The government has even turned against regime insiders. Since the summer, there have been daily detentions of once-trusted government officials, politicians, and high-ranking army officers, who now stand accused of corruption. June and July also witnessed the brutal arrests of journalists from the online news outlet Ura.ru and the Telegram channel Baza, both hyperpatriotic, pro-war publications that had been obediently hateful toward “the enemy”—Ukraine, foreign agents, Kremlin critics. In the fall, a few of the most faithful were labeled foreign agents, including Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political propagandist, and Roman Alekhin, a prominent pro-war blogger. The reasons are subject to speculation: Markov dared to offer Putin advice, or perhaps he was too cozy with Azerbaijan. Alekhin could be critical of the Russian battlefield situation. The highly militant Crimean-born blogger Tatiana Montyan skipped foreign agent status altogether and was labeled a “terrorist and extremist,” apparently because she criticized certain Kremlin-connected patriots. Now, no independent evaluation of Russia's actions is tolerated, even when it comes from the most loyal of followers.

The Kremlin's repression is deepening. Internet access has been shrinking: first, YouTube was made too slow to use, and calls via the messaging apps Signal and Viber were blocked. Then, in September, drastic new regulations came into force: calls via WhatsApp and Telegram were restricted, and anyone searching for any banned website would be fined for participating in extremism. This digital censorship was so far-reaching that factions in the Duma that are normally oppositional in name only voted against it. Only Putin's party approved it without any dissent. It even sparked a rare protest: former presidential candidate Boris Nadezhdin led a group to a parliamentary building with a cardboard placard that read, “Orwell wrote a dystopia, not a manual.” Yet the restrictions keep coming. WhatsApp is all but unusable, and mobile Internet is now blocked daily all across Russia—at least 11,300 shutdowns have been reported in different regions since May—allegedly to prevent its use for Ukrainian drone strikes, but really to sever Russia's connection to the rest of the world and to control the population.



Disillusionment is swelling. Zealous war supporters are angry that Russian society ignores the military's sacrifices. They are dissatisfied with the slow advances in Ukraine: since February 2022, Russia has occupied less than 12 percent of Ukrainian territory. Others worry about inflation, now around seven percent, and complain about the rising prices of food, utility services, gas, and medicine. Economists are gloomy about the struggling economy. The 2025 budget deficit is more than $53 billion; military spending has risen 38 percent compared with last year, while most businesses—in a variety of industries, including construction, automaking, and travel—have seen significant decline. Russia's shift to more labor-intensive sectors, rather than the “focus on high-level technology” that Putin promised back in 2020, is unlikely to help. And the country increasingly has to reckon with the loss of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who have died fighting.

If there is no peace, then full war is only a matter of time. Earlier in December, Putin's annual question-and-answer session for the public and the press was overwhelmingly focused on the country's necessary sacrifices for the “special military operation.” Staying committed to the war could potentially mean total mobilization and martial law. If, instead, the conflict ends next year, the regime will be bombarded with difficult questions. Both possibilities are laced with uncertainty, so the Kremlin's control needs to be absolute.

Yet entering 2026, Russia's recreation of 1984 remains incomplete. The final rules are not fully set, and dissent slips through the cracks. Dmitry Muratov of Novaya Gazeta—himself labeled a foreign agent—regularly raises his voice against repression. His reporters continue to work as they did before 2022. The newspaper is officially closed, but it is available online via VPN, and Russians can order a hard copy online under the alternate title Novaya Gazeta Journal. Some anchors and analysts from the YouTube channel Zhivoi Gvozd (formerly Echo Moskvy) have also remained in Moscow; evicted from their prestigious headquarters, they now broadcast from a few modest rooms on the outskirts of the city.

These people resist repression every day. So do countless others in acts of defiance that expose the ludicrousness and brutality of the regime. A few months ago, a brave man in St. Petersburg painted graffiti with the 1960s Soviet slogan “Peace on Earth”; he is now being investigated for extremism and terrorism. Walking the grounds of the St. Savior Transfiguration Monastery in Yaroslavl, an ancient town 160 miles north of Moscow, one encounters a large stone on which someone painted a bird in yellow and blue—the colors of the Ukrainian flag. In the town of Murom, 200 miles east, a clothing store attracts visitors by displaying clusters of balloons in eye-catching colors—black and purple, white and red, and yellow and blue. When I asked if the last pairing was deliberate, a saleswoman winked and said, “Well, if an official comes in, I'll do a Marilyn Monroe smile and say, ‘These colors look so pretty together.'”

            Ahead of a detention hearing Tuesday for the man accused of placing two pipe bombs near the Republican and Democratic National Committee buildings in 2021, defense attorneys argue their client should be released from jail while awaiting trial, in part because the bombs never detonated.
    


            Attorneys for the 30-year-old Virginia man, Brian Cole Jr., said he has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder – listing those as the first two factors in arguing for pre-trial release.
    


            “The question is whether there is a present danger—a contention the government never actually makes, and something belied by the past four years in which Mr. Cole has lived without incident,” Cole's attorneys argued in their filing, adding, “No device detonated, no person was injured, and no property was damaged.”
    


            But it could be difficult to convince a federal judge to release Cole amid the evidence prosecutors have already presented in court filings, more of which could be revealed during Tuesday's hearing.
    


            In an earlier filing arguing for Cole's detention, prosecutors laid out a detailed list of the bomb-making materials they said he purchased in 2018 through 2020 and used to make the pipe bombs left outside the Washington, DC-based RNC and DNC in January 2021.
    


Hardware purchases and location data: How the FBI says it made an arrest in the DC pipe bomb case, nearly five years later



            While Cole initially denied during an initial interview with investigators that he had placed the bombs, prosecutors say Cole later changed his tune after being shown a still image of himself on surveillance video around the time the bombs were planted.
    


            “The defendant asked for time to process things,” prosecutors wrote.
    


            Cole then proceeded to explain in detail how he had built the bombs, including how “he learned to make the black powder from a video game that listed the ingredients” and also watched “various science-related videos on YouTube to assist him in creating the devices,” the filing states.
    


            Cole, when asked about why he placed the bombs, said that “something just snapped” after “watching everything, just everything getting worse,” according to prosecutors.
    


            He also said his interest in history spurred the idea to use pipe bombs, specifically their use during the Troubles in Ireland, the court document states.
    


            “The defendant wanted to do something ‘to the parties' because ‘they were in charge,'” according to the court document.
    


            Cole denied that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to the Electoral College certification, which was the at the center of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol the following day.

            Back in 2017, when my husband was still in the Army, we learned he was unexpectedly deploying right as we were going to start trying to get pregnant. Military families get accustomed to this pattern: You plan and the United States Armed Forces makes you go back to the drawing board.
    


            Inconveniently, he had pre-deployment work travel pop up while I was ovulating, which is how we found ourselves explaining to the staff at a local fertility clinic that we needed to freeze my husband's sperm so I could do an intrauterine insemination while he was away.
    


            It was incredibly stressful. It was like the clinic had never dealt with a couple in our situation. We didn't have fertility issues that we were aware of, but I was 37 and it felt like we didn't have a month to waste. One staff member tried to charge us for a full IVF cycle, at a cost of at least $10,000. Ultimately, after a negotiation, we were able to get the job done a la carte for several hundred dollars.
    


            The IUI didn't work. Maybe I do have fertility issues, I thought. I wasn't exactly young for having children.
    


            I remember thinking how I wished I hadn't switched to my husband's military insurance, TRICARE. It covered only fertility issues related to “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty.” My employer-provided insurance did, though it was more expensive but significantly cheaper than paying for IVF out of pocket.
    


            I should note that having the choice of two insurance options is something many military spouses do not have. My husband was at the end of his military career, and his home base was stationary. The constant moves that usually define military life wreak havoc on a military spouse finding a job, let alone maintaining a career. Military spouses have an unemployment rate four to five times the national average. TRICARE is often their only choice for medical coverage.
    


            More than eight years after my failed IUI, as federal employees have seen an expansion in their fertility benefits, TRICARE still doesn't offer fertility coverage. A couple of weeks ago, it really looked like it would, which is why as we ring in 2026, I am thinking of the military families struggling to have a baby, for whom this new year will be off to a bitter start.
    


            They were banking on a provision in the massive defense bill signed into law by President Donald Trump just before the holidays that would have given them the same kind of access to fertility coverage that other federal employees have.
    


            The IVF language easily passed out of committees in the House and Senate. But as the bill was buffed and polished into a final version for both chambers to pass and send to Trump's desk, the IVF provision was stripped from the measure just days before a vote.
    


            It was devastating for military family members like Courtney Deady and her husband, a member of the Ohio Air National Guard, who have been trying to have a baby for a decade.
    


            They've spent $100,000 on multiple attempts to conceive by intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.
    


            “It's the mental health, it's the travel,” Deady said. “There's so many other things, such as cryopreservation” of embryos.
    


            Deady has one embryo left for one last round of IVF.
    


            She was counting on the fertility coverage in the defense bill. It seemed like it had a real shot. After all, Trump campaigned on making IVF more accessible, and this was the first National Defense Authorization Act he would sign after he reentered the White House.
    


            On the trail in 2024, Trump had pledged that “under the Trump administration, your government will pay for, or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for, all costs associated with IVF treatment.”
    


            Deady voted for Trump, sold on his IVF promises.
    


            She was buoyed by the executive order he signed in February to ease the financial burdens of fertility treatment and deflated when he signed a defense bill this month that did nothing to ease the financial burdens of IVF for military families.
    


            “It honestly feels, for lack of better terms, more of a slap in the face to a lot of our community when our Congress is receiving a lot of those benefits that we so desperately would love to have on our end,” she told CNN.
    


            Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat wounded veteran who battled infertility and ultimately conceived two children through IVF, was the Senate sponsor of the TRICARE coverage provision.
    


            Duckworth blames House Speaker Mike Johnson for removing it last minute from the bill.
    


            “The committees in both chambers support this. There's nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,” she told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            “The president of the United States … promised on the campaign trail to make IVF available to all Americans, and I can't think of a better place to make it available than to the men and women of this great nation,” the Illinois Democrat said.
    


            Duckworth sent a letter to Trump with a handwritten note: “Speaker Johnson wants you to become the deadbeat dad of IVF,” a reference to Trump's description of himself as “the father of IVF.”
    


            Johnson's home state of Louisiana has some of the most restrictive laws in the country governing IVF, emblematic of the influence of anti-abortion activists in the state.
    


            Louisiana is the only state to prohibit patients and clinics from disposing of unused embryos, requiring they be shipped out of state.
    


            A spokesperson for Johnson's office told CNN that expanding access to IVF remains a priority.
    


            “President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to lower costs and expand access to IVF. The Speaker has clearly and repeatedly stated he is supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically,” they said in a statement.
    


            Deady, who also works as the community support director of Building Military Families Network, a nonprofit for military families experiencing difficulties with fertility, rejects the position.
    


            “When we've — all of our families — have really thought logically and we've prayed about it or we've done the research to figure out what, ethically, this journey looks like for us and to not have that, it goes to show that there's a … lack of education when it comes to this realm of reproductive medicine,” she told CNN.
    


            There was bipartisan disappointment in the last-minute yanking of the IVF provision and, in the House, a group of veterans and lawmakers representing significant military communities has already reintroduced IVF coverage in TRICARE.
    


            Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, a Navy veteran, is among them.
    


            “Since 2023, Congress has rightly focused on strengthening military recruitment and retention by increasing troop pay, improving housing, expanding health care, and investing in quality of life for servicemembers and their families. Now, Congress should expand access to IVF, as many civilian employers already do, to build on that progress and help ensure America maintains the most lethal fighting force the world has ever known,” he said in a statement.
    


            Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, who represents a large number of military families in her Virginia district, which includes Virginia Beach and areas around Norfolk, the largest naval base in the country, said that “Military families already sacrifice so much in service to our nation. Access to IVF and fertility care shouldn't depend on financial means.”
    


            I am writing this column with my 7-year-old son fast asleep in his bed, counting my blessings that my failed IUI was my one and only fertility treatment.
    


            After it, my husband returned home from his work trip but deployed before I expected to ovulate again. So, when I realized I was pregnant long after he deployed, it felt like a miracle, especially when my first sonogram showed I was pregnant with twins.
    


            A few weeks after, another sonogram showed I had what's called “a vanishing twin.” The second embryo had failed to develop. But there was still one. We made it through a large subchorionic hemorrhage of my placenta and a few other difficult moments, including my water breaking a month early while my husband was in Asia on a graduation trip for his eldest child not long after returning from his deployment. Somehow, he made it back for the final minutes of my labor to see our son born.
    


            Not even a year later, my husband deployed again, for longer this time. Military family life was a lot for me to manage, caring for a baby and my young stepson as well, but I can't imagine not having the chance. Being a military spouse has been one of the best experiences of my life, but nothing surpasses being a mom.
    


            For many military families struggling with infertility, choosing between the two feels like a sacrifice they shouldn't have to make.

            Most presidents profess not to interfere in other countries' domestic politics and elections — despite decades of nefarious US political game-playing abroad.
    


            President Donald Trump doesn't bother with the pretense.
    


            A leader who transformed the Republican Party into a partial personality cult and whose every life experience seems to involve the flexing of leverage doesn't stop at the water's edge.
    


            In yet another example of how Trump has broken the mold of the presidency, Trump openly boosts favored candidates and seeks to bend their national political and justice systems in their favor. Just in case no one noticed, the White House committed to paper its support for far-right European populists trying to topple allied leaders in its new national security strategy.
    


            In his second term, Trump is acting as the global head of a nationalist political movement, seeking to shape partisan politics in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, South Korea, Venezuela, South Africa and across the Atlantic.
    


            In most cases, Trump promoted leaders and candidates who favor his populist nationalism, those who flatter him, or who face legal battles that mirror his own.
    


            On Monday, he plunged yet again into the politics of Israel, where he is highly popular and thus enjoys great political influence ahead of a general election expected next year.
    


            Trump told reporters that the pardon he'd previously requested for visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing bribery and fraud charges, was “on its way” after he'd spoken to Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Trump added: “He's a wartime prime minister who's a hero. How do you not give a pardon?”
    


            Herzog's office quickly issued a statement denying there'd been any such conversation between the two presidents. It said Herzog had spoken with a Trump representative and that the process would follow standard procedure.
    


            If Trump could deliver Netanyahu from a criminal trial, he'd considerably ease the Israeli leader's personal anxieties and might enhance his electoral prospects. He'd also leave Netanyahu deeply in his personal debt, a potential clue to Trump's motivations as he returned Netanyahu's flattery at his Mar-a-Lago resort Monday with his own lavish praise.
    


            “Thank you for your support. It's meant from the heart,” Netanyahu told Trump, while announcing his host would be the first foreigner to receive the Israel Prize, the Jewish state's top cultural award. The Peace category, which the government decided to award Trump, has never been granted before.
    


            It was a clever new spin by Netanyahu on the tradition of arriving to visit Trump bearing gifts. On a previous visit, he nominated the president for the Nobel Peace Prize that he craves.
    


            Despite whispers before the meeting that members of Trump's entourage are frustrated at Israeli foot-dragging on phase two of the Gaza ceasefire deal — one of the president's top second-term achievements — Netanyahu basked in a priceless political endorsement.
    


            “If you had 8 out of 10 prime ministers in his position right now  …. you wouldn't have Israel any longer,” Trump said. “You needed a very special man to really carry through and really help Israel through this horrible jam.” In a few sentences, he wrote his visitor's reelection pitch.
    


            American presidents have traditionally balked at being seen to overtly interfere in the politics of foreign nations. To start with, it's bad manners. And few presidents would enjoy the favor being returned to help their political opponents.
    


            It's also a fundamental principle of democracy that voters get to decide who leads them. (This is one value Trump seems not to share, given his refusal to accept his 2020 election loss). And there's always the possibility that endorsing a particular leader in a country could backfire — either by creating an anti-American backlash over the perception of meddling or by alienating new presidents and prime ministers before they take office.
    


            The Trump administration, however, rarely stops trying to shape foreign politics for its own gain.
    


            Last week, for instance, Honduras announced that the conservative National Party candidate Nasry Asfura had won a tight presidential election. Trump had warned there'd be “hell to pay” if Asfura didn't emerge from a prolonged counting process as the winner.
    


            Defeated center-right candidate Salvador Nasralla claimed that Trump's interventions — which including the pardoning of a former Honduran president serving a 45-year-US jail term for drug trafficking — had damaged his chances of winning.
    


            Trump has repeatedly sought to use US power to shape the politics of the Western Hemisphere in his populist image.
    


            He slapped a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports over the criminal prosecution of his friend and former President Jair Bolsonaro for an alleged coup. The maneuver showed how Trump uses import taxes as a foreign policy weapon in addition to a trade tool.
    


            Trump is currently using massive US power — in the form of a naval armada off Venezuela — to try to prompt the ouster or resignation of President Nicolás Maduro. The ostensible justification is to shut down the narcotics trade.
    


            Millions of Venezuelans could benefit from the exit of leader who has impoverished their nation. But many analysts also believe Trump hopes to enhance his power by installing a more ideologically friendly regime in Caracas. Perhaps he also hopes to trigger a domino effect that ends the communist regime in Cuba.
    


            The president already seems to have an eye on Colombia's presidential election next year. He warned over the Christmas holiday that President Gustavo Petro needed to “watch his a**.” Petro told CNN this month that he believed Trump's pressure on Venezuela was about oil, not restoring democracy.
    


            Trump also used America's economic power to try to dictate politics in Argentina by warning that a $20 billion economic bailout was contingent on his friend Argentine President and MAGA hero Javier Milei remaining in power. “If he doesn't win, we're gone,” Trump said.
    


            But Trump's political chess-playing isn't confined to the Western Hemisphere. When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the Oval Office in May, the president sought to undermine him domestically with a video suggesting that White South Africans were faced genocide.
    


            In August, President Lee Jae Myung faced a curveball just before Oval Office talks when Trump posted an incendiary message on social media about alleged church raids in South Korea. The visiting president smoothed things over by presenting Trump with two “Make America Great Again” cowboy hats and a personalized golf putter. But the episode was a reminder that almost nothing is off-limits for Trump when he's seeking to knock other leaders off balance.
    


            The Trump administration now seems determined to destabilize centrist and left-of-center governments in Europe. The new national security strategy argues that European culture is threatened by “civilizational erasure” because of waves of Muslim immigration. It endorses “the growing influence of patriotic European parties” and says US policy should prioritize “cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations.”
    


            Leaders of France, Germany and Britain argue that far-right parties that support Trump, such as the National Rally, Alternative for Germany and Reform UK, respectively, threaten the fabric of liberal democracies. None can have expected the United States, the guarantor of their freedoms for 80 years, to emerge as a direct threat to their political stability.
    


            Of course, Trump is far from the only US president to meddle in foreign politics. It's been happening for decades, even if such efforts were often covert or took place under another guise. And Trump supporters can point to plenty of friendly relations between Democratic and Republican presidents in Western nations with compatible liberal and conservative leaders in Western nations. President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were seen as joint heralds of a conservative revival in the 1980s, for instance.
    


            There have also been many more sinister US meddling attempts.
    


            A CIA-backed coup in Iran in 1953 set off a cascade of events that led to today's standoff with the Islamic republic. President John F. Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion failed to topple Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution in 1961. Several US administrations staged regime-change operations in Latin America — including Chile, Nicaragua, Panama and Guatemala — over the years, some of which ended in military dictatorships.
    


            And when US forces didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the catastrophic invasion was recast as part of a “Freedom Agenda” to spread democracy around the world.
    


            In one of the clumsiest recent examples of a US president playing politics in another country, Barack Obama warned in 2016 that Britain would find itself at “the back of the queue” in negotiating trade deals with the US if it quit the European Union. The Leave campaign seized on the comment to claim political interference in favor of British Prime Minister David Cameron's Remain campaign.
    


            Obama's move backfired when the UK voted for Brexit anyway, in a harbinger of Trump's shock populist win in the 2016 presidential election a few months later.
    


            Obama was part of a long line of presidents who've dabbled in politics overseas with dubious success. But few have been as overt as Trump. As he often does, he's taken actions pioneered by past presidents to extremes. His everywhere, all at once strategy reflects his domineering character and the global ambitions of his political movement.

PARIS (AP) — Power problems and a stuck train interrupted rail services through the undersea Channel Tunnel connecting the United Kingdom and continental Europe on Tuesday, operators said, stranding passengers during the busy end-of-year holidays.

At Paris' Gare du Nord station, Jamie and Issy Gill scrambled to find a flight back to the U.K. after their Eurostar train to London was canceled, desperate to be reunited with their baby boy after a getaway in the French capital.

“We came for my 30th birthday,” Issy Gill said, wiping away tears.

Jamie Gill said they'd take a roundabout route back, with a flight via Birmingham on Wednesday.

Eurostar — which runs passenger trains between London and Paris and other European destinations — blamed “overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel” and a failure aboard a train operated by LeShuttle, which transports vehicles and their passengers between the ports of Calais, France, and Folkestone, England.

On Tuesday afternoon, Eurostar said the tunnel was partially reopening but with only one of its two train lines, allowing Eurostar services to resume in the evening — although with expected continued delays and longer journey times than usual. It advised passengers to rebook their journeys on other days.

The 50-kilometer (32-mile) Channel Tunnel, more than half of it undersea, has revolutionized U.K.-Europe rail travel since its inauguration in 1994. But because it's the only fixed cross-English Channel rail link, train services tend to be vulnerable to severe disruptions.




The Gare du Nord station heaved with frustrated passengers trying to book plane or bus tickets.

“I'm disgusted, disheartened,” said Sarah Omouri, a French traveler whose plans to celebrate the New Year in London were dashed.

“It's been maybe a year since we've had a vacation,” she said. “We were made to get on the train, to get off, get on again, and get off again. Now we're told that everything is fully booked for several days. It's ruined.”

In London, would-be traveler John Paul had expected to enjoy a romantic river cruise in Paris and a trip to the Eiffel Tower with his partner, Lucy, but their Eurostar got turned back before reaching the continent.

“We got probably about an hour down the track, maybe 40 minutes, and then they basically said the train's got to stop, because the train ahead got a braking issue,” the 46-year-old Paul said.

“They kept telling us that the driver was trying to fix the brakes on this other train and that the other trains were then backed up,” he said. “There's no clear information and, obviously, we've lost a lot of money, haven't we?”

The Channel Tunnel's operator, Eurotunnel, said that the power supply problem started overnight Monday in part of the tunnel, impacting passenger and vehicle travel by rail in both directions.

PARIS (AP) — Call them Monsieur and Madame Clooney. 

France's government says that George Clooney, his wife Amal and their twins Ella and Alexander have been awarded French citizenship.

The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the “Ocean's” series of heist movies and his family were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published. 

The government notice indicated that human rights lawyer Amal Clooney was naturalized under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. It also noted that George Clooney's middle name is Timothy.

The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021. In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney described their “farm in France” as their primary residence — a decision the 64-year-old actor and his 47-year-old wife made with their children in mind.

“I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood,” he told the magazine. “I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.” 

Growing up away from the spotlight in France, “they're not on their iPads, you know?” he said. “They have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.” 

Representatives for George Clooney did not respond to The Associated Press' request for comment Monday. It wasn't clear whether he retained his American citizenship. Amal Clooney was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.




The French government's Interior Ministry did not explain why the Clooneys were entitled to French citizenship but said in a statement to the AP that the couple “followed a rigorous procedure” with security checks and interviews required as part of the naturalization process.

Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized, including if they are deemed to have abilities and talents that would enable them to render what the government describes as “important services to France.”

In recent media interviews when he was promoting “Jay Kelly,” Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app but that it remains “horrible, horrible.” He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly. 

“They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,” he joked, speaking to French broadcaster Canal+.

French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.

Brignoles Mayor Didier Brémond told broadcaster BFMTV on Tuesday that the Clooneys are “a very simple and very accessible family” and noted that the actor shops in town and attended the opening of its cinema. Their decision to become French citizens testified to “his love for our country,” the mayor said. 

“Here, he wants to live normally and that's what he is trying to do,” he said.

The American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside of the United States, has removed two panels about Black soldiers from the Dutch village of Margraten's visitors center. Local Dutch residents who care for the graves, children of U.S. soldiers and Dutch officials are outraged.

MARGRATEN, Netherlands (AP) — Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped to liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.

Sometime in the spring, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside of the United States, removed the panels from the visitors center at the American Cemetery in Margraten, the final resting place for roughly 8,300 U.S. soldiers, set in rolling hills near the border with Belgium and Germany.

The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. “Our country will be woke no longer,” Trump said in an address to Congress in March. 

The removal, carried out without public explanation, has angered Dutch officials, the families of U.S. soldiers and the local residents who honor the American sacrifice by caring for the graves.

U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo seemed to support the removal of the displays. “The signs at Margraten are not intended to promote an agenda that criticizes America,” he wrote on social media following a visit to the cemetery after the controversy had erupted. Popolo declined a request for comment. 




One display told the story of 23-year-old George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier buried at the cemetery, who died attempting to rescue a comrade from drowning in 1945. The other described the U.S. policy of racial segregation in place during World War II.

Some 1 million Black soldiers enlisted in the U.S. military during the war, serving in separate units, mostly doing menial tasks but also fighting in some combat missions. An all-Black unit dug the thousands of graves in Margraten during the brutal 1944-45 season of famine in the German-occupied Netherlands known in the Hunger Winter.

Cor Linssen, the 79-year-old son of a Black American soldier and a Dutch mother, is one of those who opposes the removal of the panels.

Linssen grew up some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the cemetery and although he didn't learn who his father was until later in life, he knew he was the son of a Black soldier. 

“When I was born, the nurse thought something was wrong with me because I was the wrong color,” he told The Associated Press. “I was the only dark child at school.”

Linssen together with a group of other children of Black soldiers, now all in their 70s and 80s, visited the cemetery in February 2025 to see the panels. 

“It's an important part of history,” Linssen said. “They should put the panels back.”

After months of mystery around the disappearance of the panels, two media organizations — the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and online media Dutch News — this month published emails obtained through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request showing that Trump's DEI policies directly prompted the commission to take down the panels.

The White House did not respond to queries from AP about the removed panels.

The American Battle Monuments Commission did not respond to queries from AP about the revelations. Earlier, the ABMC told the AP that the panel that discussed segregation “did not fall within (the) commemorative mission.''

It also said that the panel about Pruitt was “rotated” out. The replacement panel features Leslie Loveland, a white soldier killed in Germany in 1945, who is buried at Margraten. 

Chair of the Black Liberators foundation and Dutch senator Theo Bovens said his organization, which pushed for the inclusion of the panels at the visitors center, was not informed that they were removed. He told AP it is “strange” that the U.S. commission feels the panels are not in their mission, as they placed them in 2024.

“Something has changed in the United States,” he said.

Bovens, who is from the region around Margraten, is one of thousands of locals who tend to the graves at the cemetery. People who adopt a grave visit it regularly and leave flowers on the fallen soldier's birthday and other holidays. The responsibility is often passed down through Dutch families, and there is a waiting list to adopt graves of the U.S. soldiers.

Both the city and the province where the cemetery is located have demanded the panels be returned. In November a Dutch television program recreated the panels and installed them outside the cemetery, where they were quickly removed by police. The show is now seeking a permanent location for them. 

The Black Liberators is also looking to find a permanent location for a memorial for the Black soldiers who gave their lives to free the Dutch. 

On America Square, in front of the Eijsden-Margraten city hall, there is a small park named for Jefferson Wiggins, a Black solider who, at age 19, dug many of the graves at Margraten when he was stationed in the Netherlands. 

In his memoir, published posthumously in 2014, he describes burying the bodies of his white comrades who he was barred from fraternizing with while they were alive.

When Black soldiers came to Europe in the Second World War, ''what they found was people who accepted them, who welcomed them, who treated them as the heroes that they were. And that includes the Netherlands,″ said Linda Hervieux, whose book “Forgotten” chronicles Black soldiers who fought on D-Day and segregation they faced back home.

The removal of the panels, she said, “follows a historical pattern of writing out the stories of men and women of color in the United States.”

Former Deputy National Security Advisor Victoria Coates reacts to President Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Iran's declaration of a 'full-scale war' with the U.S., Israel and Europe.

Sunday's meeting between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy produced no dramatic announcements, sweeping declarations or signed peace deal. That outcome should surprise no one. After nearly four years of war, diplomacy was never going to turn on a single press conference or photo opportunity.

President Trump himself struck a measured tone afterward, saying, ""I think we'll get it done,"" while acknowledging that the effort ""can go poorly."" Zelenskyy, for his part, described the talks as constructive and serious, emphasizing that Ukraine remains committed to a just peace that ensures long-term security. Both statements point to the same reality: the process is underway, but the hard decisions lie ahead.

Still, the meeting mattered.

‘ONLY TRUMP CAN STOP RUSSIA': MILLIONS FACE FREEZING WINTER, UKRAINE ENERGY EXECUTIVE WARNS

According to reporting by Reuters and The Wall Street Journal, the purpose of the Trump–Zelenskyy talks was not to finalize peace, but to close gaps on a developing framework — often described as a 20-point plan — before Trump engages directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. That framework emphasizes Ukrainian sovereignty, enforcement mechanisms and security guarantees, while leaving the most sensitive issues — territory and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — unresolved.

In other words, diplomacy has entered a more serious phase. Not because peace is imminent, but because exhaustion is universal. Ukraine continues to suffer devastating losses. Russia bleeds manpower and treasure. Europe is strained under economic and security pressures. The United States faces growing global instability from Eastern Europe to the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific. Fatigue does not guarantee peace — but it creates political space for it.

Cautious optimism is therefore justified. But optimism without realism would be dangerous.

The central question hanging over Sunday's meeting is not whether a framework exists — it does — but whether it is built on a false assumption that still dominates much Western thinking: that Vladimir Putin is a rational actor who can be satisfied with partial concessions. The record suggests otherwise.

US OFFICIALS TOUT PROGRESS IN TALKS TO REACH 'LASTING AND DURABLE PEACE' BETWEEN UKRAINE, RUSSIA

Since the invasion began, Putin has responded to compromise with escalation, to restraint with expansion, and to negotiations with continued violence. Even as peace efforts accelerated this week, Russia continued launching missile and drone strikes across Ukraine — a fact confirmed by media outlets. Those attacks are not random. They are signals. Either Putin intends to continue the war outright, or he is deliberately shaping the diplomatic environment by force — creating urgency, fear and pressure for Ukrainian concessions.

In either case, the implication is clear: Putin will not stop unless he is forced to stop — or unless he is given everything he is demanding.

That reality should sober any discussion of ""land for peace."" Territorial concessions dominate headlines because maps are tangible and emotionally charged. But land is not the decisive variable. Security is.

Multiple outlets have reported that Ukraine is seeking what officials describe as ""Article 5–like"" security guarantees — binding commitments from the United States and its allies to respond to future Russian aggression. Zelenskyy has even indicated openness to halting Ukraine's NATO membership bid if such guarantees are credible. That alone underscores how existential this question is for Kyiv.

Ukraine has learned the hard way that vague assurances are worthless. The 1994 Budapest Memorandum did not stop Russia. Previous ceasefires did not stop Russia. Agreements without enforcement did not stop Russia. Any peace that trades Ukrainian territory for promises without teeth is not peace — it is a pause before the next assault.

Since the invasion began, Putin has responded to compromise with escalation, to restraint with expansion, and to negotiations with continued violence. 

Security guarantees must therefore be specific, automatic and enforceable. Clear triggers. Defined responses. Real consequences. Not committees that deliberate while missiles fall. Not sanctions that require months of political wrangling to reassemble. Reuters has reported that the draft framework under discussion includes monitoring mechanisms and penalties for violations — an encouraging sign, if they are implemented seriously.

TRUMP, ZELENSKYY SAY UKRAINE PEACE DEAL CLOSE BUT 'THORNY ISSUES' REMAIN AFTER FLORIDA TALKS

This is where President Trump's role becomes decisive.

Trump possesses leverage that few leaders do, precisely because he is willing to combine pressure with negotiation. He can tighten sanctions enforcement and close evasion pathways that blunt existing measures. He can impose snap-back penalties that activate immediately upon violation. He can maintain military assistance sufficient to raise the cost of renewed Russian offensives. And he can offer a conditional off-ramp — economic relief or diplomatic reengagement — only after verified compliance.

The objective is not to persuade Putin of Western goodwill. It is to change his cost calculus.

Putin has repeatedly shown that he will absorb pain — economic, military, diplomatic — if he believes time and fear are on his side. What he has not shown is a willingness to retreat in the face of strength. Any peace framework that fails to account for that pattern risks collapsing the moment attention shifts elsewhere.

Europe should be watching closely. This war is not solely about Ukraine. It is a test of whether borders in Europe can once again be changed by force. A settlement that assumes Putin can be ""managed"" through compromise alone will not stabilize the continent; it will invite the next crisis. History is unkind to illusions of restraint when dealing with expansionist regimes.

The most realistic takeaway from Sunday's meeting is this: diplomacy has not failed — but neither has it yet proven itself. Alignment between Washington and Kyiv is a necessary first step, not a sufficient one. If President Trump proceeds to speak with Putin armed with a unified framework, clear red lines and credible enforcement tools, then this effort has a chance.

If not — if peace is pursued without strength, enforcement and clarity — then Sunday's meeting will be remembered not as the beginning of the end, but as another moment when the West mistook words for power.

Peace remains possible. But only if we abandon the comforting fiction that Vladimir Putin can be satisfied with half-measures — and build an agreement that makes renewed aggression unmistakably costly.

Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports the latest on the key witness who helped identify the Brown University shooting suspect and the criticism facing police. 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts weigh in and discuss the Trump administration's immigration policy

The most gripping crime stories of 2025 weren't just about suspects and victims — they were about free speech, terrorism, trust in the justice system and safety in places once considered secure.

The crimes that drew the most attention this year revealed deep fractures in United States society but kept millions of Americans riveted to their news feeds and social media.

From politically-motivated assassinations to high-profile trials garnering round-the-clock true crime coverage, these cases shaped the national conversation over the past 12 months.

Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk visited Utah Valley University in Orem on Sept. 10 as part of a campus speaking tour in which he planned to promote free speech and debate hot-button topics.

But 20 minutes into his appearance, a sniper's bullet struck him in the neck, killing him.

""It's just one of those moments that is so shocking to your system and yet it's going to change everything and this is going to be a moment that we're going to think back upon and talk about for years and years to come,"" said Joshua Ritter, a Los Angeles defense attorney and Fox News contributor. ""How shocking it was that it took place in public, and the video of his assassination lives on the internet forever now, in such stark violence. And then to realize that it was entirely motivated because of what this man stood for and how people disagree with that really brings a level of disturbing awareness of how divided we still are as a country.""

Suspected assassin Tyler Robinson was arrested days later in his hometown in southern Utah, hundreds of miles away.

CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION LEAVES UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AS INVESTIGATORS PIECE TOGETHER GAPS IN CASE

Kirk made a career out of engaging people who disagreed with him. According to prosecutors, Robinson sent text messages to his lover allegedly admitting he ""had enough of his hatred"" and left a note declaring, ""I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.""

An ISIS-inspired attack on New Year's revelers in New Orleans killed 14 people and underscored the ongoing threat of Islamist extremism.

Authorities said the suspect was motivated by radical propaganda.

Video shows he flew a black ISIS flag from the back of his rented pickup truck as he sped down Bourbon Street, slamming into pedestrians in the early morning hours of Jan. 1 — reviving fears that global terror networks continue to inspire lone actors to carry out violence on American soil.

Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texan blamed for the attack, died in a shootout with police. Months later, authorities in Iraq revealed they had arrested an ISIS member accused of inciting Jabbar to commit the murders.

BROWN UNIVERSITY WAS ‘SOFT TARGET' FOR SHOOTER WHO REMAINS AT LARGE, CRIMINAL PROFILER SAYS

By pleading guilty, Bryan Kohberger avoided the potential death penalty and a public trial that could have exposed new details about the home invasion murders of four University of Idaho students, three of whom were asleep when he attacked them with a knife on Nov. 13, 2022.

The move brought closure for some of the victims' families, but others were outraged that prosecutors didn't take him to trial and seek capital punishment.

BROWN UNIVERSITY SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF TERROR THAT LEFT 2 DEAD, 9 INJURED

The deal spared his life but secured the highest possible punishment aside from the death penalty — four consecutive sentences of life without parole, plus another 10 years.

However, he was not required to explain himself under the terms of the deal, leaving questions about a motive unanswered.

""The Bryan Kohberger case stands out because it's literally the embodiment of every parent's nightmare,"" said Ritter, who is a father himself. ""You send your children off to college hoping they're gonna be safe, and even when you do everything to put them in a safe environment, some absolute maniac can sneak into their home in the middle of the night and kill them in an apparently random attack.""

Karen Read's second murder trial reopened one of the most divisive and closely watched legal battles in recent memory. She had fervent supporters, who believed her defense's theory that she had been framed, as well as outspoken critics, who noted that no one but her has been accused by any law enforcement agency of killing John O'Keefe.

""The Karen Read case was about far more than a tragic death outside a Boston-area home,"" said Royal Oakes, a Los Angeles-based attorney who played a key role in a judge's decision to allow cameras in the courtroom during OJ Simpson's murder trial in the 1990s. ""It became a referendum on police credibility, investigative integrity and whether a defendant can get a fair trial when law enforcement itself is accused of circling the wagons.""

EVIDENCE SHOWS DEADLY BROWN, MIT SHOOTINGS MAY BE LINKED, SOURCES SAY: REPORT

With new jurors, renewed scrutiny and sloppy police work, the retrial appeared to put the investigation itself on trial alongside Read.

""The case exploded nationally because it blended true crime with institutional distrust,"" Oakes said. ""The defense didn't just argue reasonable doubt — they argued a cover-up. That turns a homicide trial into a broader test of public faith in the justice system.""

Her first trial, which ended with a hung jury, led to disciplinary action against Massachusetts State Police homicide investigators, an independent review of the local police department and the firing of the lead detective.

The second time around, Read was acquitted of all homicide-related charges in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, O'Keefe, and sentenced to a year of probation for drunken driving.

""Karen Read's trial mattered because it illustrated a growing trend: juries are increasingly skeptical of law enforcement narratives,"" Oakes said. ""This case will be cited for years as an example of institutional doubt in criminal prosecutions.""

While Jeffrey Epstein died in 2019 and Luigi Mangione is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year, both names continued to dominate headlines in 2025.

Each case fueled broader debates about power, privilege and accountability — for different reasons.

Epstein, who was accused of sex trafficking and victimizing hundreds of women and girls for himself and his rich and powerful friends, has only one convicted accomplice, his former lover Ghislaine Maxwell. She is still fighting her conviction from inside a Texas prison camp.

Mangione, on the other hand, is accused of killing Thompson to send a message about what his supporters see as corruption in the U.S. health insurance industry.

Mangione has pleaded not guilty to a slew of charges in New York, Pennsylvania and at the federal level. None of his cases have gone to trial yet.

Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national with a green card, killed two Brown University students and injured nine more during a finals week study session, according to police in Providence, Rhode Island.

Then he drove 50 miles away to the home of a leading nuclear physicist who worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and gunned him down inside two days later, federal prosecutors said.

Neves-Valente had briefly attended Brown in the early 2000s and went to the same Portuguese college as Nuno Loureiro before that, but a motive remains unclear. Police found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a storage unit in New Hampshire on Dec. 18.

The violence reignited debate over security, surveillance and whether open campuses are prepared for modern threats.

The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says people are 'hungry for authenticity' and 'rejecting groupthink' in the new year while calling on Americans to form opinions based on truth. 

I have now made it from New York to the great state of Georgia on my Walk Across America, a million-step effort to raise funds for Project H.O.O.D.'s Leadership and Economic Opportunity Center in Chicago. 

I realized last week that I will be spending this New Year's Day here and, with 2026 fast approaching, I've been reflecting on what our nation needs the most as we begin a new year. 

For years, I have watched as brave individuals from the hip-hop community, the R&B world, pop stars, movie actors and even everyday folks come under fierce attack for simply voicing what they believe. 

ELITES CALL THE SOUTH BACKWARD — BUT WALKING IT REVEALED AMERICA'S NEXT BOOM

You have Justine Bateman out in California going against the grain with her criticisms of the political happenings there. You have Azealia Banks, who has been fierce in her defense of Israel and other issues. And you have artists like Nicki Minaj, who have faced backlash for speaking out on matters close to their hearts, whether it's faith, family values or questioning the mainstream narrative.

I know I am leaving countless people out, but this is what we need more of in the New Year: people stepping forward, refusing to stay silent, and arguing from principle and Judeo-Christian morality. The fact that we've had wave upon wave of these brave individuals tells me something powerful: America is waking up. People are tired of being told what to think, tired of being lied to, and they're ready to think for themselves.

MY WALK ACROSS AMERICA IS A LESSON IN GRATITUDE AND GIVING THANKSI don't mean to give the impression that I'm focusing just on celebrities here. Just this week I had the pleasure of having Wenyuan Wu joining our walk in Athens, Georgia, along with my friend and fellow pastor, Sean Seay. Wenyuan is the executive director of the Californians for Equal Rights Foundation (CFER) and she fights daily for equal rights, merit-based policies and parental rights for all Americans.

She came to this country as an immigrant, but as we walked together, I found myself marveling at how deeply American she is. She is a woman of God who believes with all her strength in the individual. And she has been speaking out for years. 

WHERE ADDICTS IN PHILADELPHIA BOW TO TRANQ, I SAW WHY GOD HASN'T GIVEN UP ON AMERICA YET

This, my friends, is where true freedom begins — in the mind. The power of individual thought is God's gift to each of us. He didn't create us as clones marching in lockstep. He made us unique, with the ability to reason, question and seek truth. Proverbs 23:7 reminds us, ""For as he thinks in his heart, so is he."" What you allow into your mind shapes your life, your choices and your destiny.

Too often, we're pressured to conform. If we don't, we're labeled racist or worse. Meanwhile, our nation declines, and so does the power of the individual. Aren't we then, in a sense, betraying the gift that God has bestowed upon us as Americans?

That is why, in this coming year, we cannot be afraid to stand apart from the norm. If your convictions — rooted in faith, common sense and personal experience — differ from the popular opinion, hold fast. That's not rebellion. That's responsibility.

I've seen this play out in small and big ways. If your friends turn their backs on you because you vote differently, or because you speak up for biblical truth, they were never true friends. Real relationships withstand honest differences. Stand up for what you want, what you believe, what God has called you to.

As I walk these roads, meeting Americans from all walks of life, I'm encouraged. People are hungry for authenticity. They're rejecting groupthink and embracing personal conviction.

This is the year to make it your resolution: Commit to thinking independently. Read widely, pray deeply, listen to opposing views — but decide for yourself based on truth and principle.

In 2026, let's make it the year of more and more of us standing up for what's right. God honors that kind of courage — the kind that built this nation and the kind that will restore it.

After all, God does extraordinary things through ordinary people who dare to use the minds He gave them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Ilhan Omar's obscure financial disclosures under scrutiny amid Minnesota fraud scandal","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/4364065/ilhan-omar-obscure-financial-disclosures-under-scrutiny/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has accused members of the media of lying about her net worth by misrepresenting congressional records. Omar, however, herself failed to follow congressional norms by not disclosing the value of her assets and potentially underrepresenting her husband's investment positions.

Omar's rapidly-acquired wealth has drawn renewed scrutiny amid reports about widespread fraud in the Somali community she helps represent in Congress. Her financial disclosure forms suggest she and her husband are worth at least $6 million and as much as $30 million, which has raised eyebrows because the couple said they were worth a maximum of $158,000 just two years ago. 

Omar's most recent financial disclosure shows that her husband has an ownership stake in a winery worth between $1 million and $5 million, as well as a stake in a venture capital firm valued between $5 million and $25 million. Media organizations have used this filing to produce reports claiming that Omar is worth up to $30 million, an assertion the congresswoman flatly denies.

A senior staffer from Omar's office previously told the Washington Examiner that the values on her disclosure form reflected the full value of the businesses rather than the value of her husband's individual shares in them. Omar has personally used this explanation to dismiss critics, calling her husband one of “several partners” in the two firms. 

California business records, however, show that Timothy Mynett, Omar's husband, is one of just two individuals named as a partner on the winery's statement of organization. The other is its CEO, former top Democratic operative William Hailer. 

While it's possible the winery has added more partners or diluted Mynett's stake since the winery was founded in 2020, it's impossible to know for certain because Omar hasn't disclosed how much her husband's share of the seven-figure venture is currently worth. 

But on paper, the winery business appears to have boomed, although not without some controversy. The value of the winery grew from up to $50,000 in 2023 to up to $5 million in Omar's most recent financial disclosures. Along the way, an investor reportedly accused Mynett and Hailer of failing to pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars they'd promised would materialize from the growth of the winery. 

And the value of Mynett's venture capital firm, Rose Lake Capital, seems to have exploded even more dramatically in the past two years. Omar said the firm was worth between $1 and $1,000 in 2023; by the following year, it was worth millions of dollars.

Omar's refusal to disclose the value of her husband's stakes in the winery and venture capital firm breaks with congressional norms. 

A Washington Examiner review of congressional financial disclosures shows that a number of Omar's colleagues in the House also have partial interests in privately held companies, either directly or through their spouses, and disclose the value of their stakes specifically rather than the ventures as a whole.

Even Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL), who is embroiled in several ethics scandals, managed to report the seven-figure value of his 49% stake in the security firm Pacem Solutions International. Reps. April McClain Delaney (D-MD), Bradley Schneider (D-IL), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), and Sara Jacobs (D-CA) all have partial stakes in private equity firms, hedge funds, and real estate ventures for which they provide specific valuation ranges.

Rose Lake Capital, the venture capital firm where Omar's husband is a partner, is also run by Hailer, signaling a close business relationship between the congresswoman's spouse and the wealthy former political operative. 

By not reporting the value of Mynett's stakes, Omar is effectively hiding the extent of her wealth from the public. 

Although Omar has not disclosed her net worth, the congresswoman has denied allegations that she became wealthy while in Congress, pointing out her student loan debt and noting that her husband's winery generated relatively little income in 2024. 

POLITICALLY CONNECTED SOMALI NONPROFIT GROUP PULLED IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS AFTER MISHANDLING MILLIONS

Omar has faced renewed scrutiny in the press amid reports of Minnesota's Somali community running a variety of fraud schemes in the state. Conservative critics have pointed out that the value of one of her husband's companies grew from under $1,000 in 2023 to over $5 million in 2024 amid widespread fraud in Minnesota. There is, however, no evidence that Omar profited from fraud or was involved in it in any way. 

The congresswoman, however, has stated that she does not regret sponsoring the MEALS Act of 2020, which was linked to the “Feeding Our Future” fraud scheme in Minnesota, where members of the state's Somali community defrauded the public for tens of millions of dollars. Some individuals implicated in the scheme made campaign contributions to Omar, who later gave the money to a variety of local nonprofit organizations “out of an abundance of caution.”

Omar's office did not return a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Texas antifa terrorism case: Confessions mount as Trump DOJ clinches more convictions","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3933620/texas-antifa-cell-terrorism-case-confessions-mount/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Guilty pleas are piling up in the first-known federal terrorism case in American history brought against antifa militants, as prosecutors continue to close in on more convictions.

A group of gun-wielding antifa radicals is accused of carrying out a July 4 terrorist attack on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Alvarado, Texas, about half an hour south of Fort Worth.

More than a dozen members of the heavily armed cohort — many of whom have already admitted guilt — allegedly lured law enforcement officers outside and opened fire on them from various vantage points. A local Alvarado police officer was shot in the neck by the black-clad assailants after he arrived on the scene to answer a call for help from the guards under attack at the Prairieland Detention Center.

Following the coordinated shooting, federal authorities filed a slew of terrorism-related charges against 16 codefendants believed to be cell operatives or associates of the Dallas-area antifa cell, including alleged accomplices who either helped hide suspects or tampered with evidence in the days after the attack.

TEXAS ANTIFA MEMBERS INDICTED ON TERRORISM CHARGES FOR ICE ATTACK: ‘FIRST TIME EVER'

Since then, nearly half of the codefendants have taken plea deals, admitting in exchange that they belong to a highly sophisticated antifa cell based in the Dallas area.

Here's where the case currently stands, as a slate of holdouts head to trial in January while the others who pleaded out await sentencing.

Two more admitted antifa associates pled guilty on Nov. 24, 2025, bringing the total number of convictions in the case to seven.

As part of the plea deals, Rebecca Morgan and Susan Elaine Kent acknowledged their affiliation with the Texas antifa cell and admitted to providing material support to terrorists by helping to hide the group's then-fugitive ringleader, Benjamin Hanil Song, who had fled into the woods near the ICE facility and needed to be ferried out of the area.

Morgan and Kent both admitted to joining a support network that mobilized to ensure Song's escape, which then triggered a multistate manhunt involving the FBI, after learning of the antifa cell's large-scale assassination attempt at the Alvarado detention center.

Morgan confessed to picking up Song in a “handoff” at a Home Depot parking lot in Dallas and supplying him with clothes, food, and shelter. She admittedly harbored Song at her apartment, the cell's designated hideout at the time, where she concealed him from law enforcement for approximately a week.

Kent admitted to working with others to make those lodging and transportation arrangements, including coordinating the pickup point at the Home Depot, to help Song abscond. The plan was to continually move Song around between safe houses.

An antifa blog post denouncing Kent's arrest said she was “actively” involved in the DFW Support Committee, a group raising funds for the Alvarado suspects on GiveSendGo. To date, the fundraising campaign has collected nearly $60,000 from anonymous donors to cover their legal defense fees.

Unlike their other codefendants, who had pleaded guilty before them, Morgan and Kent only confessed to assisting the cell, not being members. Kent, however, admitted that she is “aware of Antifa beliefs” and that “many members of the [Socialist Rifle Association], including co-defendants, consider themselves ‘antifascist.'”

One week prior, the Department of Justice secured guilty pleas from five other coconspirators.

Seth Edison Sikes, Joy Abigail Gibson, Lynette Read Sharp, Nathan Josiah Baumann, and John Phillip Thomas all entered guilty pleas on Nov. 19, 2025, to the same charge of providing material support to terrorists.

Sikes, Gibson, and Baumann were apprehended close to the scene of the shooting, found fleeing on foot with several others, while Thomas and Sharp were charged as “accessories after the fact.”

Pursuant to the plea agreements, the five codefendants admitted to aiding “acts of terrorism” and belonging to the Dallas-area antifa cell that ambushed the Alvarado facility, marking the first time in U.S. history that antifa ideologues have openly admitted in criminal court to being part of an organized antifa branch.

During the plea process, the defendants accepted a set of stipulated, or undisputed, facts of the case. Throughout these admission statements, the codefendants divulged in great detail antifa's organizational framework, tactical strategies, and operational objectives.

“Antifa is a militant enterprise that advocates insurrection and violence to affect the policy and conduct of the U.S. government by intimidation and coercion,” said Baumann's stipulated facts, which he signed in agreement.

“In line with his Antifa ideology, on or about July 3 and July 4, Baumann, along with others, participated in the planning of the ‘direct action' against Prairieland set for the night of July 4.”

In a similar summary of stipulated facts, Sikes acknowledged that antifa organizes in “cells or ‘affinity groups' around their beliefs.”

They prepared for the surprise attack on the Alvarado compound by conducting reconnaissance; donning “black bloc,” antifa's universal uniform, to shroud their identities; and coordinating over Signal, an encrypted messaging application, according to a summary of events that Gibson agreed is true.

Sharp and Thomas admittedly assisted Song, the cell's at-large leader who was wanted by the FBI for over a week and had made the Texas Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list, in the aftermath of the attack. Thomas was the one who drove Song to the Home Depot parking lot while Sharp provided a change of clothes for him, face coverings, and a wig to wear.

Their confessions, which laid bare antifa's modus operandi, undercut claims propagated by the political Left that antifa is a leaderless movement lacking organizational structure, on-the-ground operations, and an identifiable member base.

The guilty pleas, as well as their accompanying admissions, could accordingly bring about broader implications for antifa's forces.

Extremism watchdogs envision that the case will help debunk the myth that antifa is simply an idea, signaling a turning point in the national discourse over antifa's existence. Never before, in recent memory, have antifa operatives confessed to their membership in the court record, let alone unmasked other associates.

Capital Research Center president Scott Walter said their admissions “should destroy the lie that antifa doesn't exist as organized groups.”

CONFESSIONS FROM TEXAS ANTIFA CELL OPERATIVES COULD PULL BACK CURTAIN

“This is an unprecedented case,” Walter previously told the Washington Examiner. “They have gone on the record, saying, ‘Here's how we operated. Here are the other people I was working with. Here's the person I was helping to hide out.'”

Sikes, Gibson, Sharp, Baumann, and Thomas, like Morgan and Kent, each face up to 15 years in federal prison, instead of the decades they could have spent behind bars had they been convicted at trial. Their sentencing is scheduled for March 2026.

On Nov. 26, 2025, nine recently indicted codefendants tied to the Alvarado shooting pleaded not guilty at their federal arraignments in Fort Worth. Among them are Song, Zachary Jared Evetts, Savanna Sue Batten, Maricela Rueda, Elizabeth Andrea Soto, Ines Houston Soto, Daniel Rolando Sanchez-Estrada, and two transgender co-defendants, Cameron James Arnold, also known as “Autumn Hill,” and Bradford Winston Morris, alias “Meagan Elizabeth.”

They stand accused of federal crimes ranging from rioting to attempted murder of federal officers. Their jury trial is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 20, 2026. If convicted on all counts, the nine suspects could spend life in prison.

Sanchez-Estrada, a Mexican national and the husband of Rueda, is being held separately at the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth.

According to ICE, Sanchez-Estrada was given a green card under the Biden administration in 2024.

Sanchez-Estrada originally gained temporary protection from deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era policy that protected illegal immigrants who entered the country as children.

Many of the codefendants face state charges as well in Texas, with offenses including organized crime, obstruction of justice, terrorism, and smuggling of persons. The seven who pleaded guilty in their federal case are still awaiting state-level criminal proceedings.

ANTIFA INC: HOW AN IDEOLOGY BECAME AN ORGANIZED CRIMINAL NETWORK

Two other state defendants, though they were not federally charged, are being prosecuted by the Johnson County District Attorney's Office in connection with the case.

Janette Goering, codename “Anarchy Marie,” faces charges of aiding in the commission of terrorism, a state felony. She allegedly provided Song with a Faraday bag, a device blocking electromagnetic signals, to prevent police from tracking his phone.

Dario Emmanuel Sanchez, a teacher in the Dallas Independent School District, was indicted in August 2025 by a Texas grand jury on tampering charges for allegedly deleting texts from Signal and Discord showing the cell's attack plans.

Sanchez was bailed out of Johnson County Jail soon after; however, he was re-arrested days later on suspicion of hindering the prosecution of terrorism and then bailed out again on a reduced bond, lowered from $1 million to $150,000.

ANTIFA TRACKER: THE FAR-LEFT ACTIVISTS WHO FACE FEDERAL CHARGES UNDER TRUMP'S DOJ

The federal terrorism case came after President Donald Trump designated antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, directing all appropriate agencies to “investigate, disrupt, and dismantle” criminal networks operating under the banner of antifa, including taking prosecutorial action against antifa's financial backers.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The best way to improve yourself is to help others too.

Nowadays, having a New Year's resolution can seem almost quaint. Social-media influencers push self-improvement trends year-round: The spring has “glow up” challenges, as does the summer. Soon after, the high-discipline “Great Lock-In Challenge” and “Winter Arc” videos begin, many of them urging people to get ahead of the “new year, new me” crowd. Or you can attempt a slew of other self-betterment regimens, whenever the spirit calls. Many of these videos depict people minimizing distractions—such as, say, other people—to bicep-curl and matcha-drink their way to becoming “unrecognizable,” mentally and physically, as some YouTubers put it. At the same time, many Americans appear to be losing interest in New Year's resolutions. One report from the social-media analytic company Brandwatch found that, in the days around January 1, mentions of resolutions fell 50 percent last holiday season when compared with the year prior. To put it plainly: Many people are now always trying to hustle their way to a better self, no matter the month or season.

In one sense, detaching goal setting from the start of the Gregorian calendar is reasonable—one can, of course, choose to begin afresh at any moment. But by letting New Year's resolutions go, Americans may be losing something: a distinctly communal ritual that can remind people of how entangled their well-being is with that of others.

New Year's hasn't always been so associated with accomplishing personal goals. Humans have a long history of using the holiday to think about how to make life better for their community. Versions of resolutions have existed for about 4,000 years; in Babylonia and ancient Rome, people prayed together, paid off their debts, and made promises of good conduct to their gods. The rituals were usually framed as religious events supporting the broader group, and were tied to agricultural calendars. (“Permit my harvests, my grain, my vineyards, and my plantations to flourish,” some ancient Romans were counseled to ask of Janus, the god of transitions and beginnings, “and give good health and strength to me, my house, and my household.”) Even in the more recent past, in the United States, many people's resolutions focused on learning how to live well with others. The most popular resolution in the U.S. in 1947 was, according to a Gallup poll, to “improve my disposition, be more understanding, control my temper.” Last year, by contrast, Americans' resolutions were primarily related to exercise, health, or diet.

Americans may no longer share a schedule dictated by the agricultural calendar, but a sense of community doesn't need to disappear. New Year's can be an opportunity to gather with loved ones and set resolutions together. Maybe everyone meets in person; maybe over Zoom. Maybe the group sets one big, collaborative goal—Let's start a community garden, for instance, or Let's take turns cooking meals for one another at home. Maybe everyone picks a different resolution, and the group brainstorms how to best help each person achieve it. And ideally, the goals aren't self-serving—but considerate of the people around them.

Making a resolution with other people might actually be more effective than flying solo. Habits are unconscious patterns that can be hard to shake, and seeing someone in our environment engaging in a certain behavior can nudge us to do it too, Tim Kurz, a psychology professor at the University of Western Australia, told me. This permeability can have its downsides—your sister's Is It Cake? binge-watching in the living room could cue you to watch even more Netflix. But it can also be a great boon: As work piles up, for example, you might forget about your resolution to check in on older family members. If you have set this intention as a household, though, you might see your partner buying groceries for their grandmother, which in turn might remind you to call grandma too.

Shared resolutions can support intention setting in another way: They may help people avoid what social psychologists call “do-gooder derogation”—a quirk of psychology in which humans tend to “find people who are more moralistic than us and are behaving more virtuously than us really annoying,” Kurz said. He gave me this example: Say you've recently resolved to ride your bike to work instead of driving, for environmental reasons. Your family, already buckled into the SUV, might feel their virtue threatened and decide to poke fun at you. Look at this guy! Have fun biking in the rain, Goody Two-shoes! If you set goals as a family, however, your relatives—who under other circumstances might be psychologically motivated to subvert your resolutions—may become more committed to helping you follow through.

In the long run, resolutions that keep others in mind tend to have greater staying power. Studies have found that brute willpower alone lasts for only so long, and that people have a much harder time accessing willpower when stressed. This might help explain why a more individual New Year's goal, such as losing 10 pounds by swearing off ice cream, may be more likely to fizzle. “If you fail in your quest, then the only person you have ‘let down' is yourself,” Kurz said. Evolutionarily speaking, people might not even be built to set self-serving goals. What helped our human ancestors succeed were likely “strong social bonds,” the psychologist David Desteno wrote in a New York Times article about resolutions, “relationships that would encourage people to cooperate and lend support to one another.”

Of course, shared resolutions aren't a magic pill for behavioral change. Humans can famously be both top-notch accountability partners and rampant enablers. When picking whom to make goals with, “be careful about who that person is,” Kurz told me. “You don't want to strategically choose the person who you know is a total flake.” You might have resolved with your work bestie to quit overdoing the happy-hour piña coladas so that you can better participate in your team's conversations; if your pal capsizes on your shared goal first, though, their decision could lead to a cycle of “collective rationalization,” in which you feel okay quitting too, Kurz told me. Hell, why not get another round?

Still, communal resolutions can serve as a good reminder of how profoundly interconnected humans are. And they can push people to widen their definition of self-improvement. In a recent interview, the Potawatomi botanist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer described the concept of “expanded self-interest”—the idea that the “self” can include all of life. “My well-being is the same as my family's well-being,” she explained, and “my family's well-being is the same as the well-being of the land that feeds us.” Bicep curls and matcha lattes, then, may get us only so far on the path to flourishing. The trick to helping ourselves might just be to focus on the communal first.

Cuts to research may have spoiled the country's appetite for bold exploration.

For all of the political chaos that American science endured in 2025, aspects of this country's research enterprise made it through somewhat … okay. The Trump administration terminated billions of dollars in research grants; judges intervened to help reinstate thousands of those contracts. The administration threatened to cut funding to a number of universities; several have struck deals that preserved that money. After the White House proposed slashing the National Institutes of Health's $48 billion budget, Congress pledged to maintain it. And although some researchers have left the country, far more have remained. Despite these disruptions, many researchers will also remember 2025 as the year when personalized gene therapy helped treat a six-month-old baby, or when the Vera C. Rubin Observatory released its first glimpse of the star-studded night sky.



Science did lose out this year, though, in ways that researchers are still struggling to tabulate. Some of those losses are straightforward: Since the beginning of 2025, “all, or nearly all, federal agencies that supported research in some way have decreased the size of their research footprint,” Scott Delaney, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the federal funding cuts to science, told me. Less funding means less science can be done and fewer discoveries will be made. The deeper cut may be to the trust researchers had in the federal government as a stable partner in the pursuit of knowledge. This means the country's appetite for bold exploration, which the compact between science and government supported for decades, may be gone, too—leaving in its place more timid, short-term thinking.



In an email, Andrew Nixon, the deputy assistant secretary for media relations at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH, disputed that assertion, writing, “The Biden administration politicized NIH funding through DEI-driven agendas; this administration is restoring rigor, merit, and public trust by prioritizing evidence-based research with real health impact while continuing to support early-career scientists.”



Science has always required creativity—people asking and pursuing questions in ways that have never been attempted before, in the hope that some of that work might produce something new. At its most dramatic, the results can be transformative: In the early 1900s, the Wright brothers drew inspiration from birds' flight mechanics to launch their first airplanes; more recently, scientists have found ways to genetically engineer a person's own immune cells to kill off cancer. Even in more routine discoveries, nothing quite matches the excitement of being the first to capture a piece of reality. I remember, as a graduate student, cloning my first bacterial mutant while trying to understand a gene important for growth. I knew that the microscopic creature I had built would never yield a drug or save a life. But in the brief moment in which I plucked a colony from an agar plate and swirled it into a warm, sugar-rich broth, I held a form of life that had never existed before—and that I had made in pursuit of a question that, as far as I knew, no one else had asked.



Pursuing scientific creativity can be resource intensive, requiring large teams of researchers to spend millions of dollars across decades to investigate complex questions. Up until very recently, the federal government was eager to underwrite that process. Since the end of the Second World War, it has poured money into basic research, establishing a kind of social contract with scientists, of funds in exchange for innovation. Support from the government “allowed the free play of scientific genius,” Nancy Tomes, a historian of medicine at Stony Brook University, told me.



The investment has paid dividends. One oft-cited statistic puts the success of scientific funding in economic terms: Every dollar invested in research and development in the United States is estimated to return at least $5. Another points to the fact that more than 99 percent of the drugs approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2019 were at least partly supported by NIH funds. These things are true—but they also obscure the years or even decades of meandering and experimentation that scientists must take to reach those results. CRISPR gene-editing technology began as basic research into the structure of bacterial genomes; the discovery of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs depended on scientists in the late '70s and '80s tinkering with fish cells. The Trump administration has defunded research with more obvious near-term goals—work on mRNA vaccines to combat the next flu pandemic, for instance—but also science that expands knowledge that we don't yet have an application for (if one even exists). It has also proposed major cuts to NASA that could doom an already troubled mission to return brand-new mineral samples from the surface of Mars, which might have told us more about life in this universe, or nothing much at all.



Outside of the most obvious effects of grant terminations—salary cuts, forced layoffs, halted studies—the Trump administration's attacks on science have limited the horizons that scientists in the U.S. are looking toward. The administration has made clear that it no longer intends to sponsor research into certain subjects, including transgender health and HIV. Even researchers who haven't had grants terminated this year or who work on less politically volatile subjects are struggling to conceptualize their scientific futures, as canceled grant-review meetings and lists of banned words hamper the normal review process. The NIH is also switching up its funding model to one that will decrease the number of scientific projects and people it will bankroll. Many scientists are hesitant to hire more staff or start new projects that rely on expensive materials. Some have started to seek funds from pharmaceutical companies or foundations, which tend to offer smaller and shorter-term agreements, trained more closely on projects with potential profit.



All of this nudges scientists into a defensive posture. They're compressing the size of their studies or dropping the most ambitious aspects of their projects. Collaborations between research groups have broken down too, as some scientists who have been relatively insulated from the administration's cuts have terminated their partnerships with defunded scientists—including at Harvard, where Delaney worked as a research scientist until September—to protect their own interests. “The human thing to do is to look inward and to kind of take care of yourself first,” Delaney told me. Instability and fear have made the research system, already sometimes prone to siloing, even more fragmented. The administration “took two of the best assets that the U.S. scientific enterprise has—the capacity to think long, and the capacity to collaborate—and we screwed them up at the same time,” Delaney said. Several scientists told me that the current funding environment has prompted them to consider early retirement—in many cases, shutting down the labs they have run for decades.

 Some of the experiments that scientists shelved this year could still be done at later dates. But the new instability of American science may also be driving away the people necessary to power that future work. Several universities have been forced to downsize Ph.D. programs; the Trump administration's anti-immigration policies have made many international researchers fearful of their status at universities. And as the administration continues to dismiss the importance of DEI programs, many young scientists from diverse backgrounds have told me they're questioning whether they will be welcomed into academia. Under the Trump administration, the scope of American science is simply smaller: “When you shrink funding, you're going to increase conservatism,” C. Brandon Ogbunu, a computational biologist at Yale University, told me. Competition and scarcity can breed innovation in science. But often, Ogbunu said, people forget that “comfort and security are key parts of innovation, too.”

Americans' feelings about artificial intelligence are complicated.

A widely despised industry is slurping up Americans' water — and driving up their electricity bills — as part of a nefarious plot to take their jobs. Voters are begging for their political leaders to take a stand against these accursed corporations. Yet the Democratic Party can't decide whose side it's on.

Or so some Democratic operatives and commentators suggest.

This week, Politico published a report titled, “Americans hate AI. Which party will benefit?” In it, a diverse array of Democratic lawmakers and political professionals call on their party to be, in Politico's words, “proudly, loudly, without reservations, anti-AI.”

Their case is simple: AI development is deeply unpopular. Voters are alarmed by the data center construction spree, fearing that it's driving up energy costs and despoiling the environment. And they're worried that AI is going to put them out of work.

The Trump administration is too wedded to the tech industry to speak to this anti-chatbot fervor, the operatives reason. Democrats therefore have an opportunity to claim ownership of a winning issue — one that unites a broad, populist coalition of both blue-collar and white-collar workers.

To effectively do so, however, it's not enough to “minimally regulate” artificial intelligence while signaling a “a friendly stance toward tech companies building AI.” Rather, the party must define itself in opposition to the technology itself.

This may prove to be sound political advice. But it is nonetheless premised on a skewed reading of public opinion data. In reality, Americans' feelings toward AI are more complicated than progressive consultants and pundits tend to suggest.

There is no question that US voters are anxious about AI in general and increasingly of the data center buildout in particular. To name a few recent poll results that illustrate this unease:

As one would expect in light of these figures, Americans support the general concept of more heavily regulating the AI industry:

All this said, Americans don't seem to feel “hate” for AI, so much as unease and ambivalence about it.

In a recent poll from the Democratic data firm Blue Rose Research, 40.1 percent said they were “optimistic” about artificial intelligence compared to just 35.6 percent who said they were pessimistic (with the rest unsure).

A December survey from the left-leaning pollster Navigator produced similar results, with 49 percent of voters saying they had a favorable view of AI, while only 41 percent said they had an unfavorable one.

Meanwhile, in Gallup's polling, 79 percent of Americans say that it is “important” for the United States to have the world's most advanced AI technology, while 56 percent favored increasing government spending on artificial intelligence research. It is hard to see how a political party could be anti-AI “without reservations,” while still advancing these preferences.

In any case, for the moment, AI still isn't a top concern for the typical American. This month, an Associated Press-Norc poll asked voters to name five problems they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026 — only 3 percent mentioned anything to do with technology, AI, or social media.

Likewise, in Navigator's survey, only 7 percent of voters named AI as a top-five issue. Meanwhile, 75 percent of voters said they had heard “little” or “nothing” about new data centers being built in their communities.

Notably, some surveys cited by anti-AI populists are actually consistent with these findings. Politico's piece referenced a Pew study showing that “only 17 percent of Americans think AI will have a positive impact on the US over the next 20 years.” The liberal commentator Josh Marshall cast this as evidence that “AI is running only slightly ahead of child molesters in the public imagination.”

Yet in Pew's poll, only 35 percent said that AI would have a negative impact on the United States. In other words, two-thirds of the public said the technology would have either positive or neutral implications for American life. The share of voters who would say the same about child molesters is, presumably, quite a bit lower.

Democrats might still be wise to take a more adversarial posture toward AI. Voters are worried about the technology and support greater regulation of it. And they are increasingly sympathetic to the argument that data centers are driving up their electric bills.

Further, the public could plausibly become more opposed to artificial intelligence in the near future. If overinvestment in data centers triggers a financial crash — and/or, if AI actually generates mass unemployment — backlash to the technology would surely grow.

For the moment, however, it's far from clear that either party can dramatically increase its popular support by declaring itself, unreservedly, “anti-AI.”

Disaster capitalism isn't theoretical anymore.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

Every year at the Oscars, attendees leave with gift bags so elaborate they have to be reported as income to the IRS. Luxury skincare, personal training sessions, designer apples that never brown, and extravagant trips are standard issue. But in 2025, Academy Award guests also received a grimmer gift: a yearlong subscription to a white-glove disaster recovery service called Bright Harbor, which has grown popular in the wake of the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles last January.

If your house is destroyed in a fire or flood, the basic logistics of righting your upturned life understandably consume your full attention, even if you're a movie star. Under this level of stress, navigating the Federal Emergency Management Agency's byzantine requirements for recovery assistance quickly becomes “a full-time job,” according to Bright Harbor's chief growth officer, Emily Bush. “We help you understand what your options are and what's the cost associated with each option that you take.”

Do you stay and rebuild? Does it make more sense to just move? Bright Harbor helps clients freeze their mortgage payments, apply for FEMA aid, navigate seemingly endless paperwork, and secure low-interest small business loans. Bush acknowledged that the company's luxury services, which can significantly ease the financial burden of disasters, do not come at a cost that all victims can afford to front. (Services started at $300 per month for individuals when the company launched in 2024, but Bright Harbor now sells directly to companies — who purchase coverage for their employees.)

“To be clear,” she said, “I think the government should pay for this.”

It technically does. FEMA money is funneled to disaster relief nonprofits that then hire case managers to guide victims through the recovery process. But even before President Donald Trump took office with an eye toward diminishing the agency, recovery funds couldn't keep up with victims' needs. Now, as the administration slashes FEMA funding, withholds aid, and puts more of the onus of recovery onto individual states, victim-assistance organizations feel that they've been left totally unprepared, with too few case managers to go around. All of these issues are likely to grow more severe in the coming year, as a review board appointed to reform the agency prepares to make its recommendations.

That a service like Bright Harbor found a strong foothold in the US is not surprising. The private sector's creeping influence over disaster recovery has been noted since at least 2007, when Naomi Klein published The Shock Doctrine, the book that injected the term “disaster capitalism” into a broader lexicon. But as climate change accelerates and hammers the United States with more billion-dollar catastrophes than ever before, privatization has become more common — and complicated. Private interests can quickly mobilize huge volunteer networks, giving campaigns, and rebuilding efforts in the wake of extreme weather. But, whatever their intentions, such measures are a consequence — and sometimes a cause — of the corrosion of public institutions originally intended to safeguard Americans.

For Klein, Hurricane Katrina was a turning point for disaster capitalism. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that would go on to draft Trump's Project 2025 policies, held a meeting on disaster relief in New Orleans just two weeks after the storm in 2005. The group recommended suspending wage laws for recovery contractors, replacing public schools with privately managed charter schools, and halting environmental regulations to reestablish oil and gas production that had been stalled by the storm.

The vision they set forth would shape disaster recovery for decades. In New Orleans, public housing was demolished, the public hospital was shuttered, and the federal government rapidly took over the public school system and set about turning it over to a charter network funded largely through private philanthropy. Over 7,000 teachers and staff members were fired, forcing veteran educators to reapply for their jobs, competing against a flood of Teach for America recruits who were largely whiter, less experienced, and from outside the city.

Many residents saw this as a mercenary response to the storm, made possible by decades of disinvestment in city services, but they weren't unilaterally opposed to the charter system. “I think it's important to avoid romanticizing the system pre-Katrina,” said Jesse Chanin, a professor of sociology at Tulane University and the author of Building Power, Breaking Power: The United Teachers of New Orleans, 1965-2008. Before Katrina, the school district was so underfunded that teachers didn't have enough books and desks for their students. “A teacher told me the other day, ‘Once, I was walking and my foot just went right through the floor,'” said Chanin. The high school graduation rate hovered around 50 percent, truancy was rampant, and corruption was so widespread that the FBI had set up an office within the New Orleans Parish school board.

But while the charter network was an improvement in many ways — private philanthropy poured money into the new schools and test scores and graduation rates markedly improved — it was also marked by instability. The system ran on a portfolio model: Schools that performed well received increased funding, while schools that struggled were shuttered, their students transferred elsewhere. Because there was such a strong incentive to keep test scores up, struggling students were often pushed out of the best schools into charters that would quickly fold. Such measures, and specifically a lawsuit alleging that the schools were not providing adequate special education services, led the federal government to monitor the city's charter schools for the past 15 years.

The fact that the charter schools are so siloed — some belong to larger networks, while others operate as one-off schools — has also undermined the strength of the teachers' union. Critics say that all of this has allowed charter schools to pay employees poorly, eliminate transparency, and provide uneven and inequitable education in exchange for moderately improved test scores. “I think it's really hard to attribute test score success to the model of charter schools and not to the incredible influx of money and resources into the district,” Chanin said. But Chanin added that undoing the charter system and starting from scratch might not be the answer, either. The city opened its first district-run public school since the storm, and it's already facing serious challenges.

Schools weren't the only service that succumbed to the shock doctrine in post-Katrina New Orleans. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shut public housing residents out of their buildings shortly after the storm. Protests erupted, but pleas for help fell on deaf ears. “Many of the powerful players were basically announcing that this [was] the silver lining,” said John Arena, a professor of sociology at the College of Staten Island who was a housing activist in New Orleans at the time. “This is a horrible opportunity to do things that we couldn't do under normal conditions.” Seventy percent of public housing was ultimately destroyed and replaced with mixed-income developments built by private developers. Reports estimate that roughly half of public housing residents were permanently displaced in the wake of Katrina.

“'Recovery' has become kind of a misnomer,” said Luis Miron, the former director of Loyola University's Institute for Quality and Equity in Public Education. “People still haven't recovered.”

More than 20 years later and 2,000 miles away, disaster capitalism is picking up steam in Puerto Rico. In September, Gov. Jenniffer González Colón held a press conference announcing a new law that would allow more residents of the archipelago to obtain property titles to their homes. Land in Puerto Rico is often passed down through individual families without any formal documentation. This caused a crisis after Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, as many residents couldn't prove they owned the land they'd lived on for years, and therefore could not collect disaster relief funds.

But in the middle of the press conference, the lights abruptly went out.

Puerto Rico's electrical grid was in bad shape before Maria, but blackouts have become routine in the years since the storm. Maria hit Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 miles per hour, destroying the archipelago's power grid, knocking out power for 80 percent of residents, and setting off the largest blackout in United States history.

For many, it took nearly a year for power to be restored. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) declared bankruptcy and became the subject of a federal investigation after it was revealed that the utility operator had handed a $300 million contract to rebuild the grid over to a tiny, two-person Montana-based company called Whitefish Energy, which had little experience and close ties to Trump's secretary of the Department of the Interior at the time, Ryan Zinke. PREPA was later embroiled in a number of bribery scandals, plus instances in which it extorted customers in exchange for reconnecting them to power after Maria and bought low-quality oil while charging ratepayers high-quality oil prices for roughly three decades. Given the internal drama at PREPA, it wasn't difficult for authorities to make the case that privatization was the only way to modernize the grid.

“I call it the predator economy,” said Carmen Yulín Cruz, the former mayor of San Juan. “My grandmother used to say, ‘When people are so desperate, they will drink sand if someone markets it the right way.'” In 2021, then-Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced that the transmission and distribution of electricity, along with the reconstruction of the grid, would be handed off to a company called Luma — a Canadian-American company that has thus far failed to fulfill its promises to deliver reliable electricity. Blackouts and power surges (which often destroy electrical devices) are common.

The result is that Puerto Rico has become “generator island,” said Gustavo García-López, an assistant researcher at the Center for Social Studies at the University of Coimbra. “The pollution levels of generators are really high — not only air pollution, which is the main concern, but also noise. I remember after Maria, living in the city with the generators around, the smell and the noise that they make is really unbearable, especially at night.” And even though the grid is often nonfunctional, residents' power bills have nearly doubled since the storm. The change was sold “under the auspices of ‘if it's private, it's better,'” said Cruz. “But, my god — LUMA could not suck more if they tried.”

Luma took control with a vow to decentralize the grid and incorporate more renewable energy, keeping generation in line with Puerto Rico's 2019 Energy Policy Act, which set a goal of 40 percent renewables by 2025. But as of late 2024, fossil fuels still generated 93 percent of the archipelago's energy. Luma has argued that it inherited a crumbling grid and a power supply that's insufficient to meet customer demand. The territory's power plants are managed by Genera Energy, a subsidiary of the troubled New Fortress Energy, a natural gas company that critics say has kept the territory dependent on fossil fuels at the expense of reliability. According to PREPA's most recent fiscal plan, performance has grown steadily worse over the past few years, with customers seeing approximately 15 percent more service interruptions and 21 percent longer outages in December 2024 compared to March 2023.

As in New Orleans, Puerto Rico was vulnerable to these tactics because of years of disinvestment. In June 2016, former President Barack Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight and Management Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which would essentially lead the territory through a court-supervised bankruptcy process. Eight years later, Puerto Rico is still primarily controlled by the unelected financial oversight board established by PROMESA. The board handed many assets over to private interests after the hurricane. Charter schools, previously shut out of Puerto Rico, began to make inroads; the water system was nearly privatized; and toll roads were sold off to multinational corporations like Goldman Sachs.

“There's a debt crisis, so there's no public funds to fix anything,” said Marisol Lebron, an associate professor at the University of California Santa Cruz, and the author of Aftershocks of Disaster: Puerto Rico Before and After the Storm. “Puerto Ricans are left holding the bag in a lot of ways, for both the failures of the state, but also the failures of these private entities that are claiming to be able to do the job better and cheaper than the government.”

But even privatization has its limits. While major cities and territories are lucrative targets for private interests, disasters often devastate remote regions, where asset values are low and labor is hard to come by. “For small towns, the private sector is not going to step in if it's not a money-making business,” said Divya Chandrasekhar, a professor of city and metropolitan planning at the University of Utah, adding that depopulating areas in particular struggle to attract private investment. In remote parts of California, for instance, an alarming firefighting staffing crisis has left many small towns without adequate protection. Offers of private firefighting services — hired by insurance companies to protect their assets, or the very wealthy to protect their property — have risen accordingly. Critics, including city and state firefighters, have called for the regulation of these private services, arguing that they can hamper rescue efforts and pull badly needed water from public hydrants. During the Los Angeles fires in January, billionaire Rick Caruso hired a private company to protect the Palisades Village mall, which he owns, while nearby homes burned.

While climate change is poised to exacerbate familiar inequities like these, experts point to the opacity of privatized public services as a cause for growing concern. As more companies begin to incorporate artificial intelligence into their daily operations, it's important for municipalities to look very carefully at the restrictions being placed on contractors and public-private partnerships.

“You can imagine a situation where a community has been impacted by a natural disaster. We're going to give temporary housing to people, but this AI system is going to make the determination whether they qualify for this or not. I mean, that could be really problematic,” said Shahrzad Habibi, the research and policy director at In the Public Interest, a nonprofit that studies public goods and services. “I just think there's an interesting philosophical underpinning on all of this. What are public goods? What do we, as a society, think everybody should be entitled to? And when do we, as a society, think you're on your own?”

﻿Conservatives want more parents at home. Here's how to do it.

• Conservative policymakers say they want more parents to stay home with their children, but it's not clear that approaches like baby bonuses or bigger child tax will work.

• One possibility is to pay lower-income parents to stay home, potentially by pairing a national paid parental leave program with no-strings-attached cash allowance for new parents. Such a policy would also help to address infant care shortages.

• The focus of any plan to pay parents to stay home should be on providing a choice, not incentivizing one option or the other.

MAGA thinks the country needs more stay-at-home parents, especially mothers. The goal isn't just to boost plummeting birth rates, but to help children and families with policies that are more family-focused than work-focused. “It's not just about increasing the total number of children,” Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told the New York Times. “It is increasing the number of families, mothers and fathers, and the ability of the family to spend time together.”

Over the past several months, Republican lawmakers and conservative thinkers have offered a number of bills and ideas to help more parents stay home with kids. But as Vox journalist Anna North noted, none are likely to trigger a stampede of moms from cubicles to kitchens. When North asked whether baby bonuses or heftier child tax credits could persuade women to give up the benefits gained through decades of paid work, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Claudia Goldin deadpanned: “Are we giving them a million dollars?”

Still, conservatives need not give up the dream. If they want more parents at home, the most effective way may be to focus their efforts and pay on low-wage parents.

My reporting on families has pointed repeatedly to this group of parents as one especially willing to reduce paid work to spend more time with their children, if given the chance, and for whom a little investment could go a long way. Such investment could help address the child care shortage, bolster child development, and create more family-friendly workplaces and more vibrant neighborhoods.

Of course, there is one very obvious hurdle to this idea: Historically, poor parents — and especially single mothers of color — are the group that US lawmakers have been most eager to see working for pay.

“There are a lot of folks who pay lip service to believing moms should be home with their kids, but don't seem to think that applies to people with very low income,” said Elizabeth Lower-Basch, formerly of the Center for Law and Social Policy and an expert on public benefits.

Take cash assistance for low-income parents. For decades, the so-called mothers' pensions were available primarily to white widowed and abandoned moms. Caseworkers routinely discriminated against Black and other nonwhite mothers, often presuming they should work while the white moms shouldn't. After the civil rights movement made welfare available to all parents who needed it, lawmakers quickly imposed stringent work requirements and time limits on parents seeking financial help. Even in proudly progressive cities like New York, mothers were routinely pushed to take the first job they found, regardless of how long the commute, how late the hours, or how low the pay.

While the Clinton-era reform succeeded in forcing new moms into paid work, their babies and toddlers suffered. In one study, mothers who were pushed into work showed “significant and substantial negative effects on… provision of emotional support” toward their young children when compared to similar mothers in states that had not yet implemented the reform. Another study found that, among young children of welfare-eligible mothers, a mother's employment led to the child spending less quality time with parents. Children of these working moms were also less likely to be read to, and had more behavioral issues, such as needing constant attention or struggling to fall asleep, as reported by their mothers.

Chris Herbst — an economist at the University of Arizona who conducted the second study — told me that the problem wasn't that the mothers worked. Most research shows that women's work has no impact on young children's child development, he said.

Herbst attributes the welfare studies' findings to three factors:

But perhaps the most insidious legacy of welfare reform was ideological. The rules allowed a mother to meet her work requirements by caring for other people's children for pay, but not for caring for her own. It defined parental responsibility solely in terms of financial support, presuming that parenting itself is not labor, Emily Callaci, historian and author of Wages for Housework: The Story of a Movement, an Idea, a Promise, said.

Callaci sounded alternately skeptical and cautiously optimistic when we spoke about the new conservative-leaning thinkers who are challenging this legacy by arguing that parenting itself is crucial to the entire economy — some referring jokingly to their own kids as “future taxpayers.”

While there are certainly some conservatives who hope to leverage this framing to undo the myriad advances women have made in the workplace, others seem genuinely interested in rewarding and recognizing unpaid caretaking. They understand that high-quality child care is expensive, that low-quality child care can harm, and that the first year of life is a singularly fragile developmental window when many parents who would like to stay home with their children cannot afford to.

Were conservatives to focus their efforts on low-earning parents, it could pay off big.

Poor mothers — and especially those with minimal education, for whom work may be more exploitative than empowering — may be the parents most likely to reduce hours to care for a baby if given more money. And helping low-income parents work less, including single mothers, could alleviate the shortage of infant care, which is especially pronounced in poorer neighborhoods. This could also allow mothers to wait for jobs — and child care — with the hours, location, and set-up that works for their families.

Radical as this might sound to Americans, giving parents of all incomes this kind of breathing room during their children's first few months has plenty of precedent.

Lower-Basch told me that this is exactly what parents do in states that waive work requirements for new parents. “It's not necessarily that the parents don't go back to work within the year, but it lets them hold out for a job that fits better with being the parent of a newborn,” she said.

That, in turn, could prompt employers to compete for workers by creating more family-friendly work environments. Under-resourced neighborhoods, meanwhile, might benefit from having more parents to, say, keep an eye on children as they make their way to and from the school. For example, Wendy Mamola, a parent leader at Raising Illinois and mother of four, began volunteering in her older children's school and at a family advocacy organization after taking time away from restaurant work following the birth of her twins. This allowed her “to not only be there for [her own kids], but to advocate for everybody's babies.”

Radical as this might sound to Americans, giving parents of all incomes this kind of breathing room during their children's first few months has plenty of precedent. Most developed countries offer child allowances along with paid parental leave to care for new family members. Some policies allot more money or time off for single parents, and have floors for how little a parent can get paid when pausing work to care for a baby.

But in the United States, receiving money to stay home with a baby is an option typically available only for wealthier parents with jobs that offer paid parental leave. And while a handful of states do offer paid parental leave programs, they often haven't worked well for poor families. In California, for instance, the wage replacement given to new parents taking leave was not enough for many low-earning parents to take time off to care for their newborns. This meant these families paid into the program, but then couldn't afford to use it, Lower-Bash said in an email. (California has since upped the amount it gives parents on leave.)

A handful of innovative programs designed specifically for poor families have failed to gain traction. In the early days of welfare reform, Montana and Minnesota experimented with paying welfare-eligible mothers to stay home — disbursing to parents about the same amount that would have otherwise gone towards subsidizing their child care.

In its first few years, Minnesota's program served hundreds of families, but neither of the programs ever found reliable funding. Similar programs for low-income parents have been proposed by both Democrats and Republicans in the years since, but have also faltered in large part because policymakers have trouble categorizing them, Joshua McCabe, director of social policy at the Niskanen Center, said in an email: “It's not quite child care, not quite paid parental leave, and not quite welfare so doesn't have a strong set of champions relative to the more established groups pushing for these other policies.”

So what kind of program would rally support?

Most experts I spoke with recommend offering parents a program that neither incentivizes nor discourages working out of the home, but lets parents choose.

Many suggested that a national paid parental leave program — with a floor specifying a minimum amount that parents be paid — should be coupled with a no-string-attached cash allowance for new parents, similar to what other countries offer for raising children generally. (While Republican lawmakers have suggested forms of cash assistance, they have not shown the same enthusiasm for a national paid leave program.) Such cash assistance programs offer parents the flexibility to use funds as they see fit and are very effective at reducing child poverty. Because low-wage parents must work more hours for the same pay as higher-wage workers, it's reasonable to assume that extra cash given to all families would enable some parents to spend more time home. Research supports this; when the child tax credit was temporarily expanded during the pandemic to give parents with young children about $300 a month, unmarried mothers with young children and low levels of education were the ones most likely to use the extra cash to spend more time at home.

A permanent increase to the child tax credit, then, could allow more low-wage employees to work less in order to take care of their children. The more generous earned-income tax credit, which is already earmarked for low- and middle-income workers, could also be reworked to include at-home caretakers, including parents, as a few Democratic politicians have proposed.

But to give low-wage parents with newborns more choices, tax credits of any kind must be made fully-refundable so that families with no income, or very low incomes, can receive them, instead of only those who owe taxes. In addition, they need to be made available to families as soon as a baby arrives, so that parents need not wait out the tax year for the money. Otherwise, the funds have less benefit for families without savings to draw from. And any cash assistance program must be generous to single parents, a group that Republican proposals often neglect, and sometimes penalize.

The verdict is still out on exactly how much cash it will take for low-income parents to have the choice to work less. Baby's First Years, a cash allowance pilot that gave new, low-income mothers about $300 a month, did not impact parents' employment generally. But it did reduce the time mothers spent working for pay during the peak of the pandemic — a time when parents also received additional funds from the expanded child tax credit.

On the other hand, one study in New Hampshire linked “generous” increases in cash benefits for low-income single- parent families — where a parent with one child received more than $800 a month — to families not only having more food in the fridge, but parents working less. All of this suggests that $300 a month is not enough for a single parent with a new baby to spend more time home, but $800 could be. Families with more children at home would likely need more, while low-income families with two parents might choose to reduce paid work with less generous cash assistance.

Whatever the payment amount, money must be offered not as a handout, but as compensation recognizing parents' contributions, allowing parents “to enter the workplace in a more empowered position,” Callaci told me.

Herbst, the economist, added that the goal must stay focused on giving parents “power over a bunch of critical decisions: whether to or not to work, when to start working, whether to choose child care, and what kind of child care, and how to pay for it.” For decades, lawmakers have treated low-income families with “a lot of paternalism, whereas high-income families are the ones who get all the choices,” Herbst said, adding that this duality “is not good for policy making, and not good for society.”

Mamola, the mom of four, agrees. She still chokes up talking about how she returned to restaurant work when her son was just three weeks old, waking him after night shifts to nurse and be close. Several years later, when she had twins, their home's mortgage had been paid off, letting her and her partner take time off work. Her partner was there to support her through postpartum depression, and Mamola was able to breastfeed exclusively, as she'd always wanted, and provide “even just the basic things” like lots of skin-to-skin contact, which babies thrive on, but child care workers “legally cannot provide.” It was “wonderful,” she said, “beautiful.” It's a choice she thinks all parents should have.

Business Insider Edition 

Israel on Friday became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as a sovereign state, triggering a wave of condemnation from countries across Africa and the Middle East.


        Israel on Friday became the first country in the world to formally recognise Somaliland as a sovereign state, a move that has triggered a wave of condemnation across Africa and the Middle East and drawn sharp warnings about the risks of fragmenting Somalia.
    


        Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991 following the collapse of the central government, lies along the Gulf of Aden, where the Bab el-Mandeb Strait meets the Red Sea, one of the world's most strategic maritime corridors.
    


        The territory borders Djibouti, home to the largest US military base in Africa, giving the issue significant geopolitical weight.
    


        Within hours of Israel's announcement, several countries said the decision violated international law and threatened Somalia's territorial integrity.

        Egypt said it had begun consultations with key regional partners to oppose the recognition. In a statement, Cairo said Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty held calls with his counterparts in Somalia, Türkiye and Djibouti to discuss what it described as the “dangerous developments” in the Horn of Africa stemming from Israel's move.
    


        China also weighed in, reaffirming its support for Somalia's sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity.
    


        “No country should encourage or support other countries' internal separatist forces for its own selfish interests,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, urging Somaliland authorities to halt “separatist activities and collusion with external forces”.
    


        Jordan said it “strongly rejects” the mutual recognition between Israel and Somaliland, calling it a “flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter” and an infringement on Somalia's sovereignty.
    


        Saudi Arabia said the step entrenches “unilateral, separatist measures” and contradicts international law, stressing its full support for Somalia's unity and legitimate state institutions.
    


        Palestine described the recognition as a threat to Arab and regional security, warning that legitimising secession undermines Somalia's stability.
    


        Kuwait said the recognition violates international law and reaffirmed its backing for Somalia's sovereignty over all its territory. Iraq, chair of the current Arab League session, called the move a “blatant violation” of state sovereignty and urged the international community to take a clear stand against what it termed “unlawful practices”.
    


        The African Union said it “firmly rejects any initiative or action aimed at recognising Somaliland as an independent entity, underlining its long-standing position in support of Somalia's territorial integrity.
    


        On Saturday, a joint statement condemning Israel's recognition was issued by a group of 21 Arab, Islamic and African countries and organisations. The signatories were Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Türkiye, Iran, Pakistan, Qatar, Jordan, Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Libya, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Maldives, Nigeria and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
    


        The breadth of the backlash shows how sensitive the Somaliland issue remains more than three decades after it declared independence, and highlights fears that any international recognition could set a precedent for further fragmentation in a region already grappling with conflict and instability.

In this article

SoftBank has completed its $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI, sources told CNBC's David Faber. 

The Japanese investment giant sent over a final $22 billion to $22.5 billion last week, according to sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named in order to discuss details of the transaction. 

SoftBank had previously invested $8 billion in the ChatGPT maker and syndicated another $10 billion with co-investors. The investment takes SoftBank's stake in the company above 10%. 

CNBC reported in February that the company was finalizing a $40 billion investment in the Sam Altman-run startup at a $260 billion pre-money valuation. 

At the time, Faber reported that the funding would be paid out over a 12-to-24-month period. Some money was slated to support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure Stargate joint venture with Oracle and SoftBank.

Companies have been spending big in recent months to build out infrastructure to support a frenzy for AI solutions and growing compute needs. 

OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments over the next several years, including agreements with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom.

Over the years, SoftBank has been betting big on technology and AI companies and was an early investor in chipmaker Nvidia. On Monday, the conglomerate agreed to pay $4 billion for data center investment firm DigitalBridge to strengthen its AI push. 

Last month, SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in major AI beneficiary Nvidia. 

A different source familiar with the move to sell the stake told CNBC at the time that the sale, combined with other cash sources, would support its OpenAI investment.

The startup, which is reportedly preparing for an initial public offering, has received billions in funding over the years from tech juggernaut Microsoft. 

Earlier this month, CNBC reported that OpenAI was exploring the potential for a more than $10 billion investment from Amazon. 

Disney is also a recent backer, following a $1 billion equity investment deal that allows users of OpenAI's video generator Sora to generate content with licensed characters such as Mickey Mouse.

Eurostar urged passengers to change their travel plans on Tuesday as a problem with the overhead power supply forced the Channel Tunnel to close.

""Due to a problem with the overhead power supply and a subsequent failed Le Shuttle train the Channel tunnel is currently closed. Unfortunately, this means we have no choice but to suspend all services today until further notice,"" Eurostar said in a statement warning of ""major disruption"" on its website.

""Please do not come to the station. We're very sorry for the impact the situation may have on your travel plans,"" the company said.

The disruption brings one of Europe's busiest international rail corridors to a near standstill during the New Year travel season.

Photos published showed scores of people sitting around their bags at St. Pancras train station in London, as well as long queues of traffic as passengers waited to enter the Eurotunnel site in Folkestone in Kent.

A statement from LeShuttle, which provides a railway service for people and their vehicles between Folkestone in the U.K. and Calais in France through the Channel Tunnel, said services were ""temporarily suspended"" for up to three hours due to a power supply issue. LeShuttle apologized for any inconvenience caused.

The Eurostar service, by contrast, is just for passengers traveling to cities like Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. 

Getlink, which owns and operates Channel Tunnel infrastructure, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

Eurostar, which runs services from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, carried 19.5 million passengers in 2024, marking the most successful year in its history.

The United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday said it was pulling out its remaining forces in Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for UAE forces to leave the country within 24 hours.

The move followed a Saudi-led coalition airstrike on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla.

The attack on what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date in a widening rift between the two Gulf powers.

Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

Declaring its national security a red line, Saudi Arabia earlier on Tuesday alleged the UAE had pressured Yemen's southern separatists to conduct military operations that had reached the kingdom's borders.

It was Riyadh's strongest language yet against the UAE in the falling-out between the neighbours, who once cooperated in a coalition against Yemen's Iran‑aligned Houthis but whose interests in Yemen have steadily grown apart in recent years.

Frictions grew inside the coalition as Abu Dhabi backed southern separatists seeking self-rule, while Riyadh kept supporting Yemen's internationally recognised government, eventually creating an open rift between the Gulf allies.

On Tuesday the coalition struck what it said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the UAE-backed separatists. The head of Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council gave Emirati forces an ultimatum of 24 hours to leave.

The UAE said in a statement that it had been surprised by the airstrike, and that the shipment that had been attacked did not contain weapons and was destined for Emirati forces.

Yemen's presidential council head, Rashad al-Alimi, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, the Yemeni state news agency said, and accused the UAE in a televised speech of fuelling strife in Yemen with its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC).

""Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation,"" he said.

The UAE earlier stressed that ""dealing with recent developments must be done responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing coordination between the concerned parties.""

Major stock indexes in the Gulf fell.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both major players in the OPEC oil exporters' group, and any disagreements between the two could hamper consensus on oil output decisions.

They and six other OPEC+ members are meeting online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates say they will continue their current policy for no change in first-quarter production.

Novo Nordisk has had a difficult year: a tumbling stock price resulting in the biggest leadership shakeup in the company's 100-year history as investors turned their back on the Danish drugmaker and its weight loss business. 

It seemed investors had largely given up on Novo's ability to translate its strides in pioneering GLP-1 drugs to financial gains as the lucrative market attracts new players. Scientists, however, say that the medicine still has potential.

What started with a focus on the drug's ability to manage weight and blood sugar, and combat related conditions such as heart disease, is now expanding further with growing interest in how it might also impact the brain.

Semaglutide, or as it is better known, Ozempic and Wegovy, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that was originally developed for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugar levels. However, it quickly became prescribed by doctors off-label en masse as its appetite surpressing and weight-loss properties became known. Today, it is approved for anti-obesity purposes and brings in billions annually for its maker, Novo Nordisk.

Now, the medical community is discovering a growing list of added benefits from these drugs.

""Wegovy promotes weight loss and potentially other mechanisms not fully understood,"" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote in a statement in August when it approved the drug for treating liver disease. Semaglutide is also cleared by regulators to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in overweight people with cardiovascular disease, as well as to treat chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients. 

Meanwhile, a rival drug by U.S. competitor Eli Lilly, tirzepatide (known as Mounjaro and Zepbound), which also targets the GLP-1 hormone as well as another gut hormone called GIP, is approved for treating moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.

But the benefits may not end there. Amid increased competition, additional indications have become a new frontier for drug developers alongside new formats like pills.

Observational studies have shown that GLP-1s appear to quiet cravings not just for food, but also for alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, as they affect the brain's reward pathway. By seemingly changing dopamine signals in the brain, these drugs could reduce cravings and allow the individual to be more rational when faced with tempting options.

""There is interest in understanding the potential of semaglutide on various brain functions,"" Laura Nisenbaum, executive director at Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), told CNBC.

""Understanding that inflammation and energy usage in the brain is going to be so important for our normal cognitive function,"" Nisenbaum said. Recognizing that link will be useful in many different neurological and neuropsychiatric indications where changes or damage to the brain impact mood, behavior or cognition, she added.

Evolving data suggest that semaglutide and rival drug tirzepatide made by Eli Lilly might be the first effective ""anticonsumption"" agents with the potential to treat excessive food cravings, obesity, alcohol consumption, nicotine addiction, recreational drug use, and even uncontrollable shopping behaviors, a study by researchers at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute and University of Missouri found.  

Another small-scale randomized clinical trial found that low-dose semaglutide reduced alcohol consumption and significantly reduced cravings compared to placebo in patients with alcohol use disorder over nine weeks of treatment. The results justify larger clinical trials of incretin therapies for alcohol use disorder, the researchers concluded.

Another potential added benefit of this class of drugs could be how it interacts with the dementia process.

In November, Novo disappointed investors when it published data on a two-year-long clinical trial testing whether semaglutide could slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 

Hopes had run high that the medicine might be able to help people suffering from the most common type of dementia, as it had been observed in real-world studies that diabetes patients taking semaglutide developed Alzheimer's at a lower rate than those who didn't.

But the late-stage trial failed to meet its main goal, showing that semaglutide didn't significantly impact cognition in Alzheimer's patients. Novo said it would discontinue a one-year extension of the trial due to the results. 

However, some scientists told CNBC it shouldn't be seen as a failure. They say that even if the results were disappointing, it was a well-conducted trial that the science community was able to learn from.

""It just gave a negative result as far as the drug is concerned in that particular population,"" said Ivan Koychev, associate professor in neuropsychiatry at Imperial College London. 

Semaglutide however, affects Alzheimer's disease proteins in the right direction, as seen in biomarker measures, Koychev said. ""They're impacting Alzheimer's disease-linked proteins, they reduce their quantity in the cerebrospinal fluid, which suggests that it is interacting directly with the alternative pathology.""

There was also an observed reduction in systemic inflammation biomarkers, according to Novo. ""The thinking is that it may be this anti-inflammatory effect that, if it is implemented early enough in the disease process, you can substantially modify the risk of dementia,"" Koychev said.

""The signal was always in the prevention space rather than the treatment space,"" he added.

Similarly, Nisenbaum said a next useful step would be to test semaglutide and other GLP-1s earlier in the course of the disease as a preventative therapy. 

Novo Nordisk said it was reviewing all data from the trial, but that it was too early to speculate any further on the effect semaglutide might have on dementia patients. 

Despite the fact that the innovations developed by Novo have the potential to significantly impact public health, many investors have turned their back on the company over the past 18 months as its growth prospects face challenges.

Novo shares are having their worst year on record since listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen over three decades ago. At its peak in mid-2024, the stock traded at above 1,000 Danish kroner. Today, it trades at around 320 kroner.

The stock's year-to-date drop of 50% is being driven by increased competition from U.S. rival Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies making cheaper, copycat versions of semaglutide. A failure to convince investors that its pipeline will bring significant financial gains amid a flurry of hopeful market entrants also adds to the pressure.

The Alzheimer's trial data readout in November led shares to drop 5.8% on the day, despite analysts saying it was always a long shot and Novo management themselves called it a ""lottery ticket,"" — underlining its highly uncertain outcome.

The two Alzheimer's drugs currently on the market, Eli Lilly's Kisunla and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi have been shown to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease by up to a third but come with the risk of severe side effects. 

These medicines were studied 15 years ago, and there were many negative studies along the way, ADDF's Nisenbaum said. ""Each one, we learned something that then led to an improvement in understanding our patients in the clinical trials and then how to measure what's happening in them.""

""It's absolutely about the long game,"" she added, hopeful that semaglutide or other novel drugs that target risk factors could be used in combination with Kisunla and Leqembi.

But the market doesn't see it like that, and there are many reasons why.

First of all, investors' time horizons are much shorter than the decades-long process it typically takes to bring a drug to market, meaning pharmaceutical development often clashes with the speedier pace of public markets. Adding new indicators for a drug also takes time, as they need to be backed up by often lengthy clinical trials.

Secondly, semaglutide is facing key patent expiries in 2031 and 2032, which will give the green light to others to make generic versions of semaglutide.

""We don't see a good argument for a valuation floor,"" Jefferies analysts said late November, noting that Novo now enters the 5-year patent expiry window with no real moat.

""Lower U.S. prices may stimulate additional volume demand and enhance patient retention, but we are not of the view that, at these prices, generics and compounders cannot compete,"" they added, rating shares at Underperform.

Pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for Americans, and the threat of high import taxes, have served as additional headwinds for Novo, as well as for many of its pharma peers over the past year.

Goldman Sachs analysts, led by James Quigley, are slightly more optimistic. ""We remain Buy-rated on Novo Nordisk, as while expectations have reset sharply downwards for near/medium-term estimates, we continue to believe there could be some volume opportunity for Novo as the obesity market evolves,"" they wrote in a note late November.

""While Novo are unlikely to take a leading share, we still see opportunities for Wegovy, CagriSema and oral Wegovy to drive value in excess of what the market currently believes, although we acknowledge that this will likely take time and evidence of an uptick in scripts before investors give credit,"" they added.

Billionaire Elon Musk has put humanoid robots in the spotlight this year, positioning them as central to Tesla's valuation, which he thinks could hit tens of trillions of dollars. But Tesla is yet to sell its flagship humanoid robot Optimus.

Instead, it's likely a slew of Chinese companies that will beat Tesla to the punch and begin ramping up production of robots in 2026, as Beijing puts the technology at the center of its strategic plans. 

""China currently leads the United States in the early commercialization of humanoid robots,"" Andreas Brauchle, partner at consultancy Horváth, told CNBC by email. ""While both countries are expected to build similarly large markets over time, China is scaling more rapidly in this initial phase.""

Humanoid robots are designed to be shaped and move like a human. Artificial intelligence algorithms power their abilities along with complex hardware like semiconductors. Proponents say they could be used across various settings, from factories to hospitality and even in the home.

Over the past few years, China has made robotics a key focus of its tech strategy, unveiling plans to create supply chains and mass production of the machines. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping and the country's top leaders, known as the Central Committee, met in October and released proposals for the ""15th five-year plan,"" a document that lays out some of the key focus areas for Beijing in the coming years. 

""Embodied artificial intelligence,"" a term that refers to AI-driven hardware like robotics or driverless cars, was mentioned in the text.

For China, humanoid robots represent an opportunity to address labor challenges in the world's second-largest economy as well as advancing Beijing's quest for tech supremacy.

""China's push into humanoid robotics development is driven by a combination of addressing demographic pressures, driving the next horizon of economic growth, and strengthening its role in global competition,"" Karel Eloot, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, told CNBC.

China's birth rates are declining and the population is aging, leading to a reduced number of people in the workforce and rising labor costs. Robots are seen as a way to address this. 

Meanwhile, China is locked in an ongoing tech race with the U.S. across multiple sectors. Robotics, seen as a real-world application of AI, could become a new battleground in 2026. Politico reported this month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been meeting with the CEOs of robotics companies to form a plan to accelerate the industry. Washington is considering issuing an executive order on robotics next year, Politico reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

""China could be the most important market for humanoids,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note this month. Analysts at the bank forecast a global total addressable market for humanoids of $9 trillion by 2050, with China accounting for more than 60% of that. 

Chinese robotics firms are attempting to power ahead with mass production. 

Unitree, which is gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at around $7 billion, is one of China's buzziest robotics players. The company has various robotics models, including humanoids. This year, it debuted its latest model, the H2, showcasing its ability to dance. 

UBTech Robotics is another of China's key players. It makes humanoid robots for both an industrial setting, like a factory, as well as commercial applications, like being a tour guide. UBTech's flagship industrial model, the Walker S2, is able to swap out its battery itself in order to run 24 hours a day. 

The company is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and this month carried out a share placement to raise around $400 million to fund its expansion. UBTech plans to deliver 500 industrial robots this year and ramp up production of its humanoid robots to 5,000 in 2026 and 10,000 in 2027, the South China Morning Post reported in November.

AgiBot is another player that said this month its 5,000th humanoid robot rolled off the production line.

Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng also debuted its second-generation humanoid robot called Iron last month, and plans to begin mass production of the product next year.

There are more than 150 humanoid robot companies in China, but these are among the biggest.

China's manufacturing prowess and success in ramping up production in other products like electric vehicles, may give it an edge when it comes to robotics, analysts said.

""The depth of China's supply chain means companies can develop and manufacture robots at a significant cost advantage compared to other regions,"" Ethan Qi, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.

Indeed, UBTech expects production costs to drop 20% to 30% each year. 

Meanwhile, various local governments in China have subsidy programs aimed at companies in the robotics sector. 

The U.S. however, has ""advantages in AI, autonomy and advanced algorithmic development,"" Horváth's Brauchle said. 

American firms are ""betting on vertical integration"" — which means owning and controlling more of the supply chain — according to McKinsey's Eloot. This includes components like actuators, which power a robot's movement, as well as the AI software that is integrated into the final product.

""The belief is that tighter ownership of the full system will deliver superior performance, stronger safety cases, and defensible intellectual property,"" Eloot said.

China's humanoid robot market will initially be bigger than that of the U.S., but will not remain that way forever.

""Over the long term, both countries are expected to converge toward similarly large markets, whereby absolute mass-market penetration is expected after 2040, driven primarily by high-volume adoption in private households,"" Brauchle said.

China's robotics industry is not without its challenges. One bottleneck is its restricted access to certain chips required for robots. 

""I think there's a very high reliance on U.S. chips, for example, Nvidia chips,"" Jacqueline Du, head of China industrial tech research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's ""The China Connection"" last month. 

Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester, noted a number of other potential hurdles, such as AI limitations in unpredictable operating conditions for humanoids and regulatory barriers.

""Together, these challenges slow commercialization over the next two years and require coordinated innovation, security, and policy frameworks,"" Dai told CNBC.

There are also the technological difficulties of replicating the human movement of limbs like hands and fingers — an incredibly complex task that demands capable of mimicking biological functions. ""Most robotic hands fall well short in effective degrees of freedom, sharply limiting their range,"" McKinsey's Eloot notes.

Finally, perhaps the biggest challenge is bringing the cost of these complex machines down. Eloot said that product costs for today's advanced humanoid prototypes range from $150,000 to $500,000 per unit. Those need to come down to between $20,000 to $50,000 per unit to ""compete with human labor.""

Even though robotics is a strategic priority for China, this hasn't stopped regulators from warning about a potentially overheated market.

In November, China's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), warned there is a risk of a bubble forming in the humanoid robotic market. The NDRC said that there are more than 150 humanoid robotics companies in China, with that number growing, and many of them are bringing out similar products.

In the past, there have been boom and bust cycles around technology that Beijing has given strategic importance, such as electric vehicles.

""Many assume that humanoid robots will soon exceed human-level versatility, speed and autonomy. Manufacturers reinforce this perception through polished demonstration videos and staged trade-show performances that present capabilities not yet reproducible in real industrial environments,"" Horváth's Brauchle said.

""This gap between perception and reality increases the risk of an investment bubble.""

""A market correction could slow innovation and commercialization momentum,"" Forrester's Dai added.

A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a claim by President Donald Trump's administration that it is legally barred from securing funding for the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, noting that a court order already bars the administration from shutting the agency down.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson came as the CFPB faced the imminent exhaustion of funds. The Trump administration has denied the CFPB additional cash to meet expenses since taking control of the agency in February but ithas been repeatedly blocked in the courts from firing workers en masse.

CFPB representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Officials say cash on hand could be exhausted in early 2026 and the CFPB announced last month that an administration legal opinion held that, under the agency's governing statute, it could not seek additional funding from the Federal Reserve so long as the central bank is losing money.

But in a stinging 32-page ruling, Berman Jackson said Tuesday this was a legally baseless pretext to get around her original order, finding that ""the defendants are unabashedly trying to shut the agency down again, through different means.""

""It appears that defendants' new understanding of 'combined earnings' is an unsupported and transparent attempt to achieve the very end the court's injunction was put in place to prevent,"" Berman Jackson wrote, adding that the administration's ""unilateral decision"" to decline further CFPB funding would therefore be in violation.

The agency's supporters say that without it the public will be more exposed to predatory lending practices, scams and other abuse. Trump and others have accused it of politicized enforcement and called it a burden on free enterprise.

The agency was started to protect financial services consumers after the financial crisis of 2008.

Unlike many federal agencies, the CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve, rather than through a budget set annually by Congress. But lawmakers this year slashed the CFPB's maximum allowable funding, meaning the agency may face tighter funding constraints regardless.

In this article

Meta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. 

Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. 

The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.

Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.

""Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,"" Meta said.

According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. 

While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. 

The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.

Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. 

It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.

The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.

The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.

""Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,"" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. 

The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.

Meta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.

In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.

Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.

In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. 

To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion ""tokens"" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.

Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","David Beckham's Prenetics Stops All Bitcoin Purchases, Pivots Money to Wellness Brand","https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/prenetics-stops-all-bitcoin-purchases","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:54:22 GMT","

Prenetics has stopped buying bitcoin and will focus its capital and strategy entirely on scaling IM8, its growing consumer health brand.

Prenetics Global Limited said it has ended its bitcoin purchasing program and will redirect its capital and strategic focus entirely toward IM8, its fast-growing consumer health and longevity brand co-founded with David Beckham.

The Nasdaq-listed health sciences company said it ceased daily bitcoin purchases on Dec. 4, following approval from its board of directors, and will not pursue future acquisitions of the cryptocurrency. 

Prenetics will retain its existing holdings of 510 bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset but has committed not to allocate any new or existing capital toward expanding that position.

The move marks a clear shift away from a strategy the company adopted earlier this year, when several public firms began accumulating bitcoin as a treasury asset during a rising market. That trend has slowed in recent months as cryptocurrency prices weakened and investor focus returned to core operating businesses.

Prenetics said the decision reflects the rapid growth of IM8, which it described as the fastest-growing supplement brand in the industry's history. 

The company said IM8 surpassed $100 million in annualized recurring revenue within 11 months of launch and is projected to generate between $180 million and $200 million in revenue in fiscal year 2026.

“The phenomenal success of IM8 has exceeded all expectations and scaled much faster than our original expectations,” said Danny Yeung, Prenetics' chief executive officer and co-founder. He said management and the board agreed that concentrating resources on IM8 offered the clearest path to long-term shareholder value.

Prenetics said it remains in a strong financial position, with more than $70 million in cash and cash equivalents, zero debt, and its existing bitcoin holdings intact. The company said that balance sheet strength gives it flexibility to fund IM8's next phase of growth without relying on external financing.

Under the revised capital allocation strategy, Prenetics said funds will be directed exclusively toward IM8's operations and expansion. 

That includes product development, brand marketing, talent acquisition, working capital, and international growth initiatives. The company framed the shift as an effort to sharpen strategic clarity and reinforce disciplined governance.

IM8 markets an all-in-one nutritional supplement aimed at simplifying daily health routines. The brand has been promoted by Beckham and tennis world number one Aryna Sabalenka, and Prenetics has leaned heavily into celebrity-backed branding as it scales the business globally.

The decision to halt bitcoin purchases comes as the digital asset market faces a period of weaker sentiment. 

Bitcoin has struggled to regain momentum after a sharp downturn earlier in the year, and several companies that adopted crypto-heavy treasury strategies have seen their share prices come under pressure. 

Against that backdrop, Prenetics' move stands out as a reversion toward a more traditional operating focus.

When the company announced its bitcoin accumulation strategy in June, Yeung spoke about the potential overlap between healthcare innovation and blockchain technology. 

Six months later, the company's tone has shifted, with management emphasizing execution, revenue growth, and consumer demand.

Prenetics said it believes the updated strategy aligns the company more closely with shareholder priorities as IM8 continues to scale. While bitcoin will remain on the balance sheet, the company made clear it will no longer play a central role in its capital deployment plans.

Shares of Prenetics were little changed following the announcement. At time of writing, shares were at $16.42 a share. 

Bitcoin is currently trading at $88,626, up 1% over the past 24 hours on $39 billion in volume, with a market cap of about $1.77 trillion. 

The price sits near the top of its weekly range, roughly 1% below the seven-day high and 2% above the seven-day low, with nearly 19.97 million BTC currently in circulation.

Bitcoin's price continued to slide  on Tuesday as traders warned of a potential sharp correction early next year, even as major corporate holder Strategy moved forward with another nine-figure purchase.

Bitcoin was trading at $87,403 at the time of reporting, down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, as investors weighed warnings of a possible “mega crash” toward the $40,000 level.

Fears of a deeper pullback intensified after a widely shared post on X compared Bitcoin's current chart structure to the 2021 market peak.

“Bitcoin is now showing the same setup we saw in 2021,” one trader wrote, alongside technical charts that circulated broadly among market participants.

“If the four-year cycle is still intact, BTC will drop to $40,000 in January. Most people aren't ready for what's coming in a few weeks.”

The comments reflect a persistent belief among some traders that Bitcoin continues to follow a four-year boom-and-bust cycle linked to halving events.

Historically, these halvings have preceded major price peaks followed by steep drawdowns.

“History might be repeating itself again,” another X user replied.

Others, however, argue that the four-year cycle may no longer apply, citing increased institutional involvement in the market.

“The situation is completely different now,” one X user wrote.

Adding: “ETFs have appeared, large banks and investors have entered this market. They can influence prices, but do you seriously believe they would allow a 70% or 80% decline?”

Several prominent industry figures have also pushed back against the idea that Bitcoin is headed for a cycle-driven crash.

Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week, Fundstrat's Tom Lee said Bitcoin's four-year cycle is no longer a reliable framework for understanding the market.

“We're going to shatter the Bitcoin four-year cycle,” Lee said.

He pointed to recent price action as evidence, noting that Bitcoin rose 36% earlier in the year before reversing sharply.

“Crypto was up 36% until Oct. 10, and then it's gone straight down,” Lee said.

According to Lee, the decline has been driven less by halving dynamics and more by structural factors, particularly market deleveraging.

He compared the current environment to the period following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.

Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has also argued that the four-year cycle is being disrupted.

“We think that the move by institutions into this new asset class is going to prevent much more of a decline,” she said.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao echoed the view at Bitcoin MENA, saying external forces may now be “strong enough to offset the four-year cycle.”

Despite the sell-off and warnings of a major correction, Strategy disclosed another significant Bitcoin purchase on Monday.

The company, led by Michael Saylor, said it acquired 1,229 Bitcoin for approximately $108.8 million at an average price of $88,568 per coin.

Strategy has acquired 1,229 BTC for ~$108.8 million at ~$88,568 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 23.2% YTD 2025. As of 12/28/2025, we hodl 672,497 $BTC  acquired for ~$50.44 billion at ~$74,997 per bitcoin. $MSTR  $STRC  $STRK  $STRF  $STRD  $STRE  https://t.co/5VvOgBYwhk 

— Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 29, 2025 



As of Dec. 28, 2025, Strategy holds 672,497 Bitcoins, acquired for roughly $50.44 billion at an average price of $74,997 per bitcoin.

The move signals continued confidence in Bitcoin's long-term value, even as near-term volatility increases and bearish sentiment weighs on the market.

Analysts say technical indicators suggest Bitcoin may still have upside potential, even as downside risks remain.

Victor Olanweraju, a crypto analyst at CCN, said the Pi Cycle Top indicator — a tool used to identify long-term market peaks — does not currently signal an imminent top.

At the time of analysis, the indicator's 350-day moving average stood near $204,975, while the 111-day moving average was around $104,350.

The wide gap between the two lines suggests Bitcoin is not yet approaching conditions that have historically coincided with major cycle peaks.

“While the Pi Cycle Top is not a timing tool and does not predict exact price levels, the current separation implies that Bitcoin's longer-term upside potential may not yet be fully exhausted,” Olanweraju said.

However, he cautioned that if selling pressure intensifies, Bitcoin could struggle to break above the $104,000 level, leaving prices vulnerable to further consolidation or declines.

About us

Copy link

A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on December 30. Sign up here.

With Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade in the rearview mirror, developers have turned their attention to future improvements codenamed Glamsterdam and Hegota. 

Glamsterdam is expected sometime in 2026, and its headline features have been locked in for months. 

Despite all the talk in 2025 about Ethereum developers' renewed focus on scaling mainnet — making Ethereum itself more capable of quickly and affordably processing transactions at scale — Fusaka's chief benefit was to reduce the cost of transactions on layer 2 blockchains, which are separate from, but settle on, Ethereum. 

Glamsterdam, on the other hand, will reflect that renewed focus through its two major features: block-level access lists and enshrined proposer-builder separation, or ePBS.

Block-level access lists are expected to be particularly beneficial for complex applications, such as DeFi protocols.

At a high level, they'll enable parallel processing of certain transactions on Ethereum.

This will allow for faster block validation, more predictable transaction fees, and, for certain transactions, dramatically lower fees.

Enshrined proposer-builder separation is also expected to lower the cost of using the chain and to increase throughput. 

It could also increase the cost of censorship on Ethereum, according to one of its champions, the pseudonymous developer Potuz. 

That said, a more significant anti-censorship feature considered for Glamsterdam has been delayed to the Hegota upgrade. 

Hegota has yet to receive a target release date. We don't even know what the upgrade will include — of the many Ethereum Improvement Proposals floating around online, only that anti-censorship feature has even been marked “considered for inclusion,” meaning it's no guarantee.

That feature, fork-choice inclusion lists, or FOCIL, guarantees inclusion in a block of any valid transaction. It spurred intense debate among Ethereum developers this year. 

“In an effort to shield the Ethereum validator set from centralising forces, the right to build blocks has been auctioned off to specialised entities known as builders,” FOCIL's authors explained when proposing the feature in 2024. 

But the builder market has become concentrated, spurring fears of a choke point that could be easily leveraged by governments and others seeking to censor transactions, the authors continued. 

FOCIL addresses this by giving so-called validators — another, more distributed set of players in the Ethereum ecosystem — the power to require that builders include certain transactions. 

Privacy Pools founder Ameen Soleimani has argued that the benefits of FOCIL are overstated, and it creates legal risks for US-based validators.

When Tornado Cash was placed on the US sanctions list, some 90% of validators declined to include transactions that touched Tornado Cash smart contracts, he said. As long as a single validator was willing to include those transactions, however, they would eventually settle on Ethereum. 

Had US validators been forced to include those transactions, however, they could have faced the wrath of the US government, Soleimani argued. 

Rollup developer Tim Clancy, who, like Soleimani, attended the New York trial of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm in solidarity, called it the “single most important [proposal] for Ethereum.” 

“It delivers a capability that Ethereum must have to continue delivering on its mission of being the most neutral blockspace,” he wrote on X earlier this year. 

Of course, even if FOCIL makes its way into the Hegota upgrade, it won't be the only major feature. Ethereum devs will begin debating which features should be included in Hegota on January 8. Headline features will likely be finalised by the end of February. 

VOTE: Aave DAO votes on renewal of delegate incentive program

VOTE: Rocket Pool votes on membership slate for its grants and bounties committee

VOTE: World Liberty Financial votes to use treasury to support growth of USD1

Major cryptocurrencies closed the year well below their all-time highs reached just months earlier. 

Still, the industry has had a wildly successful 2025. Unless you're in the NFT market, that is.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Institutions are increasingly using the bitcoin options playbook for altcoins: STS Digital","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/30/institutions-are-increasingly-using-the-bitcoin-options-playbook-in-altcoins-sts-digital","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 08:21:54 GMT","

Institutions are increasingly using proven bitcoin BTC$88,266.32 options techniques on alternative cryptocurrencies to protect against price swings and earn extra returns, STS Digital, a principal trader specializing in digital assets derivatives, told CoinDesk.

""Our client base includes token projects and foundations, investors with large holdings, and asset management firms managing exposure ahead of liquidity events,"" Maxime Seiler, co-founder and CEO of STS Digital, said. ""Increasingly, we're also seeing these participants apply option strategies that were historically used in Bitcoin to the altcoin space."" 

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call option represents a bullish bet, giving the purchaser the right to buy the  asset at a specified price at a later date. A put option represents a bearish bet, protecting the buyer from a price decline.

The option seller is essentially writing insurance against bullish/bearish moves in return for an upfront compensation, called a premium.

Institutions holding bitcoin tend to sell options, writing BTC calls at levels above the going market price, and collecting the premium. This premium represents additional income on top of their spot BTC holdings.

This so-called covered call strategy has been one of the most popular institutional plays since the early 2020 crash. Institutions have also pursued other methods, such as writing bitcoin puts to boost income during price rallies, buying puts as downside hedges, and buying call options to participate in the bull run.

Now, institutions and other entities, such as project founders holding large amounts of altcoins, foundations, venture capital firms and private players, are using the same playbook in other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins. 

The Oct. 10 crash, which saw exchanges forcefully close even profit-making bets (auto-deleveraging) to socialize losses, further stressed the need for risk management in altcoins. 

""Beyond covered calls, institutions are actively using put selling for yield, downside hedging, and call buying to gain upside with defined risk. These strategies are increasingly being applied to altcoins as investors look to manage exposure without taking forced liquidations risk (ADL) that drove the October 10 crash,"" Seiler said.

""It's a clear example of why options are a more robust way to express risk in volatile markets,"" he added.

STS Digital is a regulated digital asset trading firm that acts as a principal dealer for institutional investors, providing liquidity and quoting options, spot trades and structured products across over 400 cryptocurrencies.

The breadth of its offering lets the firm cater to rising demand for altcoin options, while centralized platforms like Deribit focus on derivatives for major ones like ETH, XRP and SOL.

The firm settles billions in altcoin options volume annually through bilateral trades. All transactions occur directly between STS and clients, with STS taking the other side of the deal to provide liquidity and instant execution.

Seiler expects continued growth of options tied to bitcoin and other tokens over the coming years.

""Looking ahead, we see strong and sustained institutional adoption continuing to drive demand for options as the preferred way to manage digital asset exposure. With adoption having accelerated relentlessly over the past year, periods of consolidation and low volatility are increasingly viewed as attractive entry points ahead of the next wave of market catalysts,"" he said.

In time, this strength may even help them outperform Bitcoin consistently.

Altcoins are struggling with trading volumes at multi-year lows, while social interest across crypto markets is in freefall. It does look a bit like the pullbacks of 2019 and 2022.

But this time, there's a difference. Bitcoin [BTC] is holding its ground near cycle highs, and altcoins are no longer collapsing.

Spot trading activity in December across major altcoins has slowed massively.

Ripple's XRP's [XRP] volume slipped to about $32 billion, its weakest showing of 2025. Binance [BNB] exchange accounted for nearly half of that.

BNB, with just $13.7 billion in volume (among its lowest this year), was again dominated by Binance exchange flows.

Source: CryptoQuant

Solana [SOL], often seen as the most active large-cap alt, fell to roughly $43 billion, its softest level since 2024.

Source: CryptoQuant

Cardano [ADA] also lagged, recording around $3.8 billion, so there's subdued interest across venues.

The drop in spot volumes was followed by a collapse in public interest. Google Trends data showed crypto-related searches at near multi-year lows, even at elevated prices.

Over the past five years, spikes in attention have come in times of surges or panic. What's interesting now, is the absence of both.

Source: Alphractal

90-day data confirmed that interest has fallen through December, with no rebound across Bitcoin or major altcoins.

As Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson posted on X, such conditions have usually come before long periods of consolidation… or extended bear markets.

Weak volumes and collapsing interest definitely give reason to panic.

This is where relative performance starts to matter. Altcoins are stabilizing, while Bitcoin remains stretched at elevated levels.

Source: Alphractal

According to Wedson, altcoins stopped making new lows even as large-cap leaders corrected further in 2019 and 2022. That allowed altcoins to outperform Bitcoin regardless of BTC's short-term direction.

If Bitcoin does see another leg down, the fall may be absorbed unevenly. With many altcoins already compressed, relative strength could swim away from BTC.

Digital asset investment products closed the final full week of December under continued pressure, with persistent outflows underscoring fragile investor sentiment despite still-strong year-to-date inflows. According to CoinShares' Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report dated December 29, products recorded US$446 million in net weekly outflows, extending cumulative redemptions since the October 10 price shock to US$3.2 billion.

The figures highlight a growing divergence in crypto market behavior. While headline sentiment remains cautious—particularly toward Bitcoin and Ethereum—selective buying is emerging in specific regions and assets. XRP and Solana-linked products continue to attract inflows following their recent ETF launches, suggesting that investors are reallocating rather than exiting the asset class altogether.

This bifurcation points to a market in transition as 2025 draws to a close: one where macro uncertainty and profit-taking coexist with targeted conviction trades.

Regionally, the data reveals a clear geographic split. The United States accounted for the bulk of weekly outflows, shedding US$460 million, reinforcing the view that U.S.-based investors remain risk-averse after October's sharp correction. Switzerland also saw modest redemptions of US$14.2 million.

Germany stood out as the notable exception. German-listed products attracted US$35.7 million in weekly inflows and a substantial US$248 million month-to-date, making it the strongest regional performer. The report notes that investors in Germany appear to be using recent price weakness as an accumulation opportunity rather than a reason to de-risk.

This divergence suggests differences not just in sentiment, but in investment horizon. While U.S. flows often react more quickly to short-term price moves, European investors—particularly in Germany—may be positioning for medium-term recovery under clearer regulatory and product structures.

At the asset level, Bitcoin and Ethereum continued to bear the brunt of selling pressure. Bitcoin products recorded US$443 million in weekly outflows, while Ethereum saw US$59.5 million exit during the same period.

More striking is the cumulative trend since mid-October. Since the launch of XRP and Solana ETFs, Bitcoin products have seen total outflows of US$2.8 billion, with Ethereum products losing US$1.6 billion over the same timeframe. This suggests that capital is not simply leaving crypto, but rotating away from the two largest assets.

Despite these outflows, year-to-date figures remain historically strong. Total YTD inflows across digital asset products stand at US$46.3 billion, broadly in line with 2024's US$48.7 billion. However, total assets under management have risen by just 10% YTD, implying that many investors have yet to see positive net outcomes once flows and price action are combined.

In contrast to the weakness in Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP and Solana products continued to attract capital. XRP investment products saw US$70.2 million in weekly inflows, while Solana added US$7.5 million.

Since their ETF launches in the United States, XRP and Solana products have accumulated US$1.07 billion and US$1.34 billion in inflows respectively. This resilience highlights how new product structures and narratives can redirect capital even during periods of broader market caution.

The data suggests that investors are increasingly willing to express directional views through targeted exposure rather than broad beta. In practice, this favors assets perceived to have idiosyncratic catalysts—such as network adoption, ecosystem growth, or legal clarity—over more mature cryptocurrencies.

At the provider level, outflows were led by major U.S. issuers. iShares ETFs recorded US$290 million in weekly outflows, while Grayscale saw US$115 million redeemed. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund also experienced US$111 million in weekly outflows.

These figures reinforce the view that institutional portfolios are being actively rebalanced. Some providers, such as ProShares and Volatility Shares Trust, posted weekly inflows, indicating that leverage and tactical strategies continue to attract niche demand even as spot products lose assets.

The dispersion across issuers points to a more sophisticated phase of market participation, where investors are differentiating between structures, fee models, and strategy types rather than treating crypto exposure as a single trade.

The CoinShares report paints a picture of a market still digesting October's shock. Persistent outflows indicate that confidence has not fully recovered, even as year-to-date inflows remain robust in historical terms. This tension suggests that crypto markets are transitioning from momentum-driven inflows to more selective, fundamentals-based allocation.

Germany's continued inflows and the success of XRP and Solana ETFs may offer clues to where demand could stabilize in early 2026: jurisdictions with clearer frameworks and products that offer differentiated exposure. Conversely, Bitcoin and Ethereum may need renewed catalysts—such as macro easing or regulatory breakthroughs—to reverse the current outflow trend.

For now, the data underscores a key theme: crypto capital is still active, but it is becoming more discerning.

Oops, something went wrong

BLOK gained 32% year-to-date while Bitcoin fell 7% by allocating only 5% to spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Top holding HUT 8 surged 140% as miners benefit from operational leverage independent of Bitcoin price.

Bipartisan crypto legislation expected in 2026 could deepen institutional adoption of blockchain infrastructure.

A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans' retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.

When Bitcoin slips 7% and your blockchain ETF jumps 32%, you're not betting on Bitcoin. Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSEARCA:BLOK) launched in 2018 as one of the first blockchain-focused funds and has spent 2025 proving that picks-and-shovels exposure to crypto infrastructure beats direct Bitcoin ownership when the digital currency wobbles.

The fund's 32% year-to-date gain through late December crushed the S&P 500's 17% return and left Bitcoin's 7% decline in the dust. Only about 5% of the portfolio sits in spot Bitcoin ETFs like Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NASDAQ:FBTC) and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT). The rest is Bitcoin miners, crypto exchanges, fintech platforms, and chip makers that profit regardless of whether Bitcoin trades at $88,000 or $105,000.

The biggest macro factor driving BLOK forward isn't Bitcoin's price. It's accelerating institutional adoption of blockchain infrastructure, which creates durable revenue streams for the companies BLOK holds. Grayscale's 2026 outlook projects that bipartisan crypto legislation will become U.S. law next year, deepening integration between public blockchains and traditional finance. That regulatory clarity matters more for companies building crypto rails than for Bitcoin itself.

Watch for updates from the SEC and Treasury Department on stablecoin frameworks and digital asset custody rules. These typically arrive quarterly and signal whether institutional capital can flow more freely into blockchain services. When banks and asset managers get clearer rules, companies like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) see trading volume surge and custody businesses expand, regardless of Bitcoin's spot price.

The difference shows up in BLOK's top holdings. Robinhood has soared 213% year-to-date as retail and institutional crypto trading activity picked up. Even as Bitcoin declined, volatility drove revenue for platforms that facilitate trades.

BLOK's largest holding, HUT 8 Corp (NASDAQ:HUT), represents 5.3% of the portfolio and has delivered a 140% gain in 2025. The Bitcoin miner has doubled while Bitcoin fell. The explanation lies in operational leverage. Miners benefit from hash rate efficiency improvements, energy cost optimization, and diversification into AI data center hosting. When Bitcoin's price stabilizes or declines modestly, well-run miners with low production costs can expand margins.

Combined, Bitcoin mining stocks like HUT 8, CleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK), and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR) represent roughly 15% of BLOK's portfolio. Check Amplify's monthly BLOK-Chain commentary for mining economics and hash rate trends. The fund publishes holdings snapshots twice yearly on the Amplify ETFs website.

If BLOK's 0.73% expense ratio feels steep, iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IBLC) charges 0.47% and offers similar blockchain exposure. IBLC holds many of the same miners and exchanges but with a passive indexing approach rather than BLOK's active management. The trade-off: IBLC has just $90 million in assets compared to BLOK's $1.2 billion, which can mean wider bid-ask spreads and less liquidity during volatile periods.

Watch institutional adoption signals from regulators for the macro tailwind, and track Bitcoin mining profitability metrics in BLOK's monthly updates for the micro factor that could drive the next 12 months of performance.

Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don't.

And no, it's got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It's much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it's shocking more people don't adopt the habit given how easy it is.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Blockchain networks are actively preparing for a future where quantum computing could weaken today's cryptographic security. This is not a distant theory. Governments, researchers, and major technology companies are already testing early quantum systems, and the blockchain industry is planning years ahead to protect wallets, transactions, and long term trust.

The focus now is on quantum resistant security so blockchains remain reliable as computing power evolves.

Most blockchains rely on public key cryptography to secure wallets and validate transactions. Elliptic curve cryptography protects private keys, digital signatures, and ownership.

A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could use algorithms such as Shor's algorithm to derive private keys from public keys, break digital signatures, compromise wallet ownership, and weaken confidence in transaction finality.

Large scale quantum machines are not yet available, but cryptographic systems must be updated long before the threat becomes practical.

One of the most serious risks is long term data harvesting rather than immediate attacks.

Attackers can record blockchain transactions today, store public keys and signatures, and decrypt them in the future when quantum machines become capable enough. Because blockchain data is permanent, future decryption could compromise past transactions.

This is especially critical for long term wallets, institutional custody solutions, government ledgers, and smart contracts designed to run for many years.

Post quantum cryptography focuses on algorithms designed to resist quantum attacks. These include lattice based cryptography, hash based signatures, and multivariate polynomial cryptography.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has already selected multiple post quantum cryptographic standards. This has pushed industries, including blockchain, to begin planning migration paths.

Many blockchain teams are now testing these algorithms at both protocol and wallet levels to understand performance and compatibility tradeoffs.

Wallets are a primary focus of quantum readiness.

New designs aim to limit public key exposure, rely on hash based signatures rather than elliptic curves, and support cryptographic upgrades through soft forks or smart contract logic.

The Ethereum ecosystem has openly discussed quantum readiness as part of long term protocol evolution, showing how Blockchain Technology must evolve alongside advances in computing.

Rather than switching everything at once, many networks are adopting hybrid cryptographic models.

These combine classical cryptography with post quantum algorithms so networks can remain compatible with existing infrastructure while gradually increasing security. Hybrid signatures help reduce disruption and avoid performance collapse during the transition.

Several of these models are already being tested in research and early production environments.

Some quantum resistant features are being introduced above the base layer.

Layer 2 networks, smart contract wallets, and account abstraction frameworks allow users to upgrade security without waiting for full protocol changes. Account abstraction on Ethereum is often cited as a key enabler for flexible wallet security and future cryptographic upgrades.

This approach lets ecosystems experiment safely before committing to base layer changes.

Quantum computing research is being driven by companies such as IBM, Google, and Microsoft. At the same time, these firms are heavily involved in developing quantum safe cryptography and working with governments and standards bodies.

This parallel development accelerates both the threat and the defense, forcing blockchains teams to stay aligned with global security standards. Understanding these system level shifts is often part of advanced infrastructure discussions in a Tech Certification.

Post quantum cryptography comes with tradeoffs.

Key sizes are larger, computational costs are higher, and transaction sizes increase. These factors can affect throughput, fees, and user experience. Blockchain teams must balance security with usability, especially for consumer wallets and high frequency networks.

This is why migration is expected to be gradual rather than immediate.

Governments and financial institutions are already preparing for quantum risk.

Agencies in the United States, Europe, and Asia are calling for quantum risk assessments, migration roadmaps, and cryptographic agility plans. Enterprise blockchains and permissioned networks are often moving first because regulatory expectations are clearer.

This pressure is accelerating adoption of quantum safe designs in institutional environments.

Quantum attacks are not an emergency today, but they are considered inevitable in the long term.

Most experts estimate ten to twenty years before large scale cryptographic breaking becomes feasible, with early practical risks appearing within five to ten years. Migration planning needs to start now to avoid rushed upgrades later.

Blockchains that prepare early gain trust, resilience, and longevity.

Developers should learn the basics of post quantum cryptography, design upgradeable wallets and smart contracts, and avoid hard coding cryptographic assumptions.

Flexible governance and upgrade paths will be critical as standards evolve.

Investors should watch which blockchain ecosystems have clear quantum readiness roadmaps, governance structures that allow protocol upgrades, and active research communities focused on long term security.

Security planning is increasingly a signal of maturity and seriousness.

Blockchain was built around permanence and trust. Quantum computing challenges the cryptographic layer, but it does not invalidate the model.

By adopting post quantum cryptography, hybrid security models, and cryptographic agility, blockchain systems are evolving rather than reacting. This transition will be technical and gradual, but it is essential for the next generation of decentralized and institutional systems.

Evaluating how these changes affect adoption, trust, and long term value often benefits from strategic frameworks taught in a Marketing and business certification, especially as security becomes a core differentiator.

Blockchain is preparing for quantum threats by redesigning cryptography, wallets, and upgrade mechanisms well in advance. The goal is not to panic, but to ensure that decentralized systems remain secure in a future where computing power looks very different from today.

In the modern landscape of consumer behavior, the intersection of digital economy platforms, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered significant attention. The exciting research conducted by Chen and Xu dives deep into the nuances of how these digital economic forces influence consumer green payment behavior, a topic that is increasingly crucial in the context of sustainable development. As more consumers become environmentally conscious, understanding the mechanisms behind their payment choices can provide vital insights for businesses looking to innovate while also contributing to ecological sustainability.

The essence of the research lies in the impact mechanism through which digital economy platforms operate. The authors emphasize the role of these platforms in reshaping consumer interactions and expectations. By harnessing blockchain technology, digital platforms can ensure transparency and traceability in transactions. This transparency is vital for consumers who are keen to align their purchasing decisions with their values, particularly when it comes to environmentally friendly choices. As consumers increasingly seek brands that demonstrate genuine commitment to sustainability, platforms must adapt to facilitate these preferences.

Incorporating artificial intelligence into the equation adds another layer of sophistication to consumer engagement. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to predict purchasing habits and preferences, enabling platforms to tailor their offerings accordingly. This personalization not only enhances the user experience but also encourages consumers to engage in sustainable practices. For instance, AI could suggest eco-friendly products based on a consumer's previous purchases or browsing behavior, nudging them toward greener choices without appearing too intrusive.

Moreover, the research sheds light on the importance of trust in the digital economy. Blockchain's immutable nature fosters a higher level of trust among consumers, as they can verify the authenticity and sustainability claims associated with products. This trust is paramount in fostering long-term relationship building between consumers and brands. As consumer skepticism grows about greenwashing, where companies falsely claim to be environmentally friendly, the transparent nature of blockchain can serve as a potent antidote, reinforcing consumer confidence in their purchasing decisions.

The authors also discuss the role of social influence in shaping consumer behavior. Platforms that leverage AI can identify social trends and dynamics, thereby enabling companies to create targeted campaigns that resonate with their audience. By tapping into influencer marketing and community-building efforts, these platforms can cultivate a culture of sustainability among consumers. When individuals see their peers advocating for green payments, they are more likely to adopt similar behaviors, creating a ripple effect that extends beyond the digital realm.

Financial incentives are yet another critical aspect examined in the study. The integration of digital payment systems with blockchain can facilitate various incentive mechanisms, such as discounts or rewards for choosing sustainable options. By making green payment choices more appealing through tangible benefits, platforms can effectively alter consumer behavior. This has profound implications, as it demonstrates that consumers can be motivated not just by ethics alone but also by appealing financial advantages that come with making greener choices.

Despite the numerous advantages these technologies offer, the authors also acknowledge the challenges that accompany them. The digital divide remains a significant concern, as not all consumers have equal access to advanced technologies or the knowledge to navigate these platforms effectively. As businesses strive to harness the power of blockchain and AI, they must also consider inclusivity and accessibility for all demographic groups. Failure to do so could result in missing out on potential consumers who may benefit from and contribute to sustainable practices.

In conclusion, the research by Chen and Xu opens up a wealth of opportunities for understanding consumer behavior within the context of digital economy platforms. By effectively leveraging blockchain and AI, businesses can create strategies that foster sustainable practices among consumers. As this intersection continues to evolve, ongoing research in this field will be crucial to navigating the complexities of digital transactions, environmental responsibility, and consumer expectations. The future of commerce and sustainability hinges on our ability to adapt and innovate, harnessing technology to drive meaningful change in consumer behavior.

As our society grows increasingly aware of the environmental challenges we face, the integration of technology and consumer behavior will play a pivotal role in shaping the future. The insights gleaned from this research provide a roadmap for businesses seeking to engage with eco-conscious consumers in a manner that is both innovative and responsible. The potential for positive impact exists, and it is our collective responsibility to harness these tools for the greater good of our planet.

In summary, the emergence of digital economy platforms supported by blockchain and artificial intelligence has the potential to create a transformative impact on consumer payment behaviors. By prioritizing transparency, trust, and sustainability, companies can not only meet consumer demand but also contribute significantly toward a greener future. As we advance into a new era of commerce, the interplay between technology and environmental responsibility will be paramount, guiding our choices and shaping our world for years to come.

In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, it is essential for stakeholders to stay enlightened about the technological developments and their potential implications. This research promises to illuminate the path ahead, equipping businesses, policymakers, and consumers with the knowledge necessary to navigate the complexities of green consumerism. By fostering a culture of sustainability through innovative solutions, we can collectively work towards a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future.

Through examining the mechanisms of digital economy platforms, this research not only contributes to academic discourse but also offers practical insights for industry practitioners. As the conversation around sustainable practices continues to grow, it is vital for researchers and businesses alike to collaborate and share knowledge. Ultimately, the journey toward a sustainable future lies in our capacity to leverage technology for responsible consumer engagement.

The findings from Chen and Xu inspire hope and action, urging all stakeholders to recognize their role in driving change. As digital economy platforms become more prevalent, it's imperative that they prioritize sustainability, ensuring that their innovations align with the broader goal of protecting our environment and fostering a culture of green consumption. The implications of this research will undoubtedly resonate within multiple sectors, creating new pathways for collaboration and success as we forge ahead into the future.

By embracing the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital economy, we can collectively pave the way for a healthier and more sustainable world. As individuals, businesses, and communities band together, we hold the power to create significant change, establishing new norms that emphasize environmental responsibility and conscientious consumption. Through informed choices and proactive engagement, we can truly make a difference, leveraging technology to redefine the impact of consumer behavior on our planet for generations to come.

                            ""Assets with identifiable economic functions are easier to evaluate than those driven primarily by resale dynamics."" Efstathios Polyzos | Image source: CCN/ Derek Fenech                        


Key Takeaways

NFTs didn't collapse; their utility finally became measurable

The sharp decline in non-fungible tokens (NFT) trading volumes is often cited as evidence that this asset class has failed to make its case to investors and enthusiasts.  

Academic research has recently presented  evidence why the non-fungible tokens market should be avoided. This view mixes up the failure of speculation with the failure of the technology itself.

During the peak of the NFT boom, prices and volumes were heavily distorted by washtrading, promotional activity and short-term speculation, driven primarily by an early-adoption hype.  

As these distortions receded, what remained was a smaller but more informative market in which genuine demand, functional use cases and clearer price signals could finally be observed.  

The apparent downturn does not suggest a failure, but a transition toward measurability and economic value.

Declining NFT trading volumes are often interpreted  as a sign of market failure, according to experts. However, in speculative environments volume alone is a poor indicator of underlying value.  

During the NFT boom, exceptionally high turnover reflected rapid flipping, promotional trading and artificial activity rather than justified and sustained economic use.  

Volume measured attention, not utility and, thus, when speculative incentives weakened, much of this activity disappeared, causing a sharp contraction in headline metrics.  

But this contraction did not destroy functional demand; current lower volumes indicate improved signal quality rather than a generalized market collapse.  

The transactions that remain (and the corresponding prices) reflect genuine user interest, longer holding periods (as demonstrated in the figure below) and purposeful ownership.  

This distinction matters because markets built on speculative resale dynamics alone cannot support long-term value creation.  

Washtrading was among the most significant practices that fueled the rapid expansion of NFT markets.  

Washtrading distorted prices and perceived demand. In the NFT market, wash trading occurs when a closed group of wallets trades digital assets among themselves without real changes in ownership or use, inflating transaction volumes and creating the illusion of market interest, as academic papers have pointed out . 

These practices were facilitated by low transaction costs and marketplace incentive structures that rewarded volume rather than genuine participation.  

As a result, figures such as total sales and average prices often reflected strategic behavior rather than organic demand.  

This environment makes it difficult for participants to distinguish between assets that hold functional (or cultural) value and those supported by artificial liquidity.  

Much of this activity has now disappeared and what followed was a sharp decline in volumes, not because demand vanished, but because previously inflated signals were removed from the market.

As this speculative activity declined, the structure of NFT markets began to change in ways that improved the quality of observable signals.  

What is more important is that this transition can permit meaningful differentiation between assets that rely on hype and those with an identifiable economic function, simply by observing which projects retain demand.

NFT utility can be seen more clearly (albeit with lingering measurement challenges) in contexts where ownership serves a clear functional purpose.  

In digital gaming, and according to expert views in the field, NFTs increasingly represent  in-game assets that confer access, status or capabilities rather than resale opportunities. 

Studies focused  on luxury and collectibles markets have pointed out how these are used for authentication, provenance tracking, and after-sale services, linking digital records to physical goods.  

Ticketing and membership models can also provide measurable utility, where NFTs may function as access credentials with defined rights and time-bound use, rather than speculative value.  

In these settings, success is reflected in usage adoption, retention and integration into broader platforms.

This shift allows utility to be assessed through observable behavior and by focusing on how people use NFTs (rather than how often they trade them) the market now provides clearer evidence of economic relevance and value.  

It also creates space to identify and evaluate NFT use cases on their functional merits, rather than dismissing the entire asset class under the broad label of speculation.

This change in NFT markets has implications that extend well beyond the crypto ecosystem. 

This is relevant for creators and consumers, but also for institutions and public bodies seeking more transparent and auditable mechanisms for managing rights and transfers.

There are also implications for regulators, as the shift toward observable utility changes the nature of oversight. 

Assets with identifiable economic functions are easier to evaluate than those driven primarily by resale dynamics, reducing ambiguity around consumer protection and market integrity.

More broadly, the ability to distinguish speculative noise from functional value is essential for building trust in digital markets. 

When utility becomes measurable, markets can assess NFTs by economic and social value rather than narratives, allowing clearer participation, governance, and identification of use cases with real impact.

Despite the important signs of gradual market maturity, I still note significant limitations in NFT markets.  

Many projects still lack sustained user engagement while market fragmentation across platforms and blockchains continues to hinder interoperability and consistent standards.  

This has an impact on data quality also which remains uneven, with limited disclosure around usage metrics, ownership concentration and secondary market dynamics.  

These constraints make it difficult to compare or scale utility and thus limit broad conclusions about long-term viability across the entire sector.  

In addition, regulatory frameworks are still evolving, creating uncertainty for creators, platforms and users.  

Developments such as the establishment of the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)  in the UAE, as well as the introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)  framework in the European Union, illustrate ongoing efforts to clarify oversight but still leave important implementation questions unresolved.  

This uncertainty does not fully negate emerging utility, but it does caution against generalizing from isolated successes.  

The post-hype environment is more informative, but it is also more selective, revealing which applications can function under scrutiny and which cannot.

The decline in NFT trading volumes marked the end of hype- and speculation-driven growth, not the failure of the technology itself.  

As the distortions that inflated prices and activity dissipated, the market has made utility observable for the first time.  

This transition now permits us to evaluate NFTs on economic function rather than narrative momentum, a necessary step for any emerging financial asset seeking long-term relevance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Pudgy Penguins: A New Blueprint for Tokenized Culture","https://www.coindesk.com/research/pudgy-penguins-a-new-blueprint-for-tokenized-culture","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:58:32 GMT","

Pudgy Penguins is emerging as one of the strongest NFT-native brands of this cycle, shifting from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. Its strategy is to acquire users through mainstream channels first; toys, retail partnerships and viral media, then onboard them into Web3 through games, NFTs and the PENGU token.

The ecosystem now spans phygital products (> $13M retail sales and >1M units sold), games and experiences (Pudgy Party surpassed 500k downloads in two weeks), and a widely distributed token (airdropped to 6M+ wallets). While the market is currently pricing Pudgy at a premium relative to traditional IP peers, sustained success depends on execution across retail expansion, gaming adoption and deeper token utility.

Pudgy Penguins has emerged as a standout NFT brand this cycle, evolving from speculative “digital luxury goods” into a multi-vertical consumer IP platform. The brand's integrated flywheel - phygital products, games, NFTs, and the PENGU token - positions it to capture both mainstream consumer revenue and Web3-native value accrual.

At ~$1.1B FDV, Pudgy trades at ~22x with assumed base case revenue (~$50M) - far above Funko (~1x), Hasbro (~2x), Disney (~2.5x). The market is pricing Pudgy like a growth-tech hybrid, not a toy company. Execution across phygitals, gaming and token adoption will be critical to sustain this premium.

Pudgy Penguins is positioning itself as an investable NFT-native brand by creating a credible link between Web3 and mainstream consumer culture. Unlike competitors (like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Azuki) who build an exclusive NFT community first and then aim for mainstream adoption, Pudgy Penguins has inverted the strategy. They prioritize physical retail and viral content to acquire users through traditional consumer channels first. Their goal is to build a global IP that has an NFT, rather than being an NFT collection trying to become a brand.

The first cycle of NFTs can be best understood as a new form of digital luxury goods, with their market behavior reflecting a well-known economic phenomenon. This is the ""lag effect,"" where new wealth created during a market boom flows into less liquid, more speculative assets. In the last crypto bull run, profits from a soaring market were reallocated into NFTs, much like a thriving economy prompts investment in high-end art or watches.

The below chart offers clear evidence of this behavior. Bitcoin's value experienced a parabolic surge and initially peaked in the first half of 2021. During this same period, the Blue Chip NFT Index (Cryptopunks and BAYC - floor price in ETH) remained largely flat at a low value. It wasn't until several months later, near the end of 2021, that the NFT market truly exploded. The index's explosive growth and subsequent peak occurred well after Bitcoin's initial surge, strongly suggesting that NFTs were the digital luxury goods of that market cycle.

However, the current market cycle has not shown the same ""lag effect"" for most NFT collections. While major cryptocurrencies have had periods of strong performance, the broader NFT market has struggled since the start of 2023.

In this contracting market, one outlier in Pudgy Penguins stood out. Pudgies has not only held its position but has seen its brand recognition grow, outpacing competitors whose floors have stagnated or declined. This resilience is a result of the brand's pivot away from the ""digital luxury goods"" model

Under entrepreneur Luca Netz, who acquired the Pudgy Penguin brand for 750 ETH in April 2022, the goal was to turn a niche collection into a global powerhouse.

Netz's central thesis is that memes evolve into social currencies - tokens or IP assets that derive value from sustained cultural participation rather than speculation. In his framework, successful brands must translate viral attention into tangible economic networks, where community and content reinforce each other. Pudgy applies that thesis directly: the Pudgy Penguin IP operates as a shared social currency connecting its community, products and games.

The strategic shift began with an aggressive social media campaign. By uploading GIFs of its penguins to GIPHY, the team created short-form content that achieved over 65B views, more than double its closest brand competitor, as shown in the table below.

Pudgies are now the market leader of viral GIFs even when compared to web 2 brands such as Disney and Pokemon. This adds credibility to their brand recognition approach.

Pudgy Penguins operates across four interlinked verticals - Phygitals & Licensing, Gaming, NFTs, and the PENGU Token that together form a consumer-to-crypto funnel.

Physical products and games attract mainstream users, while QR integrations and simplified wallet systems connect them to on-chain experiences. This structure allows Pudgy to onboard new participants into the crypto ecosystem through familiar consumer interactions, without requiring prior Web3 knowledge, effectively bypassing the technical complexities that still hinder mass adoption.

This strategy echoes the success of prediction markets and similar products that utilize crypto rails in the background but do not demand user understanding of the underlying technology to engage with the brand or its features.

This integrated model makes Pudgy both a gateway to Web3 adoption and a candidate for financialization, evidenced by the proposed Pengu ETF that combines token and NFT exposure.

The brand's strategic shift began in May 2023 with the launch of Pudgy Toys, a line of plushies and collectibles. This initial release, in partnership with toy manufacturer PMI, was a major milestone, generating over $500,000 in sales in the first 48 hours and quickly becoming a #1 trending item on Amazon. This early success paved the way for further retail partnerships.

These partnerships have enabled the brand to capture a significant portion of the collectibles and plush toy market, which has a Total Addressable Market of $13.7 billion in 2025 and is expected to grow to $20.5 billion by 2030.

The other aspect is that every toy sold licenses IP from a Pudgy Penguin NFT holder, who receives perpetual royalties from the sales. This empowers the community and aligns incentives.

Holding a Pudgy Penguins NFT is not just for status; it grants the holder direct IP rights to their individual Pudgy Penguin NFT and provides a way to benefit from the brand's success. This is the core difference between how NFTs were utilized during the 2021 bull market v/s how Pudgy Penguin wants to leverage the non-fungible tokens.

There are two NFT collections within the Pudgy universe:

The Royalty Mechanism

Pudgy Penguin holders have also received significant airdrops, including the PENGU token and the Dymension airdrop, totalling an approximate value of $137,000 at their all-time highs.

This royalty model is a major differentiator for Pudgy Penguins. It directly links the value of the digital asset to the success of the physical brand, creating a win-win situation for both the company and the community. It incentivizes NFT holders to become brand advocates, as they have a direct financial stake in the success of the toy line and other merchandise.

Beyond physical collectibles, gaming is Pudgy Penguins' most direct pathway to onboarding new users into its digital ecosystem. The goal is not to advertise blockchain, but to embed it invisibly within familiar gameplay. All titles prioritize user experience and accessibility, enabling players to participate in Web3 economies without prior crypto knowledge.

This portfolio combines first-party titles developed in-house with third-party collaborations, forming the interactive entry point of the Pudgy flywheel - converting casual players and toy buyers into on-chain participants.

First-Party Games: Building the Pudgyverse

These games are central to the brand's IP and serve as key hubs for the community.

1. Pudgy World

This open-world game on the zkSync blockchain serves as the brand's metaverse hub. It's the destination for buyers of Pudgy Toys, as each physical toy includes a QR code that unlocks unique traits and collectibles for their in-game avatar. The game has successfully onboarded over 160,000 users as of January 2025, proving the effectiveness of its low-friction wallet creation.

2. Pudgy Party

Launched globally in August 2025 in collaboration with Mythical Games, a major Web3 game developer, Pudgy Party is a Fall Guys-style mobile game available on iOS and Android. The game quickly gained traction after launch, surpassing 500,000 downloads within its first two weeks. It features a relatively easy onboarding process that automatically creates a wallet for new players.

3. Vibes TCG

Pudgy Penguins has entered the booming trading card game (TCG) market with Vibes, a game that features both physical and digital cards. This move strategically positions the brand in a market that was valued at $7.8 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to $11.8 billion by 2030.

Developed by Orange Cap Games, Vibes is a strategic card game where players build decks of Penguin characters and use them to battle opponents. The game, which received $2 million in pre-seed angel funding, is available in both physical and digital formats, with each physical pack containing a QR code that can be redeemed for free packs in the digital game.

Traction wise, free cards distributed at events like Comic-Con now command $70-150 each on the secondary market.

The overall gaming strategy for Pudgy Penguins is not to build a single blockbuster game, but a diverse portfolio that can appeal to different audiences across various platforms, from mobile to Telegram.

This approach ensures that the brand is not dependent on a single revenue stream or a single platform's success. This way, the brand converts everyday engagement into Web3 participation - positioning gaming as the largest scalable funnel for crypto onboarding within its IP universe.

PENGU PENGU$0.009012 serves as the social and economic layer connecting all Pudgy verticals. It extends participation beyond NFT holders, enabling anyone to engage with the brand's games, products, and community. The token embodies Luca Netz's “social currency” thesis - that enduring memes evolve into productive, utility-based networks where culture and value reinforce each other.

Launched via airdrop in late 2024, ~23 billion PENGU tokens were distributed to over 6 million wallets, creating one of Web3's broadest user bases. The token functions as native currency across Pudgy World and partner applications, supports staking and validator rewards (including the Pengu Solana Validator), and provides a liquid proxy for exposure to the Pudgy brand. The team can also undertake strategic buybacks of PENGU token via its profits from Phygitals and IP licensing.

PENGU acts as both a simple meme exposure and as a liquid exposure to the Pudgies brand. On the meme side, PENGU's centralized exchange volume (spot and derivatives) share relative to other ‘memes' has grown from 3% at the end of 2024 to >6% now, indicating that it is gaining traction relative to other memes.

The volume share pickup is backed by superior performance metrics as PENGU has outperformed other blue chip memes since inception. This adds to the evidence that the market does not consider PENGU as simple meme exposure.

In terms of the token structure, 710M PENGU is scheduled to unlock each month for 36 months starting in December 2025. These unlocks represent approximately 5% of daily trading volumes.

Pudgy Penguins' growth to date has been driven by phygitals, gaming, and token adoption. To sustain its premium valuation and extend the brand's reach, the team is also making longer-term bets that reinforce its moat. Two stand out: building a consumer-friendly blockchain infrastructure and accelerating global expansion.

Rather than depending on existing, technically complex blockchains, Pudgy has chosen to own part of the stack. Backed by Founders Fund, the team acquired Frame, an NFT-specialized chain, and is building its own consumer blockchain - Abstract Chain.

The thesis: in the long run, the winner won't just have the best tech, but the best interface and brand. Abstract Chain uses account abstraction so users can create wallets with Google or Apple logins, removing the friction that has historically blocked mass adoption.

Current traction remains early (~25k daily active addresses), but this is a strategic, future-oriented bet; control over the chain ensures seamless user experience, deeper token integration, and defensibility if Pudgy's ecosystem scales into the millions.

Current traction remains early (~25k daily active addresses), but this is a strategic, future-oriented bet; control over the chain ensures seamless user experience, deeper token integration, and defensibility if Pudgy's ecosystem scales into the millions.

While most Web3 brands have focused on Western markets, Pudgy Penguins has made a strategic push into Asia. The company launched a separate Asia-Pacific (APAC) division and entered the Japanese collectibles market, which is a $15.4 billion industry. The strategy, according to CEO Luca Netz, is to follow the trend of culture being transmitted from East to West.

Pudgy Penguins is capitalizing on Asia's strong collectible culture and extensive convenience store networks by placing QR-coded photo cards and NFT toys in major retail chains like Don Quijote in Japan and in convenience stores like 7-Eleven and FamilyMart. The brand has also secured key partnerships with major Asian conglomerates like Lotte in Korea and toy collectible companies like Suplay in China.

Pudgy Penguins is extending its brand beyond Web3 through growing links with traditional finance. The project has featured in VanEck and Bitwise ETF campaigns, highlighting its appeal as a Web3 IP with real revenues and liquid token exposure.

In 2025, Canary Capital filed the Pengu ETF, a hybrid vehicle allocating 80-95% to PENGU tokens and 5-15% to Pudgy Penguin NFTs, offering regulated exposure to both the token economy and the IP layer. The ETF received SEC acknowledgement in July 2025, marking one of the first steps toward institutional access to NFT-native brands.

This development signals Pudgy's evolution from consumer IP to an investable digital asset platform bridging retail adoption and traditional markets.

Pudgy's ecosystem links cultural engagement, real-world commerce, and tokenized participation into a single value loop. Each vertical not only drives its own growth but also reinforces the others - converting brand attention into measurable financial and network value.

Figure below illustrates the Pudgy value flywheel. The brand sits at the center, driving four main channels - Media & Entertainment, Phygitals, Gaming, and the Abstract (liquid) brand layer. Each feeds into the NFT and PENGU token economies, which in turn strengthen the brand through liquidity, community ownership, and IP proliferation.

The flywheel is a multi-directional engine where each component feeds the others.

This flywheel captures Pudgy's model of compounding value creation: retail activity funds digital growth; digital engagement drives token demand; and token liquidity reinforces the IP's cultural and financial position.

Pudgy Penguins (NFTs + PENGU tokens) already trades at an implied fully diluted valuation (FDV) of ~$1.1B. This is higher than traditional consumer IP companies of comparable revenue scale, suggesting that the market is assigning Pudgy a tech like growth multiple.

To understand what this means, we can frame Pudgy's current FDV against potential revenue trajectories:

At today's revenue (assumed ~$50M), Pudgy trades at ~22x its revenue - far above Web2 peers such as Hasbro (valued at $11.6 billion, trading at ~2x revenue), or Disney (valued at $184 billion, trading at ~2.5x revenue). The market is clearly pricing Pudgy like a growth-tech hybrid, not a toy company.

This premium reflects the integration of physical, digital, and tokenized value capture - where IP monetization, token liquidity, and community participation are structurally linked. As Pudgy's ecosystem expands through ETF-based access and broader token adoption, this alignment between brand growth and financial exposure is likely to define how the market continues to price the Pudgy IP stack.

Competition

Pudgy Penguins is aiming to be one of the first truly investable NFT-native brands by forging a strong link between Web3 and mainstream consumer culture, leveraging tangible revenues and a community-aligned structure.

Pudgy Penguins illustrates how business model resilience can matter more than speculative hype. Many NFT and meme projects have tried to cross into mainstream adoption, but most lack tangible products and diversified revenue. Pudgy, by contrast, has anchored its growth in real-world sales (toys, games, licensing) while leveraging its Web3 roots for unique holder alignment and tokenized participation.

This foundation has already translated into partnerships across traditional and Web3 spheres - from Walmart and Lufthansa to publishing Children's books (Random House) and entertainment (animated series). The team's stated ambition is to pursue an IPO by 2027, with intermediate steps such as an ETF application that would financialize Pudgy's IP and token stack.

Looking forward, Pudgy's ability to build on its ~$1.1B FDV depends on executing across its multi-vertical flywheel:

Crypto's biggest gains rarely feel obvious at the start. XRP proved that lesson the hard way.

When XRP launched at an ICO price of roughly $0.005–$0.006, it was widely dismissed. Critics questioned adoption, utility, and long-term relevance. Many watched from the sidelines, waiting for “confirmation.”

Today, XRP trades around $1.85, delivering a 300x+ return from ICO levels. Early buyers didn't just profit — they changed their financial trajectory.

Most investors didn't miss XRP because they were late.They missed it because they hesitated.

That same moment is forming again — and this time, it's happening during an upcoming crypto presale where the infrastructure already exists.

XRP didn't succeed because everyone believed in it early. It succeeded because:

Those who acted early accepted uncertainty. Those who waited paid a much higher price.

This exact pattern repeats in every cycle — and it's why experienced investors now prioritize crypto whitelist access instead of chasing listings.

DOGEBALL fits that early-entry profile.

Chinese investors have poured over $188 million into firms working on the digital yuan following the People's Bank of China's decision to let central bank digital currency wallets accrue interest.

Almost a third of that investment went into Lakala, a third-party payment service provider that works with merchant acceptance solutions and hardware wallets, reported the Chinese outlet Securities Times. 

The firm's share price rose by over 12% on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Monday and continued rising on December 30.

The central bank's move to allow state-issued digital currencies to earn interest is a “win-win situation for all parties,” an unnamed Chinese financial expert told China's Shanghai Securities News.

“Enterprises and individuals will receive interest income and enjoy a wider variety of financial products and services. And commercial banks will receive incentives for conducting digital yuan business,” the expert said.

The PBoC says its new action plan covers the period from 2026 to 2030. 2026-30.

As of January 1, 2026, the PBoC said, “banks can independently manage the assets and liabilities of their digital yuan wallet balances.”

Almost a year after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning federal agencies from issuing or endorsing CBDCs, China is trying to breathe new life into its digital yuan project, first unveiled in 2020, vaunting its domestic and cross-border applications.

Earlier this month, a state-owned bank used a private blockchain network to issue $600 million in commercial bonds to buyers who pay in digital yuan.

According to the Chinese state-run media outlet Global Times, the PBoC says cumulative transactions using the digital yuan reached $2.38 trillion at the end of November.

The bank said a total of 3.48 billion CBDC transactions have been processed to date, with 230 million people opening personal wallets.

Share prices in a range of other digital yuan-related companies also soared by over 10% in Shenzhen on Monday. 

These included Hengbao, Cuiwei, ST Rendong, Wuhan Tianyu, and iSoftStone, all companies that work with the PBoC on CBDC-related solutions.

Many of these firms work with hardware or offline wallets, wearable or plastic credit card-type wallet solutions. 

The PBoC envisages these wallets as playing a key role in adoption. 

While most of China's young and urban population use smartphones and have bank accounts, millions of Chinese remain unbanked, with millions more not connected to the internet.

The wallets, already in deployment in the CBDC pilot zone, function offline in areas without internet access. 

They automatically update balances when they come into contact with internet-connected point-of-sale devices or train station ticket barriers.

They have also been designed to let overseas visitors use the digital yuan, with Beijing offering international sports stars and global media representatives the chance to use the CBDC for the first time during the 2022 Winter Olympics.

Beijing is upgrading its digital currency in response to the rise of stablecoins, but the goal is to create a fundamentally different system

In an effort to offer an alternative amid the global rise of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a reference asset, such as a fiat currency – China's central bank is poised to upgrade its digital yuan from a cash equivalent to “digital deposit money”.

Starting from January 1, a new system for the measurement, operation and management of the digital yuan will be officially launched, the People's Bank of China announced on Monday.

Issued by the central bank, the e-CNY is the digital form of China's sovereign currency. First piloted in 2019, the “cash” version of the digital yuan has so far mostly been used in domestic retail transactions, with consumers making payments via digital wallet apps on their smartphones.

The upgrade to a digital deposit money system will create more incentives for banks and their clients to use the e-CNY, as the currency will be able to accrue interest and its reserve requirement ratio will be lowered.

But the new digital yuan will incorporate more emerging technologies than the traditional monetary system, increasing digitisation across all stages of issuance, circulation and payment processes.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know. We've also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is “a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.”

For a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.

Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient. Learn more about some bitcoin basics for new investors.

Bitcoin's closing price hovered around $87,000 this past week. BTC is now down ~8% year-to-date and is sitting ~30% below its record close from October 2025.

Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article.

Ether's closing price stayed between $2,900 and $3,000 this past week. ETH is now down ~12% year-to-date and is ~39% below its record close from August 2025.

XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market.

An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead.

On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC B+), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB ), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch.

On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE A-), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET A-), Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF (FETH ). Here's what investors need to know.

Oops, something went wrong

BLOK gained 32% year-to-date while Bitcoin fell 7% by allocating only 5% to spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Top holding HUT 8 surged 140% as miners benefit from operational leverage independent of Bitcoin price.

Bipartisan crypto legislation expected in 2026 could deepen institutional adoption of blockchain infrastructure.

A recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans' retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.

When Bitcoin slips 7% and your blockchain ETF jumps 32%, you're not betting on Bitcoin. Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSEARCA:BLOK) launched in 2018 as one of the first blockchain-focused funds and has spent 2025 proving that picks-and-shovels exposure to crypto infrastructure beats direct Bitcoin ownership when the digital currency wobbles.

The fund's 32% year-to-date gain through late December crushed the S&P 500's 17% return and left Bitcoin's 7% decline in the dust. Only about 5% of the portfolio sits in spot Bitcoin ETFs like Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NASDAQ:FBTC) and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT). The rest is Bitcoin miners, crypto exchanges, fintech platforms, and chip makers that profit regardless of whether Bitcoin trades at $88,000 or $105,000.

The biggest macro factor driving BLOK forward isn't Bitcoin's price. It's accelerating institutional adoption of blockchain infrastructure, which creates durable revenue streams for the companies BLOK holds. Grayscale's 2026 outlook projects that bipartisan crypto legislation will become U.S. law next year, deepening integration between public blockchains and traditional finance. That regulatory clarity matters more for companies building crypto rails than for Bitcoin itself.

Watch for updates from the SEC and Treasury Department on stablecoin frameworks and digital asset custody rules. These typically arrive quarterly and signal whether institutional capital can flow more freely into blockchain services. When banks and asset managers get clearer rules, companies like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) see trading volume surge and custody businesses expand, regardless of Bitcoin's spot price.

The difference shows up in BLOK's top holdings. Robinhood has soared 213% year-to-date as retail and institutional crypto trading activity picked up. Even as Bitcoin declined, volatility drove revenue for platforms that facilitate trades.

BLOK's largest holding, HUT 8 Corp (NASDAQ:HUT), represents 5.3% of the portfolio and has delivered a 140% gain in 2025. The Bitcoin miner has doubled while Bitcoin fell. The explanation lies in operational leverage. Miners benefit from hash rate efficiency improvements, energy cost optimization, and diversification into AI data center hosting. When Bitcoin's price stabilizes or declines modestly, well-run miners with low production costs can expand margins.

Combined, Bitcoin mining stocks like HUT 8, CleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK), and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR) represent roughly 15% of BLOK's portfolio. Check Amplify's monthly BLOK-Chain commentary for mining economics and hash rate trends. The fund publishes holdings snapshots twice yearly on the Amplify ETFs website.

If BLOK's 0.73% expense ratio feels steep, iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IBLC) charges 0.47% and offers similar blockchain exposure. IBLC holds many of the same miners and exchanges but with a passive indexing approach rather than BLOK's active management. The trade-off: IBLC has just $90 million in assets compared to BLOK's $1.2 billion, which can mean wider bid-ask spreads and less liquidity during volatile periods.

Watch institutional adoption signals from regulators for the macro tailwind, and track Bitcoin mining profitability metrics in BLOK's monthly updates for the micro factor that could drive the next 12 months of performance.

Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don't.

And no, it's got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It's much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it's shocking more people don't adopt the habit given how easy it is.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Haseeb Qureshi, the managing partner at Dragonfly, predicts that by 2026, a major tech player will either integrate or acquire a crypto wallet. This could trigger a wave of adoption from Fortune 100 companies, especially in banking and fintech. These companies might build their own blockchains using existing crypto tech like Avalanche and OP Stack, providing some privacy while still connecting to public chains.

If big tech gets into crypto wallets, it could mean billions of new users. This could change how we handle digital money, making it easier for the average person. But let's not kid ourselves; there are some serious regulatory hurdles to get over.

Integrating crypto wallets won't be as easy as flipping a switch. The EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation has strict rules for stablecoin issuers. They'll need national approvals and must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws. This is likely to raise costs and legal risks for any tech giants wanting to dive into crypto.

In the U.S., things are even more complicated. The SEC classifies tokens as securities, while the CFTC looks after derivatives. This patchwork of regulations makes things difficult for custodial wallets, which will probably face more scrutiny. This means tech companies might push back their wallet launches, making mass adoption a 2027-2028 affair.

Even if they seem small, fintech blockchains could still find their sweet spots. Here are some possibilities:

SME Financing: Blockchain can help SMEs get the loans they need without relying on traditional banks. This market could grow fast, thanks to blockchain's speed and accessibility.

Cross-Border Payments: Instant and cheap payments through blockchain could make it a go-to option for companies wanting to avoid traditional currency conversion fees. The stablecoin market, which saw over $50 trillion in volume in 2025, could rival giants like Visa or PayPal.

Underbanked Populations: Crypto can help unbanked people get access to digital wallets and stablecoins. This is especially true in Southeast Asia and Africa, where mobile-first habits are common.

B2B Payments: Blockchain's infrastructure for B2B payments is growing, with fintechs targeting specific industries like healthcare to offer better solutions.

Insurance Applications: Blockchain could shake up insurance by speeding up claims, reducing fraud, and enabling faster payouts. Startups are already building apps around this.

Looking back at previous fintech innovations can teach us a lot. Here are some lessons:

Regulatory Compliance: Many fintechs failed because they couldn't navigate the regulatory landscape. Blockchain projects need to focus on compliance to avoid the same fate.

Market Validation: Successful projects validate demand before scaling. Blockchain initiatives should ensure users want and will pay for their solutions.

Transparent Economics: Good funding models are essential. Projects should secure ongoing funding to avoid the issues faced by failed startups.

User-Centric Design: Building user-friendly interfaces and addressing security concerns are critical for adoption. Blockchain projects should prioritize user experience to build trust.

User trust and security issues will be crucial in determining how quickly crypto wallets are adopted by big tech. A 2025 report shows that 40% of crypto owners don't trust the safety of their assets. This doubt is heightened by stories of users struggling to access their funds from custodial platforms.

To ease these concerns, tech companies need to focus on security and user-friendly features. Mastercard's recent initiatives highlight the need for easier and safer crypto solutions. Addressing these trust gaps can speed up wallet integration and help with mainstream adoption.

In summary, while the idea of big tech integrating crypto wallets is exciting, it comes with challenges. Regulatory hurdles, user trust issues, and the need for market validation will all be key factors in how things unfold. We'll have to see how this plays out in the ever-changing crypto landscape.

Crypto prices kicked off the U.S. trading day with a modest rally, with bitcoin BTC$87,400.28 re-taking the $89,000 level after having dropped to $87,000 one day ago.

Bitcoin being higher during U.S. market hours is a notable shift after the past month in which prices have seemingly dropped every single day during the U.S. session. Indeed, bitcoin has seen about a 20% cumulative decline during the American trading day over the last 30 days, according to Velo data.

As for Wednesday's small advance, Coinglass data shows bitcoin open interest denominated in BTC has fallen since the U.S. market opened, dropping from 514,000 BTC to 511,000. This decline in open interest alongside rising price action points to short positions being closed rather than new leveraged longs being added.

Crypto-related stocks like Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD) and Circle (CRCL) were all little-changed, as were the broader S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Year-end de-risking, record ETF outflows, and thin holiday liquidity are keeping the market subdued, according to Wintermute strategist Jasper de Mare.

All three major crypto assets remain below key systematic levels, with price action largely driven by rollover flows and tax-related positioning, he continued.

Spot bitcoin ETFs saw $19.3 million in net outflows on Monday, marking the seventh straight day of redemptions. In mid-December alone, $1.29 billion was pulled from bitcoin funds, led by a $157 million single-day outflow from BlackRock's IBIT, according to de Mare. While IBIT has recorded $25 billion in inflows year-to-date, he said December's risk-off rotation may reflect tax-loss harvesting. He added that altcoins, largely outside the IRS's wash-sale rules, have not shown the same selling pressure.

On the derivatives side, over $27 billion in BTC and ETH options expired on Dec. 26 in the largest single-day expiry in crypto history, according to Deribit data. Funding rates and open interest — which peaked at $70 billion in June — have steadily declined into year-end.

BTC's 7-day realized volatility fell sharply into Dec. 25, but has started to pick up, driven by erratic intraday swings. De Mare advised traders to avoid overfitting short-dated signals until institutional flows return in early January.

Long-term holders (LTH) of bitcoin BTC$87,400.28 have shifted back into accumulation for the first time since July. 

LTHs, defined as entities that have held bitcoin for at least 155 days, have accumulated roughly 33,000 BTC on a 30-day net basis, according to onchain data analysts checkonchain. 

Selling from LTHs has been one of the two of the largest sources of sell pressure this year along with miner capitulation.

LTHs were a major source of distribution, while miners are typically forced to sell bitcoin while mining at a loss.

Since it takes 155 days for short-term holders to transition into long-term holders, this suggests that buyers from the past six months are now becoming long-term holders and are outpacing the distribution. 

LTHs sold more than 1 million BTC during the 36% correction from October, marking the largest sell-pressure event from this cohort since 2019, a period that ultimately coincided with the bear market low that year, with bitcoin at around $3,200. 

The October sell-off was the third LTH distribution phase since the current cycle began in 2023. The first occurred in March 2024 when bitcoin reached $73,000 and over 700,000 BTC were sold, while the second took place that November when bitcoin reached $100,000 and more than 750,000 BTC were distributed by LTHs.

The US and China both want to be the first to launch a powerful AI data center beyond Earth, but the latter has seemingly jumped into the lead.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

During the 1960s, the space race was about who would be the first to leave boot prints on the Moon. Fast-forward several decades into an era in which artificial intelligence is slowly taking over the realm of technology, and version 2.0 of the countdown to takeoff has countries (and corporations vying) for something much closer to Earth. Now, the race is on to see who can launch AI infrastructure into low-Earth orbit.

It seems that China is currently in the lead when it comes to what are now being called space supercomputers. At the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, researchers are pushing to cget an AI data center (which involves 10,000 high-performance computing cards) off the ground. And they are not alone. On the other side of the planet, Silicon Valley tech moguls like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are catching up, funneling hundreds of billions of dollars into their own orbiting AI initiatives. Whoever manages to keep this afloat without too many glitches could lead the future of computing in space.

Bezos and his Blue Origin team have been developing their own iteration of an AI data hub for more than a year. Musk anticipates upgrading Starlink satellites to handle AI computing payloads. As for Pichai, his recently revealed Project Suncatcher, which places micro-racks of machines on board satellites and will be scaled up if the trial run is successful. Potentially ahead of all of them, however, is Nvidia-backed startup Starcloud. 

With an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit riding their Starcloud-1 satellite past Earth's atmosphere just last month, the company not only launched an 80-gigabyte chip (which is 100 times more powerful than any other chip than has ever been in outer space), but was also able to train the NanoGPT large language model from terra firma. NanoGPT is the first AI ever trained in space, and was the brainchild of OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. Starcloud-1 is now using the Google's open LLM Gemma to run and query responses, making it the first time an Nvidia GPU has powered an LLM from space. 

AI infrastructure in space could offer Earth relief from the enormous amounts of energy and water that the controversial technology devours each year, not to mention from the greenhouse gases it expels. Starcloud data centers, for instance, will burn ten times less electricity by using solar power.

“Gigawatt-scale orbital data centers are among the most ambitious space projects of all time,” the Starcloud team said in a white paper published last year. “We are convinced that orbital data centers are feasible, economically viable, and necessary to realize the potential of AI, the most important technology of the 21st century, in a rapid and sustainable manner.”

Meanwhile, China continues its pursuit of space-based AI dominance. A recent collaboration between Guoxing Aerospace and the research institute Zhejiang Lab deployed 12 satellites into low-Earth orbit. This was the first computing constellation in space, whose AI model (which combines 5 peta operations per second, with 8 billion parameters) translates to commercial applications and is laying the foundations for what could be an actual orbiting supercomputer. Aerospace company Zhongke Tiansuan, which was born from ICT, launched an upgraded space computer with high-performing chips as far back as 2022—though its power cannot surpass Starcloud.  Zhongke Tiansuan's satellite has remained stable in orbit for over a thousand days.

While satellites and hypersensitive computer chips face perils ranging from the intense vibrations of rocket launches to the microgravity, extreme temperatures, and exposure to highly energetic charged particles (from the solar wind) of space, competing labs seek to mitigate the effects of these factors. Many see an actual supercomputer being operational in space by the 2030s. The question is: Who will be the first to blast off?

Anecdotal stories suggesting that weight-loss drugs can help people shake long-standing addictions have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.

Over a dozen randomized clinical studies testing whether GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic can suppress addiction are now under way, and neuroscientists are working out how these weight-loss drugs act on brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation.

Scientists warn that the research is still in its early stages, but some researchers and physicians are excited, as no truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades.

Single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (SCP) is an emerging technology in which hundreds or thousands of proteins can be directly quantified in typical human cells. As the proteins detected and quantified by SCP are heavily biased toward proteins of highest abundance, chromatin proteins are an attractive target for analysis. To this end, I applied SCP to the analysis of cancer cells treated with mocetinostat, a class specific histone deacetylase inhibitor. I find that 16 PTMs can be confidently identified and localized with high site specificity in single cells. Drug treatment reveals apparent heterogeneity in the abundance and distribution of the accumulated acetylation sites in histone tails. While other techniques exist to measure histone modifications in single human cells, the approach presented here allows simultaneous quantification of hundreds of proteins, allowing phenotypic insight as well as epigenetic inferences in each individual cell. All raw and processed data described in this study has been made publicly available through the ProteomeXchange/MASSIVE repository system as MSV000093434.

All Bruker. d files and Proteome Discoverer processed data have been deposited at the MASSIVE.UCSD.EDU public repository and are publicly available as accession MSV000093434. All source data for all figures are provided as a tabulated Excel spreadsheet as Supplementary Data 1.

Topaz is frequently subjected to heat treatment and irradiation to enhance colour, particularly to produce the market's most preferred salmon pink and sky blue varieties. However, an insufficient description of these processes can lead to fraudulent practices. This experimental and forensic mineralogical and gemmological study investigates eighteen heat-treated topaz samples from Ouro Preto (OP) and Caraí (CA), Brazil, using electron microanalysis, LA-ICP-MS, Raman, and optical absorption spectroscopy before and after heat treatment at various temperatures. The most significant optical changes were observed at 300 °C when the CA sample lost its colour from sky blue to colourless, while OP samples retained their imperial orange colour up to 500 °C before transitioning to pink at 700 °C. Chemically, the CA samples are rich in F (> 1.8 apfu) with low trace element concentration (Fe ≤ 125 ppm, Ge ≤ 153 ppm), falling to the pegmatite and greisen field of topaz origin. The OP samples contain less F (1.4–1.5 apfu) but higher trace element contents (Cr up to 204 ppm, Ti up to 115 ppm, Fe, Mn, Ge < 64 ppm), consistent with a hydrothermal origin. Raman spectra show no significant inter-sample variation, but their luminescence spectra feature strong differences: Mn acts as the luminophore in CA samples, while Cr3+ centers dominate in OP samples. The optical absorption spectra reveal distinct thermal responses. The OP samples heated to temperatures ≥ 500 °C developed new absorption bands at 530–532 nm, consequently resulting in a visible pink colour. On the other hand, the CA spectra exhibit strong absorption in the NIR region; the unheated sample has a broad absorption band at 634 nm, responsible for the sky-blue colour of topaz. Heating ≥ 300 °C eliminates the transmission window in the blue to cyan regions, removing blue colouration. These thermal-optical signatures serve as indicators of heat treatment in topaz declared from these two localities. Moreover, the combination of spectroscopic methods, which we successfully applied in recognizing heat treatment on the studied samples, provides a systematic approach for identifying treatment in topaz and potentially other gemstones.

Charge density waves, electronic crystals that form within a host solid, have long been theorized to melt into a spatially textured electronic liquid. Although such liquid charge density waves have not been previously observed, they may be central to the phase diagrams of correlated electron systems, including high-temperature superconductors and quantum Hall states. In 1T-TaS2, a promising material for hosting a liquid charge density wave, a structural phase transition hinders observation. Here we use femtosecond light pulses to bypass this transition, revealing how topological defect dynamics govern hidden charge density wave correlations. Following photoexcitation, charge density wave diffraction peaks broaden azimuthally, indicating the emergence of a hexatic state. At elevated temperatures, photoexcitation fully destroys both translational and orientational orders, leaving only a ring of diffuse scattering—the hallmark of a liquid charge density wave. These findings offer compelling evidence for a defect-unbinding transition to a charge density wave liquid. More broadly, this approach demonstrates a route to uncover electronic phases obscured by intervening transitions in thermal equilibrium.

7/10

It's hard to overstate just how seismic an impact the Commodore 64 had on home computing. Launched in 1982, the 8-bit machine—iconic in its beige plastic shell with integrated keyboard—went on to become the best-selling personal computer of all time. Despite the success, manufacturer Commodore International folded in 1994, with rights to the name floating around for years.

Then, retro gaming YouTuber Christian “Peri Fractic” Simpson got the bright idea to buy the company wholesale and re-create its most important piece of hardware. This isn't the first effort to resurrect the Commodore 64, but this particular reborn rig might be the best attempt yet. It's a near-perfect replica of that 43-year old titan, one that looks, sounds, and feels like the original. It is, by any measure, a frankly extraordinary achievement—but it's not going to be for everyone.

Dubbed the Commodore 64 Ultimate, the old-new (or new-old?) device looks like a relic of the '80s—and I mean that as a compliment. It bears the same all-in-one wedge-shaped design as the original, the same chunky keys, even the same overall color palette for the beige model (it's also available in a transparent “Starlight” model with RGB lighting and, for early buyers, a golden “Founder's Edition”). If it weren't for the distinctly un-yellowed plastic shell, it could be mistaken at a glance for the real thing, leftover stock straight from 1982.

For some, that will be the most compelling thing about the C64U—it is the real thing, sort of. At its core, this is a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device, an approach most often seen to re-create classic game consoles (as with the recent Analogue3D “remake” of the Nintendo 64). To strip the idea right back, FPGAs tell one chipset to pretend it's another and, ideally, allow for performance near-identical to the original machine at a hardware level, rather than through emulation.

This goes a step further, boasting a heap of physical connectors and ports that allow you to use authentic peripherals from the '80s. If you still have your original joysticks or datasette to hand, they should all work as they did back in the day. For fans, collectors, or anyone who has their original Commodore gadgets stashed in a garage somewhere, that's a fantastic proposition. The revived Commodore International hasn't quite put the classic hardware back into production, but this comes damned close.

The C64U makes a few concessions to modernity. There are a pair of USB-A ports at the rear, where you'll connect the cassette-shaped USB stick that comes with each unit, pre-loaded with games, software demos, music that makes use of the C64's still legendary audio capabilities, and GEOS, a graphical user interface—more on that later. There's also built-in Wi-Fi and an Ethernet port, allowing access to bulletin boards and the Commoserve file server, and HDMI output. Even there, though, there's still the option for connecting to a CRT monitor, making the additions feel more like a tweak than an overhaul.

This dedication to the past goes too far at times, with elements painfully authentic to the point of being actively obtuse in 2025—original '80s labels on the casing, such as ""H-L"" and ""RF"" (how the C64 connected to CRT monitors or TVs), or ""USER PORT"" where the HDMI, USB, and Ethernet ports are. And, despite the presence of those USB ports, you can't use a modern mouse with the C64U—you'll either need a period piece or set the WASD keys to act as a virtual joystick whenever you might need to manipulate an onscreen cursor. There's almost a sense of resentment here, as if anything too modern would be a desecration of the holy hardware, and any concessions made to ensure the C64U is even halfway usable with present-day displays or add-ons were made reluctantly.

The Commodore International of 2025, leaning into its deliberately dated approach, is another fascinating aspect of the Commodore 64 Ultimate. The company has labelled itself the “digital detox brand,” positioning the C64U as a bulwark against the distracting, loud, attention-grabbing devices we're all accustomed to now. That actually appeals—I'm particularly sick of Windows cramming adverts into every corner of the OS and foisting unwanted AI features where they don't belong (and then warning people not to use them anyway), so maybe a trip back to how computing used to be done would be a virtual balm. Unfortunately, that means travelling back to a time before I was actually born, and the temporal whiplash is brutal.

Be forewarned: If you do not have first-hand experience of the original Commodore 64, a deep and abiding love for its genuinely ground-breaking era of home computing, or a burning curiosity for retro technology, the C64 Ultimate is far from welcoming, and probably not for you. I wasn't around for the original, so I have no innate nostalgia to lure me back in, but I can at least muster up that burning curiosity. Yet even then, getting used to the C64 environment is a steep learning curve.

Boot up the C64U, and you're greeted by a re-creation of the C64's menu. Here, you can type in operation commands just as you would back in the day, using the BASIC programming language. Problem: I don't have the first clue about BASIC. However, in what is possibly the greatest throwback of all, the C64U comes with a spiral-bound, 273-page user guide. It is an absolute tome. Somewhat surprisingly, it's not a reprint of anything that came with the original, but rather a tailored guide to what the C64U does, where it differs from the C64, and how to get to grips with the computer's capabilities. Equal parts history book and instruction manual, it starts out teaching you some simple commands and builds up to teaching you how to code. I'm still very much working my way through it, but that tactile approach—referring to the book, trying something out on the computer, back and forth—is a great touch.

If you don't fancy having to do homework, the C64U's own default menu, accessed at any time with a flick of the multifunction power button on the right-hand side of the unit, is a simple list of options and settings. Hit RETURN to go into any section—say, “Video Setup” to adjust whether the C64U outputs in original resolution, in PAL or NTSC modes (surprisingly important, given some games will only work with one display standard or the other), or a crystal clear 1080p with scanlines removed—and back out to save any changes to the system's flash memory. It's still a minimalist approach, but feels fairly intuitive.

This is also where you can start playing around with some of the other modern touches of the C64U, like how to leverage its far greater power. Well, “greater” in comparison to 1982. Spec-wise, this isn't going to threaten any more modern machine, but running on an AMD Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA chip and packing 128-MB DDR2 RAM—compared to the 64 KB of the C64—it blows its inspiration out of the water. While at baseline it replicates the performance of the 1982 hardware, meaning it operates as if there's only the original 64 KB were there, you can menu-dive to activate a virtualized RAM Expansion Unit, or activate a “Turbo Boost” to accelerate the clock speed to a lightning-fast (in this particular context) 64 MHz.

Then there's GEOS, loaded on that cassette-shaped USB. Navigate to the “Disk File Browser” on the C64U's menu to boot it up. This is the closest to a Windows or macOS type experience on the Commodore, a “regular” desktop environment. It has folders! And icons! It's likely the most comfortable way to use the C64U for anyone who wasn't there for the original—although if you don't have a compatible mouse, you'll have to get used to navigating it with WASD and RETURN to click.

However, while GEOS is clearer than BASIC, it's still not as smooth as more modern graphical user interface (GUI) operating systems. I've found it a little confusing switching between programs, for instance, as they seem to need to be mounted and then loaded into the OS before opening them. Even writing that back from my notes, preparing this review, I'm honestly not sure if I've been doing it correctly. Plus, when something doesn't work—failing to create a new document in GEOS apps like its word processor or paint suite was a low point—there's rarely an explanation of why it hasn't.

Away from “proper” computing, the C64 was a pioneer for home gaming, and that's one area where the C64U does feel extremely accessible. The USB drive includes a host of classic and modern retro-style games, and more can be added in the form of disk images if you have them.

The C64U can run games in NTSC or PAL format—there's a whole other rabbit hole to dive down here, but some games ran better, worse, or not at all depending on the version, and because the C64U replicates the original hardware performance, games can present the same issues here—but switching display modes is simple through the main menu. Once you've chosen what you want to play, an internal speaker mimics the sounds of the original tape or disk drive as it loads up, which is a nice—and extremely nerdy—touch.

Rating: 7/10

The downside is that in authentically re-creating the performance of the original disk or tape drives, it's also authentically slow—you can be waiting whole minutes for games to load (the same goes for programs in GEOS). Maybe it's part of that digital detox approach, an attempt to teach us whippersnappers younger than the C64 itself some patience, but I wouldn't have minded losing that particular aspect of the traditional Commodore experience.

Ultimately—pun slightly intended—that's the tricky line the C64U has to walk. Yes, it's tremendously accurate to the experience of using a Commodore 64 four decades ago, but who does that serve in 2025? Its proposition of a return to distraction-free computing could be a distinctive selling point, but I'm not sure that this much of a throwback, with its ponderous nature and leisurely pace of doing anything, is going to win many converts. Even for those with the necessary levels of nostalgia, if that hankering is mainly for the C64's games, this is probably too much—emulation or those earlier C64 hardware re-creations that focused more on gaming are probably better options.

Despite all that, the Commodore 64 Ultimate really is an exceptional piece of kit. It's a beautifully crafted love letter to the groundbreaking original, and a reminder that there's a different way of doing things on a computer, and what they're for, than what Microsoft and Apple offer now. Returning hardcore enthusiasts will undoubtedly love it—but it's hard to see the C64U reshaping the world as the original did.

Take yourself back to 2017. Get Out and The Shape of Water were playing in theaters, Zohran Mamdani was still known as rapper Young Cardamom, and the Trump administration, freshly in power, was eager to prop up its favored energy sources.

That year, the administration introduced a series of subsidies for struggling coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants, which were facing increasing price pressures from gas and cheap renewables. The plan would have put taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars. It didn't work.

In subsequent years, the nuclear industry kept running into roadblocks. Three nuclear plants have shut down since 2020, while construction of two of the only four reactors started since 2000 was put on hold after a decade and billions of dollars following a political scandal. Coal, meanwhile, continued its long decline: It comprises just 17 percent of the US power mix, down from a high of 45 percent in 2010.

Now, both of these energy sources are getting second chances. The difference this time is the buzz around AI, but it isn't clear that the outcome will be much different.

Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.

Throughout 2025, the Trump administration has not just gone all in on promoting nuclear, but positioned it specifically as a solution to AI's energy needs. In May, the president signed a series of executive orders intended to boost nuclear energy in the US, including ordering 10 new large reactors to be constructed by 2030. A pilot program at the Department of Energy created as a result of May's executive orders—coupled with a serious reshuffling of the country's nuclear regulator—has already led to breakthroughs from smaller startups. Energy secretary Chris Wright said in September that AI's progress “will be accelerated by rapidly unlocking and deploying commercial nuclear power.”

The administration's push is mirrored by investments from tech companies. Giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have inked numerous deals in recent years with nuclear companies to power data centers; Microsoft even joined the World Nuclear Association. Multiple retired reactors in the US are being considered for restarts—including two of the three that have closed in the past five years—with the tech industry supporting some of these arrangements. (This includes Microsoft's high-profile restart of the infamous Three Mile Island, which is also being backed by a $1 billion loan from the federal government.) It's a good time for both the private and public sectors to push nuclear: public support for nuclear power is the highest it's been since 2010.

Despite all of this, the practicalities of nuclear energy leave its future in doubt. Most of nuclear's costs come not from onerous regulations but from construction. Critics are wary of juiced-up valuations for small modular reactor companies, especially those with deep connections to the Trump administration. An $80 billion deal the government struck with reactor giant Westinghouse in October is light on details, leaving more questions than answers for the industry. And despite high-profile tech deals that promise to get reactors up and running in a few years, the timelines remain tricky.

Still, insiders say that this year marked a turning point.

“Nuclear technology has been seen by proponents as the neglected and unjustly villainized hero of the energy world,” says Brett Rampal, a nuclear power expert who advises investors. “Now, full-throated support from the president, Congress, tech companies, and the common person feels like generational restitution and a return to meritocracy.”

Nuclear isn't the only form of energy that seems to be getting a second start thanks to AI. In April, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to boost US coal to power AI; Wright has since ordered two plants that were slated to be retired to stay online via emergency order. The administration has also scrambled to make it easier to run coal plants, in particular focusing on doing away with pollution regulation. These efforts—and the endless demand for energy from AI—may have extended a lifeline to coal: More than two dozen generating units that were scheduled to retire across the country are now staying online, separate from Wright's order, with some getting yearslong reprieves.

A complete recovery for the industry, however, is still an open question. A recent analysis of the US power sector finds that almost all of the 10 largest utilities in the US are significantly slashing their reliance on coal. (Many of these utilities, the analysis shows, have been looking to replace coal-fired power with more nuclear.) Part of what may keep coal on its downward track in the US—albeit with an extended lifeline—is simply its bad PR. The tech of the future, after all, isn't supposed to pollute the air and drive temperatures up; while AI has significantly set Big Tech back from its climate-change goals, these companies are theoretically still committed to not frying the planet.

And while tech giants are scrambling to align themselves with nuclear, which does not produce direct carbon emissions, no big companies have openly partnered with a struggling coal plant or splashed out a press release about how they're seeking to produce more energy from coal. (Some retired coal plants are being proposed as sites for data centers, powered by natural gas.) Some companies are trying to develop technologies that would capture carbon emissions from coal plants, but outlook for those technologies is bearish following some high-profile failures.

“Emissions [are] always going to factor into the discussion” for investors, says Rampal.

The Oval Office playing favorites with energy sources doesn't mean that it can defeat the market. Utility-scale solar and onshore wind remain some of the cheapest forms of energy around, even without government subsidies. And while Washington looks backward, other countries are continuing massive buildouts of renewable energy. China's emissions have taken a nosedive over the past 18 months, thanks in large part to a huge expansion of renewable energy. Coal's use in the power sector is declining due to competition from renewables, while nuclear made up only a small slice of total power use. If the administration's goal is to defeat China on AI, it might want to start by taking a look at its energy playbook.

Keeping a daily diary doesn't come easily to most people, but it takes less effort than you might imagine. It could also become a meaningful way to reflect and grow as a person.

For more than 10 years, I've written a few words every morning, and what I've learned from this practice has changed my life. My only regret is not starting sooner.

If you're interested in adding a daily journaling practice to your life, these tips and tools can help you not only get started, but also stick with it.

My diary is a tool for clearing out my thoughts, recording details of my life that are sometimes useful to know later, and reflecting. The value in reflecting, however, only became apparent after I'd been writing for several years and could look back on my life to see it from a different perspective.

I've always been very hard on myself. I don't make excuses, and I look upon my failures with consternation. Whenever I've gone back and read a series of diary entries from low points in my life, I've been able to view them with an outsider's perspective. I can see more clearly just how tough things were, or how many things went wrong at once, or the gravity of a single event that I might have downplayed in the moment. This reflection has led me to be more compassionate toward myself—and toward others. I have learned to cut myself some slack.

You might discover something else, whether a pattern of behavior or something you want to change. Or maybe with hindsight you realize the things you thought you wanted to change don't need changing at all. Journaling sheds light on all these things.

Memory is fickle. The personal self-reflection that we do entirely in our heads differs wildly from what we can do with notes. In short, that's why I've kept up my daily writing for more than 10 years.

Start every diary entry with the date and your location. Why bother if your computer or phone can add them automatically? A few reasons. First, you will never stare at a blank page, and you will always know how to start. Second, metadata can get bungled over time or during file transfers, so it's more reliable to add them manually. Third, typing the date and location into the diary entry itself ensures that those very important pieces of information are searchable.

What else should you write? A diary entry can be a simple brain dump. That's what I do. Other things worth mentioning are major events, strong emotions, and hopes and dreams.

If following a method helps, you could try gratitude journaling. Some parents I know ask their kids at the end of the day to reflect on their ""rose, thorn, bud""—one highlight from the day, one difficulty, and something they're looking forward to—which is an equally good diary formula.

The best trick I have for forming a new habit is to tie it to an existing one. Find a habit that you already have and combine it with a few minutes of daily writing.

I journal every morning as soon as I have coffee in front of me. My coffee-making routine is non-negotiable, immovable, set in stone, seven days a week. Even when I stay in a hotel, I bring a travel coffee maker with me, and I write in my diary while drinking the coffee.

As a backstop, I also have a recurring task in my to-do list for 8:45 every morning that tells me to journal. In the event that I got distracted while I was drinking my coffee, a notification appears on my phone to remind me to write.

Should you use an app or paper? It's a matter of personal preference. The most important thing is you choose something that you will use. If you love paper notebooks, use them.

That said, digital journals have several benefits. For one, you can back up your writing so it will be safe in the event of a fire, flood, or other catastrophe. Paper gets destroyed easily. Another benefit is you can type on a keyboard or on your phone, dictate with your voice, and add multimedia, like photos and links. Password-protection and encryption options prevent snoops from reading your digital diaries. You can choose to keep them locked forever after you die or hand over the password after death. Finally, digital diaries are searchable. If you want to revisit something from your past, all you need to do is type in a few keywords or jump to a date.

If you're convinced of the superiority of electronic files but prefer writing by hand, use a digital notebook.

Although I'm enthusiastic about keeping a diary, I don't recommend journaling apps. Their prompts and suggestions make journaling needlessly complicated and get in the way of you writing.

What I recommend instead is using a note-taking app that works on all your devices. Note-taking apps typically have options to save to simple formats, such as .txt, .rtf, .md, which helps future-proof your files. In other words, if the app you use is discontinued, you can export your journals to one of these tried-and-true file types and import them elsewhere without much hassle.

I use an open-source app called Joplin, and I bring my own storage. Formerly, I used Evernote, but I didn't like the direction it was taking and transferred all my files to Joplin easily enough. Other perfectly good note-taking apps are Microsoft OneNote, Simplenote, Obsidian, among others.

If journaling apps work for you, by all means use them! Apple's Journal app certainly is convenient, and so is Google's Journal, though it's only available on select devices. For my taste, however, they're too much like scrapbooks, always asking if you want to add photos or recorded activities (like a run), or answer a writing prompt. You don't need all that. It's clutter. Just write what's on your mind or what you did yesterday, even if it's only a few sentences. Pretty soon, you'll get the hang of it. It might even change your life.

Every audio system requires amplification. In a traditional hi-fi set-up, the loudspeakers are always “passive”—which is to say, they don't produce their own power. Instead, they must receive an amplified audio signal from an external source, aptly called an amplifier, in order to do their thing. Even in a more modern, self-contained audio system (like the Sonos Era 100, for example), the drivers that produce the sound must be amplified in order to function—this just all happens in a singular box rather than across hi-fi separates.

But if you've heard about amplifiers, you may have also heard about preamplifiers (often referred to as “preamps”) and wondered where they fit into an audio system, and whether you need one. Let's answer those questions, shall we?

An audio signal needs plenty of attention before it's ready to be amplified—so ultimately the question “what does a preamp do?” broadly contains its own answer. A preamplifier takes care of everything that needs to be done before the audio signal (sent from the music source) is amplified and sent onwards to the system's speakers.

In a self-contained audio system like the Sonos speaker, the preamplifier and the amplifier are in the same enclosure, along with the speaker drivers that actually deliver the sound. Even in a more sophisticated hi-fi separates setup, the preamplifier part of proceedings is still often handled out of sight, within the amplifier. These types of amps are known as “integrated amplifiers” and contain both preamp and amplifier functionality.

However, some people prefer to separate out this functionality, which is when you may come across a preamplifier as its own piece of equipment, paired with a power amplifier. In these cases, the preamplifier allows you to select the source of music you'd like to hear (the majority have a selection of input options in order to support a system with multiple sources), and also set and adjust the volume.

The preamp also ensures the audio signal is at “line level”—that is, the standard voltage strength of an audio signal transmitted between components—and sends it on to be amplified, ready to be moved onwards, finally, to the speakers.

Hi-fi orthodoxy says that individual functions in any system should be kept as separate as possible if the best results are to be achieved. The thinking goes that, by keeping electrical activity as shielded and self-contained as possible, the audio signal has the best shot at remaining as pure and uncolored as possible.

By dividing the preamplifier and the amplifier functions into separate boxes, there should be a reduction in electrical noise and interference around the signal compared to having it all crammed into a single box.

This two-box arrangement is commonly known as “pre/power”—the previously mentioned pre-amplification and power amplification—and can safely be interpreted as a sign of a listener who takes things very seriously indeed. A system that also separates out digital-to-analogue conversion into a self-contained enclosure is more serious still—and by this point you're looking at a system that occupies a lot of space, not to mention requires quite a few mains sockets too.

There are always exceptions, though, and in this instance they concern record players, or turntables. Turntable technology, of course, is quite elderly—and the audio signal that a record player produces is so feeble it's virtually non-existent. This means it requires an awful lot of amplification even to get your vinyl sound to the point that it's at that required “line level”—so if you want to use a turntable, it will require a whole lot of preamplification of its own.

Confusingly, the dedicated turntable amplifiers that help make this happen are sometimes also called preamplifiers—but they're much more commonly known as “phono stages.” These are a very specific type of preamp, which only work to amplify a turntable's audio signal and nothing else.

Naturally, the very serious listener buys a standalone phono stage to amplify the signal from a record player to line level before it reaches the next part of a system. But you will also find phono stages built into other pieces of equipment, including the turntable itself, or an integrated amplifier.

The differences between solid state and tube preamps are, broadly speaking, the same as the differences between any solid state audio component and its tube (or valve) equivalent. Fundamentally, they concern cost, performance and longevity.

Where “cost” and “longevity” are concerned, solid state wins every time. A solid state preamp should really require no maintenance whatsoever beyond the occasional dusting, and certainly has no consumable parts. A tube preamplifier, on the other hand, needs real care taking of it, not to mention it will exhaust its tubes at some point, meaning they will have to be replaced.

Performance, though, is a rather more subjective topic. The stereotype that says solid state preamps sound clean and detailed, while tube preamps sound warm and lush is a stereotype for a reason, which means you'll have to consider the sort of sonic signature you prefer, as well as your outlay, when it comes to choosing a preamp.

If we are being entirely accurate, the answer is yes, every audio system requires a preamplifier within it, in order to do all of the work we've spoken about—namely in helping every audio signal that goes through it to the necessary line level. So if you have any form of working audio setup, be that a Bluetooth speaker or full hi-fi system, you will actually already have one.

Whether you need a separate preamplifier in your system really depends on how serious you want to get about your system. Hi-fi enthusiasts and audiophiles would say that it's a worthy investment, but upgrading your system's integrated amplifier (or indeed, upgrading from a wireless speaker to an entry-level hi-fi separates system), could be a good start, if your budget won't stretch to a full system of individual components just yet.

The audio industry being what it is, it's possible to pay anything from “not very much at all” to “fast German saloon car” money for a preamplifier. Here are four of the best—two preamplifiers, two phono stages—at different price points that all offer excellent performance at the money.

Fosi Audio

Amazon

Chinese brand Fosi Audio is making quite a name for itself where affordable-yet-impressive stereo products are concerned—and the P4 is just the latest example. This compact preamplifier has three line-level inputs, bass and treble controls and a volume control - and also features a ‘bypass' function that prevents the audio signal visiting the tone controls in an effort to keep it as pure as possible. At $129 it's the perfect way to discover what a properly implemented preamplifier can do for your system.

Cambridge Audio

Amazon

British audio savant Cambridge is no stranger to well-sorted hi-fi components, and with the $1099 CXN100, it's managed to pack in extended functionality while remaining true to the whole concept of “separation.” Here's a well-specified preamplifier with a host of physical and wireless connectivity, the necessary digital-to-analogue conversion chops to make sense of those digital signals and, by way of an encore, network streaming capability that means it can access your favorite music streaming services or any content you may have on a local network.

Rega

Audio Advice

For just over $200, this unassuming little phono stage is capable of putting an absolute rocket up the hopelessly weak signal output by your record player—all while maintaining the complete integrity of that signal as it does so. Nothing added, nothing taken away, just a signal brought to the point that a regular line-level system can make sense of it. And the Fono Mini A2D mk2 even includes a USB output in case you want to archive your precious vinyl to a computer hard-drive or similar.

Vertere

Safe & Sound

Got an expensive, high-performance turntable as part of your expensive, high-performance stereo system? Then what you need is arguably the best pound-for-pound phono stage out there—the $1895 Vertere Phono 1 mkII L. When it comes to precision, detail retrieval, rhythmic expression, dynamic potency, and all the other aspects of sound that make the vinyl format so prized, the Vertere has them in spades. You'll have never heard your records sound so complete and so direct as when the Phono 1 mkII L gets hold of them.

[Editor's Note: Agents of Transformation is an independent GeekWire series and 2026 event, underwritten by Accenture, exploring the people, companies, and ideas behind the rise of AI agents.]

It was “like bringing a Porsche into a world of Model Ts.” 

That's what Microsoft said in its 1990 annual report about the shift from MS-DOS to Windows. But the bigger breakthrough for the company wasn't the graphical interface. It was Windows' ability to serve as a platform for applications made by others.

Windows 3.0, released that year, made third-party software easier to find and launch, and offered developers a clear bargain: build to Microsoft's specs, and your software would become a first-class citizen on the computers that were arriving “on every desk and in every home,” as the company's original mission statement put it. 

Thirty-five years later, AI feels less like a car and more like a rocket ship. But Microsoft is hoping that Windows can once again serve as the platform where it all takes off.

A new framework called Agent Launchers, introduced earlier this month as a preview in the latest Windows Insider build, lets developers register agents directly with the operating system. They can describe an agent through what's known as a manifest, which then lets the agent show up in the Windows taskbar, inside Microsoft Copilot, and across other apps.

The long-term promise for Windows users is autonomous assistants that operate on their behalf, directly on their machines. Beyond routine tasks like assembling a PDF or organizing files, agents could monitor email and calendars to resolve scheduling conflicts, or scan documents across multiple apps to pull together a briefing for an upcoming meeting.

Achieving that level of autonomy requires more than just a clever interface. It will take deep, persistent memory that operates more like the human brain.

“We are now entering a phase where we build rich scaffolds that orchestrate multiple models and agents; account for memory and entitlements; enable rich and safe tools use,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a blog post this week looking ahead to 2026. “This is the engineering sophistication we must continue to build to get value out of AI in the real world.”

Elements of this are already emerging elsewhere.

But Microsoft's Windows team is betting that agents tightly linked to the operating system will win out over ones that merely run on top of it, just as a new class of Windows apps replaced a patchwork of DOS programs in the early days of the graphical operating system. 

Microsoft 365 Copilot is using the Agent Launchers framework for first-party agents like Analyst, which helps users dig into data, and Researcher, which builds detailed reports. Software developers will be able to register their own agents when an app is installed, or on the fly based on things like whether a user is signed in or paying for a subscription.

The parallels to the past only go so far. Traditional PC applications ran in their own windows, worked with their own files, and didn't touch the rest of the system for the most part.

“Agents are going to need to be able to scratchpad their work,” Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott said recently on the South Park Commons Minus 1 podcast, explaining that agents will need to retain a history of user interactions and tap into the necessary context to solve problems.

Agents are meant to maintain this context across apps, ask follow-up questions, and take actions on a user's behalf. That requires a different level of trust than Windows has ever had to manage, which is already raising difficult questions for the company.

Microsoft acknowledges that agents introduce unique security risks. In a support document, the company warned that malicious content embedded in files or interface elements could override an agent's instructions — potentially leading to stolen data or malware installation.

To address this, Microsoft says it has built a security framework that runs agents in their own contained workspace, with a dedicated user account that has limited access to user folders. The idea is to create a boundary between the agent and what the rest of the system can access.

The agentic features are off by default, and Microsoft is advising users to “understand the security implications of enabling an agent on your computer” before turning them on.

Even if Microsoft executes perfectly, the landscape is different now. In the early 1990s, Windows became dominant because developers flocked to the platform, which attracted more users, which attracted more developers. It was a virtuous cycle, and Microsoft was at the heart of it.

But Windows isn't the center of the computing world anymore. Smartphones, browsers, and cloud platforms have fragmented the landscape in ways that didn't exist back then. Microsoft missed the mobile era almost entirely, and the PC is now one screen among many.

In the enterprise, Microsoft has better footing. Azure, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and a growing ecosystem of business-focused agents give the company a strong position, competing against Google, Amazon, OpenAI and others for cloud-based AI agents and services.

Agent Launchers is a different bet — an attempt to make Windows the home for agents that serve individual users on their own machines. That's a harder sell when the PC is competing with phones, browsers, and cloud apps for people's attention. Microsoft can build the platform, but it can't guarantee that developers will show up the way they did 35 years ago.

And unlike in the 1990s, Microsoft can't count on users to embrace what it's building. There's a growing sentiment that these AI capabilities are being pushed into Windows not because users want them, but because Microsoft needs to justify its massive AI investments. 

In October, for example, Microsoft announced new features including “Hey Copilot” voice activation, a redesigned taskbar with Copilot built in, and the expansion of “Copilot Actions” agentic capabilities beyond the browser to the PC itself. 

“They're thinking about revenue first and foremost,” longtime tech journalist and Microsoft observer Ed Bott said on the GeekWire Podcast at the time. The more users rely on these AI features, he explained, the easier it becomes for the company to upsell them on premium services.

There is a business reality driving all of this. In Microsoft's most recent fiscal year, Windows and Devices generated $17.3 billion in revenue — essentially flat for the past three years. 

That's less than Gaming ($23.5 billion) and LinkedIn ($17.8 billion), and a fraction of the $98 billion in revenue from Azure and cloud services or the nearly $88 billion from Microsoft 365 commercial.

By comparison, in fiscal 1995, five years after the launch of Windows 3.0, Microsoft's platforms group (which included MS-DOS and Windows) represented about 40% of its total revenue of $5.9 billion. Windows was the growth engine for the company.

Windows is unlikely to play that kind of outsized role again. But AI integration is the company's best bet to return the OS to growth. Whether that ultimately looks like a restored Porsche or a rocket ship on the launchpad probably doesn't matter as much as keeping it out of the junkyard.

Xhuliano Brace quickly realized that venture capitalists weren't going to write big checks for two under-30 founders pursuing what he describes as a “contrarian” approach to using AI to design new drugs.

So he's making the bet himself.

After four years of working on AI projects at Amazon, Brace left the tech giant to self-fund his vision. Using personal savings and proceeds from online trading, he invested a six-figure sum into Rhizome Research, a Seattle-based startup developing made-to-order, small drug-like molecules.

After launching last year, the five-employee startup recently came out of stealth. In addition to CEO Brace, who has degrees in math, computer science and economics from the University at Albany, Rhizome's leadership includes:

Rather than working from existing molecule-building tools, Rhizome has built its own fine-tuned foundational model, named r1. The technology is a “graph neural network” and was trained on more than 800 million small drug-like molecules.

The approach is different from the popular RoseTTAFold model created by the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design, which at its core is based on the amino acids that build proteins. 

The r1 model focuses on the atoms and bonds that make up a molecule and its topography. That's where the graph idea comes in — the atoms are analogous to the points in a graph while the bonds are akin to its connecting lines. 

The team aims to provide fragment-based drug discovery, creating small molecules optimized to bind to customer-specified targets. They will ensure each drug candidate can be synthesized efficiently in the lab and is suitable for patent protection.

Rhizome last week released ADAMS, an open-source, automated AI tool that uses natural language instructions for simulating the binding between biological molecules. It also plans to share MolSim, which is a physics-based simulation that uses advanced, free-energy calculations that predict how strongly a small molecule will bind to its target. MolSim won't be open source.

Rhizome recently established partnerships with wet labs that can validate the real-world performance of the potential drugs it designs, and it's exploring customer relationships. 

Brace is operating out of Foundations, the Seattle-based startup community launched by entrepreneur and investor Aviel Ginzburg. Rhizome's other employees are working remotely, but the plan is to bring folks to Washington.

“I really want to make Seattle kind of a hub for small molecule drug discovery,” Brace said.

He pointed to the Allen Institute, the Institute for Protein Design and other Seattle-area organizations as key players. The region is also home to a slate of related drug design startups that include Pauling.AI, Synthesize Bio and Xaira Therapeutics, which is based in San Francisco and has labs in Seattle.

Brace said he's energized by the opportunity to work on a project that could have a meaningful impact on humanity and has no regrets in ponying up his own money for the effort. He's bullish in general on the use of AI for designing molecules, whether for health care or fields such as materials science and advanced manufacturing.

“This is the most interesting problem space to be in,” Brace said.

TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. 

As a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February. 

A number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of last week, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors. 

This comes nearly three months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to an American investor group. 

A week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.

According to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion—a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.

In September, a report indicated that a “framework” deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors— including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz—overseeing TikTok's U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.

The newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app's operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.

Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.

A White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain. 

ByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok's U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.

​The deal is scheduled to close on January 22, 2026. 

Reports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app. 

To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we'll first revisit the timeline of TikTok's tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations. 

The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance. 

A month later, Trump's administration sought to force a sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump's executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. 

Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration.  After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it. 

In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.

Fast-forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company. 

There have been several contenders, including The People's Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O'Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.

Another group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.

Others in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The story has been updated after publication.

Mark Zuckerberg has struck again.

Meta Platforms is acquiring Manus, a Singapore-based AI startup that's become the talk of Silicon Valley since it debuted last spring with a demo video that showed an AI agent doing things like screening job candidates, planning vacations, and analyzing stock portfolios. Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI's Deep Research.

In April, just weeks after launch, venture capital firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million and saw Benchmark general partner Chetan Puttagunta joining the startup's board. Per Chinese media outlets, some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China) via a $10 million round.

The company announced in mid December that it has since signed up millions of users and is generating annual recurring revenue of more than $100 million from monthly and year subscribers to its membership service.

It was around this time that Meta started negotiating with Manus, according to the WSJ, which says the tech giant is paying $2 billion — the valuation Manus was reportedly seeking for its next funding round.

For Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta's future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that's actually making money. This is especially pertinent given that investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta's $60 billion infrastructure spending spree, and the broader tech industry's debt-backed expenditures on data center construction.

Meta says it'll keep Manus running independently and weave the startup's AI agents into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, where Meta's own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users.

There is one wrinkle, however: Manus' Chinese founders founded its parent company, Butterfly Effect, in Beijing in 2022, before decamping to Singapore in the middle of this year. Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn has already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, raising concerns back in May about American capital going to a Chinese concern.

Cornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress' most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he's hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress.

Unsurprisingly, Meta has already told Nikkei Asia that after the acquisition, Manus won't have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet.

Their study still shows something interesting, and quite surprising. But if you choose to extrapolate from this specific setting and say coding assistants don't work in general then that's not scientific and you need to be careful.I think the studyshould probably decrease your prior that AI assistants actually speed up development, even if developers using AI tell you otherwise. The fact it feels faster when it is slower is super interesting.

Being armed with that knowledge is useful when thinking about my own productivity, as I know that there's a risk of me over-estimating the impact of this stuff.But then I look at https://github.com/simonw which currently lists 530 commits over 46 repositories for the month of December, which is the month I started using Opus 4.5 in Claude Code.

The worse part is reading a PR, and catching a reintroduced bug that was fixed a few commit ago. The first time i almost lost my cool at work and said a negative thing to a coworker.This would be my advice to juniors (and i mean basically: devs who don't yet understand the underlying business/architecture): use the AI to explain how stuff work, generate basic functions maybe, but write code logic/algorithm yourself until you are sure you understand what you're doing and why. Work and reflect on the data structures by yourself, even if generated by the AI, and ask for alternatives. Always ask for alternatives, it helps understanding.
You might not see huge productivity gains from AI, but you will improve first, and then productivity will improve very fast, from your brain first, then from AI.

* Force the AI to write tests for everything. Ensure those tests function. Writing boring unit tests used to be arduous. Now the machine can do it for you. There's no excuse for a code regression making it's way into a PR because you actually ran the tests before you did the commit, right? Right? RIGHT?* Force the AI to write documentation and properly comment code, then (this is the tricky part) you actually read what it said it was doing and ensure that this is what you wanted it to do before you commit.Just doing these two things will vastly improve the quality and prevent most of the dumb regressions that are common with AI generated code. Even if you're too busy/lazy to read every line of code the AI outputs just ensuring that it passes the tests and that the comments/docs describe the behavior you asked for will get you 90% of the way there.

I agree with the idea, I do it too, but you need to make sure the test don't just validate the incorrect behavior or that the code is not updated to pass the test in a way that actually ""misses the point"".I've had this happen to me on one or two tests every time

For some reason Gemini seems to be worse at it than Claude lately. Since mostly moving to 3 I've had it go back and change the tests rather than fixing the bug on what seems to be a regular basis. It's like it's gotten smart enough to ""cheat"" more. You really do still have to pay attention that the tests are valid.

reply

To give some further advice to juniors: if somebody is telling you writing unit tests is boring, they haven't learned how to write good tests. There appears to be a large intersection between devs who think testing is a dull task and devs who see a self proclaimed speed up from AI. I don't think this is a coincidence.Writing useful tests is just as important as writing app code, and should be reviewed with equal scrutiny.

However in my experience, the issue with AI is the potential hidden cost down the road. We either have to:1. Code review the AI generated code line by line to ensure it's exactly what you'd have produced yourself when it is generated or2. Pay an unknown amount of tech tebt down the road when it inevitably wasn't what you'd have done yourself and it isn't extensible, scalable, well written code.

I think that the reason LLMs don't work as well in a corporate environment with large codebases and complex business logic, but do work well in greenfield projects, is linked to the amount of context the agents can maintain.Many types of corporate overhead can be reduced using an LLM. Especially following ""well meant but inefficient"" process around JIRA tickets, testing evidence, code review, documentation etc.

There have been methods to reduce overhead available over the history of our industry. Unfortunately almost all the times it involves using productive tools that would in some way reduce the head counts required to do large projects.The way this works is you eventually have to work with languages like Lisp, Perl, Prolog, and then some one comes up with a theory that programming must be optimised for the mostly beginners and power tooling must be avoided. Now you are forced to use verbose languages, writing, maintaining and troubleshooting take a lot of people.The thing is this time around, we have a way to make code by asking an AI tool questions. So you get the same effect but now with languages like JS and Python.

I think for users this _feels_ incredibly powerful, however this also has its own pitfalls: Any topic which you're incompetent at is one which you're also unequipped to successfully review.I think there are some other productivity pitfalls for LLMs:- Employees use it to give their boss emails / summaries / etc in the language and style their boss wants. This makes their boss happy, but doesn't actually modify productivity whatsoever since the exercise was a waste of time in the first place.- Employees send more emails, and summarize more emails. They look busier, but they're not actually writing the emails or really reading them. The email volume has increased, however the emails themselves were probably a waste of time in the first place.- There is more work to review all around and much of it is of poor quality.I think these issues play a smaller part than some of the general issues raised (eg: poor quality code / lack of code reviews / etc.) but are still worth noting.

The job of anyone developing an application framework, whether that's off the shelf or in-house, is to reduce the amount of boilerplate any individual developer needs to write to an absolute bare minimum. The ultimate win isn't to get ""AI to write all your boilerplate."" It's to not need to write boilerplate at all.

Complex legacy refactoring + Systems with poor documentation or unusual patterns + Architectural decisions requiring deep context: These go hand in hand. LLMs are really good at pulling these older systems apart, documenting, then refactoring them, tests and all. Exacerbated by poor documentation of domain expectations. Get your experts in a room weekly and record their rambling ideas and history of the system. Synthesize with an LLM against existing codebase. You'll get to 80% system comprehension in a matter of months.Novel problem-solving with high stakes: This is the true bottleneck, and where engineers can shine. Risk assessment and recombination of ideas, with rapid prototyping.

In programming we've often embraced spending time to learn new tools.  The AI tools are just another set of tools, and they're rapidly changing as well.I've been experimenting seriously with the tools for ~3 years now, and I'm still learning a lot about their use.

A program is a series of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. The specifics of the language aren't as important as the ability to use them to get the machine to perform the tasks instructed.We can now use English as that language, which allows more people than ever to program. English isn't as expressive as Python wielded by an expert, yet. It will be. This is bad for people who used to leverage the difficulty of the task to their own advantage, but good for everyone else.Also, keep in mind that todays LLM's are the worst they'll ever be. They will continue to improve, and you will stagnate if you don't learn to use the new tools effectively.

Understanding a ""deeper"" abstraction layer is almost always to your advantage, even if you seldom use it in your career. It just gives you a glimpse behind the curtain.That said, you have to also learn the new tools unless you tend to be a one man band. You'll find that employers don't want esoteric knowledge or all-knowing wizards who can see the matrix. Mostly, they just want a team member who can cooperate with other folks to get things done in whatever tool they can find enough skilled folks to use.

That being said, I half agree but I think we see things differently. Based on what I've seen, the ""illiterate"" are those who would have otherwise dropped out or done a poor job previously. Now instead of exiting the field, or slowly shipping code they didn't understand (because that has always been a thing) they are shovelling more slop.That's a problem, but it's at most gotten worse rather than come out of thin air.But, there are still competent software engineers and I have seen with my own eyes how AI usage makes them more productive.Similarly, some of those ""illiterate"" are those who now have the ability to make small apps for themselves to solve a problem they would not be able to before, and I argue that's a good thing.Ultimately, people care about the solution to their problems, not the code. If (following the original anecdote) someone with an LLM can build a UI for their project I frankly don't think it matters whether they understood the code. The UI is there, it works, and they can get one with the thing that is actually important: using the UI for their bigger goal.

And that is that upon leaving the airspace of Malaysia into Thailand, the pilot changed course to take the plane over the Indian ocean to commit suicide.It's likely the pilot depressurized the cabin as hypoxia would've rendered the crew and passengers so they were unliikely conscious for any of this. Whether this happened before or after the course change is unknown.Given the minimal wreckage, it was likely a soft landing in the ocean rather than the pilot succumbing to a medical event. He almost certainly was conscious up until the ocean landing.The pilot knew the range and likely chose a part of the Indian Ocean that was remote and deep so the wreckage wouldn't be found as the black boxes would reveal this was intentional and it seemed like he intended his family to get the settlement and life insurance.It's unclear if the pilot was aware of the pinging that has narrowed down the location.

Four new books grapple with a global mental-health crisis and the dawn of algorithmic therapy.

We're in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it's no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI's potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout. 

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI's hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That's roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data. 

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust. 

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else's head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress. 

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people's mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.  

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist's case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals' massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don't seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues. 

But she's aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists. 

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus's engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister's smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person's digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.  

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems. 

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis. 

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there's an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.  

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers' interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn't mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users' interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes. 

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.” 

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI. 

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase. 

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane's cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,'” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user's daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month. 

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don't ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties. 

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike's creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian's estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct' decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It's a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we're seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year's reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people's political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

The Duffer brothers' Talisman adaptation is no more. Get another new look at Daisy Ridley's zombie movie, We Bury the Dead. Plus, Ryan Condal has an update about House of the Dragon‘s fourth season. Spoilers now!



During a recent interview with CBR, Ross Duffer confirmed his planned adaptation of Stephen King's The Talisman with brother Matt Duffer is no longer moving forward.

Sadly, Talisman is no longer at Netflix, so we're not involved. When I interned, when I was really, you know, back in college at Kennedy Marshall, I remember reading, I think it was a movie script for Talisman. So it's been in development forever, so I'm sorry that we were not the ones to break the curse.

Monkeypaw Productions has retweeted the rumor Jordan Peele is directing a future MCU project with an additional eyes emoji.

Bloody-Disgusting has a new clip from Daisy Ridley's zombie movie, We Bury the Dead.

 

Dread Central reports that the A24 prequel series will feature not just Jason Voorhees as a child, but also as a teenager, suggesting potential time jumps across the series.

Appearing as a guest on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Ryan Coogler noted his new X-Files series will continue to have both “monsters of the week” and “overarching conspiracy” episodes.

We intend on having both monsters of the week and also the overarching conspiracy […] it wouldn't be X-Files if we didn't do both. That's what I'm doing now. Black Panther 3 comes after that. I'm hyped, bro.

When asked if David Duchovny or Gillian Anderson would be appearing, Coogler only stated he's a “big fan” of both.

I'm big fan of Gillian's, I'm a big fan of David's. That's all I can say.

On a recent episode of The Stuff Things Are Made Of podcast, House of the Dragon co-creator Ryan Condal stated the crew is making “great progress” on the show's fourth season.

And then writing the next season, which we began in earnest a couple months ago. So, we're making great progress on all fronts.” In the meantime, they have started sending season 3 episodes to the network. We've actually started turning episodes over to the network so they can see the first drafts of things and they are very happy which is always nice to hear.

[Screen Rant]

Finally, the cast of Outlander discuss what's to come in season eight.

Outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams loves crypto. He created a mayoral “Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain,” and supposedly had his first three paychecks converted to bitcoin so the city could even pay him in crypto. And in remarks made Monday at what was probably his final press conference as mayor, he indicated that his love affair with crypto is only intensifying. In fact, Adams is somehow going to fix violence, education, and antisemitism with crypto, he says. When speaking about next steps toward the end of the presser, he got off to a rocky start: “I'm excited about the next step. I cannot tell you … I've said over and over again, anyone would like to finish a job that you started.” And then he uttered three or four partial sentences I truly could not parse. Then he got his answer back on track with the following:

“I want to do my book. I'm going to go back to school. But I also want to use cryptocurrency to go after violence, educate our children, and really deal with antisemitism that we're seeing globally. So I've always wanted to uplift families and children, and I think this is a great opportunity to use technology to do so. And also I have a great deal of opportunities I've always wanted to do.”

What does he mean? Is he turning his time machine back to 2021 and starting a DAO to tackle violence, education, and antisemitism? Is he just donating a bunch of crypto to charities related to those causes? Is he creating his own memecoin? For now, I think it's best to assume he was just expressing himself artistically at this press conference, and that the statement was a sort of Etsy-style mood board in spoken word form. 

Incidentally, 2025 was an absolutely massive year for lobbying in the crypto industry. According to the Hill, by July of this year no fewer than 27 crypto companies had filed their initial lobbying disclosures. Also in July, Politico reported that Coinbase erected branded vending machines on the National Mall and distributed 5,000 Coinbase chocolate bars, with a representative explaining that they were trying to “create a sugar rush for crypto across the Capitol.” If they're looking for more ideas like that one—and I truly mean this—they'd be fools to hire anyone other than the inventor of the phrase “All my haters become my waiters when I sit down at the table of success.” And they don't even have to pay him in real money.

Meta did it again. The social media giant just bought another AI startup. This time, it's the Singapore-based AI agent company Manus.

Meta is buying the AI company in a deal worth more than $2 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. It's the latest move in Meta's increasingly aggressive push into AI. The company already has plans to invest billions into AI infrastructure. Additionally, Meta has snapped up or invested in AI startups like Scale AI and Limitless, a sign that its in-house efforts may not be moving fast enough.

However, there's one hitch with today's deal. Manus's roots in China could raise eyebrows in Washington, as the U.S. and China remain locked in an AI arms race.

Manus made a splash when it debuted this spring as a general AI agent that could handle a wide range of tasks, including deep research, vacation planning, coding, and stock analysis.

Earlier this month, Manus announced that it had reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue just eight months after launching.

“Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,” Manus CEO Xiao Hong said in a statement.

Meta said in its own announcement that it plans to continue operating Manus as its own service, while also integrating it into its own products.

The startup was founded by its parent company, Butterfly Effect, which previously held offices in Beijing and Wuhan. Shortly after launching Manus, the company moved its headquarters to Singapore.

Manus's Chinese ties have already drawn scrutiny. Earlier this year, Silicon Valley venture capital firm Benchmark faced backlash from U.S. lawmakers after investing in Manus.

“Who thinks it is a good idea for American investors to subsidize our biggest adversary in AI, only to have the CCP use that technology to challenge us economically and militarily? Not me,” Sen. John Cornyn wrote in a post on X at the time.

In what appears to be an effort to get ahead of similar accusations, Meta said that after the deal closes, Manus will be required to sever all remaining ties with China.

In a statement to Gizmodo, a Meta spokesperson said:

Meta's acquisition of Manus AI will enable us to provide the most advanced technology to our users with safeguards in place to eliminate areas of potential risk. There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China.

According to Nikkei Asia, Manus has laid off most of its Chinese employees and now has 105 staffers based in Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.

As I've already established, it's been a wild year in audio hardware. Wired earbuds are back, MP3 players are a thing again, and CD players are somehow cooler than ever. But as palpable as the hardware nostalgia has been, you'd have to be a Minority Report-style pre-cog to put this device on your bingo card. Introducing: a DIY thing-y that streams Spotify to a cassette. Yup. Spotify on tape. F**k it.

Let me start by saying that you cannot buy this gadget; it's a hacked-together project from YouTuber Julius Makes—a one-off with no current plans of becoming a purchasable device. With that said, there's still a lot to love here, even if you may never get your hands on one.

As we've already established, this thing takes your run-of-the-mill music stream (I named Spotify, but it could be any streaming service) and converts the digital stream to an analog one. No, not just like any regular digital-to-analog converter (DAC) like this tape-shaped one that I also desperately want to buy; I'm talking about real analog. Once the conversion happens via DAC, the newly analog stream from your music service of choice is recorded on a thin strip of tape and played back via a single speaker.

Why on God's green earth would you ever want to do that? It's definitely not fidelity—we have lossless formats, preamps, and regular DACs for that. It's because tapes just have that—how should I say—je ne sais quoi. They sound… like tapes! Warm, crunchy, washed-out, lo-fi goodness. It's not how you'd want to listen to music all the time, most likely, but it has a lot more character than your average shitty-ass Bluetooth stream.

On top of all that, Julius Makes's gadget just looks cool. If you're prone to nostalgia, especially from the era where tapes were a real thing, then there's a lot to love here. It has buttons and knobs for recording levels and playback volume, and functions like a tape delay, which is a kind of audio effect that gives sounds an echo-y, nostalgic vibe. For good measure, Julius Makes threw in a quarter-inch audio in and out jack so it could be used just like a tape delay, too.

Apparently, the whole thing was a pain in the ass to make, too, so as miffed as you are about not being able to own one, we can be thankful that someone bothered to make this device exist in the first place. As Julius Makes put it, there was a learning curve, the manufacturing was costly, and waiting for the parts was longer than expected. But hey, we got Spotify on tape out of the effort, and for that, I give this project 5 out of 5 nostalgia-shaped cassette tapes.

Computer archaeology lovers among the audience are in for a rare treat in these challenging times. Remember that Unix v4 tape that was found and recovered at University of Utah around last week? You can play it in a browser emulator right now, thanks to the wonders of modern browsers and the work of Mitch Riedstra.

The emulator's page actually runs a Linux emulator first, which then you can use to call up the SimH project's PDP-11 emulator, passing it a boot.ini file containing bootstrap instructions. After booting into Unix v4 proper, you'll be greeted with a familiar prompt so you can log in as the ""root"" user.

As the old saying goes, though: beware, there be dragons here. You'd think that much like the kid in Jurassic Park, you could find your way around it because it's a Unix system, but there's no shortage of proverbial grues just waiting to eat you.

First off, you can forget about most of your commands or aliases to them. For starters, ll is short for ls -la, so you better get used to typing the whole thing. Likewise, chdir was the Old English form of cd. And while the usual cat can output files like you'd expect, editing them is a process, as there's no nano. Brother, hold on, as there ain't no vi either — you use ed and enjoy viewing files a few lines at a time and humbly requesting for substitutions (ex: s/one/two).

Additionally, as you'll quickly figure out, the navigation shortcuts like arrow keys simply do not exist. The screen was treated like a roll of paper, and in order to go back one character you have to erase it with the ""#"" character, with one of them meaning ""go back one character"".

If you want to kill the entire line, Ctrl+C won't save you, only typing ""@"" and hitting Enter will do. You can click this link if you want a deep technical dive on the vicissitudes of emulating PDP hardware and Unix.

The backend of emulation comes by way of the Linux-native SimH emulator that's running inside the almost-magical JSLinux emulator, with a barebones version of Alpine Linux. Incidentally, JSLinux can also get you going with FreeDOS and even Windows 2000. That ought to trigger more than a couple waves of nostalgia.

Consumes 1/3 the power of optical, but costs 1/3 more than optical

Scale-up connectivity is crucial for the performance of rack-scale AI systems, but achieving high bandwidth and low latency for such interconnections using copper wires is becoming increasingly complicated with each generation. Using optical interconnections for scale-up connectivity is a possibility, but it may be an overkill, so start-ups Point2 and AttoTude propose to use radio-based interconnections operating at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies over waveguides that connect to systems using standard pluggable connectors, reports IEEE Spectrum.

Point2's implementation uses what it calls an 'active radio cable' built from eight 'e-Tube' waveguides. Each waveguide carries data using two frequencies — 90 GHz and 225 GHz — and plug-in modules at both ends convert digital signals directly into modulated millimeter-wave radio and back again. A full cable delivers 1.6 Tb/s, occupies 8.1mm, or about a half the volume of a comparable active copper cable, and can reach up to seven meters, more than enough for scale-up connectivity. Point2 says the design consumes roughly one-third the power of optical links, costs about one-third as much, and adds as little as one-thousandth the latency.

A notable aspect of Point2's approach is the relative maturity of its technology. The radio transceivers can be fabricated at standard semiconductor production facilities using well-known fabrication processes — the company has already demonstrated this approach using a 28nm chip with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Also, its partners Molex and Foxconn Interconnect Technology have shown that the specialized cables can be produced on existing lines without major retooling.

AttoTude is pursuing a similar concept, but at even higher frequencies. Its system combines a digital interface, a terahertz signal generator, and a mixer that encodes data onto carriers between 300 and 3,000 GHz that feeds the signal into a narrow dielectric waveguide. Early versions used hollow copper tubes, while later generations rely on fibers measuring approximately 200 micrometers across with losses as low as 0.3 dB per meter (considerably lower than copper). The company has demonstrated 224 Gb/s transmission over four meters at 970 GHz and projects viable reaches of around 20 meters.

Both companies use waveguides instead of cables because, at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies cables fail. While at very high data rates copper cables can pass signals, they do so by becoming thicker, shorter, and more power-hungry. Furthermore, their losses and jitter rise so fast that the link budget collapses and breaks, so cables cannot be used for such applications. Meanwhile, waveguides are not an exotic choice, they are among a few viable option for interconnects with terabit/s-class bandwidth.

We look at a maker's refined interpretation of the original Makeyo MK01.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A maker has shared their take on the Makeyo MK01 3D printed PC case. They outline a handful of useful mods that they implemented based upon this premium 3D printing template. The MK01 was already a stunner, but the addition of a front USB-C port, inner 2.5-inch SSD brackets, and a fresh color scheme, all make Marst_art's re-spin worthy of attention.

The re-maker reckons that the PC case landscape is flooded with white / black / glass boxy structures, focused on showcasing RGB light shows. Marst_art would rather the case design to do the talking, not the lights, so was drawn to adopt the retro-futuristic Makeyo design.

It is difficult to find something perfect for your dream PC build, off the peg. Marst_art begins his video by commenting that “the Makeyo MK01 is exactly what I'm looking for in a case… Well, almost exactly.” Then the maker explained that he would implement the following enhancements, to tweak the Makeyo MK01 'just so':

Marst_art used a Bambu Lab A1 3D printer to output all the files required for this PC case build. He chose PLA for the case panels, which would be magnetically attached for quick servicing, while ABS was the material of choice for the frame for its heat resistance.

After printing and preparing all the parts, he noticed that he needed to print an adaptor to fit an SFX PSU in the design, as provided. With the Mayeko MK01 fitted with a full ATX motherboard, an SFX PSU is necessary, using the current plans.

Inside the finished chassis, Marst_art used his previous PC's guts, so it ended up being fitted with an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G CPU, Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU, 64GB RAM (bragging now), and a total 10TB of M.2 and SATA storage.

The final change, which the maker had previously suggested he would implement, was a power button shroud redesign. The interesting ‘X' motif which detached to allow the power button to be prodded wasn't required or desired by Marst_art. Instead, he 3D printed an ‘X' insert in a translucent material, so the assembly just became a prominent power button with the light shining through its center.

If you want to check out the original Makeyo MK01 3D project, and compare it to the remake / tweaked version, check out the video below:

On the journey, following the Makeyo plans, Marst_art noticed that the plans and guide materials didn't quite match up. That is actually explained by Makeyo's diligent work on updating and refining the premium 3D printer design plans it sells. So, there's a slight disconnect, but what you are printing now is a refined (bug fixed) version of what was originally launched.

Apparently, Makeyo is actually working on an updated revision which supports the mounting of 2.5-inch SSDs. Marst_art therefore reasons that his ‘janky' SATA mounting 3D printer files aren't worth sharing at this time.

A 4K-capable gaming PC needs top-tier components, but in a pre-built machine, you can often expect to pay a hefty premium for the privilege. That isn't the case with this Skytech gaming PC, on sale at Newegg ahead of the new year with a very respectable $200 discount that pushes it under $2,500.

For the $2,499.99 sale price, you're getting a Skytech Gaming Azure 3 Plus gaming PC that's packed with a serious spec sheet for gamers. Front and center is the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, one of the best CPUs you can buy right now, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, an elite-level GPU with 16GB of VRAM.

This Skytech Gaming Azure 3 Plus gaming PC is a 4K powerhouse, fitted with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080. It has 32GB of DDR5-6000 RAM and a 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD with Gen 4 speeds.

The coupling of the RTX 5080 with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a potent one. Our 9800X3D review explains in depth why this eight-core CPU is a powerhouse for gamers, fitted with its game-changing 3D V-Cache, which boosts the available L3 cache to 96MB, reducing the dependency on your system RAM and vastly reducing latency as a result.

The 9800X3D tops our benchmarks, it is one of the fastest gaming CPUs out there, easily beating any of its Intel rivals and offering a measurable step-up to older X3D chips like the 7800X3D. If you want an all-out rig that can push the limits of your hardware at 4K, with ray tracing and other goodies enabled, this is the CPU you'll want in your machine. If you dip down to 1440p or 1080p, you won't be much challenged, as these CPU benchmarks below show.

The RTX 5080, meanwhile, is the second-most powerful consumer GPU that you can buy right now from Nvidia's current Blackwell generation. Fitted with 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, with a 256-bit memory bus, and with 10,752 CUDA cores at its disposal, this $1,000+ GPU is only beaten by the RTX 5090, which has (almost) double the cores and double the VRAM, and isn't too far behind the performance offered by Nvidia's last-gen flagship, the RTX 4090, either.

These two components alone set the tone for this Skytech gaming PC. This is a rig ready for 4K gaming, able to utilize the full power offered by Nvidia's Blackwell GPU, including DLSS 4 with ray tracing enabled in the games that support it. As long as you have a gaming monitor that can match it, this $2,499 machine offers performance that few other pre-build PCs can offer at this price point.

You're also getting 32GB of DDR5 memory, rated for 6,000 MT/s, with RGB lighting. A 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD is also installed, offering PCIe 4.0 speeds, which should be enough for a couple of big game installations, although there's always room to replace this with a bigger drive later. This rig also uses a 360mm AIO cooler with ARGB fans to keep your expensive CPU cool.

This $2,499.99 Skytech gaming PC isn't one you should easily dismiss in the current climate, especially with these specs. With PC prices expected to rise by around 8% next year due to the skyrocketing cost of flash memory, not to mention the risk of global economic crises, this might be one of the last chances to score a pre-built PC with these specs at a reasonable price. Don't expect this deal to be around for long.

The first Iron Beam laser defense system was deployed by Israel on Sunday. This 100kW laser weapon thus became the world's first high-power drone defense zapper to be operationally deployed. Iron Beam lasers will fortify Israel's multi-layered defense, complementing the existing Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow system architecture.

The Iron Beam is a short-range line-of-sight laser interceptor that is extremely cheap to run and, therefore, perfectly suited for intercepting low-cost, high-volume threats. According to the official Israeli announcement, Iron Beam systems have “successfully intercepted rockets, mortars, and UAVs.”

A complex mix of government, military, scientific, and commercial interests were responsible for the research and development of the Iron Beam laser system. Central to the Iron Beam are “an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system, enabling the interception of a wide range of targets at an enhanced operational range, with maximum precision and superior efficiency,” boasted the press release by Israel's MoD. Moreover, it works “at a negligible marginal cost, which constitutes the laser system's primary advantage.”

We don't get much more by way of technical details, perhaps understandably. However, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems execs heralded the system's “unique adaptive optics technology,” in what it calls “the world's most advanced laser-based system for intercepting aerial threats.” Its operational debut “marks the beginning of the era of high-energy laser defense,” they claimed.

We have seen low-energy laser defense systems deployed earlier this year, with Japan's NTT using relatively puny lasers to scare birds away from poultry farms and prevent the spread of avian flu. But the Iron Beam is in a different league.

We also previously reported on several other UK laser weapons under development to counter UAVs on land and at sea. But as far as we know, these are yet to become operational. With the brutal war between Ukraine and Russia ongoing, where drones have grown to be a pivotal feature of the conflict, laser-drone defenses similar to the Iron Beam are going to be in strong demand.

Many people live with chronic pain, and previous research has shown there is a connection between chronic pain and poor brain aging.

A new study took a closer look at this by exploring whether daily habits impact brain aging in people with chronic pain. 

The researchers found that people who had healthy lifestyle behaviors had a younger brain age. In some cases, participants' brain age was up to 8 years younger than their actual age.

The findings suggest that while chronic pain was associated with accelerated brain aging in earlier studies, healthy behaviors may help protect the brain as people get older.

The study is published in Brain Communications.

As people age, their chances of developing chronic pain increase. This can happen due to wear and tear on joints, muscles, and connective tissue.

Conditions such as osteoarthritis and spinal disc degeneration contribute to chronic pain. While treatments such as physical therapy, medication, or surgery can help, recovery tends to be slower in older adults, and pain may not fully resolve.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), data from 2023 showed that 24.3% of United States adults reported having chronic pain. Additionally, 8.5% of adults had chronic pain that affected their daily life and work. 

Chronic pain can also contribute to poor sleep and depression.

Aging is also associated with changes in the brain. Studies using MRI scans have indicated that aging is associated with the shrinking of some regions of the brain, as well as with changes in gray and white matter, which are linked to slower processing speed and memory deficits. 

Ideally, a person's brain age would match or appear younger than their chronological age. However, in conditions such as dementia, the brain often appears older than expected.

The researchers behind the new study further explored chronic pain and brain age by analyzing data from more than 100 adults ages 45 to 85 who were tracked for 2 years. 

The participants were part of a larger observational study on pain and osteoarthritis risk. The scientists assessed each participant's chronic pain stage on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being little to no chronic pain and 5 being severe chronic pain.

Some factors that they considered to determine the pain stage included: 

The team also evaluated the participants' lifestyle habits and psychological traits, including tobacco use, waist size, sleep quality, stress levels, and optimism.

They used this to determine a “protective score,” and people with healthier lifestyles and stronger emotional and social well-being had higher scores.

At the start of the study, people with a higher protective score, including those with chronic pain, had brain ages that were up to 8 years younger than their chronological age.

People with lower protective scores, however, had a brain age that was older than their actual age.

After 2 years, participants with the healthiest lifestyle profiles continued to show younger brain ages, which suggests that positive habits can have a lasting effect on brain health.

Some of the most important protective factors, which were associated with a younger brain age in people with chronic pain, were:

The researchers said their results show lifestyle and social habits matter more than pain severity alone. 

They emphasized that many of these factors can be changed, and people should speak with their healthcare providers about how to develop healthier habits. 

For example, they could speak with their providers about improving sleep, stopping tobacco use, and finding ways to improve social support.

Dung Trinh, MD, an internist with MemorialCare Medical Group and Chief Medical Officer of Healthy Brain Clinic, discussed the study with Medical News Today.

“It's a compelling practical study linking chronic pain and everyday lifestyle psychosocial factors to an MRI-based ‘brain age' measure,” Trinh who was not involved in this research, told us.

He added that one of the study's strengths is using multiple brain scans.

Trinh emphasized that brain age is “a biological risk marker, not a direct guarantee of better memory or dementia prevention,” and said that because the study is observational, it does not prove cause and effect. 

Still, he noted that modifiable factors such as sleep, stress, smoking, and social connection can add up over time.

“Even if we can't change age or genetics, we can influence sleep quality, stress load, physical activity pacing in the presence of pain, smoking status, and social connection,” Trinh explained. 

Hanul Bhandari, MD, a neurologist and Chief Medical Officer at Vistim Labs, likewise not involved in this research, also spoke with MNT about the study.

Bhandari said the study stands out for showing that brain aging is shaped by daily habits:

“This study is compelling because it reframes brain aging as a dynamic process shaped by daily behaviors, psychosocial context, and chronic health stressors rather than as an inevitable consequence of time alone.”

He noted that the study did not focus only on what harms the brain, but highlighted protective factors, which he said aligns with how neurologists increasingly view aging. 

“Preserving brain health supports not just memory, but independence, adaptability, and overall lifespan quality,” Bhandari emphasized. “Studies like this remind us that the brain is responsive, measurable, and worth protecting early, consistently, and deliberately.”

For many, having a Christmas tree (typically a pine or fir tree) in the living room is a beloved holiday tradition, and the tradition may serve not only a spiritual role but also a health benefit.

A research team led by Thomas Loew, physician and director of the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine at University Hospital Regensburg in Regensburg, Germany, examined the measurable effects of pine scent and group singing on the immune system. “Since time immemorial, humans have developed rituals and habits that serve not only spiritual but also biological functions. This includes the custom of putting up a Christmas tree,” Loew said in a press release.

So does putting up a Christmas tree do more than please the eye — does the scent of pine needles make us happier or even directly influence the immune system? “Yes, we were able to find that many study participants showed a molecularly detectable positive reaction to the scent of the trees, which can be associated with an improvement in immune function,” explained Professor Loew, “and this is not just a psychological effect.”

Pine needles release essential oils that rapidly activate the defense system in the nasal mucosa. This process triggers the release of nitric oxide (NO), an important marker of immune response that can be easily measured in exhaled breath.

Interestingly, humming songs and melodies produced a similar effect, which also demonstrably increased NO release and thus activated immune function.

In a randomized crossover design, 16 volunteers either inhaled fresh pine scent (from a freshly cut tree kept for approximately 24 hours in the test room) or hummed for 5 minutes; humming was used as a control as it is known to increase nasal fractional exhaled NO (FeNO) levels in minutes.

FeNO was measured immediately before and after the exposure and the control procedure. A simple subjective relaxation test was taken in parallel.

Before-after comparisons revealed an impressive increase in NO concentrations; however, the results were not statistically significant, nor were intraindividual (pre-post) differences between the two groups (Wilcoxon test). Positive changes with the scent of the felled tree were observed in 44% of volunteers and with humming in 48%. Almost 70% of the study participants benefited from at least one of the two stimuli; only 25% showed no increase.

“In our study, each of the two interventions — simply smelling the tree and humming melodies — led to an immediate improvement in immune function in over 40% of participants, though usually according to the principle of ‘either/or.' In combination, around 70% showed increased immune function. Only about a quarter showed no measurable response. We could jokingly call these ‘Christmas Grinches,'” Loew summarized.

With a smile, one can conclude that the decorated Christmas tree and singing together around it might be more than just tradition; they apparently also benefit the immune system.

A meta-analysis found no clear evidence on whether menopause hormone therapy (MHT) increased, decreased, or had no effect on the risk for dementia or mild cognitive impairment in postmenopausal women, irrespective of the formulation, duration, or age of initiation. According to the authors, the evidence did not support using MHT for the prevention of dementia following menopause at any age.

""The available evidence does not confirm whether MHT has a positive, negative, or null effect on the risk of dementia or mild cognitive impairment,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Melissa Melville, Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, England. It was published online on December 22, 2025, in The Lancet Healthy Longevity.

Only one randomised controlled trial included women who initiated MHT at the age of 65 years or above. Most studies were observational, which may have introduced residual confounding, survival bias, and exposure or outcome misclassification. MHT exposure was evaluated on the basis of prescription or self‑reported data without confirming adherence.

This study was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada. One author reported receiving funding from the National Health and Medical Research Fund of Australia and others and meeting support from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, having a membership on a World Health Organization international advisory board and a BreastScreen Victoria board, and serving as an editor at the Cochrane Collaboration.

Public videos of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests showed brief warning signs before collapse, frequent seizure-like movements or gasping afterwards, and a gap between quick recognition and starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation or using a defibrillator.

""Our video-based observations reinforce these messages with concrete, real-world imagery and timings, suggesting value in incorporating curated, ethically sourced footage into lay and professional training to improve recognition fidelity and decisional confidence,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Kristin Alm-Kruse and Tommaso Scquizzato, both from the Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. It was published online on December 22, 2025, in Resuscitation.

The dataset was not representative and skewed towards crowded or sport-related events involving younger males. Key details on patient demographics, outcomes, and confirmed diagnoses were often incomplete. Videos were brief, about 1 minute, and mostly focused on footage before the event, which limited the assessment of post-arrest care.

Use of certain proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, according to findings from a meta-analysis.

The findings of this study suggest that “PA-PPI use should be discouraged in patients with glioblastoma, since alternative agents are available and a detrimental effect cannot be excluded,” the authors of the study concluded.

The study, led by Emilie Le Rhun, MD, PhD, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The study was retrospective, although data were captured prospectively. Drug use was only tracked while patients remained in the trial, potentially affecting overall survival analyses through post-progression pharmacotherapy. Confounding by indication was possible because patients with more severe edema or symptoms were more likely to receive steroids and PPIs. Overall steroid dose, duration of treatment, and timing relative to treatment phases were not captured.

The study was supported by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumor Group. Le Rhun disclosed receiving grants from Bristol Myers Squibb and Servier and personal fees from Bayer, Biodexa/Sitoxi, Janssen, LEO Pharma, medac, My Tomorrows, Pierre Fabre, Roche, Seattle Genetics, and Servier, outside the submitted work.

The association between periodontitis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is stronger than previously recognized, a new scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) suggests.

Evidence also shows that treatment of periodontal disease can reduce inflammatory factors and improve certain intermediate risk markers associated with ASCVD.

However, there is still insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship, the statement authors said.

“There has been increasing research showing an association between periodontal disease and heart disease; however, additional studies are needed to further clarify mechanisms and long-term effects from childhood into adulthood,” said lead author of the statement, Andrew H. Tran, MD, MPH, assistant professor of pediatric cardiology and director of preventive cardiology at The Heart Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio.

“We hope that this scientific statement brings attention to a modifiable risk factor that could decrease the risk of heart disease if addressed and spur additional research in this area,” he said.

Previous research indicates periodontal treatment improves inflammation-related blood markers and some intermediate cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

In the US, 42% of adults aged 30 years or older have periodontitis, with 7.8% experiencing severe disease. Severe periodontitis is more common among older adults, smokers, non-Hispanic Black people, and Mexican Americans.

Prevalence also rises with poverty: About 60% of people living below the federal poverty level have periodontitis.

These populations also carry a disproportionately high burden of ASCVD risk.

Studies have identified several plausible biological pathways linking periodontal disease and CV disease. Those studies include a 2024 umbrella review of periodontal disease and CV risk published in BMC Oral Health and a look at the association between these two diseases in a 2025 study published in The International Journal of Molecular Sciences.

Direct mechanisms include bacteria entering the bloodstream through bleeding periodontal pockets, leading to systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction and potentially contributing to atherosclerotic plaque development or instability, according to the scientific statement. Studies, including a 2025 review in Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, also confirm these relationships.

Indirect mechanisms include chronic periodontal inflammation raising circulating CV risk markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and TNF.

The statement authors also cited additional proposed pathways, including immune cross-reactivity, prothrombotic effects through increased platelet activation, and oral microbiome dysbiosis, all of which may contribute to vascular disease.

Oral hygiene measures, scaling and root planing, and, when appropriate, antibiotics have been shown to reduce inflammatory markers such as white blood cell count, fibrinogen, and CRP.

In addition, a meta-analysis reviewed in the AHA statement indicates that periodontal treatment can improve ASCVD-related biomarkers and endothelial function, with the strongest effects observed in individuals with established ASCVD and diabetes.

Reviews of multiple Cochrane systematic analyses and key clinical trials indicate that evidence remains insufficient to conclude that periodontal treatment prevents adverse CV events.

Establishing a direct causal link is challenging, largely because both conditions share common risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and socioeconomic disadvantage.

The authors emphasize the need for further studies examining the long-term impact of periodontal disease and its treatment on CV outcomes.

“This important new American Heart Association scientific statement brings attention to an often-overlooked potential risk factor for heart problems — gum disease,” said Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, New York City.

He noted that a prior analysis from the US NHANES registry found a clear relationship between increasing severity of periodontitis and CV risk.

“While a cause-and-effect relationship has not been definitively established, regular brushing, flossing, and dental visits remain sound advice regardless of their direct impact on cardiovascular risk,” said Bhatt, who was not part of the statement writing group.

Bhatt reported having no relevant financial relationships. Tran reported receiving research support in the form of a PEDSnet data analysis voucher and reported having no other relevant financial relationships.

A smartphone-delivered digital cognitive-behavioral therapy (DCBT) program was associated with 71% remission at 10 weeks in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) compared with 35% for psychoeducation in a new study, with benefits persisting up to 24 weeks.

“Given the longstanding limitations on access to empirically supported CBT [cognitive-behavioral therapy], the validation of an efficacious DCBT program that can be prescribed by mental health and primary care practitioners has the potential for dramatic public health impact,” the investigators wrote.

“The consistent evidence for the efficacy of this smartphone-accessible DCBT suggests it is a scalable, first-line treatment option for adults with GAD,” they added.

This study was led by E. Marie Parsons, PhD, Boston University, Boston. It was published online on December 15 in JAMA Network Open.

The racial diversity of the study sample diverged from US Census data, with a lower inclusion of Hispanic and Latino adults and a higher inclusion of White adults. The study excluded participants with psychosis, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, a moderate or greater suicide risk, or GAD-7 scores below 15, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, data on time spent with each intervention were not available, and interrater reliability data for the CGI-I scale were not directly collected in the trial.

This study was funded by Big Health Inc. Some investigators reported having financial or other ties with various organizations, including Big Health Inc. Full details are provided in the original article.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive forms of lung cancer, with a five-year survival rate of only five percent. Despite this poor prognosis, SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy. However, patients typically relapse and experience very rapid disease progression. Current research into the biological mechanisms behind SCLC remains essential in order to prolong treatment responses, overcome relapse and, ultimately, improve long-term patient outcomes.

A research team led by Professor Dr Silvia von Karstedt (Translational Genomics, CECAD Cluster of Excellence on Aging Research, and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne – CMMC) has discovered a novel mechanism used by this type of cancer that helps explain its aggressive nature. The study titled ""Lack of Caspase 8 Directs Neuronal Progenitor-like reprogramming and Small Cell Lung Cancer Progression"" was published in Nature Communications.

Unlike other epithelial cancers, SCLC shares features with neuronal cells, including lack of caspase-8 expression, a protein involved in programmed, non-inflammatory cell-death (apoptosis), a mechanism that is essential to eliminate faulty or mutated cells and to maintain health.

To better mimic the features of human SCLC, the team generated and characterized a novel genetically engineered mouse model lacking caspase-8. Using this new model, the team observed that when this protein is missing, an unusual chain reaction sets off. ""The absence of caspase-8 leads to a type of inflammatory cell death called necroptosis that creates a hostile, inflamed environment even before tumors fully form"" explains von Karstedt.

We were also intrigued to find that pre-tumoral necroptosis can in fact promote cancer by conditioning the immune system.""

Dr. Silvia von Karstedt, University of Cologne

The inflammation creates an environment where the body's anti-cancer immune response is suppressed, preventing immune cells from attacking threats like cancer cells. This, in turn, can promote tumour metastasis. Surprisingly, the researchers observed that this inflammation also pushes the cancer cells to behave more like immature neuron-like cells, a state that makes them better at spreading and that is associated with relapse.

While it remains unknown whether similar pre-tumoral inflammation also occurs in human patients, this work identifies a mechanism contributing to the aggressiveness and patient relapse in SCLC that could be exploited as a way to improve the efficiency of future therapies and early-stage diagnostic methods.

Children with peanut allergies may not need large doses of peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) to build protection to peanut, finds a new study led by The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and Montreal Children's Hospital. Researchers found that a small dose can help children with their peanut allergy and reduce the risk of severe reactions from accidental exposures, with less side effects than the current standard treatment. 

In Canada, peanut allergies affect almost two per cent of children and adults and increasingly contribute to hospital admissions. Peanut OIT is a method to increase the amount of peanut that a child can eat before experiencing a reaction, helping to protect children against accidental contamination. Children receiving peanut OIT eat a gradually increasing amount of peanut over time until they reach a ""maintenance"" dose that is eaten regularly, even after the treatment, to help keep up the benefits. 

While peanut OIT can help children with peanut allergies to build protection, current approaches use large doses that require lengthy treatment, close medical supervision and often can result in discontinuation due to dislike of the taste and side effects of allergic reactions like anaphylaxis. 

The study is the first of its kind to compare a commonly used peanut OIT treatment to reduced doses in children, and provides evidence to support a significantly lower dose that could increase treatment accessibility and help protect more children with peanut allergy. 

To investigate the safety and effectiveness of a very low maintenance dose of peanut OIT, the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology – In Practice, randomly assigned 51 children with peanut allergy to three groups: low-dose treatment (30mg maintenance), standard-dose treatment (300mg maintenance) or avoidance (no peanut OIT). 

Both peanut OIT treatment groups experienced significant and similar increases in their allergic reaction threshold to peanuts, showing that eating even small amounts is better than avoidance when it comes to training the immune system to manage more peanut. 

""We were excited to find that peanut OIT maintenance doses can be much lower than previously thought and still contribute to positive outcomes,"" says Dr. Julia Upton, Head of the Division of Immunology & Allergy, Project Investigator in the SickKids Research Institute, Co-Director of the SickKids Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Program and co-first author.

The more options we have, the more we can support patients' experience and provide meaningful, tailored care.""

Dr. Julia Upton, Head of the Division of Immunology & Allergy, Project Investigator, SickKids Research Institute 

Children who were in the 30 mg maintenance group had fewer adverse reactions than the 300 mg maintenance group, and none withdrew from treatment. 

""This is a small enough dose that even children who do not like the taste can continue treatment,"" says co-senior study author Dr. Thomas Eiwegger, Adjunct Scientist in the Translational Medicine program. ""This is the first time we've compared standard doses to such a low dose, but the minimum maintenance dose to provide benefit may be even lower than 30mg."" 

The research team notes that some children and families may choose to remain on very low doses, while others may prefer to increase over time depending on their goals. This study marks an important step to further the development of safe and effective protocols for peanut OIT. Ultimately, the goal is to make peanut OIT accessible to more peanut-allergic children. 

""The study found that very small amounts of peanuts, that are associated with less reactions, could be used as effectively as large amounts for oral immunotherapy, making it safer and accessible to more Canadians, even those who are very sensitive to the allergen,"" says Dr. Moshe Ben-Shoshan, co-senior author of the study, a pediatric allergy and immunology specialist at the Montreal Children's Hospital and Scientist in the Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.

Following stroke, some people experience a language disorder that hinders their ability to process speech sounds. How do their brains change from stroke? Researchers led by Laura Gwilliams, faculty scholar at the Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute and Stanford Data Science and assistant professor at the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, and Maaike Vandermosten, associate professor at the Department of Neurosciences at KU Leuven, compared the brains of 39 patients following stroke and 24 healthy age-matched controls to unveil language processing brain mechanisms. 

As reported in their JNeurosci paper, the researchers recorded brain activity while volunteers listened to a story. People with verbal speech processing issues from stroke were not slower to process speech sounds but had much weaker processing than healthy participants. According to the researchers, this suggests that people with this language disorder can hear sounds of all kinds as well as healthy people but have issues integrating speech sounds to understand language. 

Additionally, when there was uncertainty about what words were being said, healthy people processed speech sound features longer compared to those who had experienced a stroke. This could mean that, following stroke, people do not process speech sounds long enough to successfully comprehend words that are difficult to detect. 

This work points to brain activity patterns that may be crucial for understanding verbal language, according to the authors. First author Jill Kries expresses excitement about continuing to explore how this simple approach-listening to a story-can be used to improve diagnostics for conditions characterized by language processing issues, which currently involve hours of behavioral tasks.

More than seven million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, and two-thirds of them are women, according to the Alzheimer's Association. The O'Banion Lab at the Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience at the University of Rochester has long been studying this disease and is looking more closely at the differences between male and female brains.

""It is well documented that males and females are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at different rates,"" said M. Kerry O'Banion, MD, PhD, professor of Neuroscience and Neurology.

But we still do not have a great understanding of why this is the case. We can only improve any possible treatment or prevention of this disease if we know the why, when, and where these differences are occurring.""

M. Kerry O'Banion, Professor of Neuroscience and Neurology, University of Rochester Medical Center

New research led by O'Banion and Neuroscience graduate student Lia Calcines-Rodríguez discovered that the immune cells in the brain, known as microglia, act differently in the male and female Alzheimer's brain, and appear to cause residual harm in the female brain. As described in their recent paper in the Journal of Neuroinflammation, they discovered that in mice, when microglia respond to amyloid-β plaques-the sticky clumps of protein that accumulate in the brain in Alzheimer's disease- female microglia express more interferon-related genes.

In the body, interferons are known for their role in combating viral infections; however, the role of interferons in Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Previous research has shown that interferon signaling can drive neuroinflammation and can damage synapses, the connections between neurons. Researchers believe that as the microglia consume the amyloid-β plaques, they may be exposed to DNA or RNA, mistake it for a virus, and this may cause the cells to release interferon, although the exact cause and function of interferon in Alzheimer's remains unclear.

This research also found that female microglia leave behind larger and more irregular plaques, which damage more neuronal connections than those in the male brain.

""It was surprising to see that female microglia had such a strong interferon response and that these interferon-responsive microglia were taking up more amyloid-β,"" said Calcines-Rodríguez, first author of the study. ""Interestingly, we did not see differences in amyloid-β pathology or microglia gene expression in females at different hormonal stages of their cycle, suggesting that hormone fluctuation may not explain these differences."" She also sees potential in the interferon signaling in microglia as a possible sex-specific, personalized treatment to combat Alzheimer's.

Microglia are an important part of the nervous system. In a healthy brain, they help maintain a stable environment. It is understood that these cells play a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Now, researchers aim to understand whether these differences between male and female microglia could provide a path to alter the disease course, if male and female microglia are inherently different, and if interferon signaling could be a potential pharmacological target.

AI model using deep transfer learning – the most advanced form of machine learning – predicted with 92 % accuracy spoken language outcomes at one-to-three years after cochlear implants (implanted electronic hearing device), according to a large international study published in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery.

Although cochlear implantation is the only effective treatment to improve hearing and enable spoken language for children with severe to profound hearing loss, spoken language development after early implantation is more variable in comparison to children born with typical hearing. If children who are likely to have more difficulty with spoken language are identified prior to implantation, intensified therapy can be offered earlier to improve their speech.

Researchers trained AI models to predict outcomes based on pre-implantation brain MRI scans from 278 children in Hong Kong, Australia and U.S., who spoke three different languages (English, Spanish and Cantonese). The three centers in the study also used different protocols for scanning the brain and different outcome measures.

Such complex, heterogenous datasets are problematic for traditional machine learning, but the study showed excellent results with the deep learning model. It outperformed traditional machine learning models in all outcome measures.

""Our results support the feasibility of a single AI model as a robust prognostic tool for language outcomes of children served by cochlear implant programs worldwide. This is an exciting advance for the field,"" said senior author Nancy M. Young, MD, Medical Director of Audiology and Cochlear Implant Programs at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago – the U.S. center in the study.

This AI-powered tool allows a 'predict-to-prescribe' approach to optimize language development by determining which child may benefit from more intensive therapy.""

Gestational diabetes rose every single year in the U.S. from 2016 through 2024, according to a new Northwestern Medicine analysis of more than 12 million U.S. births. The condition, which raises health risks for both mother and baby, shot up 36 % over the nine-year period (from 58 to 79 cases per 1,000 births) and increased across every racial and ethnic group.

""Gestational diabetes has been persistently increasing for more than 10 years, which means whatever we have been trying to do to address diabetes in pregnancy has not been working,"" said senior author Dr. Nilay Shah, assistant professor of cardiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

The findings update the research team's earlier work covering 2011–2019, confirming nearly 15 years of uninterrupted increases. Gestational diabetes, a form of glucose intolerance first diagnosed during pregnancy, carries immediate pregnancy risks and increases the chance of future diabetes and heart disease for both the mother and the child. Shah said the alarming trend likely reflects worsening health among young Americans.

""The health of young adults has been persistently worsening - less healthful diets, less exercise, more obesity,"" he said.

These trends likely underlie why the rates of diabetes during pregnancy have gone up.""

Dr. Nilay Shah, Northwestern University

The study is the most current national analysis of gestational diabetes trends in the U.S. It will publish on Dec. 29 in JAMA Internal Medicine.

For the study, the Northwestern scientists analyzed every U.S. birth for first singleton pregnancies from 2016 to 2024, using birth certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics. The team then broke down the data by race and ethnicity and found that women who are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or from other Pacific Islander groups had substantially higher gestational diabetes rates than other groups.

""This is particularly important because these populations tend to be the least well-represented in health research, so we actually understand very little about why these groups have such high rates,"" Shah said.

Here's how many women per 1,000 births had gestational diabetes in 2024:

""The reasons for the differences in gestational diabetes rates across individual groups are an important area for further research,"" Shah said. See tables and charts from the study for visuals of the national rise over time and the rates within each racial and ethnic group, including Asian and Hispanic categories presented in detailed subgroups.

""We saw a lot of variation within Asian and Hispanic groups, which often gets overlooked in research,"" noted first author Emily Lam, a third-year medical student at Feinberg.

""These data clearly show that we are not doing enough to support the health of the U.S. population, especially young women before and during pregnancy,"" Shah said. ""Public health and policy interventions should focus on helping all people access high-quality care and have the time and means to maintain healthful behaviors.""

The study is titled, ""Gestational Diabetes in the US From 2016 to 2024.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Combination therapy offers hope for AML patients facing drug resistance","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251230/Combination-therapy-offers-hope-for-AML-patients-facing-drug-resistance.aspx","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:49:00 GMT","

A research team at Oregon Health & Science University has discovered a promising new drug combination that may help people with acute myeloid leukemia overcome resistance to one of the most common frontline therapies.

In a study published today in Cell Reports Medicine, researchers analyzed more than 300 acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patient samples and found that pairing venetoclax, a standard AML drug, with palbociclib, a cell-cycle inhibitor currently approved for breast cancer, produced significantly stronger and more durable anti-leukemia activity than venetoclax alone. The findings were confirmed in human tissue samples, as well as in mouse models carrying human leukemia cells.

""Of the 25 drug combinations tested, venetoclax plus palbociclib was the most effective. That really motivated us to dig deeper into why it works so well - and why it appears to overcome resistance seen with current therapy,"" said Melissa Stewart, Ph.D., research assistant professor at OHSU and lead author of the study.

More than 20,000 Americans are diagnosed with AML each year, making it one of the most common types of leukemia - and one of the most aggressive.

Since the drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019, venetoclax combined with azacitidine has rapidly become a go-to treatment for many people with AML. But resistance remains a nearly universal problem.

""Unfortunately, almost everyone will eventually have drug resistance,"" said the study's corresponding author, Jeffrey Tyner, Ph.D., professor of cell, developmental and cancer biology in the OHSU School of Medicine.

This regimen has improved initial response rates and quality of life, but the five-year survival rate for AML is still only about 25 % to 40 %. We have a lot of work to do.""

Jeffrey Tyner, School of Medicine, OHSU

Tyner, a co-leader of the national Beat AML 1.0 program said the new study builds directly on the work of that national initiative to help transform and expand treatments for AML.

""This combination was nominated from the Beat AML data, and Dr. Stewart validated that prediction, showing not only that it works, but why,"" Tyner said.

The study found that AML cells exposed to venetoclax alone try to adapt by increasing protein production, a shift that helps them survive. Adding palbociclib, a drug approved for breast cancer, blocked this adaptation by regulating protein-production machinery inside the cell.

""Patient samples that responded strongly to the combination showed clear downregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis,"" Stewart said. ""This was a big clue.""

A genome-wide CRISPR screen also revealed that while venetoclax alone becomes more effective when protein-production genes are lost, the combination therapy does not rely on that same vulnerability - a sign the two drugs work together to shut down multiple survival pathways.

The research team tested the combination using mouse models implanted with human AML cells carrying mutations known to cause venetoclax resistance.

""In this model, venetoclax alone didn't extend survival at all - just as we'd expect based on the genetics,"" Stewart said. ""But with the combination, the majority of mice lived 11 to 12 months. In fact, one mouse was still alive when the study ended.""

Stewart says the project holds personal significance.

""I'm a breast cancer survivor and was treated here at OHSU, so I know what it's like to be a cancer patient,"" she said. ""The hope that research and clinical trials can bring - that's what motivates me. Working on AML gave me a way to contribute.""

Both researchers emphasized the importance of following scientific data even when it leads outside traditional boundaries.

""Some might ask why a breast cancer drug would work in AML,"" Tyner said. ""But biology can be shared across very different cancers. This is a great example of why keeping an open mind matters and following the data where it leads.""

Stewart said that the team is already evaluating other drugs similar to palbociclib - many of them also approved for breast cancer - to expand future clinical trial options. The researchers hope to move the combination toward clinical testing.

""We haven't tested it in patients yet, but based on everything we've seen, our prediction is that this combination would mitigate most known resistance mechanisms to the current standard therapy,"" Tyner said. ""Making it a clinical reality will take work, but this is exactly why we do what we do.""

Immune cells called B cells make antibodies that fight off invading bacteria, viruses and other foreign substances. During their preparation for this battle, B cells transiently revert to a more flexible, or plastic, stem-cell-like state in the lymph nodes, according to a new preclinical study from Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. The results could help explain how many lymphomas develop from mature B cells rather than from stem cells, as many other cancers do, and guide researchers in developing better treatments.

The study, published Dec. 29 in Nature Cell Biology, reveals a paradox: as mature B cells get prepped to make antibodies, a highly specialized process, they temporarily gain plasticity, a feature normally reserved for unspecialized stem cells. They do this by partially erasing their B cell features and activating stem-like programs, which are normally silenced in mature, differentiated cells. These are epigenetic changes, meaning the packaging of DNA is adjusted to regulate gene activity without altering the genetic information itself. Thus, the cells can turn these changes on or off as needed.

""Lymphomas are mostly driven by genetic mutations, but our study suggests that some of these mutations can take advantage of this epigenetic plasticity to drive tumor growth and fitness,"" said Dr. Effie Apostolou, associate professor of molecular biology in medicine and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.

Dr. Laurianne Scourzic, a former instructor of molecular biology in medicine, also co-led the work in collaboration with Dr. Ari Melnick, adjunct professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and director of the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona.

After B cells encounter an antigen, a special environment called the germinal center forms around them in the lymph nodes, in which they cycle between two zones: In one zone, called the dark zone, B cells rapidly divide and mutate to make a random array of antibodies; then they move to the other zone, called the light zone, where they stop dividing and compete for selection from helper T cells in order to either form antibody-secreting cells or memory B cells, long-lived cells that help the body remember the antigen it encountered. If the B cells are not chosen for either of these options, they will undergo apoptosis (programmed death) or a minor fraction will recycle back for additional rounds of proliferation, mutation and selection.

These rapid and multidirectional changes are unusual in normal mature cells and prompted Dr. Apostolou's team to hypothesize that the B cells might be reverting to a stem cell-like state during process.

We know these B cells are mature and terminally differentiated, but they have features reminiscent of stem cells. This goes against the central dogma that cells lose their plasticity and stemness as they develop.""

Dr. Effie Apostolou, Weill Cornell Medicine

The team employed stringent functional methods to test the plasticity of these cells and found that indeed, germinal center B cells have drastically higher capacity to reprogram to a stem cell-like state compared with other mature B cells. Further investigation revealed that only a small subset of the germinal center B cells, the ones that receive T cell help, acquire this plasticity, proving that this process is tightly regulated. Indeed, using various means to modulate the communication between B cells and T cells, the team could enhance or reduce B cell plasticity.

Using single-cell techniques, Dr. Scourzic found that the B cells that interacted with helper T cells showed reduced expression of B cell-specific genes, weakening their B cell identity, while they re-activated stem and progenitor-like programs and regulatory elements, which are usually repressed during development. In another experiment, the researchers deleted a protein called histone H1, which is commonly mutated in lymphoma patients and normally keeps chromatin tightly packaged inside the B cells. They observed an ""opening up"" of the chromatin and increased plasticity of all germinal center B cells, regardless of their interaction with helper T cells. ""This result shows that there might be multiple roads to this plasticity,"" Dr. Scourzic said.

The team then examined associations with lymphoma patients. ""All the signatures that we identified for this highly plastic state seem to be even further upregulated in many lymphoma patients, and they correlate with worse prognoses,"" Dr. Apostolou said. ""We believe that the normal, tightly regulated plasticity during immune reaction can be hijacked by specific mutations to promote lymphomagenesis or enhance fitness."" Mutations in histone H1 are one such example.

The current work highlights promising and targetable molecules and pathways involved in B cells plasticity. Ultimately, identifying the mechanisms involved in germinal center B cell plasticity and their functional links to lymphoma mutations could help researchers find biomarkers indicating which patients would respond better to therapies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists capture real-time action of antiviral drugs on herpes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251230/Scientists-capture-real-time-action-of-antiviral-drugs-on-herpes.aspx","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:41:00 GMT","

Harvard Medical School researchers have uncovered crucial insights into how an emerging class of antiviral drugs works.

The discovery sheds light on an important tool for fighting drug-resistant strains of herpes simplex virus, or HSV, and points to new pathways for treating herpesviruses and other kinds of DNA viruses (those that have DNA as their genetic material and can replicate inside host cells).

The federally funded study is published in Cell Dec. 29.

As an infectious disease doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, study co-senior author

Jonathan Abraham has seen many patients with compromised immune systems develop dangerous drug-resistant HSV infections. Such resistance can evolve when the virus is repeatedly treated with the same type of antiviral.

But Abraham is also an HMS associate professor of microbiology who studies how the physical structures of viruses factor into infections, diseases, and immune responses - making him uniquely positioned to study and find solutions to the problem.

""As a clinician, it's disheartening when medicine can cure a patient of cancer, but the patient requires immunosuppression that leaves them vulnerable to a virus that doesn't respond to the best drugs we have to treat it,"" Abraham said.

As a researcher, this inspires me to learn as much as I can about how the virus works so that we can continue to find better options for people who are sick with resistant strains of viruses.""

Jonathan Abraham, Harvard Medical School

Members of a new class of antivirals are being tested in U.S. clinical trials, and one has gained approval in Japan, but how these emerging drugs work is mostly unknown. Abraham and colleagues sought to uncover some of those secrets.

Abraham worked with co-senior author Joseph Loparo, HMS professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology, to take advantage of advances in structural biology and imaging techniques to explore the biophysical mechanisms at play as the new drugs bind to and inactivate a critical enzyme in the life cycle of HSV.

Abraham's lab focused on revealing the structural details of how the drugs locked to the viral protein, while Loparo's lab worked on capturing real-time details about how the binding process works to block the viral protein.

""A real strength of this study is the combination of high-resolution, atomistic pictures of the viral proteins bound by the inhibitors and real-time imaging of the viral proteins in action,"" Loparo said.

Herpesviruses can cause infections such as chicken pox, shingles, and mononucleosis; have been implicated in cancers, autoimmune diseases, and other diseases; and tend to linger in a latent stage lifelong. Among them, HSV-1 is commonly known for causing cold sores but can also cause serious brain infections in healthy adults and severe disease in immunocompromised people.

The antiviral medicines that are currently FDA-approved for HSV-1 focus on targeting the virus's DNA polymerase, a protein that makes copies of the viral genome. However, strains of the virus have emerged that are resistant to these drugs.

Alternatives are already on their way, including a class of drugs known as helicase-primase inhibitors, or HPIs. These target the viral helicase-primase, an enzyme that, like the polymerase, is critical for herpesviruses to make copies of themselves.

The viral helicase unwinds the viral genome, motoring along and unzipping the interlaced strands of DNA to convert it to single-stranded DNA. This exposes the information encoded in the genome so the polymerase can reproduce it.

The viral primase, meanwhile, triggers the creation of an RNA molecule that serves as a starting place for the new copy of the genome to attach itself to, like the piece at the bottom of a jacket zipper that allows the slider to engage with the teeth of the zipper.

HPIs interfere with these operations to stop the copying process.

Until now, no research had managed to reveal the structures of HSV enzymes such as the helicase-primase. One reason is that they are very wiggly, constantly moving and changing shape. The existence of a working inhibitor - the HPI drugs - now allows scientists to lock the enzymes into a single, static form that can be imaged. Without it, Abraham and colleagues said, their discoveries wouldn't have been possible.

The team used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize at near-atomic resolution the physical structure of the HSV-1 helicase-primase when it is bound by several inhibitors.

The researchers also used cryo-EM to visualize how the viral helicase-primase interacts with the viral polymerase during DNA replication. The structure of this larger complex may help in the identification of new drug target sites by revealing the physical and chemical properties of places where a potential drug could bind and interfere with replication.

The cryo-EM data were collected at the Harvard Cryo-EM Center for Structural Biology at HMS.

A cryo-EM image is a detailed snapshot that shows precisely where and how the drugs interlock with the enzyme and prevent the virus from making new copies of itself. But to understand in a more detailed way how the inhibitor functions, the team wanted to see the molecules in action.

To do this the researchers performed experiments with a tool known as optical tweezers.

Optical tweezers use the momentum of photons from highly focused lasers to manipulate particles, like a science-fiction tractor beam but at a much smaller scale.

The researchers used the tweezers to suspend a piece of viral DNA equipped with the helicase-primase between two beads. They watched the enzyme working, then investigated what happened when they introduced tiny doses of the inhibitor drug. The team was able to observe individual helicase molecules unwinding the double helix of DNA and also could see when the drug stopped the process.

""The latest generation of imaging tools, like the tweezers, have given scientists an unprecedented ability to see how the processes of life work at the level of single molecules,"" said Loparo. ""In this case we were able to see, in real time, how the inhibitor gums up the motor of the helicase and causes it to stall.""

These new insights inspire hope that their work can drive further drug development for antivirals and continue to provide deeper knowledge that will someday soon let physicians harness the machinery of life to bring better health to people everywhere, the researchers said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New roadmap guides antiseizure medication adjustments during pregnancy and postpartum","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251230/New-roadmap-guides-antiseizure-medication-adjustments-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum.aspx","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:20:00 GMT","

For the first time, clinicians have access to a clear, evidence-based roadmap for adjusting antiseizure medication doses during pregnancy and after childbirth. 

The strategies, practiced by a group of leading women's neurology experts in the nationwide landmark Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study, were published today in Neurology. They are expected to inform clinical practice and help ensure healthy pregnancies for women with epilepsy. 

""Our goal was to generate practical evidence that empowers clinicians everywhere-from rural hospitals to urban subspecialty centers-to provide the best possible care for women with epilepsy during pregnancy,"" said Page Pennell, M.D., senior author of the study and chair of neurology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

These strategies are based on real-world data from hundreds of successful pregnancies and can be applied in the clinic immediately.""

Page Pennell, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine 

Epilepsy affects more than one million American women of childbearing age, but for decades, both patients and physicians have faced uncertainty about how to safely manage antiseizure medications during pregnancy. While some modern antiseizure medications are safer than older drugs, pregnancy changes how the body processes these medications, often necessitating careful dose adjustments to maintain seizure control and protect both mother and baby. 

The MONEAD study followed women with epilepsy and their children from pregnancy through age six years. Researchers at 20 academic medical centers, including UPMC as a key clinical partner to Pitt, recorded real-world epilepsy care during pregnancy and postpartum and analyzed the patterns that led to healthy deliveries. 

Leading up to the analysis for this new publication, Pennell and her research collaborators were the first to show that blood levels of epilepsy medications often drop early in pregnancy, requiring proactive dose adjustments to prevent breakthrough seizures. A prior MONEAD study report published in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that pregnant women with epilepsy experienced the same degree of seizure stability as non-pregnant women with epilepsy, but had their medication doses adjusted significantly more often. The MONEAD research also provided critical evidence that children born to women with epilepsy and who were exposed to antiseizure medications in utero reach neurodevelopmental milestones on par with their peers. 

Despite these advances, translating knowledge into everyday clinical practice remains challenging. Research conducted by UPMC pediatric neurologist Laura Kirkpatrick, M.D., found that a significant percentage of healthcare providers report low confidence in managing epilepsy during pregnancy-a gap compounded by historical misconceptions and stigma, which contribute to lower birth rates among women with epilepsy. 

The new study builds upon this earlier work and offers a detailed and practical week-by-week playbook for dose adjustments during pregnancy and postpartum, filling a longstanding gap in clinical care. 

""As a practicing physician who specializes in women's neurology and pregnancy, I see firsthand how critical timely dose adjustments are for protecting both mother and baby,"" said Denise Li, M.D., lead author of the study and assistant professor of neurology at Pitt. ""This guidance gives clinicians the confidence to adjust antiseizure medication doses precisely at every stage of pregnancy and postpartum."" 

Ongoing studies at UPMC and partner sites continue to refine medication management strategies for pregnant women with epilepsy to further improve outcomes and support raising awareness of best practices through initiatives such as the Epilepsy and Pregnancy Medical Consortium website. 

Other authors of this research are Wesley Kerr, M.D., Ph.D., and Katherine McFarlane, M.S., of Pitt; Alison Pack, M.D., of Columbia University; Jacqueline French, M.D., of NYU Langone; Elizabeth Gerard, M.D., of Northwestern University; Angela Birnbaum, Ph.D., of the University of Minnesota; and Kimford Meador, M.D., of Stanford University.

Compared to the accelerated track to Olympic gold that was 2024, this year has been one of transformational adjustments within the U.S. women's national team. Relative to the tight deadline head coach Emma Hayes was under when she began her tenure last year, officially starting the job two months before the Olympics, she luxuriated in ample time with the team in 2025 .

This meant time to tinker with the development pipeline within U.S. Soccer, which led to the inaugural Futures Camp in January as well as a record-setting 16 new players called up to the senior team, which makes the USWNT's 2025 record of 12-3 even more impressive.

Throughout the year, players spoke of steep learning curves, exceptional challenges, and confidence building as they attempted to wedge their way into the core group Hayes plans to hone in on when the intensity of World Cup preparation increases further in 2026.

The U.S. finished the calendar year with a tidy 2-0 victory over Italy in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. on Dec. 1, and only seven of the players who competed in that match were part of the team's gold medal-winning roster from the 2024 Summer Olympics. The Athletic reflects on some of the most pivotal moments from 2025 and sets intentions for the next.

USWNT's high-scoring summer

This summer felt like the epitome of Hayes' vision not only for the senior national team, but the system she's been forging with other head coaches on the women's side of U.S. Soccer. She kicked the summer off in surprising fashion by offering a break to players based in Europe who had just completed their seasons abroad; only center-back Naomi Girma, who was working her way back from injury, was called in to camp that summer. Everyone else featured came from the NWSL and included a slew of new faces, many of whom had been named to the January Futures camp or had recently impressed at the U-23 level, like midfielder Sam Meza and defenders Jordyn Bugg and Lilly Reale.

The U.S. competition over the summer was filtered through the schedules of continental tournaments like the Women's Africa Cup of Nations, Copa América Femenina, and the European Championship. They faced tests against China, Jamaica, Ireland, and Canada, and aced all four emphatically, scoring a total of 18 goals without conceding a single one. Given the volume of fresh faces who played during that window, this summer offered a glimpse of Hayes' program in motion.

USWNT 1-2 Portugal

I'm enjoying the growing lore between the U.S. and Portugal, which started at the 2023 World Cup when Portugal nearly knocked the U.S. out in the group stage. This match, the first of two in the October window, was their first time meeting since the World Cup. Portugal, despite having the weaker roster in terms of individual talent, was assertive and unafraid, bouncing back after conceding in the opening minute of the match to claim a massive 2-1 victory.

The U.S., meanwhile, looked listless across the pitch, unable to conduct plays from the midfield and generally seeming unsure of themselves, which resulted in individualistic play that Hayes described as a “game of Whac-a-Mole.” Adding to the concern was the fact that the starting midfielders in that game were composed of USWNT veterans Lindsey Heaps, Rose Lavelle, and Sam Coffey.

That said, at the risk of sounding aggressively glass-half-full, this felt more like a one-off moment rather than a pattern in 2025. Hayes has been adamant all year that she would not prioritize winning over development, which is why the USWNT's other losses to Japan and Brazil that preceded this match are not “worst moment” candidates. Those games, which took place in February and April, respectively, were experimental for younger USWNT players like Ally Sentnor, Claire Hutton, and Lily Yohannes, who were going up against teams ranked among the top 10 in the world for the first time at the senior level. That was less the case in October and with a more experienced lineup, which is what made the Portugal match so confounding and disappointing.

—Griffin

Catarina Macario

Macario is a complete player, with a high, and frankly undefined, ceiling. So much so that it's hard to tell how much better the 26-year-old forward can get. After missing out on the 2024 Olympics due to irritation in her knee, Macario started 2025 with a bang that refused to dull. She scored the USWNT's first goal of the year against Colombia in the SheBelieves Cup and went on to net seven more, making her the team's top goalscorer this year.

As with most things related to Macario's game, the stat sheet only tells part of the story. Her awareness and movement off the ball are singular in the USWNT's attack, and her ability to combine with younger players like Yohannes (whose two assists this year both led to Macario goals) and older ones like Lavelle makes her a critical link between generations on the pitch. She started all 10 of the matches she appeared in and recorded two assists on top of her eight goals on the year.

—Griffin

Hayes on players going abroad

Hayes is good for a quirky metaphor; she's quoted Robert Frost and made culinary references to putting players in the frying pan and slow-cooking her development plans like a winter stew.

My favorite line from Hayes, however, was in response to a question the former Chelsea manager is likely tired of being asked about USWNT players moving abroad to play in Europe. It's a question she thinks exposes a subtle gendered assumption about where female athletes can and should be, rather than celebrating that they have viable options.

“I find it fascinating because nobody asked Mauricio (Pochettino, USMNT head coach) them, and it almost feels like we always have to ask that question because it's women. Now, all of a sudden, women get the opportunity to choose. We should celebrate the position that women are in to be able to do that. We shouldn't shoehorn it. Like, we can have an incredible league and still have incredible U.S. women's national team players that played both here and abroad and is celebrated instead of, like, picking it apart.

“It doesn't mean we're always going to lose people forever, and it doesn't mean we're going to lose everyone. We just have to accept that different things matter to different people.”



—Griffin

Sam Coffey the… goalscorer?

On a scale of 1-10, if someone had told me Sam Coffey would be in a three-way tie for second place on the USWNT's list of top goalscorers by the end of 2025, my surprise would register somewhere at around an eight.

Before this year, the 26-year-old defensive midfielder had one goal to her name from a 2023 friendly against China. This year she scored four (including in another friendly against China), along with forwards Lynn Biyendolo and Ally Sentnor. Only Macario has scored more with eight.



“I miss plenty of them in practice, so it was about time I made one,” Coffey joked after this year's China match. “I feel like I'm working a lot on trying to join the play more, get up in counter-measures. I tend to play it too safe, and think too ‘worst-case scenario,' so I was just trying to join.”

The USWNT hasn't seen a goalscoring No. 6 since Julie Ertz, who was known for her aerial prowess. Coffey's profile is very different, but her burgeoning hunger for the back of the net makes for exciting possibilities as the USWNT continues to build.

Sophia Wilson

2025 was marked by a Triple Espresso-shaped hole in the USWNT as Wilson and Mallory Swanson were absent on maternity leave and Trinity Rodman's ongoing back injury forced her into sporadic appearances on the national team. Wilson gave birth to her daughter Gianna in September, and by November was traveling with her to the NWSL Championship in San Jose, Calif. and the USWNT's final games of the year in Florida.

When she announced that she would exercise her player option with the Thorns and return to Portland in 2026, Wilson mentioned the importance of returning to a familiar place after such a significant life change and long break from soccer. On the national team front, she'll be returning to a completely different setup than the one she left shortly after the Olympics, which will make her return to the USWNT all the more worth paying attention to.

The bounce back in Connecticut

We all remember the panic that set in after the USWNT fell to Portugal at Subaru Park in Philadelphia. It was an uncharacteristic 2-1 loss from the U.S., as they seemed disjointed on the pitch. It was the first time the team played together in roughly 130 days, and it certainly showed.

But what stood out from this window was the team's ability to bounce back. The U.S. returned to the pitch at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn., just three days later, where they faced Portugal again. This time, the U.S. flipped the script. Both games started with an early goal from the U.S., but the players kept their pace in their much-needed redo. Rising star Olivia Moultrie played a key role in their 3-1 win with her second-ever career brace — a symbolic nod to the team's next generation. The team kept their momentum against Portugal, maintained control and ended the night on top.

As Hayes said after the match, “I'm really, really pleased with the mentality, most importantly, of the group to recover, but also (to) dominate the game in a way I expect and demand.” Losing against Portugal was just as important for the U.S. as winning against them was, and this pair of matches stands out as one of the most important weeks of 2025 for the USWNT as they continue to develop.

16 first-time call-ups

As Tamerra pointed out in her dispatch from Florida earlier this month, a record 16 players earned their first senior national team caps with the U.S. in 2025. This stands as the most caps earned in any calendar year in program history.

Hayes' pipeline was put into motion this fall when Rodman had to miss the USWNT camps in October and November after sustaining a mid-season injury with the Washington Spirit. Paris Saint-Germain's Eva Gaetino, who was called up to train with the U.S. U-23 camp, was called up mid-window to fill in that vacancy on the senior side.

This fluidity between the two teams was also highlighted by Gotham FC's Jaedyn Shaw. The 21-year-old successfully moved between both rosters, returning to the USWNT senior side in October for the first time since April after spending two summer windows with the U-23. Upon her return, Shaw seemed refreshed. This was punctuated further by her dominance with Gotham, which she joined in September, and later helped lead to their second NWSL Championship win in three years.

Hayes' persistence in developing this pipeline will continue to strengthen the foundation of the U.S. team and allow players the flexibility to develop at their own pace.

The return of Triple Espresso

About a year ago, when Hayes shared the USWNT's 26-player roster for January camp, the team's announcement included a line about the Triple Espresso. The beloved frontline of Wilson, Swanson and Rodman would be absent from the team's first camp of 2025, as they continued offseason rest and injury recovery.

No one could have predicted that we would go the entire calendar year without the trio together on a pitch, especially after they won the hearts of global soccer fans with their Olympic gold medal run in Paris just the summer before. Wilson and Swanson took time away from soccer in 2025 to start their families, while Rodman's long-anticipated return to the USWNT this fall was delayed by an injury sustained during the NWSL season.

To say the national team has moved on from Triple Espresso would be wrong. Sure, multiple players have stepped up in their absence, and these players will all have to earn their way back into the team's starting lineup, but as the USWNT eyes the 2027 World Cup in Brazil, this next year will be critical in identifying the tournament's final roster.

Chris Richards, Lily Yohannes, and more headline GOAL's 2025 USMNT and USWNT Awards, breaking down the players, moments and transfers that defined American soccer's year.

On paper, 2025 looked like a lull for American soccer. For the U.S. men's national team, it was the year before the year, with eyes fixed firmly on the 2026 World Cup. For the U.S. women's national team, it marked a transition from 2024 Olympic glory toward the 2027 World Cup cycle.


In practice, it was anything but quiet. Big moments, big goals and big results defined a rollercoaster year that laid critical groundwork for what comes next.


That foundation is what made 2025 matter. Down-the-stretch performances gave both the USMNT and USWNT reason for optimism, with Mauricio Pochettino and Emma Hayes setting the tone - and a host of players delivering when it counted.

To close the door on 2025, GOAL looks back at the year that was for the USMNT and USWNT by giving out some awards, headlining the best in American soccer...

There are plenty of candidates for this award, perhaps more than in recent years. However, if you're searching for the right combination of successes with both club and country, there really is one player that stands out: Richards.

This 2025 calendar year has been something of a breakout one for Richards, even if he was already established prior to it. With Crystal Palace, he won two trophies, headlined by an FA Cup triumph that was his club's first-ever piece of major silverware. With the USMNT, he was a mainstay throughout the year, stepping into a leadership role that should carry on right through the World Cup.

There's no doubt now that Richards is right up there with the most important players in the USMNT group.

Again, no shortage of candidates, but there was something special about Macario's run throughout 2025.

After seeing several years derailed by injuries, Macario was desperately needed by the USWNT this year. With the famous Triple Espresso largely sidelined, Emma Hayes was looking for a real leader in the attack, and she found one in Macario. The Chelsea star finished with eight goals in 10 games, four more than any USWNT player, but it wasn't just the goals; it was the impact she made on a young USWNT group that was largely experimental throughout the year.

Now, with the USWNT approaching full strength, Macario has more than proven she deserves to be a part of it, and perhaps even a focal point on the road to 2027.

This was a big year for many young players clawing for a USMNT spot. The thing is, though, that few could have imagined Freeman being a part of it just 12 months ago.

The Orlando City star earned his first MLS start in March. By summer, he was a USMNT Gold Cup starter and, by the end of the fall slate, he looked about as close as a player can to being a World Cup contender. It was a rapid rise for the fullback, who blossomed defensively after showing so many positive signs on the attacking end in the first half of the year. 

Now, Freeman looks set to be a key player for the U.S. for years to come, and, still just 21, his potential seems somewhat limitless.

Yohannes' rise felt inevitable. What surprised many was how quickly everything clicked.

Just 18 years old, Yohannes has already shown that she can go toe-to-toe with any midfielder on the planet. She already has incredible vision and game sense, and her ability to actually pass the ball can't be matched by anyone in the USWNT pool. There are aspects of her game that need some development, for sure, but there are already several legitimately world-class aspects to what Yohannes can bring to a team.

There's so much reason for optimism with Yohannes, who already seems to be a starter for the U.S. despite being a teen. That's insane given the wealth of talent in the U.S. pool, but Yohannes might be the most purely talented of any of them.

It was like everything the USMNT had been working towards manifested itself in one night. To close 2025, the U.S. put in a near-perfect performance, one that created enough optimism to hold everyone over until their return in March.

Facing off with Uruguay, the team that knocked them out of the Copa America just over a year prior, the U.S. ran away as 5-1 winners, reducing one of South America's best teams to a pile of rubble. It wasn't a game dominated by the USMNT's traditional ""stars"" either; it was one that saw a young, hungry group of upstarts step up and show that they, too, can play against the best teams in the world.

After the match, a notably frosty Mauricio Pochettino fired back at the notion that there were ""regulars"" or that any player in the pool had more or less to prove than anyone else. This result showed that he was right and that the USMNT has a wide variety of players capable of creating magic, even against teams as good as Uruguay.

This isn't the choice because of the on-field result. The U.S. beat plenty of good teams this year, and they put on several performances that were actually more impressive than this one. This is the choice, though, because of what it represented.

A number of storylines made this significant. First, of course, was the crowd itself. The match was the first women's match played at SoFi Stadium, and it was played in front of over 32,000 fans, showcasing the strength of women's soccer and women's sports in America. Then there was the game, which was billed as a rematch of the 2024 Olympic Gold Medal match, pitting two of the sport's great teams against one another. And then, finally, there was the presence of Trinity Rodman, who marked her return from injury with a goal just five minutes into the 2-0 USWNT triumph.

This match was just the perfect encapsulation of everything that makes the USWNT so exciting: Passion, starpower, and, ultimately, results against the game's top teams.

Just one year ago, it would have been hard to imagine that Musah wouldn't be a key player at the 2026 World Cup. Now, there are legitimate questions about whether he'll be there at all.

We haven't seen Musah in a USMNT shirt since March and, given his struggles on the club level, it remains unclear where he stands with Pochettino and his staff. Musah, like teammate Christian Pulisic, skipped out on the Gold Cup but, unlike Pulisic, was not given a recall in the fall, meaning he missed out on many of the USMNT's most crucial games this season.

What will we see from Musah next? It may depend on the transfer window. So, too, might his World Cup hopes.

That aforementioned Brazil game? That was all we saw of Rodman in a USWNT shirt as injuries derailed so much of her 2025 calendar year. It's such a shame, too, because, when she is healthy, Rodman is quite clearly one of the most exciting players that the sport has right now.

A back injury defined the start of the year, although she was able to make that one appearance against Brazil. That game, as it turned out, has been her only one since the Gold Medal game back in August 2024. Recalled in the fall, an MCL issue once again put Rodman on the shelf, preventing her from being part of the USWNT's October slate.

Rodman is just so good and, while we've seen her show that in the NWSL, it hasn't happened nearly enough in a USWNT shirt. Let's hope that 2026 can be different as Rodman, like her two other Triple Espresso running mates, prepares for a return.

This is tough to break down, particularly so early into the season. In terms of impact, though? There's no denying just what this meant for Tillman and, in some ways, for the USMNT.

Tillman's move to Bayer Leverkusen came with a reported fee of $41 million, which makes sense given what was being asked of him. He wasn't signed as a project; he was brought in to replace a world-class star in Florian Wirtz as quickly as possible. So far, he's shown that he can make a difference, even at a level as high as the Bundesliga.

Just as importantly, though, he's offered a blueprint, particularly to now-former PSV teammate Ricardo Pepi. If Tillman can do it at the highest level, why can't Pepi? That's part of the knock-on effect that comes from an American player proving himself for club and country.

This one came all the way back in January, and, in hindsight, it was something of a trendsetter, wasn't it?

To start 2025, Girma became women's soccer's first $1 million player when she made the move to Chelsea. That distinction, though, didn't last long. In the months since, four other players have hit that illustrious seven-figure mark, including her USWNT teammate Alyssa Thompson, who joined her in London later in the year. Girma's move, then, was a tipping point, one that kick-started a new era for women's soccer.

It was also a warning shot to the NWSL, which could lose more stars to Europe in the years to come. In response, the league unveiled new roster rules this fall with an aim to keep hold of Rodman. Still, it was Girma who was the biggest domino to fall with a move that could have a huge lasting impact.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

High Impact Player mechanism debate with NWSLPA signals pivotal moment for league

by



This holiday season brings a mix of cheers and jeers for National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Jessica Berman.





A record eight NWSL teams made the Forbes annual list of the world's most valuable sports teams. Atlanta will join the league as its 17th team, having paid a record-high $165 million for expansion rights. The league also garnered record-breaking TV audiences this year for its Championship game on platforms like ESPN. 





Crucially, two of the United States women's national team's brightest stars, Sophia Wilson and Trinity Rodman, are seemingly choosing to remain stateside. On December 16, Sportico first reported that Wilson officially became the league's highest-paid player as she exercised her $1 million player option with the Portland Thorns. 





It serves as a counterpoint to the narrative about the league's difficulty retaining elite American players, like Alyssa Thompson and Naomi Girma.





However, that is where things get complicated.

Tim Howard sites Matt Freese's rapid ascent for why he is U.S. Soccer's Breakthrough Male Player of the Year while Landon Donovan focuses on Diego Luna's impact on the team's culture shift.

For the United States Men's Soccer Team, 2025 will likely not be remembered as a year of tremendous on-field success.  Yes, they did end on a high note going unbeaten in 5 consecutive friendlies capped off by their 5-1 win over Uruguay.  But those results are at best neutralized and at worst overshadowed by the team's 3rd place finish in March's Nations League and their runner-up finish in the summer's Gold Cup.

With results being mixed in the way that they were, 2025 may instead be remembered for the new faces that emerged along the way, faces that could yet blossom into national team mainstays in the years to come.

On the latest edition of Unfiltered Soccer with USMNT legends Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the duo handed out their end-of-year “Unfiltie” awards, among which was the award for U.S. Soccer's Breakthrough Male Player of the Year.  Howard identified a number of viable candidates, but ultimately, it was a player at the position closest to his heart whose rise was so extreme that it stood above the rest.



“If we sat here six months ago and someone would have said to both you and I, ‘the starting goalkeeper is going to be this kid Matt Freese from New York City,' we'd have been like ‘caller, get off the line, you're stupid.'”

But that is precisely what has happened.  Freese didn't emerge as a regular starter at club level in MLS until 2024 when he was 25 years old.  He didn't receive his first call up to the national team until this past January.  But as the curtain comes down on 2025, he is the unquestioned number 1 goalkeeper for his country.

“He's gonna play every game in the World Cup,” said Howard.  “That has to be the breakthrough player of the year.”

In Donovan's eyes, however, there was a player even more deserving than Freese.

In the summer of 2024, Diego Luna wasn't able to land a place on the U.S. Olympic team, a roster primarily comprised of up-and-coming players under the age of 23.  But less than a year later, the Real Salt Lake midfielder had caught the eye of the senior team Head Coach and has subsequently played his way into serious contention to be a part of the USMNT's World Cup squad.

“When Diego Luna broke his nose during that January friendly and refused to come off the field,"" said Donovan, ""[Mauricio] Pochettino gravitated to him and said, ‘okay, he's like me.”

In Donovan's estimation, Luna's impact was more significant than simply performing well on the field – he was also the catalyst to a much-needed culture change within the program.

“As players, we're always paying attention. And if the coach loves a guy who's doing a certain thing, you're like, ‘I'm going to do more of that because I want to get on the field.' And that's what Diego Luna was. He was that guy that everyone said, ‘okay, I have to play this way. I don't have to be perfect, but I have to play with that level of passion if I'm going to make the national team.' And I think that was a breakthrough moment. So for me, he's the breakthrough player of the year.”

Tis the silly season

It's nearly January which means that the January transfer window is set to open. While the week between New Years and Christmas is typically a time void that feels as if it spans anywhere from three to 47 days where sleep and meal schedules are wildly jostled about ahead of the return to schools and offices, football clubs are busy planning moves for the second half of their seasons. That means there are gifts that could be opened in the form of transfer moves to begin the year.

This year that could be Ricardo Pepi heading to Fulham for upwards of $50 million according to The Daily Mail. The report notes that the Cottagers are in need of help upfront and are willing to spend a tidy sum to bring in the right player. Pepi was linked to the club in the past and his showing with PSV this year has kept that interest strong. The striker has 10 goals and 3 assists across playing in the Eredivisie and Champions League while being in and out of the starting XI.

Moving to the Premier League would obviously be a step forward for Pepi, but it may also risk his playing time ahead of the World Cup.

FIFAe and Sports Interactive have announced the launch of the FIFAe Club World Cup 26™ featuring Football Manager.

According to FIFAe, FIFA's football esports division, registrations are open for professional, semi-professional, and amateur football clubs worldwide on FIFA.GG, offering places in the online qualifiers. 

“From press conferences to transfers and tactics, represent your club on the global stage and become the first-ever champion of this new competition,” stated FIFAe on social media. 

The online qualifiers act as a pathway to the FIFAe Club World Cup 26™ featuring Football Manager. Clubs, represented by participating players, will compete in several online match weeks, where the players' performance will determine which teams qualify for the main event.

FIFAe has shared that it will publish more information on competition format, schedule, roster requirements, and operational processes for the online qualifiers in the coming weeks. In the meantime, clubs can apply for the qualifiers by reaching out to the esports division through [email protected].

The FIFAe Club World Cup 26™ marks the return of Football Manager as an esport. Taking the traditional PVE experience and pitting the best players against one another in a competitive setting.

FIFAe last held a collaborative competition for Football Manager in 2024, where 40 players (20 managers and 20 assistant managers) from 19 nations competed in Liverpool for a $100,000 (~£75,000) prize pool. Back then, the tournament took place across five days, with the Group Stage spanning four days before concluding with the Knockout Stage on the fifth. 

The 2026 edition is setting itself up as a separate tournament entirely, which is apparent through the format changes announced so far, such as the inclusion of online qualifiers. 

In 2025, no FIFAe Football Manager esports event took place. This could have been due to the fact that the franchise never released a 2025 edition after postponing its annual release. The announcement for the FIFAe Club World Cup 26™ featuring Football Manager was made a month after the release of Football Manager 26 in November 2025.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) -- World sport was this year marked by major title breakthroughs and tightly contested championship finishes. Here are some of the key moments:

Football: PSG breakthrough and Club World Cup

Club football in 2025 saw Paris Saint-Germain finally claim the European crown, while Chelsea triumphed at the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States.

PSG clinched its first UEFA Champions League title by overwhelming Inter Milan 5-0 in the final in Munich. The result delivered the silverware the French club had craved since the start of the Qatar-backed era in 2011.

Under coach Luis Enrique, PSG moved away from a reliance on high-profile individual stars, building a team that combined tactical discipline with youthful exuberance. Teenage winger Desire Doue was among the standout performers in the final with two goals and an assist.

The new-look FIFA Club World Cup ended with Chelsea lifting the trophy after a 3-0 win over PSG in the final in New Jersey. Cole Palmer scored twice and added an assist, capping a season in which he established himself as one of Chelsea's most decisive players.

Brazilian clubs made a strong collective showing at the tournament, with Botafogo, Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense all reaching the knockout stage.

Argentina's representatives struggled by contrast, as Boca Juniors and River Plate exited early, highlighting a gap between the country's dominant national team and its leading clubs.

Tennis: A rivalry for the ages

Men's tennis in 2025 continued a transition that now appears firmly settled at the top of the sport. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner shared the biggest titles and the world No. 1 ranking throughout the season, turning their rivalry into the defining storyline of the year.

They met six times on the ATP Tour, with Alcaraz holding a 4-2 edge. Each won two Grand Slam titles in 2025, extending a run in which they have claimed the last eight men's singles majors dating back to the 2024 Australian Open.

Their rise confirmed a generational shift following the retirements of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, with Novak Djokovic remaining the only leading figure from the previous era still competing at the top level.

By the end of the season, the focus had shifted to how Alcaraz and Sinner would shape the sport rather than whether they were ready to do so.

Formula One: Thrilling finale

Formula One delivered one of its most competitive seasons in years, with the drivers' championship going down to the final race in Abu Dhabi.

Briton Lando Norris secured his first world title after a three-way battle with Red Bull driver Max Verstappen and McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.

Norris won seven races and secured 18 podium finishes, keeping his composure in the tense final weeks.

The title was McLaren's first drivers' championship since Lewis Hamilton won in 2008, marking a milestone for a team that had spent much of the previous decade rebuilding.

NBA: Oklahoma City ends wait

The NBA's defining story of 2025 was the rise of the Oklahoma City Thunder from contender to champion.

The Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 4-3 in the NBA Finals to secure the franchise's first championship since relocating from Seattle in 2008.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander dominated the 2024-25 season with a league-high average of 32.7 points per game as he won both the regular-season MVP and Finals MVP awards.

The title capped a season of sustained dominance for Oklahoma City, which finished the regular season 68-14, tied for the fifth-most wins in a single NBA season.

Athletics: Duplantis caps record-breaking year

Armand Duplantis dominated the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, clearing a pole vault world record of 6.30 meters to cement his position at the top of the sport heading toward the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.

Over the course of 2025, the 26-year-old broke the world record four times across indoor and outdoor competitions.

Beyond Duplantis, the championships delivered a host of standout moments, including Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson's Jamaican one-two finish in the men's 100 meters, a historic marathon gold for Tanzania's Alphonce Felix Simbu, and a sprint treble by U.S. athlete Melissa Jefferson-Wooden.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won the women's 400 meters in the second-fastest time in history, also a new championship record, while Kenya's Beatrice Chebet completed another 5,000m-10,000m double after the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Cricket: Title droughts end

Cricket in 2025 produced two world championship wins that had been a long time coming. South Africa claimed the ICC World Test Championship at Lord's, defeating defending champion Australia in the final.

It was the Proteas' first major ICC men's title since they lifted the Champions Trophy in 1998. The team was anchored by Aiden Markram's fourth-innings century, with captain Temba Bavuma contributing a composed 66 to end a long run of near misses in major tournaments.

In the women's game, India claimed its first ICC Women's Cricket World Cup title on home soil, defeating South Africa in the final in Navi Mumbai. India posted a competitive total before Deepti Sharma led the bowling effort to close out the match.

Reigning champion Australia was eliminated in the semifinals, reinforcing the depth of competition at the top of the women's game.  ■","{'href': 'https://english.news.cn', 'title': 'Xinhua'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Guardiola: Man City's resurgence began at Club World Cup","https://www.beinsports.com/en-us/soccer/premier-league/articles/guardiola-man-citys-resurgence-began-at-club-world-cup-2025-12-29","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 04:52:46 GMT","

Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City's revival began at this summer's Club World Cup, which helped banish the woes of the previous season.

City's 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest on Saturday means Guardiola's team have won their last six Premier League matches, and they are just two points off leaders Arsenal.

This is a stark contrast to last season, in which City finished trophyless for the first time since the 2016-17 season, with the club losing four league matches in a row at one point, their worst run since 2008.

Despite City exiting the Club World Cup at the hands of Al-Hilal in the last 16, Guardiola is convinced that the tournament laid the foundations for a return to form in the coming months.

""Energy, energy, energy,"" he said.

""We lost it last season. We started to train better, compete better.

""We needed energy and then you have a good environment. When we went out to Al-Hilal, it wasn't the fact that we didn't win but that we were so good there.

""I think there, after talking with [City assistants] Pep [Lijnders] and James [French], Manel [Estiarte], Hugo [Viana], Txiki [Begiristain], we turned around and said something changed. Something [you can feel].

""It doesn't mean you are going to win, but that you are able to recognise the team.

""It is not easy to compete in a way we do. We have to improve, absolutely, but this mindset is better.""

Guardiola, who is in his tenth season at City, admits that he himself has been re-energised by his new-look side, with the club having signed Rayan Cherki, Tijjani Reijnders and Gianluigi Donnarumma in the summer.

He said: ""New players, I want to help them. When you've got the same players it is, 'Ah, tired.'

""But new players you think, 'ah, how is this guy?', and try to analyse. The energy comes from there.

""Energy can go down but energy can go up. Never in our lives is it the same.

""In professional or personal, you'll never be happy all the time but never sad all the time. You have to realise why, to realise what we missed, to come back.""

City face Sunderland on Thursday. They have also been heavily linked with a move for Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo.

Reece James celebrates Chelsea's Club World Cup win Luke Hales/Getty Images

Reece James' 2025 has been peppered with landmarks in his Chelsea career, and he will end the year with another.

On May 25, Chelsea qualified for the Champions League for the first time under James' captaincy. Three days later, he lifted his first trophy as captain when Chelsea won the Conference League, and on July 13, he added another with victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final. October 18 saw James reach 200 appearances for his boyhood club on their trip to Nottingham Forest.

Tonight, when Chelsea host Bournemouth, will mark another milestone: one year injury-free. After a hamstring injury in November 2024, James returned to Enzo Maresca's matchday squad on December 30 for their 2-0 defeat away at Ipswich Town and, bar a brief illness in March, has been fit ever since.

Given how injuries have disrupted the 26-year-old's career to date, that is a huge achievement — for which both player and club deserve credit.

“The fact that he's been able to sustain a good period without injury is definitely a positive sign for him going forward,” says physiotherapist Luke Anthony, who has not worked with James but provided The Athletic with a general view from his time at Watford, Reading, and Norwich City.

“I think probably the biggest difference with him is he's been able to get on a run (of games) and he's had a period of adaptation where he has developed that robustness.

“What may have happened is either that he has just been able to develop that consistency of training and develop strength in his body, (or) whether he has changed his approach.”

Two statistics from Chelsea's festive fixtures highlight the improvement in James' availability.

He made his 50th club appearance of 2025 against Aston Villa on Saturday, the highest figure he has reached in a calendar year since 2021. Hamstring and knee problems have particularly plagued James, and across the past three full seasons, he has averaged 22.3 appearances in all competitions per campaign. He has already made 22 appearances this season with five months remaining.

The club's medical team, led by Bryce Cavanagh, have managed James carefully. Ben Macdonald, one of Chelsea's rehab physios, has been tasked with working closely with James on his fitness and the two have developed a strong rapport.

James is also an example of how Chelsea believe their approach to load management can pay off. As The Athletic have reported, this season has seen a deliberate strategy of carefully managing players' minutes, led by the medical and performance team.

The graph below shows James' rolling minutes-per-game average. Previously, steep drops were followed by sharp peaks as he was introduced to a heavy load quickly after returning. Since his return in January, his minutes have been managed more carefully.



“It makes perfect sense to take longer with the return to play,” Anthony says. “There is such a huge gap between a few days or a week of training and then being able to sustain 90 minutes of high-intensity Premier League football game by game.

“Sometimes with these soft-tissue injuries, you don't necessarily get the warning signs, and the player plays and feels OK. Then the temptation is to use him again, especially if they're an important player in your team.”

Anthony explains the importance of patience as a player's tissues adapt to the load of professional football after a lay-off. “It takes a period of time to develop that, especially when you're coming back from injury. Otherwise, you are more vulnerable to that injury.”

A tweak to James' position could also have helped his continued fitness. The idea of using him in midfield is not new; in the days after Maresca's appointment, the head coach sent James footage of him playing in midfield when on loan at Wigan Athletic in the 2018-19 season and suggested they could explore that.

It has become increasingly common to see the Chelsea captain playing in a defensive-midfield role, and as well as yielding impressive performances, Anthony suggests the shift might also have helped reduce the strain on his muscles.

“(Wide players) generally have an exposure to more distance of high-speed running and more sprints, more one-v-ones in those areas offensively and defensively. The central positions will generally have less distance of sprints and high-speed running.

“As a midfielder, you'll have more distance covered, but you'll likely have fewer offensive and defensive sprints, which are again, slightly more attritional for a soft-tissue injury.”

James himself is also credited for his hard work, with one source close to the player — speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships — saying it is like he lives at the training ground. The individual work he has done includes working with his own external physiotherapist, in addition to the support he is given by Chelsea.

Hand in hand with James' improved availability has been his growth as a leader, which has been noticed around the club.

“I spoke with him, and I expected more from him in terms of leadership, inside the changing room and for different kinds of things,” Maresca said of James in October 2024. “He's one of the captains. I expected from him, and his team-mates expected from him, to give always more in terms of leadership in general.”

Naturally, being on the pitch more often has helped James' leadership, and he has responded well to Maresca's challenge. As he has grown into the captaincy, he has expressed himself more and his increased comfort in media interviews has been noticed at Chelsea. He is described as having the respect of everyone at the club.

James' maturity was evident in his post-match interview with Sky Sports on Saturday, when he said Chelsea “have ourselves to blame” for errors that cost them in the 2-1 defeat against Aston Villa.

“Absolutely, yes,” Maresca said when asked in his press conference ahead of the Villa match if James was now playing and behaving like the captain he wanted. “He's growing in terms of leadership, he's growing also in terms of (as a) player, because he's playing more and more minutes.

“We are all happy, first of all, because he can be fit, he can be healthy. And then because we know that he can behave as a leader.”

Chelsea have supported their captain throughout his injury troubles. In September 2022, he signed a contract that runs until 2028. Chelsea's general policy is not to hold contract talks during the season, wanting players to focus on the campaign, and prefer to do so in summer. Even if James travels to the World Cup in 2026 with England as expected, that does not necessarily mean an agreement could not be reached this summer; Cole Palmer, for instance, signed a new deal in August 2024 after the European Championship.

At a time when Chelsea need strong leadership, James' continued fitness and growth are surely one of the biggest positives to take from 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

...

Manchester City could keep one eye on a sell-on clause included in their deal that took James McAtee to Nottingham Forest in the most-recent summer transfer window.

McAtee decided to part ways with his boyhood club on a permanent basis this summer in the backdrop of a 2024-25 season wherein the 23-year-old struggled for regular minutes in his first full season back in the Manchester City senior ranks after successive loans at Sheffield United.

The Salford-born playmaker considered a January exit amid interest from Bayer Leverkusen but Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola pleaded with the academy graduate to see the season through as the Blues struggled with key absences in midfield and spent over £180 million on reinforcements in the January transfer window.

Guardiola handed McAtee a new lease of life in the business stages of the 2024-25 campaign as the midfielder made his first set of Premier League starts, notably scoring on his full debut in the English top-flight as Manchester City came from two goals behind to claim an emphatic 5-2 triumph over Crystal Palace in April.

However, it was too little, too late in terms of a show of faith as McAtee decided to captain England at the FIFA U-21 World Cup in the summer over a chance to represent Manchester City at the FIFA Club World Cup in the United States.

Clubs across the Bundesliga expressed varying levels of interest in the Englishman, who toured suitor clubs' facilities in Germany before deciding to stay in England and join Nottingham Forest for £30 million.

Manchester City are understood to have included sell-on and buy-back clauses in the playmaker's sale to the City Ground – a standard practice for the Blues in the event of academy graduate sales over the years.

The Blues remain in an embryonic stage of their transition under director of football Hugo Viana, who made sweeping changes to Guardiola's ranks in the summer, and while the jury remains out on whether they can sustain their recent purple patch, City could well finish the season with silverware.

Meanwhile, McAtee has so far struggled to establish a regular starting place in the east Midlands following major upheaval at the City Ground, where Ange Postecoglou was sacked as manager in October 39 days into his reign and replaced by Sean Dyche.

Now, according to the information of Mail Sport's Simon Jones, both Leeds United and Chelsea have checked on McAtee's situation at Nottingham Forest, while Bournemouth, Fulham, and Sunderland have varying degrees of interest in a loan deal for the player.

It is explained that while Dyche and the club's hierarchy think highly of the 23-year-old and maintain he has a bright future at the club, his 10 appearances so far this season with several from the substitutes' bench has alerted interested clubs.

Further afield, it is pointed out that Bundesliga sides Stuttgart, Red Bull Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt have maintained a watching brief on McAtee, while Porto and PSV Eindhoven are also among the player's admirers.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports Canada'}","soccer"

The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams for the first time

A fan group says ""alarm bells should be ringing at Fifa"" over the fact England supporters have not taken up their full ticket allocation for next summer's World Cup final and semi-final.

So far the number of allocated tickets to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) exceeds the number of applications received, meaning everyone who has applied for a ticket to the final and semi-final is guaranteed one.

The pricing structure for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised, with about 90% of tickets for the final made available to ESTC members costing £3,094.

That led to Fifa introducing a limited number of tickets at £45, but the Football Supporters' Association's Fans' Embassy says England fans not taking up their allocation should be a concern.

""Whilst unsurprisingly the group games are oversubscribed, as well as the possible glamour tie in Mexico City in the round of 16, the numbers for the semi-final and final speak for themselves,"" the group said in a statement.

""The numbers are reflective of a fan base that has been priced out, and some of the most loyal supporters of the international game feel completely let down.

""Alarm bells should be ringing whenever participating member allocations, meant for the most loyal fans, are not sold out for any game at a World Cup.""

Fifa has been criticised for group stage tickets for next year's World Cup costing up to three times those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Earlier this week Fifa president Gianni Infantino defended the prices, saying they reflect the public's ""absolutely crazy"" demand for tickets.

""We have six to seven million tickets on sale and in 15 days we received 150 million ticket requests,"" Infantino said.

""So 10 million ticket requests every single day. It shows how powerful the World Cup is.""

Craig Burley slams FIFA over World Cup ticket prices and 'The Best' awards. (2:10)

A fans' group has said ""alarm bells should be ringing"" at FIFA with England's most loyal fans having so far failed to take up their full ticket allocation for next summer's World Cup final and semifinal.

Around 90% of the tickets made available to members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) for the final will cost at least $4,185 (£3,094), and up to more than £6,400 for the most expensive tickets.

An update to ESTC members on Tuesday revealed the number of allocated tickets for the final and semifinal currently exceeds the number of applications received, meaning as things stand everyone who has applied is guaranteed a ticket.

The application window closes on Jan. 13.

Complaints over FIFA's initial pricing policy for tickets allocated to countries' most loyal supporters led it to introduce a limited number at $60 (£44), amounting to approximately 10% of the allocation.

However, the Football Supporters' Association's Fans' Embassy says the fact England's 4,500 allocation for the final is undersubscribed should be a big concern to FIFA.

""Whilst unsurprisingly the group games are oversubscribed, as well as the possible glamour tie in Mexico City in the round of 16, the numbers for the semifinal and final speak for themselves,"" the group said in a statement on the Free Lions X account.

""The numbers are reflective of a fan-base that has been priced out, and some of the most loyal supporters of the international game feel completely let down.

""Alarm bells should be ringing whenever participating member allocations, meant for the most loyal fans, are not sold out for any game at a World Cup.

""This is especially concerning when the allocations for games are so low, and England have a membership of over 30,000.

""This isn't acceptable.""

The ESTC told members on Tuesday they have until 5 p.m. on Friday to apply if they wish to be considered for $60 tickets for any match, after which time they will miss out regardless of how many 'caps' they have earned for attending England matches under the ESTC loyalty scheme.

The ESTC said all ""top cappers"" -- members of the scheme with 62 active caps -- would be guaranteed a $60 ticket for all England's matches through to the final based on current applications.

Meanwhile, disabled England fans have been advised that tickets for a carer or companion must be paid for.

It has been common practice for these tickets to be offered free of charge alongside wheelchair or easy-access seating at previous major football tournaments, including the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.

The Disability and Fan Inclusion Network of Football Supporters Europe (FSE) wrote to FIFA earlier this month regarding its concerns around the lack of accessible tickets in the cheapest $60 category, and the failure to provide free companion tickets.

The network also highlighted to FIFA that accessible tickets were being sold at hugely inflated prices on the FIFA ticket resale platform, with no eligibility checks in place to ensure these tickets were even being sold to disabled fans.

December 29, 2025

By Dante Gonzalez

Gianni Infantino has overseen several major rule changes in soccer, a sport traditionally resistant to altering how the game is played or officiated. With the 2026 World Cup now less than six months away, the FIFA president has again hinted at potential modifications, including a possible adjustment to the offside law long advocated by Arsène Wenger.

The year 2025 has served as a testing ground for multiple innovations across FIFA competitions, including the use of a “green card” to request VAR reviews at the U-20 World Cup and Arab Cup, referee body cameras at the FIFA Club World Cup, and the introduction of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers. Some measures were fully implemented while others were trialed, but collectively they provided valuable data ahead of the 2026 tournament.

Speaking during the inaugural World Sports Summit in Dubai, Infantino reflected on the evolution of officiating in recent years: “We introduced VAR to make football fairer, to give referees the chance to correct a mistake that millions of people, both at home and in the stadium, might have seen. We are continuously improving VAR with increasingly advanced technology to help referees make the right decision.“

With the aim of “making the game more offensive and attractive,” the FIFA president acknowledged that revisiting the offside rule could help achieve that goal. “We are considering the offside rule, which has evolved over the years and currently requires the attacker to be behind the defender, level with him. Perhaps in the future the attacker would have to be completely ahead to be considered offside,” he added.

Arsene Wenger, FIFA Chief of Global Football Development.

The offside law has been a frequent source of debate in recent seasons, with former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger emerging as the leading proponent of reform. Now serving as FIFA's Chief of Global Football Development, Wenger's proposal has gained renewed momentum, with Infantino publicly acknowledging its growing relevance.

During the 2022 World Cup, matches regularly featured extended stoppage time to compensate for delays, a measure that later fell out of favor. Still, FIFA continues to explore solutions aimed at improving game flow. “We are also evaluating measures to prevent time-wasting. It is important for the game to flow properly, so interruptions must be minimized,” Infantino concluded.

The most significant change to the offside law dates back to 1925, when the requirement was reduced to two opposing players, typically the goalkeeper and one defender, between the attacker and the goal. Since then, the rule has largely remained intact, even as VAR has shifted decision-making from the assistant referee to technology, fueling ongoing controversy.

Under the so-called Wenger Law, the two-player requirement would remain unchanged, but the interpretation would shift dramatically. An attacker would only be offside if their entire body were ahead of the second-to-last defender, meaning that any overlap would keep the player onside.

By contrast, the current rule penalizes attackers if any playable body part is ahead of the defensive line. If implemented, the new interpretation would favor fast, attacking players and challenge teams that rely on a high defensive line, while sides defending deeper would be far less affected by the change.

ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) — Demand is booming for the FIFA World Cup 2026, part of which will be played in Atlanta. 

Fans from more than 200 countries have submitted over 150 million ticket requests, a record-breaking number, FIFA announced on Tuesday. That's more than 30 times the available seats and 3.4 times the overall number of people who have ever attended a World Cup match. 

“This overwhelming response from passionate fans is a true representation of how our game is loved globally,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. “We are going to make history in North America when we bring the world together like never before in a celebration of unity and the best of football.”

Napoli star Rasmus Hojlund has been hailed as the ""strongest striker in Serie A"" alongside Inter's World Cup-winning talisman Lautaro Martinez, as the Denmark international continues his impressive goalscoring exploits following his summer loan move from Manchester United. The forward has scored six goals and registered two assists in 12 appearances, proving his worth in Italy following a dismal spell in the Premier League.

Hojlund joined Napoli on loan with an obligation to buy in the summer, and has already gone on to score six Serie A goals, netting a brace last time out in a 2-0 win over Cremonese. The Denmark star's exploits may come as something of a surprise, given his well-documented struggles at Old Trafford. During his first two seasons at United after joining from Atalanta, he made 95 appearances but only scored 26 goals, of which only 14 came in the Premier League. Now, though, he has been hailed as one of the best centre-forwards in Italy's top-flight. He has already eclipsed his league goal tally at United last season, doing so in 22 fewer games.

Christian Vieri, the former Italy international, has claimed that Hojlund has the ability to become one of the best strikers in the world. 

He said: ""I consider Hojlund as potentially one of the five best strikers in the world. He can score goals, but he knows how to attack deep and wear down defences. He has a strong left foot and is great with his head and his physicality.""

Giampaolo Pazzini, a former striker with Fiorentina, AC Milan and Inter, has also waxed lyrical about Hojlund, while giving Napoli boss Antonio Conte credit for bringing the best out of him. Pazzini told Sportsmediaset: “At the moment, Hojlund, under [Antonio] Conte, is the strongest striker in Serie A alongside Lautaro [Martinez]. Since he arrived, he has undergone an incredible transformation.

“He has always been a good player, but with great instinct, great power, he was a wild horse. Conte took him, educated him and raised him.

“Now he's a fantastic striker because he plays for the team, he doesn't make a single mistake, he never gets anticipated, he plays short, he plays long, he's vicious in front of goal.

“Now he's decisive throughout the match and you also find him in the defensive phase.”

Conte has claimed that Hojlund is becoming ""dominant"" as he grows in Serie A. 

He said: “Hojlund is a player who is very young, he's still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal.

“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he's starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.

“He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”

A member of Hojlund's entourage, Luca Nigriello, revealed his motivations, adding: “When we were closing the operation with Napoli there was great enthusiasm. Rasmus arrived from a complicated period at Manchester United, but he never experienced Napoli as a stop-gap (ripiego). He arrived with true hunger, with the desire to get back into the game. Character-wise he is strong, tough, he knows what he wants.

“Conte gives him confidence and is making him grow. Rasmus plays, makes mistakes, and learns. He has become hungrier, more consistent. He is a chameleon who adapts to what the team asks.”

Napoli play Lazio on Sunday as they bid to continue their title defence. Conte's side are third in Serie A, two points behind current leaders Inter. The two sides will clash on January 11 when Hojlund and Co head to the San Siro. Hojlund won the Suppercopa Italiana this year, and is now gunning for his first major trophy in Italy. He did lift the FA Cup during his time at United, having also won the league with Copenhagen in 2020-21.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

This is Legacy, GOAL's feature and podcast series following the road to the 2026 World Cup. Every week, we dive into the stories and the legacies that shaped football's greatest nations. This time we turn to Germany, a nation once famed for producing the world's deadliest strikers. From Gerd Müller to Miroslav Klose, the No.9 shirt was a symbol of power, precision, and pride. But since 2014, it's become a question mark, a reflection of a team still searching for its next great finisher, and perhaps, for its own identity.

Looking through German-tinted glasses, it is clear that the national team's greatest success this millennium also marked the beginning of a rather fundamental crisis. At least, that is easy to say with the benefit of hindsight.

When Miroslav Klose scored his 16th World Cup goal in the memorable 7-1 victory over Brazil in the semi-final in Belo Horizonte in 2014, becoming the tournament's all-time leading scorer, a record that remains unbroken to this day, he not only ended his personal international career, but he also put an end to the era of the so-called ‘classic German centre-forward', among whom Uwe Seeler, Gerd Müller, Klaus Fischer, Horst Hrubesch, Rudi Völler, Jürgen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff are just the most famous names.

For over 13 years – or 137 international matches and 71 goals – Klose was considered the epitome of ruthless efficiency and instinctive goal-scoring. Klose, whose star rose internationally with his five goals at the 2002 World Cup, was Germany's last world-class striker. His departure from the national team after the triumph of 2014 meant the loss of a clear identity in the front line. From then on, the role of the German No.9 was mostly vacant, replaced by many tactical experiments and the search for a suitable successor.

Mario Gomez, who stood in Klose's shadow for a long time, could have been the one. He also played as a target man, bringing with him a good goal-scoring instinct and finishing ability, while at the same time not differing too much from Klose in terms of physical presence and heading ability.

But Gomez and the national team never really clicked. The long-time striker for Stuttgart and Bayern Munich always struggled to convert chances in the national jersey, going almost three years without scoring in competitive matches. When he somehow managed to miss the goal from close range in the match against Austria during the group stage of Euro 2008, shooting the ball over the bar instead, he had to contend with the mockery from German fans for a long time.

Without Klose, Germany tried for a while to achieve success with so-called false nines. They converted No.10 players or played with wingers through the centre. Mario Götze, Thomas Müller, Serge Gnabry and Kai Havertz were just a few of those who had to try their hand as false nines. These were all attempts to replace Klose's power with finesse in combination play. Three disastrous tournaments later – the 2018 World Cup, Euro 2021 and the 2022 World Cup – it was clear that this swap had not worked out.

Since then, and especially with a view to the 2026 World Cup, the question that has been hanging over the heads of various DFB officials for years has become increasingly pressing: Where has the historic DNA of the German striker gone?

The attempt to answer this question leads to the philosophy of youth development over the last decade-and-a-half, combined with the hope of finding a good solution by adopting international trends. The youth academies of German professional clubs generally produce versatile attacking players who are expected to combine, interpret space and participate in pressing. Players like Götze, for example. He brought Germany the World Cup victory in 2014 with his goal and played for Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, but his career nevertheless remained slightly unfulfilled.

The training of pure, robust finishers was seen more as a relic of the past and was no longer really pursued explicitly. The invaluable ability to have a genuine goal-scoring instinct or to develop it in a more targeted manner in order to be able to prevail against two defenders, to be a fraction of a second quicker to the ball and to force a goal with the entire body in the manner of Gerd Müller – this power was sacrificed in favour of technical flexibility.

The desire was for attacking players who could participate in the game, partly because the supposedly static centre-forward was perceived as a tactical ‘brake'. He was denigrated as a figure who only disrupted the flow of possession and would have required ‘simple' solutions such as a cross, which in those years was considered a rather underdeveloped offensive strategy.

The consequence of this ideological aberration was a systematic impoverishment of one of the most important positions in the game. Where once Gerd Müller, Völler, Klinsmann and later Klose stood and tied up defensive lines or wore down opponents with their mere presence, there was suddenly a void. The next generation of players, including Thomas Müller, Götze, Timo Werner, Havertz and Gnabry, were able to run into space in a tactically sophisticated manner. However, they often lacked the final touch at the moment of decisive confrontation in the penalty area.

The fundamental mistake in training was the assumption that the physical toughness and killer instinct of a ‘real' No.9 could be learned later, while in younger years the cognitive and technical skills of a No.10 or winger were prioritised.

But Klose's success was based not only on his continuous presence and constant duels with his opponents, but also on his total focus on the goal. That is simply skill, no question, but it is also a mental attitude that can be trained over many years and must be consolidated. Otherwise, a striker cannot be the successful end point of a team's attack in theory or in practice.

In Germany, young, physically strong striker talents were often encouraged to drop back, make themselves available for passes instead of exploiting their physical advantages in the most dangerous area of the pitch. Training was dominated by the fear of losing the ball and the love of perfect structure.

Chance, improvisation, and perhaps even raw power in the penalty area – all things that are part of the striker gene of a classic No.9 – took a back seat. Hannes Wolf, director of development at the DFB since summer 2023, quickly recognised this tactical error in the structure of the youth academies. He recently put it bluntly in the Frankfurter Rundschau: ”We have trained poorly, there's no point in kidding ourselves. We were the worst of the top nations in terms of player development.”

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

That was a harsh slap in the face for the entire training philosophy, and Wolf has set himself the task of revolutionising it. With regard to the training of genuine attackers, he has already said: ""If we take an 11-a-side game, the striker has 30 touches of the ball in 90 minutes. If he trains for half an hour, he has 10 touches of the ball, if you do the maths. How are you supposed to develop strikers through pure 11-a-side, through a large game format? It doesn't work. It used to work, but they didn't grow up in training. They grew up on the pitch.""

The consequence of the impoverishment of the German striker pool is that the DFB squad is still searching for a pragmatic solution on the road to the 2026 World Cup. A ‘German Harry Kane' or a talent who could one day become world-class is simply not there. The late discovery and first call-up of Niclas Füllkrug in November 2022 marked the clearest end to the ideology of the false nine. When the then Werder Bremen player made his Germany debut, he was the oldest outfield debutant since Martin Max in 2002, at 29 years and 280 days.

Although not at world-class level, Füllkrug brought exactly the qualities that Klose had perfected: Physical presence, heading ability and finishing skills. His call-up was a commitment to pragmatism. This necessary departure from the supposed aesthetic ideal was also supported by the management.

DFB sporting director Rudi Völler, himself a legendary striker, knows only too well that, especially in tournaments, you need a man who can score goals that are sometimes simple but powerful.

“I have repeatedly emphasised that we need this type of striker who guarantees goals and is also willing to do the dirty work,” said Völler, later making it even clearer: “Of course, we would prefer to have a world-class centre-forward, but we don't have one at the moment. We all know that we don't have a huge number of top strikers. We don't have that many, and we have to nurture and care for them. We have to get the best out of them.”

The emergence of Tim Kleindienst from Borussia Mönchengladbach, whom national coach Julian Nagelsmann first called up in October 2024 as a replacement for the injured Füllkrug at the age of 29 years and 41 days and who also impresses with his physical strength, served as further evidence of this return to form, as well as proof that the tactical change in Germany has not worked.

Now the team was trying again with players like Füllkrug and Kleindienst, who offered the team a real vertical option, took some of the pressure off the midfield and provided the wingers with a clear target man. They also brought back some much-needed toughness. After all, neither Füllkrug nor Kleindienst are delicate magicians. But they are masters of the first touch in the box, can secure a long ball with their backs to goal and have the determination to stick their foot in when others hesitate. However, Füllkrug and Kleindienst are far from world-class.

Over the years, the DFB has had to realise that the classic striker type cannot be replaced, but must be revitalised. The big challenge now is not to force new talents into the wrong roles again, but to promote their natural strengths. Whether this will result in a ‘new Klose' remains to be seen, but the direction of travel must be right.

Nick Woltemade is currently the player who best embodies the physical dominance of the classic striker combined with the modern requirements of the game. At just under two metres tall, the 23-year-old is predestined for the role of target player, but at the same time possesses remarkable technique and simply enormous talent. He is a candidate who, given the appropriate further development, can play at a world-class level.

When Nagelsmann and Völler saw Woltemade, who has since moved to Newcastle United for a transfer fee of up to £69 million (€90m), shine for Stuttgart in the DFB Pokal final last May, they were able to observe “his technical skills and the elegance with which he can dribble past opponents.”

Woltemade's “power and understanding of the game” are “top notch,” explained Völler, adding: ”Despite his height, he still has room for improvement in his heading, but these are things that can certainly be learned and trained. If he improves by a few per cent, he has a great career ahead of him.”

Woltemade could be the one to bridge the gap between Klose's legacy and today's demands of top-flight football, a striker whose primary weapons are his physicality and instinct, but who also has the tactical intelligence to fit into the pressing and combinations of Nagelsmann's system – and who is also extremely agile and has fine technique. Woltemade's development is, in a sense, the litmus test for the DFB's new philosophy.

Nagelsmann was recently quite satisfied with the progress made by the now-eight-time international: “I think he did quite well. He still has a few steps to take, but he's on the right track.”

The national coach's words can also be understood as instructions to Woltemade to use his talent and adopt the right attitude in order to make regular progress.

The development of more players like him now requires a rethink at all levels. Youth coaches must once again allow specialisation in the striker position. There needs to be more individual training that focuses exclusively on shooting and heading techniques under extreme pressure. The repetition rate of these specific situations, which Wolf describes as essential, must increase exponentially in order to ideally preserve the instinct that distinguished someone like Klose.

With the help of Wolf's work, Germany must ensure that strikers learn once again to master the moment of decision in the penalty area, as the prominent examples of the past were able to do intuitively. It is a matter of correcting what has been forgotten in the era of possession hype.

Only in this way can the German national team, which continues to have a wealth of technically-skilled midfielders, find one of its potentially last pieces of the puzzle for success. The hope is vague, but the necessity is clear: The continuity of the German goal-scoring tradition must be restored in order to compete at the top globally.

Former Real Madrid star James Rodriguez is reportedly close to agreeing a move to MLS outfit the Columbus Crew as he aims to remain in shape ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The Colombian midfielder has left Leon in Liga MX and while he initially planned to remain in Mexico, he now looks set to move to the United States instead.

James has embarked on a nomadic career since leaving Real Madrid at the end of 2020. The Colombia international played for Everton, Al-Rayyan, Olympiacos, Sao Paulo, and Rayo Vallecano prior to his move to Mexico with Leon. During his time with the Liga MX club, he made 34 appearances, scoring five goals and registering nine assists. Now, Marca reports that he is set to head to the United States next. Oscar Orstos reports that the Columbus Crew are hoping to seal a deal, despite being without a manager following the departure of Wilfried Nancy to Celtic. 

James is also said to be of interest to Orlando City, and there had been links with Santos, although the Brazilian club have denied their interest in the ace. James has 122 caps for Colombia and is eyeing a spot at the 2026 World Cup; he has already revealed he dreams of bringing the trophy back to his homeland, in what is likely to be his final tournament. He will turn 35 in 2026 and has yet to win a major trophy with his country. He has been a runner-up in the Copa America but has not tasted international success since Colombia's youth team won the Toulon Tournament back in 2011.

He said: “Playing in the World Cup is always a great joy. Now, at 34, I think it's much nicer because football passes, time passes for everyone. I'm in very good spirits for that World Cup. We're all on the same path. With the team we have, we'll stand up to anyone because this is a big team. We're playing for big things. A World Cup, and we want to win it.”

James has become a star at previous World Cups, scoring the undoubted goal of the tournament at the 2014 showpiece, with a brilliant volley from range. He won the Puskas Award for the strike, and also won the Golden Boot, having scored six goals throughout Colombia's run to the quarter-finals, where they lost to Brazil. Rodriguez became the first player since Ronaldo in 2002 to score five or more goals at a World Cup. He was left in tears after their defeat to the Selecao, and claimed a ""great team has been born"" after the game, although Colombia have struggled since and have not scaled such heights, even failing to qualify for the 2022 tournament in Qatar. If he does settle at a new club in MLS, James may help play a role in changing that next summer.

Indeed, Rodriguez remains central to Colombia's plans, and played in every single one of his side's qualifiers, scoring against Argentina and Bolivia, and providing assists against Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, while setting up two more goals in their final game against Venezuela. He also played a key role at the Copa America in 2024, but Colombia were beaten by Lionel Messi and Co in the final after extra time.

Colombia know two of their group stage opponents at the tournament. They will play both Uzbekistan and Portugal, as well as one of New Caledonia, Jamaica, or DR Congo, depending on the winner of the play-off. First, James will hope to find a club, with the Columbus Crew seemingly closing in on his signature. 

He could join the likes of Messi and Son Heung-min in America, as the profile of MLS continues to rise. James would undoubtedly be a major signing if the Columbus Crew can get the deal over the line, as he would be for Orlando, too. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Transfermarkt's final update of the year lists the 17-year-old Xolos de Tijuana standout alongside Club América's Allan Saint-Maximin. U.S. international Alejandro Zendejas also made the top 10. 

Mora's surge is the result of an exceptional 2025 in which he impressed at both club and international level. Even with his Apertura campaign ending earlier than expected, his impact across competitions and with Mexico drew widespread attention, including from European scouts, a factor that played a key role in his rise to the top of the rankings.

Over the course of the year, Mora scored 12 goals across Liga MX, Leagues Cup, and international tournaments. That total made him the most prolific scorer worldwide in the 2025 calendar year among players under 17, finishing three goals clear of Bayern Munich prospect Lennart Karl and Irish striker Michael Noonan.

At club level, nine of those goals came with Xolos de Tijuana - seven in Liga MX play and two in the Leagues Cup - while he added three more at the U-20 World Cup in Chile, where he took on a leading role for El Tri.

Sharing the top valuation with Mora is Allan Saint-Maximin, also listed at $11 million. While the French winger remains one of the league's most high-profile names, his value has dipped slightly compared to his arrival at Club América following spells with Al-Ain and Fenerbahçe.

Just below them, a cluster of midfielders highlights the depth of talent in Liga MX. Marcel Ruiz ($9.9 million) and Erick Lira ($9.9 million) stand out after strong seasons with Toluca and Cruz Azul, respectively, both becoming key figures for their clubs and the Mexican national team setup.

Zendejas, who has been linked with a move to MLS over the last two seasons, came in at No. 8, valued at $9.35 million. 

The USMNT winger continues to be a vital player for Club America, where he's notched 33 goals and 22 assists in 113 matches in his five seasons with the club.

Japan legend Kazuyoshi Miura, who will celebrate his 59th birthday in February, has agreed a six-month loan move to Fukushima United, extending a professional career that now stretches into a remarkable fifth decade. The agreement means Miura could feature in the J.League, encompassing Japan's top three divisions, for the first time in five years.

Miura has insisted that his love for the game remains the fuel that drives him forward. Preparing for what will be his 41st season as a professional footballer, the veteran made it clear that the fire still burns. 

""My passion for football hasn't changed, no matter how old I get,"" he said. ""I'm very grateful to be given this opportunity. I promise I will play with everything I have to make a contribution. Let's make history together!""

Nicknamed ‘King Kazu' in his homeland, Miura's journey began far from Japan. He started his professional career with Santos in 1986, immersing himself in Brazilian football culture at a time when few Japanese players ventured abroad. Miura would go on to play club football in Italy, Croatia and Australia, building a global resume long before such moves became commonplace for Asian players.

Since 2005, Miura has been registered with Yokohama FC, although his time there has largely been spent on loan. This latest switch to Fukushima United marks his fourth loan move since 2022.  Last season, Miura spent time on loan at fourth-tier Atletico Suzuka, where minutes were limited. He made seven appearances, totalling just 69 minutes, and did not find the net.

Miura scored 55 goals in 89 appearances for Japan, establishing himself as one of the country's most recognisable footballing figures. His last cap came in 2000, two years after he failed to make the cut in Japan's squad for their first-ever World Cup finals. Since then, he has even represented his country in futsal, earning six appearances alongside his enduring club career.

Setbacks have rarely discouraged him. After relegation to Japan's regional leagues, Miura spoke about his readiness to ""take on a new challenge"", a mindset that has once again shaped his next move. Fukushima United, who finished 10th in the 20-team third division last season, offer a fresh environment and a new chapter.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Rasmus Hojlund has opened up on his time at Manchester United and says he felt he did well, particularly during his first campaign at Old Trafford. The Denmark international has since moved on a season-long loan to Serie A side Napoli and is currently thriving with Antonio Conte's side, meaning he could well end up making his stay with I Partenopei permanent.

Hojlund sealed a loan move to Napoli after a season where he managed just four Premier League goals for Manchester United. The Red Devils also splashed out on attackers Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in the summer transfer window, pushing the Dane further down the pecking order. Hojlund has gone on to star in the Italian top flight, scoring six goals in 12 league games, helping fire Napoli into third place in the table and just two points behind leaders Inter. The transfer also includes an option to buy which will reportedly be activated if Napoli qualify for the Champions League.

Hojlund has now spoken about his United exit and why he had to move on. He told Sports Illustrated: ""United made it quite clear to me that I wasn't part of the plans for this year. Coming into the season, and with no European football, I think Napoli saw an opportunity to go and get me. As soon as I heard the interest from them I made it quite obvious to my camp and the people around that I only wanted to go there. I had a good few talks with the manager and with the sporting director.""

The striker then spoke a little about his conversation with Conte about the move, adding: ""It was not very long. I think we were both quite clear that it was a good step for me and it was a good match. So it was a quite short conversation but a very good one. He's an incredible coach, I've only seen him do good things almost everywhere he's been. Obviously that was a big part of it. When he calls, you just have to say yes.""

Hojlund has joined former Manchester United team-mate Scott McTominay at Napoli but says the two players had different reasons for wanting to leave United. He explained: ""We're not in the same sort of path in our careers, I still have a lot to learn, whereas he is a bit older and had a bit more on his back to go out and prove himself. That's all part of it. I am young, I have to play football and for that reason I also think this was a good move for me.""

Hojlund also reflected on his time with the Red Devils and added: ""It was a lot of attention and a lot of pressure obviously. I feel like it was hard for me not to take that step, I was a United fan. I think I did well, you could argue I probably needed a year more or whatever, but I felt like it was the right step for me. I think I did well in my first year especially, I became top scorer in the team and had a good campaign in the Champions League and won a trophy with the guys. I was happy for my time in Manchester. Still they are all my friends, I am still watching them and wishing them good luck every time they play.""

Hojlund's good form has already seen him described as the ""strongest striker in Serie A"" alongside Lautaro Martinez by former Italy star Christian Vieri. The 22-year-old certainly looks a different player under Conte and has already won his first trophy with the club after lifting the Supercoppa Italiana earlier in December. Hojlund is currently looking odds on to make his Napoli stay permanent, with Conte admitting recently that his striker ""still has a huge margin for further improvement.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Chris Richards, Lily Yohannes, and more headline GOAL's 2025 USMNT and USWNT Awards, breaking down the players, moments and transfers that defined American soccer's year.

On paper, 2025 looked like a lull for American soccer. For the U.S. men's national team, it was the year before the year, with eyes fixed firmly on the 2026 World Cup. For the U.S. women's national team, it marked a transition from 2024 Olympic glory toward the 2027 World Cup cycle.


In practice, it was anything but quiet. Big moments, big goals and big results defined a rollercoaster year that laid critical groundwork for what comes next.


That foundation is what made 2025 matter. Down-the-stretch performances gave both the USMNT and USWNT reason for optimism, with Mauricio Pochettino and Emma Hayes setting the tone - and a host of players delivering when it counted.

To close the door on 2025, GOAL looks back at the year that was for the USMNT and USWNT by giving out some awards, headlining the best in American soccer...

There are plenty of candidates for this award, perhaps more than in recent years. However, if you're searching for the right combination of successes with both club and country, there really is one player that stands out: Richards.

This 2025 calendar year has been something of a breakout one for Richards, even if he was already established prior to it. With Crystal Palace, he won two trophies, headlined by an FA Cup triumph that was his club's first-ever piece of major silverware. With the USMNT, he was a mainstay throughout the year, stepping into a leadership role that should carry on right through the World Cup.

There's no doubt now that Richards is right up there with the most important players in the USMNT group.

Again, no shortage of candidates, but there was something special about Macario's run throughout 2025.

After seeing several years derailed by injuries, Macario was desperately needed by the USWNT this year. With the famous Triple Espresso largely sidelined, Emma Hayes was looking for a real leader in the attack, and she found one in Macario. The Chelsea star finished with eight goals in 10 games, four more than any USWNT player, but it wasn't just the goals; it was the impact she made on a young USWNT group that was largely experimental throughout the year.

Now, with the USWNT approaching full strength, Macario has more than proven she deserves to be a part of it, and perhaps even a focal point on the road to 2027.

This was a big year for many young players clawing for a USMNT spot. The thing is, though, that few could have imagined Freeman being a part of it just 12 months ago.

The Orlando City star earned his first MLS start in March. By summer, he was a USMNT Gold Cup starter and, by the end of the fall slate, he looked about as close as a player can to being a World Cup contender. It was a rapid rise for the fullback, who blossomed defensively after showing so many positive signs on the attacking end in the first half of the year. 

Now, Freeman looks set to be a key player for the U.S. for years to come, and, still just 21, his potential seems somewhat limitless.

Yohannes' rise felt inevitable. What surprised many was how quickly everything clicked.

Just 18 years old, Yohannes has already shown that she can go toe-to-toe with any midfielder on the planet. She already has incredible vision and game sense, and her ability to actually pass the ball can't be matched by anyone in the USWNT pool. There are aspects of her game that need some development, for sure, but there are already several legitimately world-class aspects to what Yohannes can bring to a team.

There's so much reason for optimism with Yohannes, who already seems to be a starter for the U.S. despite being a teen. That's insane given the wealth of talent in the U.S. pool, but Yohannes might be the most purely talented of any of them.

It was like everything the USMNT had been working towards manifested itself in one night. To close 2025, the U.S. put in a near-perfect performance, one that created enough optimism to hold everyone over until their return in March.

Facing off with Uruguay, the team that knocked them out of the Copa America just over a year prior, the U.S. ran away as 5-1 winners, reducing one of South America's best teams to a pile of rubble. It wasn't a game dominated by the USMNT's traditional ""stars"" either; it was one that saw a young, hungry group of upstarts step up and show that they, too, can play against the best teams in the world.

After the match, a notably frosty Mauricio Pochettino fired back at the notion that there were ""regulars"" or that any player in the pool had more or less to prove than anyone else. This result showed that he was right and that the USMNT has a wide variety of players capable of creating magic, even against teams as good as Uruguay.

This isn't the choice because of the on-field result. The U.S. beat plenty of good teams this year, and they put on several performances that were actually more impressive than this one. This is the choice, though, because of what it represented.

A number of storylines made this significant. First, of course, was the crowd itself. The match was the first women's match played at SoFi Stadium, and it was played in front of over 32,000 fans, showcasing the strength of women's soccer and women's sports in America. Then there was the game, which was billed as a rematch of the 2024 Olympic Gold Medal match, pitting two of the sport's great teams against one another. And then, finally, there was the presence of Trinity Rodman, who marked her return from injury with a goal just five minutes into the 2-0 USWNT triumph.

This match was just the perfect encapsulation of everything that makes the USWNT so exciting: Passion, starpower, and, ultimately, results against the game's top teams.

Just one year ago, it would have been hard to imagine that Musah wouldn't be a key player at the 2026 World Cup. Now, there are legitimate questions about whether he'll be there at all.

We haven't seen Musah in a USMNT shirt since March and, given his struggles on the club level, it remains unclear where he stands with Pochettino and his staff. Musah, like teammate Christian Pulisic, skipped out on the Gold Cup but, unlike Pulisic, was not given a recall in the fall, meaning he missed out on many of the USMNT's most crucial games this season.

What will we see from Musah next? It may depend on the transfer window. So, too, might his World Cup hopes.

That aforementioned Brazil game? That was all we saw of Rodman in a USWNT shirt as injuries derailed so much of her 2025 calendar year. It's such a shame, too, because, when she is healthy, Rodman is quite clearly one of the most exciting players that the sport has right now.

A back injury defined the start of the year, although she was able to make that one appearance against Brazil. That game, as it turned out, has been her only one since the Gold Medal game back in August 2024. Recalled in the fall, an MCL issue once again put Rodman on the shelf, preventing her from being part of the USWNT's October slate.

Rodman is just so good and, while we've seen her show that in the NWSL, it hasn't happened nearly enough in a USWNT shirt. Let's hope that 2026 can be different as Rodman, like her two other Triple Espresso running mates, prepares for a return.

This is tough to break down, particularly so early into the season. In terms of impact, though? There's no denying just what this meant for Tillman and, in some ways, for the USMNT.

Tillman's move to Bayer Leverkusen came with a reported fee of $41 million, which makes sense given what was being asked of him. He wasn't signed as a project; he was brought in to replace a world-class star in Florian Wirtz as quickly as possible. So far, he's shown that he can make a difference, even at a level as high as the Bundesliga.

Just as importantly, though, he's offered a blueprint, particularly to now-former PSV teammate Ricardo Pepi. If Tillman can do it at the highest level, why can't Pepi? That's part of the knock-on effect that comes from an American player proving himself for club and country.

This one came all the way back in January, and, in hindsight, it was something of a trendsetter, wasn't it?

To start 2025, Girma became women's soccer's first $1 million player when she made the move to Chelsea. That distinction, though, didn't last long. In the months since, four other players have hit that illustrious seven-figure mark, including her USWNT teammate Alyssa Thompson, who joined her in London later in the year. Girma's move, then, was a tipping point, one that kick-started a new era for women's soccer.

It was also a warning shot to the NWSL, which could lose more stars to Europe in the years to come. In response, the league unveiled new roster rules this fall with an aim to keep hold of Rodman. Still, it was Girma who was the biggest domino to fall with a move that could have a huge lasting impact.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

United Cup action in Sydney does not begin until 3 January (2 January in Perth), but many of the biggest tennis stars in the world have been working hard at Sydney Olympic Park.

Alex de Minaur practised with fellow Sydneysider Aleksandar Vukic Tuesday with Team Australia's United Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt watching on. De Minaur has long enjoyed success at the mixed-teams event, where he has defeated Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in the past.

Another man he has beaten at the season-opening event is Alexander Zverev, who is also on site and revving up for his 2026 season.



The two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion led Germany to United Cup glory in 2024 and will hope to do so again this year beginning with his country's clash on Sunday against the Netherlands.



Victoria Mboko is playing in the United Cup for the first time, leading the way for Canada alongside Felix Auger-Aliassime.



Auger-Aliassime ended his 2025 season playing some of the best tennis of his career, competing in the Nitto ATP Finals for the second time. He is at a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings.



Casper Ruud has flown the flag for Norway since the inception of the event and will look to make a quick start to his campaign. The 27-year-old's first match of the year will come Monday against Czechia's Jakub Mensik.



Hubert Hurkacz has been waiting since June to step on court for an ATP Tour match after struggling with a knee injury. The Polish former World No. 6 again partners Iga Swiatek at the United Cup after falling short in the championship match in two consecutive editions.



Maya Joint will try to help carry home hopes inside Ken Rosewall Arena as Australia's No. 1 WTA player. Joint trained with Mboko on Tuesday and will open her season Saturday against Norway's Malene Helgo.

With an opening in the Carlos Alcaraz coaching box, could we see a collab with the likes of Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal?ByTENNIS.comPublished Dec 30, 2025 copy_link

Published Dec 30, 2025

As we make our way toward the 2026 season—which begins Friday, January 2 on Tennis Channel with the United Cup—our Tennis Channel analysts and editors tackle the most important questions of the new year.Next up: Which recently retired player should become a super coach?

VICTORIA DUVAL: Rafael Nadal. Can you even imagine the wealth of knowledge? He's one of my favorite athletes and is unmatched when it comes to discipline, humility, tenacity, and problem-solving under pressure. He would elevate any player to new heights.DAVID KANE: When we first posed this question, Carlos Alcaraz didn't have an opening for a coach and Serena Williams hadn't put feelers out about a potential 2026 comeback—at this point, it seems more likely we'll see Williams on the court than in the coaching box. One of the more forgotten big stories of 2025 was Andy Murray's brief stint as Novak Djokovic's coach. Though they didn't last long, the pair was the talk of the Australian Open, Djokovic scoring his lone 2025 victory over Alcaraz with Murray in his corner.Enthused as he was by the prospect of coaching a former rival, I have to think Murray would be—if asked—even more excited to step in for Juan Carlos Ferrero. Comparison abound between Alcaraz and the likes of Nadal and Djokovic, but it would be fascinating to see what Murray could bring to the Alcaraz camp, who reportedly wanted him on board in the past. Perhaps he'd bring an ethos that mixes the work hard-play hard mentality the young Spaniard appears to crave.

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

After a tense battle for the title in 2025, Lando Norris ultimately beat team mate Oscar Piastri to the crown – but the Australian does not expect this to change the dynamics between them.

Oscar Piastri believes that the dynamics between himself and team mate Lando Norris will remain unchanged following Norris' World Championship victory, with the Australian suggesting that the win does not mean that his fellow McLaren driver has “become Superman”.

A closely-fought battle played out between the pair – and fellow championship contender Max Verstappen – for the 2025 crown, a season that saw Piastri head the standings following a strong run in the earlier stages of the campaign before Norris retook the lead after his dominant triumph in Mexico.

It was ultimately the Briton who held on to the top spot through to the finale in Abu Dhabi, securing his maiden title by two points from Verstappen while Piastri ended the year 13 points adrift in third.

When asked if the dynamics between them could consequently change going forward – and whether it will now be harder to fight Norris as the reigning World Champion – Piastri denied that this will be the case.

“No, I don't think so,” the 24-year-old answered. “I don't think that will change anything. For me, he's obviously had a great season this year and a deserving champion, but he's still Lando Norris. It's not like he's become Superman.

“So, I don't think things will change with that. I'm expecting full fairness from the team and equality going forward. I don't have any concerns that that will change at all. Clearly, Lando's had a very strong season this year, and ultimately did a better job.”

McLaren became known for their ‘papaya rules' in 2025, with the squad voicing their intention to treat Norris and Piastri equally and give both the same opportunity to win the title. While this approach occasionally came in for criticism, Piastri believes that the outfit's success in both the Drivers' and Teams' Championship shows that the strategy has worked.

“I think it is a testament to the way we go racing,” the nine-time race winner explained. “Obviously, it's not easy fighting for both the Constructors' Championship and the Drivers' Championship with two very evenly matched drivers. But ultimately, that's a problem we knew we were going to have.

“At the end of the day, I think there's a lot of good things that come from that. Yes, there's difficult moments and tension at times, but I think both Lando and I have become better drivers from pushing each other to the limit.

“Sometimes that's been uncomfortable for everyone, but ultimately, yeah, it's been a good thing. We've had a lot of discussions through the year, and I'm sure we'll have discussions in the off-season about anything we want to do slightly differently for next year.

“But I think at the end of the day, they gave us both as good a chance as the team could have to fairly fight for a World Championship, and that's all you can ask for.”

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

From Netflix shows and grassroots programs to wild card triumphs and brand new partnerships, 2025 was the year F1 ACADEMY proved it's about much more than just what's on track. We look back at the moments that shaped the season off the track and left a lasting mark on the paddock and beyond...

It's been a full-on 2025 for F1 ACADEMY – the third season of the female-only single-seater series. On the track, we were treated to a fantastic title fight between Mercedes' Doriane Pin and Ferrari's Maya Weug that went down to the wire in Las Vegas, with Pin emerging victorious after a thrilling weekend of racing. But off the track, the series has grown and grown.

Whether it was a new Netflix docuseries, the myriad of exciting driver-brand partnerships, or best-selling books from icons of the sport, there's been plenty for fans to get stuck into over the year. Here are some of the best storylines away from the asphalt...

Enter the game-changer. May 2025 saw the launch of F1: The ACADEMY on Netflix – the Reese Witherspoon-produced rewind on the 2024 season, setting the tone for 2025.

With unprecedented behind-the-scenes access, the series went deep on what it takes to be an F1 ACADEMY driver – the sacrifices, the triumphs, the person behind the visor – and turned the racers into streaming stars.

If you're thinking Drive to Survive, think a little different: where DTS delivers on Formula 1's glamour and drama, F1: The ACADEMY focuses far more on the raw determination of young women fighting for their place in motorsport.

The series proved a hit with the critics – and with the fans, whose deeper connection with the drivers no doubt played a part in the growing audience in the grandstands at races around the globe.

2025 was a statement season for F1 ACADEMY and fashion/beauty brands, and marked many new partners fully committing to the sport for the first time.

Alba Larsen joined the grid backed by Tommy Hilfiger, with her car carrying the brand's statement red, white and blue colours throughout the season. However, this partnership extended well beyond the livery, with Larsen bringing the 'Tommy Girl' identity into the paddock and becoming something of a case study as to how personal style can sit comfortably alongside racing. Racing suits and fashion aren't mutually exclusive!

Charlotte Tilbury remained involved through driver Chloe Chong, continuing a partnership that has become familiar within the series, including providing the makeup for the drivers for the Netflix premiere. For the female-founded beauty brand, the focus stayed on supporting these young drivers as they develop their careers in motorsport, rather than simply increasing visibility of women in the sport.

Wella Professionals were the major new addition to the grid. The global haircare brand already has a history of backing women's sport, but has now made the move into motorsport for the first time through F1 ACADEMY. Their involvement added another dimension to the grid, centred on confidence and self-expression, and has been backing up and coming star Joanne Ciconte.

By the end of the season, these partnerships have clearly become a huge part of F1 ACADEMY's identity. Not a distraction from the racing, but a reflection of the drivers themselves as modern athletes competing at the highest level while defining who they are and want to be out of the cockpit.

When Joanne Ciconte rolled out for the Canadian round in her new Wella Professionals livery, the internet collectively cheered as the red, mermaid-inspired design took social media by storm. Here was a global beauty brand that believed in F1 ACADEMY enough to make it their first-ever motorsport sponsorship, which made the moment feel way more special than just a fresh paint job.

The partnership showed up around the paddock too. Wella, OPI and ghd set up styling stations in the Paddock Club, giving guests and drivers a chance to get quick touch-ups before heading out. Hair, nails, the small details that usually sit far away from a race weekend suddenly felt part of it. A few years ago, that might have raised eyebrows. In Montreal, it just felt normal.

The partnership inspired other groundbreaking activations to The Paddock Club over F1 ACADEMY race weekends. Wella, OPI, and ghd set up glam stations where guests – and, of course, drivers – could get race-ready touch-ups all weekend long. Hair styled, nails perfected, and most importantly, confidence boosted before heading trackside. These kinds of beauty services at a race weekend would have been dismissed as frivolous a few years ago. Now, thanks to F1 ACADEMY, they're not only acceptable but embraced as essential parts of both driver preparation and the fan experience.

For Ciconte, with her long curly hair, the support provided by Wella stretched beyond the track. ""I used to be really bad at maintaining [my hair],"" she told The Paddock Journal. ""When Wella came on board, they taught me so much, which I really needed."" It's a small detail that speaks to something larger: F1 ACADEMY is choosing partners who bring real change to the grid, helping these young drivers feel confident in every aspect of their lives, not just behind the wheel. Sometimes it's the off-track details that help everything else fall into place!

While the championship fight played out on track, Tommy Hilfiger racer Alba Larsen was busy elsewhere too. Still only 15 when she started it, her G.I.R.L. (Girls International Racing Lab) initiative began to gather real momentum during the 2025 season. Events across her home nation of Denmark brought over 400 girls into motorsport spaces that felt welcoming from the start, without the pressure or assumptions that tend to usually come with them. Her goals are even bigger for next year, as Alba aims to reach 15,000 girls globally.

That hard work off the track didn't go unnoticed by the racing community. In 2025, Alba received the FIA Women in Motorsport Award, as they recognised the impact G.I.R.L. was already having and the pathway it was starting to open up for young girls looking at racing for the first time.

When she wasn't racing or building a global grassroots movement, Alba was just as busy! Over the summer, she featured in a Vogue Scandinavia profile, she toured with her book The Fastest Girl in the World, and met young fans to sign copies, all while maintaining her racing schedule and making improvements all season long!

Now at just 17 years old, Alba has cemented herself as the template for the modern F1 ACADEMY driver: a racer by weekend, an author and activist by weekday, and a fashion muse year-round. She understood something fundamental that's reshaping motorsport: cultural impact and track performance aren't separate careers, they're two sides of the same ambition. 2025 was the year Alba proved you don't have to wait until after your racing career to make a difference or an impact off-track. You can do both, simultaneously, and do them brilliantly.

During mid-season, the wild card program delivered one of the year's best storylines. Esmee Kosterman, the Dutch driver who arrived at F1 ACADEMY as the Zandvoort Wild Card with TeamViewer, had everything to prove and nothing guaranteed beyond that race.

Kosterman became the highest points-scoring wild card driver of the entire season, performing so impressively that LEGO Racing signed her for their 2026 debut season. Her success also highlighted something crucial about F1 ACADEMY's philosophy: the doors aren't closed. If you're fast enough and talented enough, there's always a way in. The wild card program proved it in 2025, and it will continue to prove it as Esmee takes her LEGO Racing seat in 2026.

In October, as the championship fight intensified on track, off-track, a different kind of milestone was reached. Managing Director of F1 ACADEMY, Susie Wolff released her memoir, Driven, and it didn't take long for it to climb the Sunday Times bestseller list.

The timing felt perfect – Wolff's story was arriving to fans just as F1 ACADEMY was becoming more visible both inside and outside the paddock. In the book, she looks back at her own journey through motorsport, including the barriers she ran into and the moments that shaped how she approaches the sport now.

However, it isn't just a racing memoir; it's the roadmap for why F1 ACADEMY exists. Every partnership Wolff secured, every wild card driver who got their shot, every girl attending Alba's G.I.R.L. program, they're all living proof of the future Wolff envisioned when she created this series.

Wolff's motorsport journey is at the heart of F1 ACADEMY's successes. Her story and her presence is a big reason why so many young girls want to join the series because they can see themselves in her story, and now, they can see themselves on the grid.

If there was any doubt that F1 ACADEMY had become a cultural phenomenon, Las Vegas erased it sharpish! When the Hello Kitty partnership was unveiled at the most glittering race on the calendar, fans went wild. This iconic collaboration included a merch line featuring Hello Kitty and friends in racing gear, a sequin jacket that became instantly popular, and yes, even a Hello Kitty dog harness (because why not?).

The Hello Kitty Fanzone served food and drinks in Hello Kitty packaging that promptly became a collectors item. What's more Hello Kitty even waved the chequered flag following a wild reverse grid race.

But don't be fooled, this partnership wasn't just about selling merch. It has become clear that F1 ACADEMY understands something fundamental about modern sports: you can be serious about driver development while also being fun and engaging for all divisions of your fan base. The two aren't contradictions – they're complements.

LEGO also made its mark in Vegas, providing LEGO bouquets for the podium. Instead of flowers that wilt, drivers received buildable bouquets they could keep forever, and that fans could buy and build themselves. Even the victory celebrations became shareable, collectable moments. It was another sign of how F1 ACADEMY is rethinking every tradition through a more creative, culturally engaged lens.

As the season wound down, the news didn't really stop. Gatorade announced it would be coming on board for 2026, with a focus on female athlete performance and a sports science stance. The partnership will see them work closely with Lisa Billard, building hydration support around the specific demands she faces as a driver. This goes above and beyond sponsorship, it's research and development for women's sport, using F1 ACADEMY as a testing ground for performance science that could benefit sportswomen across all sports.

The season kicked off with three major announcements that signalled something different was coming. TAG Heuer became the Official Timekeeper, ""reinforcing its commitment to shaping the future of racing, ensuring that talent – not gender – determines success on the track."" TeamViewer and More than Equal joined as partners, bringing their platforms and resources to the series. Three significant partnerships before the season even started made one thing clear: F1 ACADEMY 2025 wouldn't just be about racing; it would be about cultural relevance.

LEGO Racing officially confirmed their 2026 entry with Esmee Kosterman behind the wheel. Alba's G.I.R.L. program continues its global expansion with ambitious targets. One announcement rolled into the next, and together they painted a picture of where F1 ACADEMY is heading next.

This season made it clear that F1 ACADEMY isn't just about what happens on track anymore. Fashion, culture, grassroots projects, and racing all found space to coexist, and the drivers were at the centre of it all! The brands getting involved weren't there to plaster logos on cars, but wanting to work with the drivers, support them in different ways, and trying new things along the way.

The Gatorade partnership represents the next evolution: Lisa Billard now has hydration and performance support built around her needs as a female athlete, with the research feeding back into broader sports science. The fashion and beauty collaborations have given drivers a chance to express themselves beyond the helmet. Alba Larson's G.I.R.L. programme continued to grow, connecting hundreds of girls to motorsport in a way that feels tangible and hopeful.

And then there was Vegas. Hello Kitty waving the chequered flag felt playful and a little surreal, but it went down a treat, and a perfect snapshot of what F1 ACADEMY had become in 2025. Racing, culture, and creativity all at once, with plenty still to come next year!

Clooney has cited French privacy laws protecting children from paparazzi as a key factor in the family's decision to become citizens.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


George Clooney and his wife Amal have been granted French citizenship, along with their two children, according to an official decree in France's government gazette, the Journal Officiel, published over the weekend.


	In an interview with French radio earlier this month, Clooney praised French privacy laws that protect his family from paparazzi.




	“Here, they don't take photos of kids. There aren't any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That's number one for us,” he told RTL Radio.

	The Clooneys own a property in southern France, in a former wine estate called the Domaine du Canadel, near the village of Brignoles, which they purchased in 2021. The pair also owns an estate in Italy's Lake Como region, purchased in 2002, and bought a historic manor in England.


	Clooney told RTL that although the family travels frequently, their home in France “is where we're happiest”.


	In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney described their “farm in France” as their primary residence, and noted that the couple made a conscious choice to raise their kids far from the culture of Hollywood. 


	“I was worried about raising our kids in L.A.,” Clooney said. “I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids.”

	











	Clooney is not the only American film industry figure seeking French citizenship. The US director Jim Jarmusch, whose latest feature, Father Mother Sister Brother won the Venice International Film Festival, told France Inter radio on Friday that he also plans to apply for French citizenship.


	“I would like a place that will allow me to escape from the United States,” Jarmusch said.

Running at more than five hours and without distribution, 'My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow' might seem like the longest of Oscars longshots. But the vibrant documentary has been shortlisted by the Academy and won major critics' prizes. We go inside the secret word-of-mouth hit of the season.


							By 

	David Canfield


Senior Entertainment Writer


	In an unusually competitive documentary landscape this awards season — featuring the return of an Oscar-winning Ukrainian filmmaker from a warzone, a critical and audience phenomenon that reached millions via Netflix — one especially unlikely contender has still managed to stand out. With her first documentary feature in nearly 30 years, Julia Loktev (The Loneliest Planet) is striking a chord with My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow, a vérité portrait of journalists in Russia as their country launches a war with Ukraine. In just under five and a half hours of runtime, these subjects feel the tightening, irreversible grip of authoritarianism forcing them out of their home — but they still live life, sharing meals and making jokes, and taking things day by day. Taken together, My Undesirable Friends weaves an epic tapestry of humanity.

	The film premiered to strong reviews at the 2024 New York Film Festival, but in the year-plus since, has been unable to find a distributor. (It was self-distributed to qualify for Oscars consideration this cycle.) In the time since, My Undesirable Friends has won top documentary prizes from the New York Film Critics' Circle and other regional groups, been shortlisted for the best doc Oscar, and dominated publications' year-end best-of lists among nonfiction movies. Accordingly, just as Loktev finishes work on her second, equally lengthy installment, the film's fortunes may soon change. “We should hopefully have news soon,” Loktev tells The Hollywood Reporter.

	But the road has not been easy — Loktev has had miniscule funds to work with, compared with her competitors, and knows the challenge of getting voters to see the longest film in the running. “When you see on paper, ‘Oh, it's a five and a half hour film about Russian journalists,' you go, ‘Scary, I'm not sure about that,'” she says. “But then more people watch it, and the more people actually talk about what the experience of it is, the word starts spreading.”


	See below for THR's Q&A with Loktev.


I'm curious how you thought about the way this would be released, given the length. Did an episodic format ever come up, especially with the existing chapter structure? What was it like planning to get it out into the world?


	The whole making of the film has been this crazy endeavor. I shot it alone with an iPhone, no crew, and basically have been the director, producer, cinematographer — and I had a co-editor and an assistant editor, so literally most of the film has been three people. That's it. I started filming a film in Russia four months before the full scale war, when nobody knew that Russia would start this horrific war in Ukraine, and then history just started unrolling super fast, and I was there and filming it all. There was no time to think; I just had to keep filming. I was there during this historic event and I had a tiny seed development grant. There was no planning.


	I continued to film all the characters in exile and then I just thought, I have this incredible historic footage, captured through people you get to know as characters the way you would in a fiction film. I let the film become what it needs to be rather than have somebody tell me what it should be. There was a point very early in the editing process that I walked away from equity that would've funded the whole film. 

	











Really? Wow.


	It would've imposed a format on it. “It's going to be a feature-length film.” I said, “I need to see how to shape this. I have this incredible footage and I want it to tell me what the film should be and I want to be true to the actual material and true to the events.” So I got some grants and just kept editing to make it what it needs to be. It was obvious it would've been an easier path to go and find a place and have somebody telling me exactly what to make it into, but I owed it to the story to let it be what it needed to become.


As you were starting to put this together, what told you that this was the final format, a five-plus-hour film? It's not typical, obviously, even if you had so much footage to work with.


	And it's an enormous amount of story — it's not just footage. I mean you can condense all the footage you want to. I was basically there to capture this historic exodus from this moment, from when it's still possible to work as the opposition in Russia and be an independent journalist in this authoritarian society and fight back, to when everybody realizes that to continue to do this work, we have to flee this country. A million people left. What the film does, I think, is it lets you live through it with people. I come from fiction — I filmed them like they were characters in a fiction film that you live through it with them, feel through it with them. It's not experts explaining things. It's just really being in the moment.

	











	If you make it into an hour and a half film or a two hour film, yes, you could do it and it would be this condensed version where you get the information — and you can get the information in a New York Times article, you can find the information elsewhere. But to feel what it feels like to live through it with characters that you could hopefully fall in love with, you needed to have time to understand that. It's a very long film, but a super fast-cut film — it's not a meditative film at all. You're having trouble sometimes keeping up reading the subtitles so fast, but it's dense. 


	And I mean, it's not a series because no streamer wanted it. (Laughs) I would've had a lot more money to make it if they did — and a lot more money now for an awards campaign, God knows. But at the same time, I question these distinctions because if you think about it, like all the great Russian novels, Crime and Punishment and War and Peace, not to mention the Charles Dickens novels or Ulysses, were all released in serialized forms and magazines first and then became novels. We don't question, now, is War and Peace a novel? 


The beauty of the film is that this feeling of real life happening, but you are still a filmmaker and there is a certain rigor to your approach. Did the project formally evolve at all, the deeper you got into it?


	I just tried to work really organically, even in the shooting: Something is happening in front of you and you're just trying to keep up and frame the shot. Because I do come from fiction, I don't know if I filmed them any differently than I would an actor giving a great performance, except it happens to be true in their real life and all the more tragic for that. 

	











	One of the things that I learned so much from this as a filmmaker is that people are so much more complicated and so much more contradictory and interesting than I could ever write them, to be honest. When we write fiction, so often people go a little bit more on the nose — if people are going through a tragic moment, they stay in that tragic moment. What I constantly observed with people here is this shift from the most terrible horrible things, to sudden humor, back to the terrible horrible things — very inappropriately and wonderfully and in a way that I'd think, “Wow, I wish I could write like this.” This taught me so much in having to observe in a very focused way as you're filming, and seeing people joke in the middle of their lives falling apart.


What was your relationship to the subjects like? You're very present in the movie as the one with the camera, and as you mentioned, they trusted you implicitly to do this.


	I knew Anna Nemzer, who leads us into this world. She knew all the other characters in some way professionally or as peripheral acquaintances, friends to different degrees. She brought me into this world as a trusted person. I was born in Russia, and so Russian is the language I speak to my mom, even though I grew up in the States. It would be a completely different relationship if I was coming in without that. But people opened up to me very quickly, very instantly. We had a rapport, and then over the course of filming we became friends. That's a huge part of the film because you experience it with me — you literally meet a lot of these characters as I'm meeting them. You get to know them and hopefully they become your desirable friends as well as mine. They're “undesirable” only because that's what the Russian government has marked them as. That's an actual legal category in Russia where they have marked most journalist organizations and most of civil society as “undesirable organizations.” They're undesirable to their authoritarian project.

	











How have you experienced screening the film over the last few months, getting it out there in an awards context? 


	Oh, Jesus, my favorite subject — the campaign. (Laughs) We're trying to do our best. When I heard what the streamers spend on their films, my jaw dropped. We can only do a tiny fraction of what is supposedly considered necessary to do. We are just doing our best on a micro budget. It's really, really difficult because you're sitting there getting bombarded with things from the larger distributors. You're feeling small and insignificant and feeling FOMO when you have no budget to do anything about it. It's unfortunate that that's how things are, but it is how things are and all you can do is your best. We just want the film to reach an audience. That's what we care about. 


It must feel like a nice bit of vindication, then, when you hit the Oscars short list or pick up these critics' awards. 


	Definitely. I mean, it's a tougher road. And $1 or $2 million for a campaign couldn't hurt.


Can I ask what you are working with in terms of money?


	Oh God, it's a fraction. We're just trying to extract so little — like, well, I shouldn't say that in print. But it's not like there's some distributor paying for it. In all honesty, it's production money that was supposed to eventually pay me, and literally the characters in the film. I didn't want to do it, to be honest; I was like, “This seems so crazy to enter into this.” And it was characters from the film who said to me, “Listen, try to give the film the best chance possible. Let's do a little bit of something.” 

	











Laura Poitras did an event with us at my house and I went to Tashkent Supermarket, which has all this post-Soviet food in New York. I got a bunch of snacks. I put them on a table. There were no waiters with tiny hors d'oeuvres. That's what we can do. We've had people be very kind. Laura's been supportive, and I love her film [Cover-Up] as well. 


The film's portrait of living under creeping authoritarianism has certainly resonated in the U.S., as it's a relevant topic these days. Have you noticed that? 


	How people perceive the film has shifted so much since we opened at the New York Film Festival [in 2024]. It all felt so far away then. It's just transformed so much. What's interesting to me is it's not just about the larger picture, but very specific details in the film that were specific to something happening in Russia that suddenly took on resonance. Somebody has a throwaway joke about when they shut down Russia's biggest comedy show. It wasn't planted there. Or when Russia shuts down its oldest human rights organization, which was dedicated to preserving the memory of political repression and addressing political repression in the current times, the judge says, “Why must we talk about our unpleasant history? We must be proud.” Of course, I'm watching Trump with the Smithsonian now and saying, “Why must we talk about unpleasant things like slavery?” 


	Last night I read about the 60 Minutes piece being pulled. The crackdown on journalism with Russia, they didn't go straight for charging journalists with treason and extremism or terrorism. They started with economic pressure, pulling advertisements or threatening to sue journalists for libel — various kinds of strong-arm techniques that all looked perfectly so-called “reasonable.” 

	











	One of the nicest things that I've heard from people is that it gives them a way of processing the current moment because we're living through something unprecedented and we don't know how to deal with it emotionally. There is this cognitive dissonance or horrible things happening in our country. Meanwhile, the fabric of many lives looks completely normal and for the most part undisturbed. If you look around your neighborhood, it looks more or less the same. Life looks nice, and yet what's actually happening is horrific. That's really what dystopian societies look like. They don't look like V for Vendetta. Authoritarianism is really good for some people, and for the rest of us, it is this cognitive dissonance where parts of our lives remain intact and seem very normal, and meanwhile, people are being snatched into unmarked vans by masked men.


Where are you with Part 2?


	I've edited four out of the five chapters, and so now I have to edit the last one. I'm in the process of doing that now. It's scary, but I am being given a little bit of hope. I've spent four years with these people, and in a way I'm kind of having separation anxiety of what will happen when I finish that. But if the Vladimir Putin regime ever falls, we're going to go back and make a third installment. We may be very, very old by then because it's not going to go well probably right after.


Have you stopped filming? Do you know where this story ends for now, as a film?


	I haven't actually stopped filming. I'm not actively filming a lot, but as I'm meditating on the last chapter, I want to end as closely to where we leave off as possible because the story keeps unfolding. I'm pretty sure I know what that last shot will be. Once I get three quarters of the way or 80% of the way with editing this chapter, I want to film that one thing. Probably, that's when we'll stop.

The annual list honors British figures for their work in their respective fields.


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



Idris Elba, Ellie Goulding and Cynthia Erivo are among the entertainment and music figures recognized in the U.K.'s New Year Honors List.


	The King's annual list acknowledges and honors figures from across British society with knighthoods and damehoods, as well as CBEs (Commander), OBEs (Officer) and MBEs (Member). The former is the highest honor prior to earning the title of Sir or Dame with a knighthood or damehood. A total of 1,157 recipients from the worlds of politics, sport, entertainment, science and more appear in this year's list.


	Elba has been awarded a knighthood in the list released on Tuesday (Dec. 30) and he will assume the title of Sir Idris Elba. The honor comes in recognition of his charity work with young people, having launched an anti-knife crime campaign and founded the Elba Hope Foundation alongside his wife Sabrina, which provides grants to organizations across the UK, the US and Africa.

	











	As a teenager, Elba was a beneficiary of the Prince's Trust, and was given a £1,500 grant to attend the National Youth Music Theatre program. He went on to appear as an actor in hit TV shows The Wire and Luther, and has released music and performed as DJ Big Driis at festivals across the world.


	Other music figures to appear in the list include Wicked star and performer Cynthia Erivo and singer Ellie Goulding, both of whom are awarded MBEs. Erivo is recognized for her work across the drama and arts space, while Goulding is also recognized for her efforts towards biodiversity and the climate, having worked with the UN as a global environmental ambassador.


Max Richter is honored as a CBE less than two weeks prior to the physical release of his original score for the Oscar-tipped film Hamnet, directed by Chloe Zhao and starring Paul Mescal. Scottish singer Eve Graham receives an MBE for services to the music industry. Graham is a founding member of The New Seekers, and had a global hit with a version of “I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing” in 1972.

	











	Other industry figures include Karen Ruth Emanuel, founder and chief executive officer of Key Production Group, who receives an OBE for services to music; Philip Patterson, a former sector specialist at the Department for Business and Trade, who is awarded an OBE for his work for the music industry; and Live Music Now chair Janet Fischer, who is awarded an MBE for services to music and charity.

The alleged bucket list floating on social media includes items like skydiving, swimming with sharks and climbing a volcano. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	Ye (formerly Kanye West) has accomplished many eccentric things outside of music, but the rapper says the bucket list attributed to him that's currently going viral on social media is fake.


	Chatter around the viral handwritten bucket list made it back to Yeezy this holiday season, so he took to X on Monday night (Dec. 29) with a rare tweet clarifying that it wasn't actually created by him.


	“That so called bucket list is fake It's not my hand writing,” he wrote. 


	The bucket list in question is filled with random goals — 36 to be exact — like learning to pole dance, climbing a volcano, skydiving, swimming with sharks and visiting places like Russia, Cambodia, the Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu, Brazil, Iceland and Chile.

	











	On the innovation and design side, there were ideas like creating his own shampoo and soap line, as well as writing a book. 




	“It's ok about wanting to learn how to pole dance we won't judge,” one fan quipped. “Nah but deada— we need the real Ye bucket list.”

Kanye West shared his bucket list pic.twitter.com/8mfNw6WqYv


	Ye has been lying low while spending time with family this holiday season. TMZ reported that he spent part of the holidays reuniting with ex-wife Kim Kardashian as they co-parent their four children in the same space in Los Angeles. And another photo surfaced of Ye with his wife, Bianca Censori, and daughter North West, along with other alleged family members.


	Ye also pulled up to Deon Cole's comedy show over the weekend, where, after being invited on stage to chat with the comic, he confirmed he has a “new album” on the way. It's unclear if that project is the much-delayed Bully or a completely separate LP.

	“Lend me the strength of the All Fathers, so that I may fight once more. Defeat one more enemy. And return home to her.”


	And so the scene is set for Thor‘s story in Avengers: Doomsday, the highly anticipated Marvel movie reuniting its most famous superheroes against a new enemy: Robert Downey Jr's Doctor Doom.


	Chris Hemsworth will return as the God of Thunder, and the Doomsday teaser features him on bended knee in a sepia-lit forest praying to his late father, the Norse god Odin.


	He is pleading for a safe return to his daughter, Love, who will be played by Hemsworth's real-life daughter, India. The character first appeared in 2022's Thor: Love and Thunder.












	The Thor-themed trailer is the second to be released, following a teaser revealing the return of Chris Evans as Steve Rogers — another character doting on their child ahead of impending doom. The Doomsday teasers are playing in cinemas attached to showings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. 


			Watch on Deadline		







Avengers: Doomsday will be the big Christmas movie next year, premiering on December 18, 2026. Joe and Anthony Russo's last Avengers title, Endgame, is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.799 billion at the global box office.

TV Reporter


	The end of Stranger Things is lurking just ahead with Wednesday's highly anticipated two-hour finale set to conclude the epic supernatural series after nearly a decade.


	Netflix revealed a trailer for the final episode on Tuesday, teasing what's to come.


	“I need you to fight. One last time,” Hopper (David Harbour) says tearfully to Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) inside the Upside Down as the crew mounts one last attempt to save the world. 


	“Life has been so unfair to you,” he says. “Your childhood was taken from you. You've been attacked, manipulated by terrible people, but you never let it break you. Fight for the days on the other side of this. Fight for a world beyond Hawkins. Let's end this, kid.”

	











	Watch the trailer above. 




			Watch on Deadline		







Stranger Things 5 picks up eighteen months after the events of Season 4, when the crew finally reunited back in Hawkins only for Vecna to split the earth open as he began his mission to reshape the world. Over the course of the first seven episodes, Season 5 has answered many of the mysteries of the Upside Down, including what, exactly, it even is. 


RELATED LINK: ‘Stranger Things 5′ Creators & Star Noah Schnapp Unpack Will Byers' Leap Of Faith In Volume 2: “It Was So Freeing”


	However, for all the questions answered, particularly in Volume 2, there are still some lingering loose ends to tie up, mainly regarding the remaining pieces of Henry's backstory and the enduring MKUltra experiments, which are responsible for creating Eleven and, by proxy, the Upside Down in the first place.

	











	“The goal is to tie up the remaining loose ends and answer any questions that remain,” creator Ross Duffer teased to Deadline in an interview for Volume 2, promising a satisfying conclusion to the series.


Stranger Things cast and crew have set some grand expectations for the finale. Executive producer and director Shawn Levy (who directed Episode 6, “Escape from Camazotz,” and co-directed Episode 7, “The Bridge,” with the Duffers) paraphrased star Finn Wolfhard's enthusiasm about it, telling Deadline: 


RELATED LINK: ‘Stranger Things 5' Star Caleb McLaughlin On That Emotional Scene With [SPOILER], Upside Down Mythology & More From Vol. 2


	“I'll say something that I think Finn said, but I'll say it with even more fervor having watched the finale episode recently. It's one of the best finale episodes of any show that I've ever seen,” Levy said. “And I am so knocked out by the mastery that the Duffers show in the finale episode. I can't wait for the world to see it. I can't wait for them to see it on the biggest, loudest screen possible, because that's what it deserves.”


	Added Wolfhard, “Couldn't have said it better myself, something that I've said myself.”


	The Stranger Things finale arrives in theaters and on Netflix at 5 p.m. PT New Year's Eve.

Ricky Gervais is in typically unapologetic form in his latest Netflix stand-up special.


	The co-creator of The Office used Mortality — which premiered on Tuesday — to bemoan a “really weird” time for comedy and declare victory over elites who “find anything offensive.”


	Filmed at the London Palladium this year, Gervais said: “It's great to hear this sort of laughter again, because you probably don't notice it as much as comedians, but we've had a really weird 10 years where we're really second-[guessing jokes].”

	He explained: “People find anything offensive, but we pushed back and we won. So f*** them. Until the next time. They haven't gone away. They're just licking their wounds. They'll be back with something madder. But remember who it is next time? Right?

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“It's always these sort of educated, middle-class, privileged, elitist, sort of people telling ordinary working-class people what they can and can't do and say and laugh, not realizing how important comedy is to ordinary people.”


	Gervais has been at the sharp end of controversies around comments in his previous stand-up specials. His 2022 show Supernature came under fire for trans jokes, which he later said didn't target “trans folk, but trans activist ideology.” In 2023, a petition was started requesting that Netflix remove material about young cancer sufferers from Gervais' Armageddon special.


	Gervais said there had been numerous attempts to get him canceled over the past 15 years — including from fellow comedians who criticize him for “punching down.” “They've always failed,” he said. “I'm too old now not to say what I want. I want to say and do what I want all the time. I want to do my favorite thing all the time.”

	











	Gervais turned to anthropology to offer an explanation for the rise of cancel culture. He said: “There's still two ways you can raise your status in society. One, be competent at something, like, ‘Oh, he's a good hunter, go with him, he's good for the tribe.' The other way you can raise your status is to have virtue like, ‘Oh, he's not a great hunter, but he's wise or kind or whatever.' 


	“And then, with the advent of social media, people suddenly discovered they could just say they were virtuous. No evidence, no proof, just loads of flags in their bio. And they would raise their status by bringing other people down, catching other people out … And that's where the term virtual signaling comes from, right?”


	He continued: “The most annoying thing about virtue signalling is people being smug about having the morality of the age. You're what you're like because of where you are and when you are.”


	Gervais said he considers himself to be anti-racist, but acknowledged that he could have been a slave owner in another century. He joked: “I'm willing to admit that if I'd have been born 300 years ago and I was white and wealthy, I'd have probably owned slaves. I'd be nice to them, so shut up, right? Yeah, I'd be the best slave owner.”


Golden Globes Gag


	The After Life creator also reflected on his time hosting the Golden Globes, praising the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for never censoring his jokes. He did reveal, however, that he stopped himself from making a gag about Jason Momoa in 2020.


	“I thought the meta joke would be to show my hypocrisy and my cowardice, like, ‘I'm ok to slag off actors who's scared of actors? But when it comes to a big dude, I'm not so brave.' So I was gonna go, ‘I've got nothing bad to say about our next presenter, because he's got a cock like a baby's arm.'


	“I told my mate I was gonna do that, and my mate went, ‘Do you think people will think that's racist?' I went, ‘Why is it racist?' ‘Well, because he's a person of color.' I went, ‘It's nothing to do with that. It's to do with the fact that he's so big, he'd probably have a cock like a baby's arm.' So I didn't do it.”

He's still doing the same boring “look how offensive I am?” shtick. So many comedians do it so much better, because they just make the joke—without talking endlessly about how brave they are. 

See Adrienne Iapalucci. A hundred times funnier than Gervais, a hundred times more offensive.

When does the podcast start?

Gervais: “The most annoying thing about virtue signalling is people being smug about having the morality of the age…”, that's exactly him, he actually doesn't make any jokes anymore, just complain about others and he's not funny just annoying virtue signaling others, dude Tina and Amy were way better than you, meaner and smarter at the Globes, and they never complain unlike you

Always one step ahead of the curve, eh Ricky?
These are new, edgy, relevant sounding jokes that will SHOCK THE WORLD!!
Great job!

It's almost as though only having the balls to do stand up once you're famous *isn't* the best route to good stand up…

Agree it's not that edgy. The new thing now is focusing on telling well crafted homes and being a good writer. Can still complain endlessly on the podcasts, if people need the good jokes as such a service don't waste time covering old ground…bring them these jokes man. It's your job. Jk?

Arden Cho and Ahn Hyo-seop, the voice actors behind KPop Demon Hunters main characters Rumi and Jinu, respectively, will appear in their first-ever sit-down interview together on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Monday, Jan. 12.


	News of the duo's late-night TV debut, which will air at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT on NBC and stream the following day on Peacock, was shared today on the show's social media accounts. The episode will also feature guests Kristen Wiig and Ashton Kutcher and a musical performance by Ty Meyers.  


Netflix‘s KPop Demon Hunters quickly became a phenomenon for the streamer, skyrocketing to the top of its charts as the platform's most popular film of all time with more than 500 million global views since its premiere 27 weeks ago. Since then, the Sony Pictures Animation movie has notched three Golden Globe nominations, two Critics Choice nods and five Grammy Award noms for its record-breaking soundtrack, which is certified Double Platinum. As Deadline previously reported, Netflix and Sony are eyeing a 2029 release for a sequel.

	Ta-da! The GOATs are back. This applies to the three main therapists at Paul Rhodes' (Harrison Ford) practice and their extended web of friends and family. Apple has released the trailer for the Shrinking's upcoming third season.


	Created by Emmy winners Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein alongside star Jason Segel, Shrinking Season 3 will premiere globally on Apple TV with a one-hour season premiere episode on Wednesday, January 28 followed by one new episode weekly until April 8.


	Jimmy (Segel) has to work hard to mask his sadness and project excitement at Alice's (Lukita Maxwell) recruitment to play soccer at a college in Connecticut. Goldstein's Louis Winston will be back in Season 3 as he and Jimmy sit on a bench — quite a common setting in this series — talking about it.

	











	“All I want is for her to live peacefully, and then she can go off and make whatever mistakes a young woman in her 70s might make,” Jimmy tells Louis, who remarks that “that sounds healthy.”

	Cue Kid Cudi's “Mr. Miracle” as Paul dispenses a nugget of wisdom: “Life is gonna keep demonstrating what you need most.” Lawrence told Deadline at the end of Season 2 that Season 3's main theme will be “moving forward.”


	Sofi (Cobie Smulders) has a brief appearance, but Jimmy fails to ask her out, as pointed out by Liz (Christa Miller) spying from her balcony, Sean (Luke Tennie) doing something on the pool house roof and Derek (Ted McGinley) getting a football out of a tree.

	











Michael J. Fox also makes his grand entrance to the series when he appears at what looks like a doctors office Paul is visiting, joking that he's in for “a haircut” after Paul tells him he's getting seen for his Parkinson's.


	Michael Urie is back starring as Jimmy's best friend Brian, and Season 3 also brings back guest stars Goldstein, Damon Wayans Jr., Devin Kawaoka, Wendie Malick and Smulders, along with new additions Jeff Daniels and the aforementioned Fox.


Shrinking is produced for Apple TV by Warner Bros. Television, where Lawrence and Goldstein are under overall deals along with Lawrence's Doozer Productions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Bella Hadid lightens up with new platinum blond hair in Aspen","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/30/style/bella-hadids-platinum-blond-hair-transformation-in-aspen-photos/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:24:00 GMT","

Bella Hadid brought the frost to Aspen.

The model, 29, was spotted on the streets of the celebrity ski town with her hair dyed an icy shade of platinum blond. 

Hadid was photographed out and about with friends, including Sports Illustrated model Brooks Nader, as both spent the holiday week in the Colorado mountains.

The freshly lightened ‘do matched Hadid's plush fur coat — a sensible choice for the 20-degree weather — and she capped off the cozy ensemble with the Wild Places Hat ($30) by Texan outdoors brand Poncho.

The Orebella founder kept warm in Ugg's knee-high Classic Tall Boots ($220) and a paisley cashmere scarf by sister Gigi Hadid's Guest in Residence brand, which Bella tied around her quilted red leather Chanel expandable tote bag.

Hadid's hair has run the gamut of brunette and blond shades over the course of her career, but since May, she's been sporting a highlighted honey hue that her hairstylist, Jacob Schwartz, dubbed “supermodel blond.”

He chose the shade for its “glossy, healthy finish that perfectly captures the essence of French Riviera luxury and Bella's off-duty model aesthetic,” he told Page Six at the time.

Her new color has a noticeably cooler tone and may be her lightest look yet, save for the various white-blond wigs she's sported for modeling gigs.

More often than not, she's played the brunette sister to Gigi's blond — though in 2018, she told Allure that she naturally has lighter hair of the two.

“I just have a darker personality. And my sister being blond and me being brunette, it's a good separation,” she explained. “I put a blond wig on and think it would be fun to go back but I'm happy with my hair. Blondes are so angelic. My sister can get away with anything.” 

In 2022, Bella first experimented with an “Aspen blond” shade — a golden hue created by colorist Jenna Perry — which she debuted at her sister's Guest in Residence pop-up shop in the same ski town.

Her latest platinum iteration takes the concept to new heights.

This streaming release is gonna be popular. 

After 53 days in theaters (and a buzzy, fashion-filled press tour), “Wicked: For Good” will finally be available to stream on video-on-demand (VOD) retailers like Prime Video.

The film's already generating early awards season buzz, with stars Ariana Grande (Glinda) and Cynthia Erivo (Elphaba) both clinching individual Golden Globes nominations. 

Read on for everything you need to know to catch act two of the much-discussed story — and change your at-home movie nights for good. 

The second part of the “Wicked” movie is available to buy on Prime Video starting at midnight ET on Dec. 30, 2025. The ultra-high definition version costs $29.99. 

You won't need to be a Prime member to watch it, although you'll need to sign up for at least a free Amazon account to store your digital purchase. 

Luckily for “Wicked” obsessives, purchased movies live in your Amazon account indefinitely and can be watched and rewatched as much as you'd like.

While there's no word yet on when you'll be able to stream “Wicked: For Good” without purchasing it, the buzzy sequel will eventually make its way to Peacock, given it's owned by the same parent company as Universal Pictures.

Need to catch up? The first part of “Wicked” is already available to stream on Peacock. 

The service starts at just $7.99/month for an ad-enabled plan. (If your 2026 plans also involve binging Apple TV shows, you can bundle the two services for $12.99/month.) 

As of now, “Wicked: For Good” is still in theaters. Given its predecessor became the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation of all time in 2024, in addition to taking home two Oscars, its run isn't done quite yet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Ryan Coogler was ""absolutely not"" allowed to use Kraven for Black Panther","https://www.avclub.com/black-panther-kraven-ryan-coogler","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:21:02 GMT","

There was a time when Sony's universe of Spider-Man villains really looked like it might have been something. Or, rather, it looked that way to executives counting the surprising $850 million box office of Venom. Assuming that all Spider-Man's villains were as popular and beloved as Eddie Brock, Sony pressed forward with films about Dr. Michael Morbius, Madame Web, and a hunter named Kraven. The quick diminishing returns felt by audience members who didn't know they were buying tickets to an off-brand superhero franchise eventually led to the series flaming out with the unsurprising disappointment of Kraven The Hunter last December. If Sony hadn't been so protective of characters that really need a good and recognizable hero to give them some juice, they may have been able to make a pretty good Kraven movie directed by Ryan Coogler. In fact, during Coogler's interview with Happy Sad Confused today, the director revealed that he originally wanted the character for his first Black Panther, but Sony put the kibosh on Kraven.

To be clear, Kraven wouldn't have been the film's big bad, nor would Michael B. Jordan have played the Hunter. From the sounds of it, the director wanted the character for a cold-open action scene. Coogler tells host Josh Horowitz that he and co-writer Joe Robert Cole took inspiration from Christopher Priest's run of comics, which starts with Black Panther, Kraven, and Everett Ross fighting in a kitchen. A self-proclaimed “big Spider-Man fan, especially Spider-Man: The Animated Series,” Coogler asked the higher-ups at Marvel if he could use the character. Sony clearly had other ideas. “I was like, ‘Yo, can I have Kraven in the movie?' [Marvel was] like, ‘We don't think so, but let us check.' So, they hit Sony, and Sony was like, ‘Absolutely not.' They came back to me like, ‘Yo, we can't do it.' So, I was like, ‘Okay.'”

Strangely, “okay” is what many moviegoers said after the trailer for 2024's Kraven The Hunter.

Apple TV's Shrinking, the therapy comedy created by Bill Lawrence and starring Harrison Ford and co-creator Jason Segel, returns for another season of dark comedy and uplifting humor. Providing relief to Apple's many television patients, the streamer has released a new trailer for season three, which follows the aging shrinks as they wonder what to do with the rest of their lives. We can only hope that the show's writing staff has figured it out.

This season sees Jimmy (Segel) facing an empty nest as his daughter, Alice (Lukita Maxwell), heads off to college, sending him into his latest existential crisis. Meanwhile, Gaby (Jessica Williams) is reconsidering her career choices, and Paul navigates his Parkinson's disease and gets some tips from Michael J. Fox in the process. Fox isn't the only guest star in need of therapy. Season three also features Brett Goldstein, Damon Wayans Jr., Wendie Malick, Cobie Smulders, and Jeff Daniels.

Here's the trailer:

﻿

After debuting to positive reviews in 2023, Shrinking grew in esteem throughout season two and received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series. Shrinking returns to Apple on January 28, 2026, with a one-hour season premiere. New episodes stream every Wednesday through April 8.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Gia Giudice Opens Up About Holiday Reunion With the Gorgas: ‘Let Bygones Be Bygones'","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/gia-giudice-gorga-reunion-holiday-2025/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:36:07 GMT","

Gia Giudice is speaking candidly about what it took to bring her family back together. The “Next Gen NYC” star recently confirmed she spent Christmas Eve with her uncle Joe Gorga and his wife Melissa Gorga — a major step forward for a family once plagued by tension.

During a December 26 appearance on Jeff Lewis Live on SiriusXM, Gia shared that her mom, “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” star Teresa Giudice, initiated the reunion with Joe at their parents' gravesite.

“They met alone at the cemetery first. It was just them at first, just my mom and her brother,” Gia explained. “After that conversation went really well, they were like, ‘OK, now it's time to have a conversation, us four.'”

She added that Teresa's husband, Luis “Louie” Ruelas, and Melissa joined the conversation later at a nearby park, before all four continued the discussion at Willow & Whisk, a popular Bergen County brunch spot.

“People took pictures of them, and that's kind of how [news of the reconciliation] got out,” Gia said. “They were like, ‘OK, whatever. We can't hide forever.'”

This year's Christmas Eve was particularly meaningful, marking the first time Gia had ever visited Joe and Melissa's Franklin Lakes home.

“They invited us around Thanksgiving,” she shared. “So we knew for quite some time now that we were gonna spend Christmas together.”

She said the evening was filled with heartfelt moments — including one with her cousins, Antonia, Gino, and Joey Gorga.

“I even said something to my cousins,” Gia recalled. “I said I am sorry for the disconnect and that I'm so happy we're here in a place where we're together… My mom and my aunt, everyone chimed in, and they were just like, let bygones be bygones, and we have to move on.”

Despite feeling grateful for the gathering, Gia admitted the catered food didn't quite meet her expectations. “It was OK. They had it catered,” she said. “Even next year — my mom even said it — we should all cook together because [the food] is always better.”

Still, one thing impressed the Bravo star: her aunt Melissa's Let's Sprinkle dessert line.

Gorga initially launched her dessert line in December 2024 with a debut batch of soft, baked-to-order rainbow sprinkle cookies. The brand was inspired by a now-infamous scene from “The Real Housewives of New Jersey,” when Teresa Giudice criticized Melissa's contribution to their family's Christmas celebration.

“She came to my house Christmas Day, she brought me sprinkle cookies,” Teresa recalled in the viral moment. “I said to her, ‘Melissa, nobody touched the cookies you brought. I threw them in the garbage. You know what my favorite cookies are? Pignoli cookies.' That's what I said.”

Despite the brand's origins, Gia has since embraced her aunt's dessert line, saying, “I like crumb cake… I thought the cake was very moist,” she said. “I'm not kidding. I really liked the cake.”

“Modern Family” star Eric Stonestreet penned a heartfelt tribute to Pat Finn, remembering him as a wonderful person and sharing just how much he had meant to him. 

Finn's death was reported on December 24. He died from bladder cancer and was 60. “He was the kindest, most joyful person in any room, and was surrounded by his incredibly close and loving family and friends,” a statement about his death reads, Entertainment Weekly reports. 

Stonestreet shared his tribute to Finn on X. “Everyone's favorite guy @thatPatFinn sadly passed away this week. To say Pat was beloved is a gross understatement. No ONE and I mean NO ONE jumped quicker and more head first into a bit with you than Pat Finn,” he wrote. “He was the definition of what an improviser is and also the definition of what a good guy is. Please keep his entire family and all of his close pals in your thoughts.”

Fans showed their support for the actor in the post's comments. “Rest in peace. Blessings to his family,” a comment reads. “He was such a funny actor. Loved him in everything he did. I'm sorry for the loss of your friend,” another fan shared. 

Other reactions include, “Wow, I hadn't heard!  He was awesome…prayers up for him, his family and friends,” and “I loved The Middle, and he was excellent in it, he's probably in the best scene of the entire show…He seemed like a great guy.” 

Finn was an actor and comedian whose portfolio of work included appearances on “The Middle,” “Friends,” and “Murphy Brown.” He was loved by many, including fans and celebrities who knew him. 

Finn is survived by his wife, Donna, and their children, Cassidy, Caitlin, and Ryan. A GoFundMe fundraiser, titled “Help the Finn Family Through Pat's Fight,” with the beneficiary listed as Donna Finn, was created to help support the family with the costs incurred from Finn's battle with cancer. 

“The Finn family, cherished friends of so many of us, are truly in a tough spot. Pat has been battling cancer on and off for the better part of three years,” the statement reads. “Throughout the grueling and painful process that is Pat's fight against this insidious disease, the family has been a rock of support for each other. Pat, Donna, Cassidy, Caitlin, and Ryan have demonstrated enormous strength every day, supporting each other as Pat's fight has become more complicated, challenging, and physically difficult. As friends, we all continue to offer our help, and it's now time to expand that support into fundraising.”

The initial goal is listed at $230,000, and at the time of publication, the fund has raised over $188,000 with 369 people showing their support.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Major Updates on Hallmark's ‘Hope Valley 1874' Including ‘Heroic' Efforts by Cast & Crew","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/hope-valley-1874-filming-update/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:51:50 GMT","

As Hearties anxiously await the season 13 premiere of Hallmark's hit series “When Calls the Heart,” premiering on January 4, 2026, filming has begun on the show's just-announced prequel, “Hope Valley 1874” starring Benjamin Ayres, Bethany Joy Lenz, and Hallmark newcomer Jill Hennessy. 

Hallmark revealed the surprise series to fans on December 12 and began shooting days later, racing to film an eight-episode first season in time for the series to debut on Hallmark+ in March. They faced some major hurdles right out of the gate, but there's been plenty of good news, too. Here's everything we know about the show so far…

Days after Hallmark announced “Hope Valley: 1874,” the primary cast and crew began filming in Vancouver in tough weather conditions. On December 22, “When Calls The Heart” production manager Mike Magnusson, who is also handling logistics on “Hope Valley: 1874,” shared on social media that the first week of filming was complete, and everyone had gone home for the holidays. 

“I want to thank our cast & crew for a heroic week one,” he captioned a photo of ominous clouds over an inlet. “Weather systems conspired to make this a week of biblical level challenges. I am confounded by the personal stories of heroic dedication required to get the job done; or in some cases, heroics required just to make it to work! Heros, each & every one of you! Thank you so much for your dedication! 🙏🙏🙏”

Grip Grayson Wells, who also works on “When Calls The Heart,” wrote in the comments, “We killed it as a team👊🏼 My boots are still wet though! lol”

On December 28, longtime Hallmark actress Chelsea Hobbs revealed that she was the first cast member to join “Hope Valley: 1874,” but her busy schedule as a single mom kept her from celebrating her news online sooner. The “Dream Moms” and “Deck the Halls on Cherry Lane” star shared in an Instagram post that she's “over the moon” to be playing Peggy McCabe on the series. 

She wrote, “To say I'm grateful and honoured to join the #whencallstheheart universe for this more rugged prequel, would be a wild understatement. 💞”

Fellow Hallmark stars cheered Hobbs' announcement, including Taylor Cole, who commented, “Oh I love this. You and @benjaminayres are going to have so much fun. 🤩 congratulations”

In her Instagram Stories, Hobbs posted a selfie video in which she further shared, “I'm giddy excited about this experience. I was actually one of, if not the first, person cast. I've been sitting on it, like, couldn't announce anything (or) talk about it.” 

“I've learned how to drive a wagon, been back on a horse,” she said, and then gushed, “The costumes, the people, like everything already is just so fun. I'm giddy about it. It's so fun! Can't wait.”

Two days before Magnusson's update, Ayres posted a montage of footage he took behind the scenes, revealing rugged and dimly-lit backdrops, from the inside of a horse stable to him sitting near the water as clouds and fog rolled in. 

Hennessy, who's starred in multiple hit series including “Crossing Jordan,” wrote in the comment section, “Wow, you really captured it!!! Really beautiful work this week, Ben!!👏👏👏” and he replied, “You crushed it sister! So fun being wet and cold with you:)”

For those Hearties wondering whether “When Calls The Heart” co-creators Brian Bird and Michael Landon Jr. have been involved in and aware of the development of “Hope Valley: 1874,” the answer is YES. Even “When Calls The Heart” showrunner Alfonso Moreno is at the helm, ensuring consistency across the franchise.  

Bird acknowledged his involvement and support on December 12, tweeting an article about the show announcement and writing, “For #Hearties everywhere… this has been a big few weeks on the BREAKING NEWS front. Thanks to patron @hallmarkchannel and partners @MichaelLandonJr, @BradKrevoy and @AlfonsoMoreno, a new original series… Hope Valley: 1874!”

In an Instagram post on December 13, Landon Jr. wrote, “When I first created When Calls the Heart, I never imagined we'd one day be going back to explore how Hope Valley began. And now here we are. So thrilled to share that ‘Hope Valley: 1874' is officially coming to @HallmarkPlus. Watching this world grow and knowing it still resonates with so many of you means more than I can say. Can't wait to see what this talented cast and team bring to the frontier. March 2026—mark your calendars, #Hearties. 💛”

Some die-hard Hearties have questioned the name of the new series, noting that in Janette Oke's first novels that inspired “When Calls The Heart,” and in the show's first season, Hope Valley was originally called Coal Valley. Social media questions about why the show isn't called “Coal Valley 1874” have gone unanswered; the reason may be as simple as the need for consistent and recognizable branding across the franchise. The initial press announcement acknowledged that the show will be about “the early days of the settlement that later becomes Hope Valley.”

In the initial press announcement about the new show, Hallmark Media head of programming Michelle Vicary said, “‘1874' gives us a wonderful opportunity to further explore the universe of ‘When Calls the Heart' and build a deeper world around this show for our devoted fans, who have helped make it one of the most successful and enduring series on television today. We're excited for the Hearties to join us as we tell this rich origin story filled with the kind of heart, community and hope they know and love.” 

Lenz will play Rebecca Clarke, “who travels from her home city of Chicago to the Western Canadian frontier with her 11-year-old-daughter. But when her wagon breaks down, she has no choice but to accept help from local rancher and confirmed bachelor, Tom Moore,” played by Ayres.

“Despite Rebecca's best intentions to remain unattached,” Hallmark's synopsis continues, “the future she dreams of for her and her daughter along with the people she meets in this fledgling town –including the guarded Tom and tenacious pioneer woman Hattie Quinn (played by Hennessy) – ultimately compel her to put down roots and make a fresh start.”



I love When Calls the Heart! Will the New Hope Valley be aired on The Hallmark Channel? I hope it will be!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but when When Calls the Heart premiered, the name of the town was Coal Valley and it was changed only in the aftermath of the mine disaster.

Disappointed that this will be on Hallmark+. Hoping it will be shown on Hallmark channel at a later date.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Big Brother' Fans React to Resurfaced Mickey Lee Clip After Her Passing","https://entertainmentnow.com/big-brother/fans-react-mickey-lee-passing-palm-reading/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:50:21 GMT","

“Big Brother” fans are mourning the sudden loss of Mickey Lee, and revisiting moments from her time in the house through a new, heartbreaking lens. After Lee's family announced that the 35-year-old season 27 star died on Christmas following flu complications, viewers resurfaced an old clip in which she casually discussed a palm reading from a fellow houseguest. A moment that once felt playful but is now being described by fans as “eerie” in hindsight.

After the passing of Mickey Lee, a “Big Brother” 27 clip has resurfaced that shows Lee discussing a palm reading she received from fellow houseguest Ava Pearl.

In the clip, Mickey says, “She was like, ‘This is the lifeline. Oh, it's kinda short.” Then Ashley Hollis added, “[Pearl] freaked out, Mickey's like, ‘Does that mean I'm going to die early?' She's like, ‘Um, you know… let me do Ashley's.'”

Mickey then added, “But then she also said that she was confused about the lines.”

While the houseguests are joking in the video and having fun during an HOH sleepover, fans were quick to jump on social media to share how eerie the clip is following Lee's unexpected death.

One fan wrote, “This is wild in hindsight. Rest in Power, Mickey. 💔 Gone too soon,” while another added, “I think Ava was being nice. Saying she didn't know the life line. Avas demeanor changed A LOT during those weeks. Idkkkkk.”

A third user wrote, “this is so devastating 🙁,” while a fourth one added, “Oh my gosh 😱.”

Another fan happened to show concern for Ava's well-being after the news of Lee's passing, saying, “Does anyone know how Ava is doing btw? Is she okay?”

According to Parade, Pearl did speak on her Instagram Story following Lee's death. Pearl said, “Was hoping for different news regarding Mickey, a genuine tragedy for anyone to pass as young as she did.”

Pearl went on to say, “Wishing her friends and family peace, respect, and privacy during this time. No matter what, we lost a member of the ‘Big Brother' family, and she will be missed.”

After her passing, Mickey's family started a GoFundMe page to help support them with medical expenses. It's close to raising the $45K goal.

On that page, the family explains that she recently suffered a sudden and devastating medical emergency. She experienced a series of cardiac arrests due to complications from the flu and has since transitioned, surrounded by loved ones.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:indiewire.com","7 Essential Brigitte Bardot Films Worth Revisiting After Her Death — Even If She'd (Probably) Hate That","https://www.indiewire.com/lists/brigitte-bardot-best-movies/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:32:43 GMT","

Brigitte Bardot just died at 91, and it's hard to imagine anything she would have liked less than a curated list of movie recommendations from her brief, inescapable film career. But to let the controversial French icon's death go by as yet another moment of her quiet, confused erasure would be to knowingly repeat a mistake audiences have made with Bardot countless times before. Love her, hate her, or lust after her, cinema's original and most contentious “cool girl” still deserves better.When Bardot abruptly exited the film business at age 39, she was an international sex symbol and one of the most famous faces in the fashion industry. Her retirement, following 1973's “The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot,” baffled audiences and was quietly rejected by the public imagination. In Hollywood, that denial was treated as permission to collapse the Bardot persona into a static set of visual signifiers, which were swiftly Americanized. The blond hair. The bangs. The (sometimes) bikini. Even as her filmography receded from view, Bardot saw her image endlessly copied and commodified. Her artistic essence was reduced to a repeatable French “look,” and the woman herself pivoted into animal activism.

The flattening of Bardot's talent didn't stop there. Instead, it intensified as the actress further rejected what made her famous, resulting in increasing strain with the art world over the last three decades. Born to wealthy parents in Paris, 1934, Bardot trained as a ballerina before becoming a model and actress as a teen. She appeared on the cover of “Elle” magazine as a fresh-faced brunette (yes, brunette!) and was soon recognized as an emblem of the jeune fille. That youthful, “clean girl” aesthetic rewired European style back then and laid the groundwork for the '50s/'60s mod chic we're still chasing in design today.

Bardot's entrance onto the film scene was an act of romantic, rich-girl defiance, too, one that hinged on her turning 18. Traveling to auditions, Bardot rebelled against her parents by dating Roger Vadim, then a director's assistant whom she met on a failed casting call. After reportedly threatening suicide during a brief forced separation from Vadim, Bardot convinced her parents to accept her future as an artist. The first of Bardot's four husbands, Vadim eventually cast her as Juliette Hardy in 1956's “And God Created Woman.” The filmmaker didn't sexualize his star so much as relocate erotic agency into her hands, and Bardot changed the cinematic framing of physical desire as a result.

The character of Juliette Hardy was a feminine force driven by so-called “masculine” urges, and Bardot's memorable portrayal — ethereal, emotionally detached, and energized rather than disgusted by the novelty of sex — had consequences that continue to ripple through film, gender, and politics today. Already successful but not yet seismic when she broke out 70 years ago, Bardot became a cultural symbol almost overnight. The international popularity of “And God Created Woman” allowed audiences around the globe to project a fantasy of European sexual freedom onto the real woman behind it, and Bardot's private life soon became tabloid fodder throughout France, the United States, and beyond.

In the actress' own writing (Bardot authored a memoir and several quasi-memoirs beginning in the 1990s), she reflected on a profound ambivalence toward feminism, fame, and family. She frequently described a sense of feeling wanted everywhere but belonging nowhere — free to be anyone but judged by everyone. An unattainable reflection of sexual mystique, Bardot is often compared to Marilyn Monroe, and she's acknowledged that both were exploited as young women in Hollywood. But if Monroe was a tragedy mourned at the movies, Bardot actively rejected the language of victimhood. Her withdrawal from film was never fully forgiven by the fans who didn't understand it, and you can view what followed as a deeply unlikable attempt to wrestle control of a mythic image far bigger than Bardot herself.

By the mid-1970s, Bardot had withdrawn from performing entirely, and she increasingly framed that alienation as a kind of moral clarity. In the process, the aging actress became mired in self-inflicted political controversy and was sharply criticized for her ultra-conservative, provocative talking points. Bardot was fined by the French government repeatedly for racist and hateful rhetoric. She later minimized sexual harassment during the height of the #MeToo movement, effectively aligning Bardot with a corner of discourse in stark contrast to the rebellious assertiveness she embodied on screen. 

That trajectory has made it easier to dismiss Bardot rather than reckon with her contradictions. But what's been lost in the repeated calls for her metaphorical dismissal is the degree to which Bardot's acting presence forever changed our understanding of female autonomy. What's more, we've missed her resistance to a tidy moral arc off-screen as an extension of that flawed legacy. At Bardot's most famous, her work didn't offer apology but friction-filled pleasure and unresolved playfulness. That tension is not incidental to her work. It is the work, and it deserves the layered reflection of any “serious” acting.

In the end, the woman synonymous with sexual liberation recoiled from global attention. The face that redefined desirability ultimately spent years fleeing visibility. That trajectory says as much about the culture that consumed Bardot as it does the icon herself, and revisiting these seven movies in the wake of her death isn't an act of absolution or nostalgia. It's an insistence on contending with women's complexity, however uncomfortable, and letting their imperfections pierce through to become poetry.

Listed in chronological order, seven essential feature films of Brigitte Bardot.

Shot in sunny Saint-Tropez (not far from where Bardot spent her final days in 2025), director Roger Vadim's debut follows Juliette Hardy (Bardot) as she ricochets between lovers, marriage, and rejection — refusing to organize her passion around punishment or repentance. She isn't a scandalous character because she's erotic. She's revolutionary because “And God Created Woman” refused to moralize her desire. Bardot behaves as if wanting is instinctual, not reward-based, and that seemingly obvious assumption about women subtly rewired film culture. The performance is raw, alluring, and executed without perceptible strategy. The result is a flirtatious tongue-tie of a film that made the public reaction to Bardot impossible to manage, but the censorship and backlash that followed were proof of her impact. Here, Bardot emerged both as a star and a problem Hollywood would spend years trying to solve.

Directed by Michel Boisrond, 1957's “La Parisienne” is a fizzy romantic comedy that stars Bardot as a naive yet calculating young woman navigating Parisian high society and political intrigue as the daughter of the French president. Breezy and knowingly lightweight, the film captures Bardot at the precise moment she was transforming her rumored sex appeal into silly charm that could sell tickets. She performs fame and femininity with impish delight here — appearing playful, coquettish, and increasingly aware of the gaze that surrounded and even preceded her by then. The role also shows how quickly autonomy can be stylized into something consumable, even as Bardot remains magnetic.

Jean-Luc Godard's exquisite “Contempt” from 1963 would indirectly look at the contradictions lesser Bardot films exposed, folding her ever-evolving reputation as a sex icon into a self-conscious meditation on art, commerce, and betrayal. The script unfolds during the collapse of both a marriage and a movie, and shot in widescreen color with aggressively composed primary hues, the film foregrounds Bardot's body even as it withholds access to her inner life. The final performance is emotionally opaque, even frustrating at points, and that tension isn't a failure so much as fuel. This is Bardot being used and critiqued simultaneously with a purpose, and discomfort is the point. “Contempt” doesn't see Godard rescue Bardot's warping ingénue image; he anatomizes it with exacting style.

In Louis Malle's “Viva Maria!,” Bardot stars opposite Jeanne Moreau as an opportunistic music hall performer out for a big adventure. The two women accidentally become revolutionaries alongside a strapping George Hamilton while traveling through a fictional Latin American country, and Bardot fully immerses herself in that theatrical fantasy. Her years of ballet as a young girl show immediately, and Bardot is funny and self-aware — having too much fun for any serious misunderstanding. Here, her liberation is still thrilling but it's also absurd. Malle gifts fans one of the few Bardot films that allowed the star to expand instead of slink and even produced some of the best photos of the actress ever taken.

In 1967's “Two Weeks in September” from filmmaker Serge Bourguignon, Bardot stars opposite Laurent Terzieff as a famous model who retreats to a seaside town in search of anonymity, only to drift into a fragile romance with a younger man. Desperate for privacy in a world that refused to grant it, the real Bardot embraced a premise that audiences interpreted as a kind of confession, even as the movie was badly received by critics and bombed at the box office. The result is pretty but palpably weary, foreshadowing the logic behind Bardot's eventual departure from film. It presents attraction itself as a kind of quiet violence but fails to achieve the meta impression made by the earlier “Contempt,” a sure sign that Bardot's grasp on her own persona was already slipping away five years before she quit.

By the time Bardot appeared opposite Sean Connery in “Shalako,” she was becoming a cookie-cutter movie star in a bad way. Transplanted into another Western framework she only sort of fit after “Viva Maria!,” Bardot was miscast by Edward Dmytryk not because she lacked the presence for a romantic gunslinger but because the film offered no language for her flavor of autonomy. Rather than diminishing Bardot, that mismatch quietly exposes the limits of global stardom in the late '60s, and Bardot comes out looking not neutral but stripped of her specificity. That's why “Shalako” best captures Hollywood's inability to understand her as one of its all-time greatest assets — with or without the cowboy hat.

A kind of anti-farewell for Bardot, her final film from 1973 is uncomfortable, unsentimental, and largely denied audiences the artistic grace note they wanted from the actress. In Nina Companeez's “The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot,” the star appears as an ensemble player in a bawdy historical farce about a sexually innocent young man (Francis Huster) and his belated awakening amid a kidnapping. Bardot is deliberately ungainly here, reinforcing her lifelong resistance to seeming palatable even as she's walking out the door. It's a shrugging kind of comedy from her, but also an indelible reminder that, for better or worse, Bardot rarely allowed her history to seem simple.

Rob Reiner, who tragically died along with his wife Michele earlier this month, will be remembered for making unforgettable movies that touched generations of viewers. And one of the best and most lasting is 1987's “The Princess Bride,” a fairytale farce about true love that turned leads Robin Wright and Cary Elwes into household names.

This week, Elwes — who was in his early 20s when he played Westley, the dashing but often hapless hero of the film — joined his co-stars and many of Reiner's other collaborators and colleagues in paying tribute to the filmmaker, actor, and philanthropist known for titles like “Stand by Me” and “When Harry Met Sally.” Like many who spoke out after the couple's alleged murder, Elwes described Reiner's warm personality and graciousness on set, something that often set him apart from other big names in the industry, as well as his willingness to take a chance on a young, relatively unknown actor.

“Enough time has passed that I can finally put my grief into words. I was 24 when I first met Rob Reiner on The Princess Bride. And from that very first meeting I fell in love with him. I was already a fan of his work so meeting him in person was a dream come true. As we began spending more time together I knew this was someone I wanted in my life. I also knew that by casting me as Westley he was giving me the keys to the castle,” the actor wrote in an Instagram post on December 29, adding that the first thing he noticed about the director was that “he wore his heart on his sleeve.” “This was a man who felt deeply. Whose heart was filled with love and compassion. He wasn't impressed by how much money you had or if you had a privileged upbringing. He just wanted to know if you were a ‘good guy.'”

In the post — which includes behind-the-scenes footage from the making of “The Princess Bride” as well as a snippet of the stars and director discussing the pioneering comedy on its 25th anniversary — Elwes also touched on how Reiner, the son of comedian and industry legend Carl Reiner, had an infectious appreciation for the filmmaking process. 

“He obviously loved making movies – and was clearly a brilliant filmmaker – but he told me what he really enjoyed the most was the experience itself. He used to say, ‘Once the movie is released it belongs to other people. But while you are making it, that's your time on the planet, so you wanna make it good.' And boy was my time with him on The Princess Bride beyond great. I can't remember a single day without laughter,” he wrote of the film, which was based on a 1973 romantasy novel by William Goldman.

Later in the post, Elwes, who was close with the Reiners, referred to the director meeting and falling in love with his future wife on the set of “When Harry Met Sally,” where she worked as a photographer. Praising her talent and passion for lifting others up, he wrote, “To say that they were a great team would be an understatement. Their only interest in fame was that it allowed them to shine a light on causes they believed in, especially helping those who were marginalized. In a town where many talk the talk, they truly walked it. 

 










“Whenever we got together we would talk about family, life, movies and politics. But without fail Rob would always find a way to make us laugh. That was important to him. Finding the joy,” he added. “And if I could make him laugh in return, I felt like I had won the lottery. His laugh was one of the greatest sounds I've ever known — so heartfelt it still rings in my ears.”

As the British actor — who went on to star in a string of ‘90s commercial and cult hits, including “Days of Thunder,” “Bram Stoker's Dracula,” “The Crush,” and “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” — closed his message, he referenced a line from the film that changed the course of his career. “Sure, death cannot stop true love but life is pain without you. ⚔️💔,” he wrote, invoking the message at the heart of “The Princess Bride.” 

In the hours and days following the Reiners' death on December 14, the people whose lives they touched, either directly or indirectly, expressed both heartbreak and gratitude for what they left behind. But many of those closest to the couple have taken time to process their thoughts and mourn in privacy. Given the immense legacy that Reiner alone forged, it's safe to assume that it will be a long time before the actors, writers, and directors who had the pleasure of working with him — along with the many people affected by his warmhearted films — will be finished reflecting on the once-in-a-lifetime cinematic personality.

	After Republican Congressman Tim Burchett likened Jack White to Wednesday Addams in a snarky social media post to gin up a reaction from MAGA supporters, the musician responded on Tuesday with a 384-word missive on Instagram. “The great state of Tennessee deserves better, Mr. Burchett, but you and your cult are too dug in and blinded to even realize it,” he said.


	Burchett's post, on Monday, retweeted a five-second clip of White saying, “Don't even think about listening to my music, you fascist.” In his response, White said that the video was AI-generated. The poster, @MAGAresponse, asked, “What's your response to Jack White?” The congressman, who reps a district in eastern Tennessee, replied on Monday,” That cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry.”


	White took the high road in his response. “Can you believe that a U.S. congressman, that's right, a CONGRESSMAN (from my state no less), a once hallowed and respected position in our society, would repost an A.I. generated video, containing a false comment that I never said and refuted (without researching that I might add) and like a 10-year-old on a playground, add to it attempted insults to my physical appearance?” the musician wrote. “What kind of joke are we all living in now? All of Trump's lackeys and bootlicks like this elected official are cowards that would never talk this way to anybody like me or you in person. Trump really lowered the bar when he brought his scourge to this government.”

	White's response criticized what he characterized as “sycophantic” politicians who lack dignity and “regurgitate … fake Christian(!) rhetoric.” He expressed a wish that “the average American conservative” could converse with people from other countries to learn “what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become.”

	











	Ultimately, he described Congressman Burchett, and those like him, as embarrassing. “I've said it before and I'll say it again: There will come a time in the future when none of these right wingers will admit to being a part of this cult from this time period,” he wrote. “All the MAGA hats will be in landfills and actual intelligent and honorable leadership will take their place. … I'm wondering if half of these so called representatives have ever actually read the Constitution that they pledged an oath to.”

	Although White did not tell MAGA supporters not to listen to his music, he has called Donald Trump “a disgusting, vile, egomaniac loser, child,” for the president's response to Rob Reiner's death, and has said that he considers Trump's insults a “badge of honor.”


	In an op-ed, Rolling Stone praised White's responses to Trump. “He's speaking truth to power and getting under the president's skin, and his punches are landing,” Senior Writer Angie Martoccio wrote. “We should listen to him now, more than ever.”

	At least three more events are no longer happening at the Kennedy Center after its board, which was handpicked by President Donald Trump, voted to rename the venue the Trump-Kennedy Center.


	New York Dance Company Doug Varone and Dancers announced that they would no longer bring their pre-scheduled performance to the institution in protest of the decision to rename the arts center.


	“It is financially devastating but morally exhilarating,” Varone told The New York Times in an email. (Varone did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.)


	Also on Monday, the Kennedy Center's website said two events set for New Year's Eve by the Cookers had also been canceled. While jazz band the Cookers did not immediately share the reason for the show cancellation, it came after jazz star Chuck Redd canceled his annual free concert, originally scheduled for Christmas Eve.


	Alabama folk singer Kristy Lee, who was set to perform a free show on Jan. 14, was also among the artists who pulled out. “I won't lie to you, canceling shows hurts,” she said in a Instagram post last week. “This is how I keep the lights on. But losing my integrity would cost me more than any paycheck. When American history starts getting treated like something you can ban, erase, rename, or rebrand for somebody else's ego, I can't stand on that stage and sleep right at night.”

	











	In a statement to Rolling Stone, Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell said, “The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership. Their actions prove that the previous team was more concerned about booking far left political activists rather than artists willing to perform for everyone regardless of their political beliefs. Boycotting the Arts to show you support the Arts is a form of derangement syndrome.” 

	











	The new cancellations arrive several days after Grenell threatened to take legal action against Redd for canceling the Christmas Eve show, calling his letter to the musician an “official notice” that the center would seek $1 million in damages for the “political stunt.”


	For more than 20 years, the Kennedy Center has hosted the Christmas Eve Jazz Jam, with Redd headlining the event since 2006. “When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd told the AP on Dec. 24.

	The cancellations mark another round of protests against the Kennedy Center after at least 26 performances were canceled earlier this year, including 15 by the scheduled acts themselves, in protest of Trump's self-appointment as chairman of the establishment. Issa Rae canceled a February show, citing “an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums.”

	Cary Elwes posted a lengthy tribute to Rob Reiner, celebrating the filmmaker for his “love and compassion.” The actor famously collaborated with Reiner on 1987 fantasy film The Princess Bride, which Reiner directed. 


	“Enough time has passed that I can finally put my grief into words,” Elwes wrote on Instagram. “I was 24 when I first met Rob Reiner on The Princess Bride.

Which is among the many reasons he was the perfect person to direct it.”

	











	Elwes also shared his memories of Reiner's wife, Michele Singer Reiner, who was stabbed to death alongside her husband on Dec. 14. Their 32-year-old son Nick has since been charged with their murders.


	“Besides being a gifted photographer she was an incredibly loving, intelligent person,” Elwes shared. “Deeply passionate about her family and about lifting others up. To say that they were a great team would be an understatement. Their only interest in fame was that it allowed them to shine a light on causes they believed in, especially helping those who were marginalized. In a town where many talk the talk, they truly walked it.”

He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room.”

New Mexico really can be out of this world.

 With high altitude, dark skies, and vast expanses populated by few people, it's no wonder that New Mexico has a longstanding history as a hotspot for stargazing, rocket launches, and possible UFO sightings.


 ""New Mexico's connection to space is woven into our landscape, our history, and our spirit of exploration,” says Lancing Adams, acting cabinet secretary of the New Mexico Tourism Department.


 One of the best ways to explore the Land of Enchantment's out-of-this-world history is by embarking on the New Mexico Space Trail. The road trip consists of 52 historic sites related to space—from ancient rock art to modern laboratories—that give insight and unique perspectives on the state's important role in the space industry.


 “Dating back to the 1990s, the development and promotion of the Space Trail has been an ongoing initiative of multiple organizations, including the New Mexico Museum of Space History, which continues to play a key role in space education in the State,” says Sheli Hinds Armstrong, director of space tourism for the SpaceValley Foundation and owner and CEO of Destination Southwest, based in New Mexico. 


 Here's what you need to know before planning a trip on New Mexico's Space Trail.

 There are about a dozen observatories scattered throughout New Mexico, so witnessing the stars, planets, and galaxies through a high-powered telescope is a must. The state's low levels of light pollution and vast open spaces make it perfect for stargazing. 


 Attend a free open house viewing session at The University of New Mexico Campus Observatory in Albuquerque or The Tombaugh Campus Observatory at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, to use a wide variety of telescopes. Or, head to the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science's planetarium for a guided tour of the night sky in the 55-foot full-dome theater.


 The Magdalena Ridge Observatory in Socorro hosts Enchanted Skies Star Parties that include a tour of the observatory and professional astronomers, who explain what attendees are seeing in the sky. Visit the Sunspot Solar Observatory to get an up-close look at the sun via the Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope. Another point of interest is the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array, which has 27 82-foot-wide radio antennas. 


 There are a variety of space museums in New Mexico that cover everything from planetary science to the Atomic Age. The free Bradbury Science Museum, at Los Alamos Laboratory, features interactive exhibits regarding the Manhattan Project that led to the creation of the first atomic bomb.


 In Albuquerque, The National Museum of Nuclear Science and History provides information and education about nuclear weapons and features Heritage Park—a nine-acre outdoor exhibit with defunct rockets, missiles, and bombs. 


 For a broader history of space, visit the New Mexico Museum of Space History in Alamogordo. Here, you can see astronaut and rocket artifacts, hear the roar of a rocket engine, and see enormous rockets at the Air and Space Park.


 UFO enthusiasts will want to stop in Roswell, best known for two alleged crash sites that date back to 1947. Conspiracy theorists believe extraterrestrials were pulled from the wreckage, but the government maintains that it was simply a fallen weather balloon filled with anthropomorphic dummies. 


 The most comprehensive information about UFO and alien sightings in the area can be found at the International UFO Museum & Research Center in Roswell. It has historic photographs, audio recordings, videos, informational placards, and representations of aliens and spaceships.


 New Mexico is home to many sites focused on World War II and the Cold War era—a time period during which the Space Race and the nuclear arms race took place between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. 


 Once a year, in October, visitors can attend an open house at the Trinity Site—where the first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945. It's part of the White Sands Missile Range, an active United States Army facility, known as the ""Birthplace of America's Missile and Space Activity."" Learn more about U.S. missile development and testing, and walk through the outdoor display of missiles and rockets, at the White Sands Missile Range Museum. But New Mexico's role in aerospace isn't just a thing of the past, as is evident at Spaceport America—the world's first facility designed for commercial suborbital space travel. 


 Records of astronomical events date back thousands of years, and you can see ancient renderings created by the ancestral Pueblo people at Chaco Culture National Historic Park. There are both pictographs and petroglyphs, including a well-known drawing of a supernova. The Three Rivers Petroglyphs Site features more than 21,000 petroglyphs, accessible via a hiking trail.

 Since the Space Trail crisscrosses the state, pick the sites you would like to see the most (there are 52 after all), and map out your route. You'll need to factor in things like the distance between points of interest, which sites require reservations, and how much time you'd like to spend at each. Some parts of the state do not have reliable cell service, so it's a good idea to print out a map with directions before hitting the road.

 New Mexico is largely a high-desert environment, which can mean triple-digit temperatures and monsoon rain in the summer months. Fall is the ideal time to take on a Space Trail road trip, with cooler weather, colorful fall foliage, fewer crowds, and the ExxonMobil Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta—the largest in the world—held annually in October.

 Albuquerque is the largest city in New Mexico and is also home to the Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ). The city is known for the historic Old Town, the annual hot air balloon festival, and the scenic Sandia Peak Tramway. For a chic stay, I recommend Hotel Andaluz, Hotel Chaco, or the new Arrive Albuquerque. Grab a bite to eat at a retro diner on Route 66, such as The Range Café or 66 Diner, or try authentic New Mexico cuisine at Church Street Cafe. Stop by Sawmill Market for a food hall experience or Itality, the only Indigenous, woman-owned, plant-based eatery in the city.


 Known for its world-class art galleries, historic Santa Fe Plaza, and Spanish-Pueblo Revival architecture, the capital city of Santa Fe offers luxury lodging at The Inn of Five The Graces and the Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado. The vibrant culinary scene includes restaurants such as Terra, The Pink Adobe, and Cafecito in the Railyard District


 Toas is most notable for its Taos Pueblo community and its downtown Historic District. It is home to the newly opened Hotel Willa with the on-site Juliette restaurant serving seasonal New Mexico cuisine. Picks up snacks for the road at Cid's Food Market and snag a reservation at The Love Apple.


 In the small alien-themed town of Roswell, you'll mostly find small motel options, such as the Roswell Inn. For a truly immersive experience, just outside of town, spend the night in an underground bunker attached to a 180-feet-deep Atlas F nuclear ballistic missile silo. Make time to sample local wines and cuisine at Pecos Flavors Winery & Bistro.


 Soak in geothermal hot springs baths in Truth or Consequences, at hotels such as the Sierra Grande, Hoosier Hot Springs & Inn, or Mothership Yoga Lounge & Hot Springs. For the best pizza in town, head to Outer Edge Pizzeria and swing by Passion Pie Cafe for delicious pastries and freshly brewed coffee.

UFO disclosure is no longer a fringe topic, and it is not going away. According to longtime researcher and filmmaker L.A. Marzulli, the conversation has reached a tipping point. “It's here. It's happening. And it's now,” Marzulli said in a recent reaction video, warning that the global push toward disclosure is unfolding “in real time,” not in the distant future.

Marzulli's recent reaction video centers on the new film Disclosure Day, which he believes is less entertainment and more ideological groundwork. 

The movie repeatedly frames “full disclosure” as a moral necessity, suggesting the world has a right to know the truth all at once. That framing, Marzulli argues, is intentional. “People have a right to know the truth,” the film declares. Marzulli's response is pointed: “But what truth are we going to hear? Whose truth will we hear?”

Throughout his breakdown of the movie's trailer, Marzulli highlights imagery he believes is doing heavy theological lifting. Scenes of altered consciousness, possession-like behavior and religious symbolism are not incidental.

“There's no way around that,” he said of one scene depicting a woman losing control of her faculties. “That's possession. She no longer is in possession of her faculties.” He also noted the film's use of Catholic imagery, saying it subtly suggests that faith can be reinterpreted to accommodate non-human entities. “They're already spinning this thing within a certain theological framework,” he said.

More broadly, Marzulli rejects the film's assumption that alleged non-human intelligences are benevolent extraterrestrials. “They're not from Zeta Reticuli,” he said. “They're gods with little g's. They are the fallen angels with a very nefarious agenda.”

He ties this directly to biblical prophecy, warning that such revelations could trigger what Scripture calls a great falling away. “When they reveal themselves, that's the game changer,” Marzulli said. “And we are being set up for it.”

The push for disclosure is shaping how people think, believe and interpret reality. As governments, media and entertainment move in lockstep, discernment matters more than ever. Pay attention to the world around you. Deception rarely announces itself. It hides in plain sight, often where we are told to look for truth.

Although TV Westerns generally aim to depict the American West in realistic terms, the past decade has seen a subgenre develop which places overtly supernatural phenomena in a Western setting. The supernatural Western isn't actually a 21st century invention, but it's an innovative spin on the genre that's become increasingly commonplace in recent television.

For well over half a century, various landmark Western movies have featured supernatural elements, from Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter to Alejandro Jodorowsky's countercultural classic El Topo. Yet, it was typically something that previous generations of Western TV shows didn't incorporate into their storylines.

Midway through the 2010s, however, several small-screen Westerns began to factor the supernatural into their plots. In fact, some of the best neo-Western TV shows across major streaming platforms have fantasy genre tropes built into their premises. Without their supernatural setups, these groundbreaking series wouldn't be nearly as entertaining.

The supernatural Western is now an integral part of the television genre. Alongside sci-fi Westerns such as Westworld and Fallout, it's expanded the frontiers of the Wild West far beyond the traditions of Matt Dillon and Rowdy Yates, in more weird and wonderful directions than viewers could have possibly imagined in days gone by.

 Arguably the first ever fantasy Western TV show, Four Feather Falls was the creation of Thunderbirds puppeteer Gerry Anderson and his musical collaborator Barry Gray. Made for kids in the UK, this 39-episode series is a jaunty singalong about Sheriff Tex Tucker, who's been conferred magical powers through the feathers given to him by a tribal chief.

Like Western TV's longest-running show, Gunsmoke, Four Feather Falls is set in Old Kansas, and it apes the tone and visual style of this classic TV Western, albeit in the form of singing puppets. The show's formal limitations may be somewhat dated over six decades later, but it remains pioneering and immensely enjoyable work of children's television.

The TV adaptation of Quentin Tarantino's From Dusk Till Dawn, this Western horror series blends supernatural mythology from Mesoamerica with the genre's traditional tales of outlaws and lawmen. It makes for a frenetic and frightening vampire story, in which the 1996 movie's director Robert Rodriguez had a major hand.

From Dusk Till Dawn works better as a TV show with various slow-burning, subtly interwoven subplots, than as a single, incoherent feature film. The series also upgrades the design of the Culebras at the center of the movie's plot, turning them into some of the most gruesome monsters ever to appear on the small screen.

Another horror-inflected supernatural TV Western, Preacher differs considerably from the comic book series it's based on, yet still managed to win over fans of its source material with scintillating storytelling and an unabashed indulgence in the macabre. Dominic Cooper is sensational as the titular wayward preacher, while the show offers up at least two of the Western genre's best villains.

As well as the direct homage that names like Jesse Custer, Cassidy, Tulip, and William Munny pay to legendary figures of the Old West, Preacher's characterizations are very much in the tradition of the genre. From its central antihero, Custer, to its spirited female lead, O'Hare, the show isn't shy about showcasing its influences.

Prime Video's Outer Range may be this decade's best sci-fi Western, but its liberal application of science leans heavily on supernatural phenomena. The series stars Josh Brolin as a rancher struggling to hold onto his family's homestead in Wyoming. So far, so Western, until a mysterious black void appears on his land.

Outer Range cleverly plays on the rugged wilderness of a typical Western setting to introduce outlandish sci-fi tropes into an otherwise grounded frontier tale. The show's careful balance between its foundation in classic cowboy stories and its supernatural conceit works superbly for fans of both genres.

Wynonna Earp is now a cult-classic fantasy show that's likely to continue growing in stature for years to come. It tells the story of sharp-shooting 19th century lawman Wyatt Earp's fictional descendant, who inherits his famous Colt revolver and is tasked with slaying the ghosts of his outlaw adversaries.

Even beyond this fantastical premise, though, Wynonna Earp breaks the mold for TV Westerns in so many ways. There's the show's gunslinging female hero, the LGBTQ+ subplots it works into storylines, and its conscious effort to be relatable for teenage viewers. If ever the supernatural Western subgenre served a higher purpose, it was here.

While Dark Winds is primarily a Western noir crime drama, the show's deliberate inclusion of supernatural elements based on Navajo folklore is key to its underlying themes. Despite the Ye'iitsoh monster proving to be a man in Dark Winds season 3, this terrifying specter retains its symbolic importance.

Joe Leaphorn's visions of supernatural phenomena hold allegorical significance both for the plot of Dark Winds, and for the role of Joe's tribal heritage in his work. More broadly, the series styles itself as a supernatural Western to highlight the cultural value of First Nations mythology in the modern-day United States.

LAS VEGAS (FOX5) — A Discovery Channel TV star says he used his “supernatural ability” to find out his cellmate was a predator before killing him, an arrest report says.

Chad Ollinger, 41, is accused of killing his cellmate on Dec. 26 after the evening meal at the Clark County Detention Center. According to an arrest report from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the victim was identified as Christopher Kelly.

The report says an officer discovered Kelly unresponsive while making rounds for medication. Ollinger was his cellmate and told police Kelly “was not feeling well.” Police entered the cell and found Kelly with blood on his face. Medical arrived and pronounced him deceased. Ollinger was placed in a temporary holding cell while police investigated.

Police said they took photographs of the cell and Kelly's body. When it was time to photograph Ollinger's injuries, he told officers, “good luck cracking the case.”

Officers interviewed nearby inmates in other cells. According to the arrest report, they told police they heard a fight, and someone was screaming for their life. One inmate said they heard someone scream, “they're beating me, they're killing me... help me.”

Police interviewed Ollinger. He told police he suffers from memory loss because of previous trauma, and he was not able to remember recent memories of his life. He said he does not have a mental illness, does not take medication, and was not diagnosed with memory loss. He said he did not ingest any drugs or alcohol.

He told police he must have done something traumatic to Kelly that caused the memory loss.

According to the arrest report, Ollinger said he had a “supernatural ability” to read people and know things about them. He said, “If I know something about somebody that's bad, I take care of it.”

The report says his ability told him Kelly was a predator and he had a “responsibility” to identify predators because he had his own children taken away from him. Other than this ability, he told police he had no proof Kelly was a pedophile.

He said Kelly's killing was not planned and it was spontaneous. According to the report, he said when he begins to “know” things, something “snaps.” He said he felt no emotion when he killed Kelly and said he did not care if he went to prison for the rest of his life.

Ollinger said Kelly screamed for help as he strangled him for about four to five minutes. After he died, he said he put him on the bottom bunk. He told police Kelly's bed was the top bunk, but he couldn't lift him there.

Ollinger found fame on The Discovery Channel's show, “Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch.”

Jail records from Clark County show that Ollinger has been in jail since October. He was sentenced for the contempt charge on December 18. The records show he was scheduled for release on January 12, 2026.

The arrest report says Ollinger was rebooked for open murder. He is scheduled in court for a hearing Tuesday.

DEAR BONNIE: My question to you as a medium is, do atmospheric happenings affect you? Do you feel more energy or see more divine activity in your work? I guess I am asking if a medium would feel these happenings (like eclipses, auroras , earthquakes) in their “center” and would it affect them when giving a reading. Thanks, Jason

DEAR JASON: We are all energy, and everything in the energetic world can affect all of us. I know a full moon with its intense energy will keep me from sleeping all night. I will meditate before bed to help calm my energy. It is how each of us reacts to certain situations. I know that some people in my own family feel that the last snowstorm hit them hard energetically to the point of being depressed and almost angry. When you are expecting one thing and get another, it can throw off your mood, thoughts, and happiness, affecting your energy. Then, others were elated that they had one more chance to stay home, cuddle up with a book, and enjoy one last snowstorm of the season.

Since we are all made up of energy centers called chakras and many events and situations can affect these centers, the weather and atmospheric changes could affect many people.

Could these atmospheric changes potentially affect a medium's ‘center' and their abilities during readings? I believe that if a medium is adept at “centering” their energy and grounding themselves to Mother Earth, their readings will remain unaffected. Personally, when I feel energetically off, I seek assistance from my spirit team to ensure the quality of my mediumship readings for that day would not be affected.

The veil between the two worlds is thinner than at other times, such as Halloween. I would not believe this if I did not know this to be true, but I know without a doubt that delivering messages gets easier as the veil gets thinner and thinner. With more people tuning into their spiritual side and higher consciousness, messages from the other side will become easier to access and more attainable for all of us.

Mediums will know how to adjust to these changes, and any time should be a suitable time to seek guidance and messages from the other side without the worry if the medium “center” is going to be affected by the astrological events in the world. If you feel your energy is off during these times, seek out a meditation for grounding and centering your energy centers, and this should help any feeling of unrest while making you feel secure.

Republican leaders are speaking out against narratives surrounding Melissa Hortman's death following her assassination last June. FOX 9's Soyoung Kim has the story on why they feel speaking out now is important.

(FOX 9) - Republican lawmakers are speaking out debunking some of the narratives surrounding late Representative Melissa Hortman's death, saying they felt a responsibility to address them.

The backstory:

In what authorities call a politically-motivated attack, two state lawmakers and their spouses were shot in June.

Late state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman were killed. Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were injured.

What we know:

Hortman was well-respected by many for her leadership and ability to work across the aisle. Hortman was the top Democrat in the Minnesota House.

""She wore her emotions on her sleeve because she genuinely cared. Even though we disagreed about the best way to care for Minnesotans, her heart was 100% in it, and everybody should strive to lead in that fashion,"" said Sen. Julia Coleman (R-Waconia).

""Melissa was a good leader. I disagreed with her politically. I don't think we ever voted the same. She had a strong love for Minnesota. She had a strong love for the institution of the Legislature,"" said Rep. Kristin Robbins (R-Maple Grove).

What they're saying:

It has been more than six months since Hortman was killed in what authorities said was a politically-motivated attack in her home. Now, some theories surrounding her murder have been circulating online.

""I saw yet another X or Twitter social media personality share this conspiracy theory that Melissa Hortman was murdered either because of a vote she took at the end of the special session, or she was terrified and knew it was coming. Something along the lines that she was tied into the fraud. Or the most disgusting one I've seen yet is that somehow Governor Walz was involved,"" said Coleman.

""I just think it's a very harmful narrative. And we all have a responsibility to say it's not true,"" said Robbins.

Coleman and Robbins were some of the state lawmakers to speak out publicly against these narratives. They said it was important to step up in this moment standing in solidarity not just as elected leaders, but as fellow Minnesotans.

""This is not a left or right issue. This is not about politics. This is about American values,"" said Robbins.

""I would ask other people to call it out where they see it as well,"" said Coleman.

What's next:

The man accused of Hortman's murder, Vance Boelter, is currently awaiting trial. He is facing state and federal charges.

Hundreds have poured in.","https://www.nola.com/news/politics/why-louisiana-is-collecting-reports-of-chemtrails/article_5c676c6b-25dd-4107-b5ca-203fc8962dff.html","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","









The reports are alarming.

Angry residents say the Louisiana skies are being sprayed with chemicals, creating “tic-tac-toe” shapes up above, or in one case, an “Acura logo.”

The supposed culprit: Chemtrails, a long-debunked conspiracy theory that scientists say is not accurate.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, the state agency charged with regulating the state's expansive petrochemical industry, among other sectors, has collected more than 400 such reports since just this summer, when the Republican-led Legislature passed a bill requiring them to track such reports.

A handful of Republican state lawmakers have encouraged their constituents to write in, propping up the conspiracy theory that the condensation trails airplanes leave behind are, in fact, dangerous chemicals or heavy metals.

The new law passed by the Legislature did more than require LDEQ to collect such reports. It also banned climate geoengineering and cloud seeding, which are real technologies designed to combat climate change or generate greater precipitation for agricultural or other purposes. Neither are used in Louisiana, according to state and federal regulators.

The debate about chemtrails among state lawmakers prompted a clash over longstanding farming practices, nascent climate technology and outright conspiracies. And as a result, the state environmental regulator is now required to collect reports of such alleged activities.

Records show that more than 400 of the reports received by LDEQ allege that condensation trails long left by airplanes are the long-debunked “chemtrails.”

“This garbage has been going on here for years,” one resident reported to the state system. “At some point We the People need a Say about this.....We are being poisoned and Our tax dollars are funding this.”

Another resident in Metairie in October wrote, “Very typical aerial dispersions of aerosols in lines or trails … some in straight lines, some in long narrow crosses and one in the shape similar to the auto emblem for an Acura vehicle. As usual they remained in place and gradually spread out to form cloudlike areas. Some shut off at certain points as the valve was turned off on the tank that was being utilized.”

This summer, President Donald Trump's administration sought to dispel the chemtrails theory and published webpages addressing chemtrail conspiracy theories and explaining how condensation trails work.

The Environmental Protection Agency calls chemtrails “a term some people use to inaccurately claim that contrails resulting from routine air traffic are actually an intentional release of dangerous chemicals or biological agents at high altitudes for a variety of nefarious purposes, including population control, mind control, or attempts to geoengineer Earth or modify the weather.”

Still, the EPA's efforts have not dissuaded at least one state lawmaker. State Sen. Valarie Hodges, a Denham Springs Republican, recently told residents to report sightings of “chemtrails” to the state. That advice appears to have prompted an uptick in reports. Hodges didn't respond to messages for this story.

“Have you noticed strange white trails crisscrossing our skies lately? Many residents across our state are reporting heavy chemtrails, contrails, geoengineering, and cloud-seeding activity — and now there's a new Louisiana law addressing it,” Hodges posted on Facebook, prompting hundreds of comments. “Our skies belong to We the People, not to corporations, contractors, or agencies experimenting with our weather. Let's document, report, and demand transparency.”

Louisiana for decades had a process for permitting cloud seeding, a practice of releasing tiny silver iodide particles into clouds to enhance precipitation. It is used in nine mostly arid states, but it was never used here, likely because Louisiana has abundant rainfall.

A handful of studies have suggested silver iodide is not harmful, though questions remain about whether the prolonged use and accumulation of the compound may cause health or environmental problems.

Jennifer Finley, spokesperson for the state Department of Agriculture and Forestry, said, “No license was ever issued under the law just repealed.”

The state's new law also bans solar geoengineering, a technology that does exist but is still in its infancy. It's a highly contentious source of debate among climate scientists and advocates, some of whom believe that spraying compounds high into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight could help mitigate the effects of climate change. Louisiana has felt the effects of climate change particularly acutely, with worsening hurricanes, rising heat-related deaths and more.

A 2016 study surveying the world's leading atmospheric scientists debunked the theory that “chemtrails” are harmful chemicals being released from high-flying aircraft. Surveys have found a small share of Americans believe in the theory, which the study's co-author Steven Davis said grew with widespread adoption of the internet. Davis said at the time that the study is important to establish basic scientific facts, like refuting the chemtrails theory.

State Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, sponsored the bill to ban cloud seeding and climate geoengineering. The bill removed the state's ability to permit cloud seeding activities and required LDEQ to receive and monitor reports of alleged spraying of chemicals into the air at over 1,000 feet. Fesi declined interview requests for this story.

Throughout the legislative debate, Fesi repeated debunked theories that people are spraying hazardous chemicals in Louisiana to modify the weather or climate, though he offered no evidence. Republicans easily passed the measure into law, over the objections of Democrats who noted that much of the debate centered around the debunked “chemtrails” theory.

Meagan Molter, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Quality, said the agency didn't ask for the bill and that the new law doesn't require the agency to do anything other than receive the reports.

With a real environmental hazard, like a chemical spill, the agency follows up on reports and responds to the hazard. But the new “chemtrails” reports are simply logged in the system.

“These are strictly for data collection,” Molter said. “It does not interfere with our daily regular duties we have by law to go and investigate things that are actually in our purview, like spills. We have a team whose whole job is to take these calls and reports and go out and investigate.”

The agency set up a separate system to receive reports of chemtrails and has tried to make clear to residents that they should report oil spills or other emergencies through normal channels.

“It is our job to take any and all reports from concerned citizens,” she said.

Previous research on the effect of wolves on the food web has been criticized, raising questions about the predator's role in the Yellowstone ecosystem.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Over the last three decades, Yellowstone National Park has undergone an ecological cascade. As elk numbers fell, aspen and willow trees thrived. This, in turn, allowed beaver numbers to increase, creating new habitats for fish and birds.

The shift has largely been attributed to the reintroduction of wolves to the park — as predators, they helped control the elk numbers. But their return may not have reshaped the entire ecosystem in the way that scientists thought, and has sparked a fierce debate among scientists over exactly why and how Yellowstone has rebounded.

According to a study published in January, the reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) in the 1990s created a trophic cascade — a chain reaction in the food web — that benefitted the entire ecosystem. The study linked wolves in the area to a reduction in the elk population, which in turn reduced browsing and allowed willow trees to grow. Between 2001 and 2020, this led to a 1,500% increase in crown volume, the total space filled by upper branches of the willows.

But now, scientists have written a response letter to the editor, published in Oct. 13 in the journal Global Ecology and Conservation, in which they argue that the original study's methodology was flawed, and that Yellowstone wolves' effect on willow shrubs is not so clear.

Large predators were targeted in Yellowstone from the end of the 1800s. By the 1920s, wolves were largely extinct from the park. Their disappearance created an ecological imbalance — the elk population exploded, which decimated plant populations and in turn threatened beavers, among other impacts. This is known as a trophic cascade, where the removal of one species causes ripples throughout the food web.

While the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone has led to changes within the park, the authors of the response letter claim the original study reinterpreted existing data to fit an oversimplified story.

The study converted willow height measurements collected and published by another research group into a metric called crown volume, response author Daniel MacNulty, a wildlife ecologist at Utah State University, told Live Science in an email. Crown volume was used as a proxy for willow size, meant to capture the shrub's entire three-dimensional growth more than simply measuring its height.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

""Because crown volume was built directly from height, [the study] only showed that height predicts height,"" MacNulty said. ""They did not reveal anything new about how willow growth changed after wolf reintroduction.""

The response letter suggests other inconsistencies in data analysis, like comparing willow measurements from different locations across years. This is problematic because it shows a misleading time series of willow growth, and MacNulty's research group has previously published research noting sampling biases in other studies supporting this same trophic cascade theory.

""There is substantial scientific evidence of a definitive effect of wolf recovery on the rest of the Yellowstone ecosystem,"" MacNulty said, like wolves increasing the supply of carrion to bears, coyotes, eagles and other meat-eating species. But the effect of wolves on vegetation is less clear because it operates through the decline of elk populations, which wolves were likely not solely responsible for. As MacNulty points out, humans, grizzly bears and cougars also hunt elk. ""A major problem with the simple trophic cascade story is that it ignores the role of these other predators.""

William Ripple, an Oregon State University wildlife ecologist and author of the original paper, stands by the original conclusions of the paper, maintaining that a large carnivore, elk, and willow trophic cascade occurred in Yellowstone. ""Our methods are sound, the modeling approach is standard,"" Ripple told Live Science in an email. ""So we reject the idea that there are fatal flaws.""

The debate about Yellowstone wolves and the impact of their reintroduction goes beyond this study and the latest response. While scientists widely agree that there is a trophic cascade in Yellowstone, its strength — and which predators are most responsible for it — form the center of the disagreement, MacNulty said.

Some scientists argue the story is more complex. ""There are reasons other than trophic cascades by which carnivores and plants can be positively associated,"" Jake Goheen, a wildlife ecologist at Iowa State University told Live Science in an email. Goheen, who was not involved in the research or response, said he doesn't believe that the authors of the original study provided enough evidence to support their conclusion that reintroducing wolves in Yellowstone caused a strong trophic cascade that affected willows.

""There is a growing body of literature at this point that has scrutinized the hypothesized cascade in Yellowstone,"" Goheen said. He adds that this does not mean there's no wolf-to-elk-to-willow trophic cascade in Yellowstone, only that the evidence presented so far is not clear enough.

—Yellowstone holds potentially untapped cache of 'carbon-free' helium for rockets, reactors and superconductors

—We finally know where the Yellowstone volcano will erupt next

—Yellowstone's 'queen of the wolves' killed by rival pack after living to 11 years old and having 10 litters of pups

To establish a clear trophic cascade from Yellowstone wolf reintroduction to willows, researchers would need to account for other predators and herbivores, said MacNulty. The ideal study would then analyze how much more total willow biomass there is now compared with before wolf introduction, to identify the strength of the effect; then calculate how much of that increase can be attributed solely to wolves, to identify its cause.

Ripple and his research team are now preparing a detailed reply, which explains that criticisms of the original study come from misunderstandings of what they did, Ripple said. ""The basic scientific logic of the paper is solid,"" Ripple said.

Conservation priorities might be fueling the controversy over large carnivores' beneficial effects on ecosystems, said Goheen, adding that even if wolves are not definitively causing a trophic cascade to willows, they are still important to conserve.

Researchers are developing a real-life tractor beam, with the goal of pulling defunct satellites out of geostationary orbit to alleviate the space junk problem.

In science fiction films, nothing raises tension quite like the good guys' spaceship getting caught in an invisible tractor beam that allows the baddies to slowly reel them in. But what was once only a sci-fi staple could soon become a reality.

Scientists are developing a real-life tractor beam, dubbed an electrostatic tractor. This tractor beam wouldn't suck in helpless starship pilots, however. Instead, it would use electrostatic attraction to nudge hazardous space junk safely out of Earth orbit.

The stakes are high: With the commercial space industry booming, the number of satellites in Earth's orbit is forecast to rise sharply. This bonanza of new satellites will eventually wear out and turn the space around Earth into a giant junkyard of debris that could smash into working spacecraft, plummet to Earth, pollute our atmosphere with metals and obscure our view of the cosmos. And, if left unchecked, the growing space junk problem could hobble the booming space exploration industry, experts warn.

The science is pretty much there, but the funding is not.

The electrostatic tractor beam could potentially alleviate that problem by safely moving dead satellites far out of Earth orbit, where they would drift harmlessly for eternity.

While the tractor beam wouldn't completely solve the space junk problem, the concept has several advantages over other proposed space debris removal methods, which could make it a valuable tool for tackling the issue, experts told Live Science.

A prototype could cost millions, and an operational, full-scale version even more. But if the financial hurdles can be overcome, the tractor beam could be operational within a decade, its builders say.

""The science is pretty much there, but the funding is not,"" project researcher Kaylee Champion, a doctoral student in the Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), told Live Science.

 




The tractor beams depicted in ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" suck up spacecraft via artificial gravity or an ambiguous ""energy field."" Such technology is likely beyond anything humans will ever achieve. But the concept inspired Hanspeter Schaub, an aerospace engineering professor at CU Boulder, to conceptualize a more realistic version.

Schaub first got the idea after the first major satellite collision in 2009, when an active communications satellite, Iridium 33, smashed into a defunct Russian military spacecraft, Kosmos 2251, scattering more than 1,800 pieces of debris into Earth's orbit.

In the wake of this disaster, Schaub wanted to be able to prevent this from happening again. To do this, he realized you could pull spacecraft out of harm's way by using the attraction between positively and negatively charged objects to make them ""stick"" together.

Over the next decade, Schaub and colleagues refined the concept. Now, they hope it can someday be used to move dead satellites out of geostationary orbit (GEO) — an orbit around Earth's equator where an object's speed matches the planet's rotation, making it seem like the object is fixed in place above a certain point on Earth. This would then free up space for other objects in GEO, which is considered ""prime real estate"" for satellites, Schaub said.

 




The electrostatic tractor would use a servicer spacecraft equipped with an electron gun that would fire negatively charged electrons at a dead target satellite, Champion told Live Science. The electrons would give the target a negative charge while leaving the servicer with a positive charge. The electrostatic attraction between the two would keep them locked together despite being separated by 65 to 100 feet (20 to 30 meters) of empty space, she said.

Once the servicer and target are ""stuck together,"" the servicer would be able to pull the target out of orbit without touching it. Ideally, the defunct satellite would be pulled into a ""graveyard orbit"" more distant from Earth, where it could safely drift forever, Champion said.

The electrostatic attraction between the two spacecraft would be extremely weak, due to limitations in electron gun technology and the distance by which the two would need to be separated to prevent collisions, project researcher Julian Hammerl, a doctoral student at CU Boulder, told Live Science. So the servicer would have to move very slowly, and it could take more than a month to fully move a single satellite out of GEO, he added.

That's a far cry from movie tractor beams, which are inescapable and rapidly reel in their prey. This is the ""main difference between sci-fi and reality,"" Hammerl said.

 




The electrostatic tractor would have one big advantage over other proposed space junk removal methods, such as harpoons, giant nets and physical docking systems: It would be completely touchless.

""You have these large, dead spacecraft about the size of a school bus rotating really fast,"" Hammerl said. ""If you shoot a harpoon, use a big net or try to dock with them, then the physical contact can damage the spacecraft and then you are only making the [space junk] problem worse.""

Scientists have proposed other touchless methods, such as using powerful magnets, but enormous magnets are both expensive to produce and would likely interfere with a servicer's controls, Champion said.

Related: How do tiny pieces of space junk cause incredible damage?

The main limitation of the electrostatic tractor is how slowly it would work. More than 550 satellites currently orbit Earth in GEO, but that number is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades.

If satellites were moved one at a time, then a single electrostatic tractor wouldn't keep pace with the number of satellites winking out of operation. Another limitation of the electrostatic tractor is that it would work too slowly to be practical for clearing smaller pieces of space junk, so it wouldn't be able to keep GEO completely free of debris.

Cost is the other big obstacle. The team has not yet done a full cost analysis for the electrostatic tractor, Schaub said, but it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars. However, once the servicer were in space, it would be relatively cost-effective to operate it, he added.

 




The researchers are currently working on a series of experiments in their Electrostatic Charging Laboratory for Interactions between Plasma and Spacecraft (ECLIPS) machine at CU Boulder. The bathtub-sized, metallic vacuum chamber, which is equipped with an electron gun, allows the team to ""do unique experiments that almost no one else can currently do"" in order to simulate the effects of an electrostatic tractor on a smaller scale, Hammerl said.

Once the team is ready, the final and most challenging hurdle will be to secure funding for the first mission, which is a process they have not yet started.

Most of the mission cost would come from building and launching the servicer. However, the researchers would ideally like to launch two satellites for the first tests, a servicer and a target that they can maneuver, which would give them more control over their experiments but also double the cost.

If they can somehow wrangle that funding, a prototype tractor beam could be operational in around 10 years, the team previously estimated.

 




While tractor beams may sound like a pipe dream, experts are optimistic about the technology.

""Their technology is still in the infancy stage,"" John Crassidis, an aerospace scientist at the University at Buffalo in New York, who is not involved in the research, told Live Science in an email. ""But I am fairly confident it will work.""

If you shoot a harpoon, use a big net or try to dock with them, then the physical contact can damage the spacecraft and then you are only making the [space junk] problem worse.

Removing space junk without touching it would also be much safer than any current alternative method, Crassidis added.

The electrostatic tractor ""should be able to produce the forces necessary to move a defunct satellite"" and ""certainly has a high potential to work in practice,"" Carolin Frueh, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University in Indiana, told Live Science in an email. ""But there are still several engineering challenges to be solved along the way to make it real-world-ready.""

—World's largest communication satellite is a photobombing menace, astronomers warn

—Chinese scientists call for plan to destroy Elon Musk's Starlink satellites

—Geomagnetic storm sends 40 SpaceX satellites plummeting to Earth

Scientists should continue to research other possible solutions, Crassidis said. Even if the CU Boulder team doesn't create a ""final product"" to remove nonfunctional satellites, their research will provide a stepping stone for other scientists, he added.

If they are successful, it wouldn't be the first time scientists turned fiction into fact.

""What is today's science fiction could be tomorrow's reality,"" Crassidis said.

      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are diverse and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed cases, along with the perspectives of various Redditors:
    


      Many Redditors find the statements from high-ranking officials and credible individuals particularly compelling:
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""It is time for the truth to be brought out. Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      Personal accounts, especially when detailed and potentially corroborated, are often considered convincing:
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: A Redditor describes seeing a silent, rectangular craft with curved corners and three large, dim, almost organic lights. ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



      Another Redditor shared a similar experience: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



      When multiple sightings match in description, it can add credibility:
    


Portugal and San Diego Sightings: A Redditor highlights the striking similarity between a UFO sighting in Portugal from the 90s and a video from San Diego in 2015. ""The ufo that the San Diego man recorded, matches exactly like the one reported in the Portugal sighting...""



      Another Redditor notes: ""There's definitely credibility with consistency in sightings, provided that these are two separate instances""



      While rare, official reports can offer a more objective perspective:
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: The Condon Committee report suggested a mechanical device of unknown origin. ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting.""



      It's important to consider skeptical explanations, which are also prevalent on Reddit:
    


Factual Errors in Official Accounts: One Redditor points out factual inaccuracies in the list of credible people, which can undermine the overall credibility. [""

The United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday said it was pulling out its remaining forces in Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for ​UAE forces to leave the country within 24 hours, in a major crisis between the ‍two Gulf powers and oil producers.

The UAE made its announcement hours after a Saudi-led coalition air strike on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla.

The attack on what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date in a widening rift between the two Gulf monarchies.

Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday its national security was a red line and backed a call for UAE forces to leave Yemen within 24 hours, shortly after a Saudi-led coalition carried out an air strike on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla.

Once the twin pillars of regional security, the Gulf heavyweights have seen ‍their interests diverge ​on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

The UAE Defence Ministry said it had voluntarily ended the mission of its counterterrorism units in Yemen, the only remaining forces it had in the country after its military presence in Yemen “concluded” in 2019.

The ministry said the “remaining presence was limited to specialized personnel as part of counterterrorism efforts, in co-ordination with relevant international partners.”

It said the decision was taken after a comprehensive assessment following recent developments, state news agency WAM reported, citing a statement from the ministry. 

Declaring its national security a red line, Saudi Arabia earlier on Tuesday alleged the UAE ⁠had pressured Yemen's southern separatists to conduct military operations that had reached the kingdom's borders.

It was Riyadh's strongest language yet against the UAE in the falling-out between the neighbours, who once co-operated in a coalition against Yemen's Iran‑aligned Houthis but whose interests in Yemen have steadily grown apart in recent years.

Frictions grew inside the coalition as Abu Dhabi backed southern separatists seeking self-rule, while Riyadh kept supporting Yemen's internationally recognized government, eventually creating an open rift between the Gulf allies.

On Tuesday the coalition struck what it said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the UAE-backed separatists. The head of Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council ‌gave Emirati forces an ultimatum of 24 hours to ‍leave.

The UAE said in a statement that it had been surprised by the air strike, and that the shipment that had been attacked did not contain weapons and was destined for ‍Emirati forces. 

Yemen's presidential council head, Rashad al-Alimi, accused the UAE in a televised speech of fuelling ‌strife in Yemen with its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), the Yemeni state news agency said, 

“Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United ⁠Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation,” he said.

The UAE earlier stressed that “dealing with recent developments must be done responsibly and in a way ​that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing co-ordination between the concerned parties.”

Major stock indexes in the Gulf fell.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both major players in the OPEC oil exporters' group, and any disagreements between the two could hamper consensus on oil output decisions.

They and six other OPEC+ members are meeting online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates say they will continue their current policy for no change in first-quarter production.

The UAE was a member of the Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthi movement in Yemen from 2015. In 2019 it started a drawdown ​of its troops in the country but remained committed to the Saudi-backed internationally recognized government.

The STC later decided to seek self-rule in the south, and this month launched an offensive against Saudi-supported Yemeni troops, bringing the UAE and Saudi Arabia closer than ever to confrontation in Yemen and risking reigniting a long civil war.

The advance broke years of stalemate, with the STC claiming broad control of the south, including Hadramout province. Saudi Arabia had warned the STC against military moves in Hadramout and sought withdrawal of its forces. 

The STC dismissed the Saudi call. The air strike early on Tuesday followed the weekend arrival of two ships from the UAE port of Fujairah on Saturday and Sunday without its authorization, the coalition said. 

The Saudi state news agency published a video showing a ship it identified as “Greenland” from which it said arms and combat ⁠vehicles were unloaded. The registered owner and operator of the Greenland is Salem Al Makrani Cargo Company, headquartered in Dubai, with a branch office in Fujairah, the company's website indicates. It is ⁠a roll-on/roll-off (RoRO) cargo vessel.

The coalition said the Mukalla port strike caused no casualties or collateral damage, according to Saudi state media. Two sources told Reuters that the strike targeted the dock where the cargo ‌of the two ships was unloaded. 

Reuters could not immediately verify what had been struck or the nature or origin of any cargoes that may have been attacked.

Footage on Yemen's state TV showed what it said was black smoke rising from the port in the early morning after the strike, with burned vehicles at the port. Alimi imposed a no-fly zone, and a sea and ground blockade on all ports and crossings for 72 hours, except for exemptions authorized by the coalition.

Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the head of the STC and the deputy head of the presidential council, said in a joint statement with three other members of the council the UAE remains a main partner in ‌the fight against the Houthis. The statement rejected Alimi's orders and said they lacked consensus.

We speak to journalists Gideon Levy and Rami Khouri about President Trump's meeting Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump supported Israel's threats to launch new attacks on Iran and warned Hamas to disarm during the second stage of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement. Khouri, a Palestinian American journalist, called the meeting a “continuation of the American-Israeli drive, that's been going on for some years now, to reconfigure the Middle East … into a new colonial arrangement, whereby the U.S. and Israel dominate what goes on in the region.” Levy, Israeli journalist for Haaretz, called the meeting an “embarrassment,” noting that “Donald Trump presents himself as someone who promises the sky, who has no demands from Israel whatsoever.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show with President Trump's meeting at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump expressed support for Israel's threats to launch new attacks on Iran, as Netanyahu claims Iran is rebuilding its nuclear industries following U.S. and Israeli attacks last summer.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again. And if they are, we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening. I heard Iran wants to make a deal. If they want to make a deal, that's much smarter.

AMY GOODMAN: Separately, Trump warned Hamas to disarm during the upcoming second stage of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, even as Israel has repeatedly violated the truce with near-daily attacks on Gaza.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we talked about Hamas, and we talked about disarmament. And they're going to be given a very short period of time to disarm, and we'll see how that works out. Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be in charge of that from our side. But if they don't disarm, as they agreed to do — they agreed to it — then there will be hell to pay for them.

AMY GOODMAN: President Trump also claimed he recently spoke to Israeli President Isaac Herzog about pardoning Netanyahu, who faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases in Israel. Trump said Herzog promised a pardon, quote, “is on its way,” though Herzog's office later denied the claim.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu announced Trump would become the first non-Israeli to receive the Israel Prize, the nation's highest civilian award. The announcement came as Trump was caught on a hot mic complaining to Netanyahu he'd been denied a Nobel Peace Prize.

For more, we're joined by two guests. In Tel Aviv, Gideon Levy is with us, an award-winning Israeli journalist, author and columnist for the newspaper Haaretz and a member of its editorial board. His latest book, The Killing of Gaza: Reports on a Catastrophe. And in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we're joined by Rami Khouri, Palestinian American journalist, distinguished public policy fellow at the American University of Beirut. He's also a nonresident senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Rami Khouri, let's begin with you. Talk about the significance of this Mar-a-Lago meeting, that dealt with everything from the U.S. saying they'd support again a strike on Iran to saying Hamas must disarm before the second stage of a truce.

RAMI KHOURI: Well, the significance of the meeting is that it reconfirmed most of the fears that most people around the world have about what the U.S. and Israel are actually doing or planning in Gaza, the rest of Palestine and the wider Middle East. There were very, very few, if any, specifics at all of the plans ahead for a so-called phase two of the Trump-Netanyahu plan. Phase one has not been implemented fully.

Almost every statement that Trump and Netanyahu made was either inaccurate or a deliberate lie or vague or irrelevant or warmongering — threats, sanctions, “We're going to beat the hell out of them.” It was quite an extraordinary performance of two men who are known for their love of warfare and bravado, tough guy talking, and they performed almost like cartoon characters. “We're going to beat the hell out of them if they don't do this,” they're gonna this and that, and with very, very few, if any — really no specifics whatsoever.

And this is the concern that most people have, that what this tells us or suggests, that this situation is a continuation of the American-Israeli drive, that's been going on for some years now, to reconfigure the Middle East, at least the Levant-West Asia part, into a new colonial arrangement, whereby the U.S. and Israel dominate what goes on in the region, they give orders to everybody, and they set the rules, and they grab whatever territory they want — if they want to make a resort, if they want to make an Israeli Zionist colonial settlement, if they want to set up a military base, that they can do anything they want.

It was really quite depressing, but also a very, very accurate reflection of and culmination of a century of Zionist and Israeli linkages with Western colonial powers — the British and then the Americans — in dominating this region and playing with it like they're — they were, like, playing a game that was a combination of Monopoly and Risk, that you move people around, you buy this, you set up a hotel, a beach resort here, an investment there. It was quite distressing, but an accurate reflection of where we are in the world.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Rami Khouri, during the press conference, Trump claimed that Israel was abiding by the ceasefire, despite the fact that over 400 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire was agreed to. Your response to this claim?

RAMI KHOURI: Well, this is a reflection of what I said, that almost every statement that Trump or Netanyahu made is either an outright lie or an exaggeration or a diversion. It's not accurate. It's not the truth. The truth is that maybe 10, 15% of what they agreed on in the phase one of the plan has been implemented.

The Israelis are killing, bombing, attacking, starving. They now have a new weapon, which is to freeze babies to death. Palestinian babies are dying by freezing, 1-year-old — 1-week-old, 2-week-old babies. And this follows the last two years, where Israel has killed Palestinian babies in Gaza with starvation, with bomb attacks, with fires, with lack of medicine, lack of water, lack of food. It's unbelievable what is happening. And it's continuing.

And this is part of the problem, that the American president, at least for now — we don't know if his position is going to stick. He's very erratic, mercurial. He could change, and maybe there's stuff going on behind the scenes that we don't know. But from what he says, he is fully supporting whatever Israel wants to do in continuing its genocide, and possibly even following Israel into Syria, Lebanon and Iran.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I also wanted to ask you — in flying to the United States, Netanyahu's aircraft, according to flight tracking data, crossed Greek, Italian and French airspace. All three of those nations are signatories to the Rome Statute, which obliged them to arrest Netanyahu because of his outstanding arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Your response to this failure of these European countries to act?

RAMI KHOURI: Well, this raises another really important and distressing factor or issue that's going on now, has been for some years, which is the Israeli-driven American collusion in shredding not just Palestinian babies and tents and homes in Palestine, but shredding international law and existing conventions on war crimes, human rights, sovereignty. So, the Israelis basically say, “We don't — these rules of law, rules of war, the International Criminal Court, all these things, they don't apply to Israel. We're exempt from all this.” And the Americans seem — the president, at least, seems to go along with this.

And this is troubling, but it's a sign that the Arab-Israeli or the Palestinian-Zionist conflict is now expanding, because Israel is pushing policies all around the world that protect it and favor it, and are now impinging on fundamental rights, not only of states around the world, but individual rights. For instance, in the U.S., it's very difficult to teach a course on Palestinian-Israeli history or Palestinian resistance, as it used to be very routine, but now you can't do it. So, public libraries are being restricted in what they can do. Media is being restricted to a large extent, the mainstream media. And this is one of — this is another factor, that law doesn't matter anymore. We're into a lawless world, which is really taking us into the new phase of colonialism, as I described it.

AMY GOODMAN: Let's bring Gideon Levy into this conversation, the award-winning Israeli journalist on the board, editorial board, of the newspaper Haaretz. Can you talk about the significance of this meeting at Mar-a-Lago, Netanyahu's fifth, what it means with the threat to Hamas, and then also this whole issue of Trump saying he spoke to the Israeli president, he's going to be giving Netanyahu a pardon, and then the president's office in Israel saying that wasn't true?

GIDEON LEVY: It's very hard, Amy, to speak about the significance of a meeting in which what you got was only warm air, all kind of cliches, all kind of threats, things which are — as Rami rightly said, things which are totally disconnected with reality. And you don't know — you don't know to find yourself there. I would agree almost to everything that Rami said, except of one thing: It was not a two-man show. In this case, it was a one-man show, because Netanyahu was absent yesterday. It was all about Donald Trump.

And Donald Trump presents himself as someone who promises the sky, who has no demands from Israel whatsoever. This was really outrageous. “They should do this, and they should do this, and they should do this.” And the country that slaughtered 20,000, 30,000 children in Gaza has no accountability for anything, in Israel. And there are not — at least at the press conference, there are not special requirements from this country. It's all requirements from all the other actors. And this, by itself, is outrageous.

And then comes another point, obviously, that by the end of the day, they come in — they are coming from two different schools, because for Trump now, the most important thing is to get a deal. No matter how, no matter what, he wants to see deals. For Netanyahu, the main strategic goal is to continue in all four fronts, to continue to fight, not to put an end to any of the disputes there, neither in Lebanon, nor in Syria, nor in Iran, and obviously not in Gaza. Trump doesn't speak about a redeployment and taking out the Israeli troops from Gaza. I mean, that's a core issue. What about it? It's even not mentioned. Who cares if the Israeli army will stay there or not? This is something marginal.

And then came, obviously, this unbelievable intervention in a sovereign other country, in the legal system of a sovereign other country. A journalist, not really a journalist, but a spokesperson for Netanyahu, raised the question about the pardon, I mean, by chance, obviously. And here he is back, Donald Trump calling to pardon Netanyahu, intervention in the legal system in the middle of a legal procedure in another country, spreading also — I don't want to say “lies,” but President Herzog denied that he spoke with Donald Trump after he got his letter. So, in any case, it was embarrassing. I think the most accurate way to describe yesterday's conference, press conference, was embarrassment.

AMY GOODMAN: I also wanted to ask you, Gideon, about Israel becoming the first country in the world to recognize Somaliland, the breakaway region of Somalia, as an independent state, coming as other countries refuse to recognize it. And today, large protests took place across Somalia. This is Somalia's U.N. Ambassador Abu Bakr Dahir Osman addressing the U.N. Security Council Monday during a special meeting on the issue.

ABU BAKR DAHIR OSMAN: A3+ unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to northwestern region of Somalia. This action is not only unlawful, but it's morally reprehensible.

AMY GOODMAN: So, Gideon Levy of Haaretz, can you talk about the significance of Israel becoming the sole nation to recognize Somaliland, and this reference to using it to — for Palestinians to be sent there?

GIDEON LEVY: It's funny and ironic that the only country in the world, except of the United States, which opposes any kind of recognition in a Palestinian state, in the rights of the Palestinian people, and so forth and so forth, is now the only country which recognized some other entity which nobody knows exactly to describe, nobody knows exactly what is the nature of this country and where are they aiming. Israel, as a pariah state, is functioning in recent years with total ignoring of the international community. No matter what the international community says, no matter what are the resolutions, Israel is playing as if it is the only international actor.

The UAE said it was withdrawing voluntarily after Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council canceled a defense pact with the UAE and asked its forces to leave the country within 24 hours.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced it would withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen following an ultimatum.

The country's Defense Ministry, in a statement via its state-run WAM news agency, cited ""recent developments and their potential repercussions on the safety and effectiveness of counter-terrorism operations."" 

However, it did not say when the withdrawal would occur.

Earlier on Tuesday, the leader of Yemen's presidential council announced a state of emergency after a Saudi Arabia-led strike on the southern port of Mukalla.

Saudi Arabia said the strike targeted an arms shipment from the United Arab Emirates meant to reach Yemeni separatists.

In response, the UAE Foreign Ministry called for ""restraint and wisdom,"" and denied that it shipped weapons to separatists.

The Saudi-backed presidential council issued a 72-hour ban on all border crossings in its territory except those allowed by patron Riyadh, while also calling for UAE forces to leave its territory in 24 hours.

The security pact between Yemen and Abu Dhabi has also been canceled by the council.

The Saudi military announced the strike in a statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, saying it targeted a shipment that arrived to Yemen from the Fujairah, a city located on the UAE's eastern coast.

According to the statement, the ships' crew ""had disabled tracking devices"" on them and unloaded ""large amount"" of weapons and vehicles for the STC's armed forces.

The UAE denied that the shipment targeted in the Saudi attack included weapons, but acknowledged transferring vehicles. It did not say it would withdraw from Yemen as demanded.

The statement labeled the weapon shipment an ""imminent threat and an escalation that threatens peace and stability,"" also adding the military had carried out the attack during the night to reduce collateral damage.

The Saudi Foreign Ministry said its ""sisterly state"" UAE's actions in Yemen were ""extremely dangerous.""

It wasn't immediately clear whether other armies took part in the attack other than the Saudi military.

Separatist group Southern Transitional Council (STC) are backed by the UAE, while Yemen's presidential council are backed by Riyadh.

UAE government spokesperson Afra Al Hameli said Tuesday that Abu Dhabi ""affirms its total rejection of the allegations related to fuelling the Yemeni conflict."" 

The attack signals the escalation of tensions between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, with the two countries backing competing sides in the war against the Iranian-backed Houthis.

The organization is one of 25 humanitarian groups suspended for their alleged failure to comply with new Israeli rules.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

The Israeli government said Tuesday that Doctors Without Borders, one of the largest medical organizations currently operating in Gaza, is among the 25 humanitarian groups that will be suspended at the start of the new year for their alleged failure to comply with Israel's widely criticized new registration rules for international NGOs.

According to the Associated Press, Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs “said the organizations that will be banned on January 1 did not meet new requirements for sharing staff, funding, and operations information.” The Israeli government specifically accused Doctors Without Borders, known internationally as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), of “failing to clarify the roles of some staff that Israel accused of cooperation with Hamas and other militant groups,” AP reported.

In addition to providing medical assistance to desperate Palestinians, MSF has been an outspoken critic of what has it described as Israel's “campaign of total destruction” in Gaza. The group said in a report released last December that its teams' experiences on the ground in Gaza were “consistent with the descriptions provided by an increasing number of legal experts and organizations concluding that genocide is taking place.”

Ahead of Tuesday's announcement, Doctors Without Borders warned that the looming withdrawal of registration from international NGOs “would prevent organizations, including MSF, from providing essential services to people in Gaza and the West Bank.”

“With Gaza's health system already destroyed, the loss of independent and experienced humanitarian organizations' access to respond would be a disaster for Palestinians,” the group said in a statement last week. “The humanitarian response in Gaza is already highly restricted, and cannot afford further dismantlement.”

“If Israeli authorities revoke MSF's access to Gaza in 2026, a large portion of people in Gaza will lose access to critical medical care, water, and lifesaving support,” the group added. “MSF's activities serve nearly half a million people in Gaza through our vital support to the destroyed health system. MSF continues to seek constructive engagement with Israeli authorities to continue its activities.”

Pascale Coissard, MSF's emergency coordinator for Gaza, noted that “in the last year, MSF teams have treated hundreds of thousands of patients and delivered hundreds of millions of liters of water.”

“MSF teams are trying to expand activities and support Gaza's shattered health system,” said Coissard. “In 2025 alone, we carried out almost 800,000 outpatient consultations and handled more than 100,000 trauma cases.”

Israel's announcement came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with US President Donald Trump in Florida, where both dodged questions about their supposed “peace plan” for Gaza after more than two years of relentless bombing. The Israeli military has been accused of violating an existing ceasefire agreement hundreds of times since it took effect in October.

Al Jazeera reported Tuesday that “Israeli forces have carried out strikes across the Gaza Strip as they continue with their near-daily violations of the ceasefire agreement, with Israel's genocidal war on the besieged enclave continuing apace and displaced Palestinians enduring the destruction of their few remaining possessions in flooding brought about by heavy winter rains.”

            A Georgia judge on Monday ordered a temporary pause to a December execution that was already put on hold, saying questions about the state's clemency process must be addressed before Stacey Humphreys' death sentence could be carried out.
    


            Humphreys, 52, was facing scheduled execution Dec. 17 but the procedure was paused just days before he was to have received a lethal injection.
    


            He was convicted of malice murder and other crimes in the 2003 shooting deaths of Cyndi Williams, 33, and Lori Brown, 21, at the real estate office where they worked in Cobb County, northwest of Atlanta.
    


            At issue: Humphreys' lawyers contend that two members of Georgia's parole board have conflicts of interest which would taint their participation in a clemency hearing.
    


            Humphreys' lawyers earlier this month filed a petition asking a judge to order the two members of the parole board to recuse themselves from considering his clemency petition.
    


            The lawyers said one of those board members, Kimberly McCoy, was previously a victim advocate with the Cobb County district attorney's office at the time of Humphreys' trial and was assigned to work with victims in the case.
    


            Another board member, Wayne Bennett, was the sheriff in Glynn County, where the trial was moved because of pretrial publicity. Humphreys' lawyers say Bennett oversaw security for the jurors and Humphreys himself during the case.
    


            In an order filed Monday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote that “pressing ‘pause' on the execution machinery until we answer the non-frivolous question raised by Petitioner concerning the proper composition of the Board for his clemency hearing is the correct course of action.”
    


            He ordered lawyers for both sides to file additional legal briefs on the issue by Jan. 19.
    


            Additionally, the judge wrote in his order that Humphreys deserves to have the conflict of interest question researched and argued thoroughly so that a parole board free of conflicts of interest can decide his case at a clemency hearing.

PARIS (AP) — Power problems and a stuck train interrupted rail services through the undersea Channel Tunnel connecting the United Kingdom and continental Europe on Tuesday, operators said, stranding passengers during the busy end-of-year holidays.

At Paris' Gare du Nord station, Jamie and Issy Gill scrambled to find a flight back to the U.K. after their Eurostar train to London was canceled, desperate to be reunited with their baby boy after a getaway in the French capital.

“We came for my 30th birthday,” Issy Gill said, wiping away tears.

Jamie Gill said they'd take a roundabout route back, with a flight via Birmingham on Wednesday.

Eurostar — which runs passenger trains between London and Paris and other European destinations — blamed “overhead power supply issues in the Channel Tunnel” and a failure aboard a train operated by LeShuttle, which transports vehicles and their passengers between the ports of Calais, France, and Folkestone, England.

On Tuesday afternoon, Eurostar said the tunnel was partially reopening but with only one of its two train lines, allowing Eurostar services to resume in the evening — although with expected continued delays and longer journey times than usual. It advised passengers to rebook their journeys on other days.

The 50-kilometer (32-mile) Channel Tunnel, more than half of it undersea, has revolutionized U.K.-Europe rail travel since its inauguration in 1994. But because it's the only fixed cross-English Channel rail link, train services tend to be vulnerable to severe disruptions.




The Gare du Nord station heaved with frustrated passengers trying to book plane or bus tickets.

“I'm disgusted, disheartened,” said Sarah Omouri, a French traveler whose plans to celebrate the New Year in London were dashed.

“It's been maybe a year since we've had a vacation,” she said. “We were made to get on the train, to get off, get on again, and get off again. Now we're told that everything is fully booked for several days. It's ruined.”

In London, would-be traveler John Paul had expected to enjoy a romantic river cruise in Paris and a trip to the Eiffel Tower with his partner, Lucy, but their Eurostar got turned back before reaching the continent.

“We got probably about an hour down the track, maybe 40 minutes, and then they basically said the train's got to stop, because the train ahead got a braking issue,” the 46-year-old Paul said.

“They kept telling us that the driver was trying to fix the brakes on this other train and that the other trains were then backed up,” he said. “There's no clear information and, obviously, we've lost a lot of money, haven't we?”

The Channel Tunnel's operator, Eurotunnel, said that the power supply problem started overnight Monday in part of the tunnel, impacting passenger and vehicle travel by rail in both directions.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks edged lower in afternoon trading on Wall Street Tuesday as 2025 nudges closer to the finish line. 

The S&P 500 fell 0.1%. The benchmark index is still on track for a gain of more than 17% for the year. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 120 points, or 0.3%, as of 12:21 p.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.1%.

The biggest weights on the market remained technology companies, especially those focused on advancements for artificial intelligence.

Nvidia fell 0.2% and Apple fell 0.5%. Both companies have outsized values that have a greater overall impact on the market's broader direction.

On the winning side, Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.9%. The company is buying artificial intelligence startup Manus as it continues an aggressive push to amp up AI offerings across its platforms.

Markets were mixed in Asia and higher in Europe.

With just two trading days left before the year ends, most big investors have closed out their positions and volume has been thin. U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for New Year's day.

The more notable action was again in the commodities markets. Gold, silver and copper all resumed their ascent after steep declines a day earlier. 

The price of gold rose 1.1% and silver prices gained 9.5% after slumping Monday when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the largest trading floors for commodities, asked traders to put up more cash to make bets on precious metals. Prices for both metals have surged in 2025 on a mix of economic worries and supply deficits. 




Copper rose 3.7% and is up more 40% for the year on strong demand. The base metal is critical to global energy infrastructure, and demand is expected to keep growing as the development of artificial intelligence technology puts more of a strain on data centers and the energy grid.

Crude oil prices were relatively steady. The price of U.S. crude oil was mostly unchanged. The price of Brent crude, the international standard, fell 0.1%.

Treasury yields mostly rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.12% from 4.11% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, held steady at 3.45% from late Monday.

Overall, bond yields have fallen significantly through the year, partly because of the market's expectations for a shift in interest rate policy at the Fed. The central bank cut interest rates three times late in 2025, most recently at its meeting earlier in December.

The central bank has been dealing with a more complex economic picture. Consumer confidence has been weakening throughout the year as inflation squeezes consumers and businesses. The continued impact of a wide-ranging U.S.-led trade war threatens to add more fuel to inflation.

Inflation remains stubbornly high while the jobs market slows down. The Fed can cut interest rates to help the economy weather a slower jobs market. But, that could add more fuel to inflation that is still solidly above the Fed's 2% target. Hotter inflation could stunt economic growth.

The Fed has signaled more caution moving forward and minutes from its December meeting will be released later Tuesday.

Wall Street is betting that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its next meeting in January.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — An investigation that extended to the Philippines of two men accused of shooting dead 15 people at a Sydney Jewish festival has found no evidence that they were part of a “broader terrorist cell,” police said on Tuesday.

Sydney residents Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram spent most of November in Davao City in the southern Philippines, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said.

They returned on a flight from Manila on Nov. 29. Two weeks later, they are accused of killing 15 and wounding another 40 in a mass shooting that targeted a Hannukah festival at Bondi Beach.

Philippine National Police determined the pair rarely left their hotel during the visit, Barrett said.

“There is no evidence to suggest they received training or underwent logistical preparation for their alleged attack,” Barrett told reporters.

“These individuals are alleged to have acted alone. There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack. However, I want to be clear, I am not suggesting that they were there for tourism,” Barrett added.

Barrett did not detail a motive for the visit, which began on Nov. 1.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Police allege the pair were inspired by the Islamic State group. The southern Philippines once drew small numbers of foreign militants aligned with the Islamic State group or al-Qaida to train in a secessionist conflict involving minority Muslims in the largely Catholic nation.




Barrett said she was limited in what she could disclose about the investigation in the Philippines because she did not want to prejudice Naveed Akram's trial.

He has yet to enter pleas to dozens of charges including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. Police shot him in the abdomen during a gunfight at Bondi on Dec. 14 and he spent a week in a hospital before he was transferred to a prison. Police shot his father dead at Bondi.

Authorities are promising the largest police presence ever at New Year's Eve festivities at Sydney Harbor on Wednesday. More than 2,500 officers will be on duty. Many will be openly carrying automatic rifles, a sight rarely seen on Sydney streets.

The first police responders to the Bondi massacre were armed with Glock pistols that lacked the lethal range of the Akrams' rifles and shotguns. Two police officers were among the wounded.

New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the state was not moving toward a more militarized police force in response to the attack.

“Given we've just had the worst terrorism event in Australia's history inside the last month, it would be self-evidently the case that things need to change and the security needs to change,” Minns said.

“I understand that there'll be some people that oppose this or regard it as the militarization of the police. My sense is far more families would fully support that kind of police operation because they will feel far safer in that environment,” Minns added.

More than 1 million revelers crowd the waterfront each year to see a world-famous fireworks display centered on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.

Minns said he was concerned that any reduction in crowd numbers would be interpreted by extremists as a victory.

“It's an opportunity to thumb our nose at the terrorists and their ideology that really would have us living in a ball and not celebrating this beautiful city. So this is an opportunity to live your life and show defiance to that kind of ideology,” Minns said.

The Bondi victims will be commemorated with one minute of silence at 11 p.m. on Wednesday when four images of a Jewish candelabrum known as a menorah will be projected on the bridge's pylons, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore said.

Local government authorities had planned to project images of a dove with the word “peace,” but that was changed after consultation with Jewish representatives.

Crowds confront security forces on Tehran's Jomhouri Street, forcing units to retreat from the area. (NCRI.)

Protests spread across Iran on Tuesday after President Donald Trump and other administration officials voiced support for demonstrators. Speaking Monday, Trump pointed to Iran's economic collapse and long-standing public discontent while stopping short of calling for regime change.

Inside Iran, demonstrations entered a third consecutive day, expanding beyond the capital's commercial center. The exiled opposition coalition National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) reported widespread strikes and student protests across Tehran and multiple provincial cities, describing clashes with security forces and anti-government chants. A video obtained by the NCRI appears to show protesters pushing back security forces, forcing them to leave the scene on Tehran's Jomhouri Street. 

Iran International reported that universities emerged as major protest hubs, with rallies at Tehran University, Sharif University of Technology, Shahid Beheshti University, Elm-o-Sanat University and Khajeh Nasir University. Security forces tightened entry controls at campuses and reinforced offices linked to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Strikes spread across Tehran's Shoush and Molavi districts and into Isfahan's Naqsh-e Jahan Square, while parts of Tehran's Grand Bazaar and the gold market shut down. Mobile phone traders gathered outside major shopping centers after closing their stores. Protests turned violent in several locations, with tear gas fired in Tehran and Malard and reports of live fire in Hamadan. Nighttime demonstrations were reported from Qeshm Island in the south to Zanjan and Hamadan in the north, with videos showing chants of ""death to the dictator.""

Speaking at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, Trump said he was ""not going to talk about overthrow of a regime."" Instead, he focused on Iran's deteriorating economy and the state's violent response to protests. ""They've got tremendous inflation. Their economy is busted, the economy is no good,"" Trump said. 

He said that when Iranians gather to protest, the regime responds with lethal force.

Members of the Anglo-Iranian community, along with supporters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), commemorated the 45th anniversary of the revolution in Iran that saw the overthrow of the Shah's regime and eventually led to a theocratic Islamic republic in 1979.

""Every time they have a riot or somebody forms a group, little or big, they start shooting people,"" Trump said. ""You know, they kill people. All of a sudden people start getting shot and that group disbanded pretty quickly.""

Trump said he has watched the unrest build for years, describing Iran's leadership as brutal.

""I've watched this for years — there is tremendous discontent,"" he said. ""I've watched it for years, and vicious, vicious people."" His remarks came as protests intensified following the collapse of Iran's currency to historic lows. The rial fell to roughly 1.45 million per U.S. dollar on the open market, triggering strikes and demonstrations centered on Tehran's Grand Bazaar and spreading to other major cities, according to Iran International's live reporting. Videos and eyewitness accounts described heavy security deployments, clashes with demonstrators and the use of tear gas as unrest widened.

TRUMP VOWS TO ‘KNOCK THE HELL OUT OF' IRAN IF NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS REBUILT AGAIN AFTER HIGH-STAKES MEETING

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz issued a direct message of support. ""The people of Iran want freedom,"" Waltz wrote on X. ""We stand with Iranians in the streets of Tehran and across the country as they protest a radical regime that has brought them nothing but economic downturn and war."" 

A parallel statement from the U.S. government's Persian-language account, @USAbehFarsi, said Washington supports the Iranian people's efforts ""to make their voices heard,"" urging the Islamic Republic to respect fundamental rights rather than suppress protests.

Iranian officials acknowledged the unrest but defended the government's approach. Reuters reported that government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Tehran recognizes protests and that officials would set up a mechanism to engage with protest leaders. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian directed his interior minister to address protesters' ""legitimate demands"" and engage in dialogue with their representatives.

Independent analysts warned the unrest reflects deeper structural strains. The OSINT research group SpecialEurasia said in an assessment on Tuesday that Iran's internal stability has reached a ""critical threshold,"" citing the convergence of currency collapse, renewed international sanctions and chronic water and energy shortages. The group noted that the participation of bazaar merchants, traditionally a pillar of regime support, signals declining confidence in the state's economic management and raises the risk of prolonged unrest.

NCRI leader Maryam Rajavi said the protests reflect the anger of ""tens of millions"" driven to the breaking point by inflation, corruption and clerical rule. NCRI's claims reflect opposition reporting and cannot be independently verified due to restrictions on access inside Iran.

Cameron Khansarinia, vice president of the National Union for Democracy in Iran, said the latest demonstrations underscore a growing shift in public sentiment. ""Iranians have once again taken to the streets."" Citing President Donald Trump's remarks this week, he added that ""each time they do, the regime tries to crush it,"" but argued that ""Iranians' desire to be free is increasingly becoming greater than their fear of the regime."" Khansarinia claimed that chants in support of Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi have been growing in the protests, saying the protesters showed ""remarkable bravery.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The fight for the Senate: Where battleground races stand in the polls","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/congressional/3918169/2026-midterm-elections-battleground-senate-races-polling/","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The battle for control of the Senate is likely to hinge on a half-dozen of the most competitive races in the 2026 midterm elections, as Republicans fight to retain their majority in an election year that Democrats are poised to outperform them.

Still, the map heavily favors the Republicans holding on to the upper chamber, which the party controls 53-47.

With Vice President JD Vance as a tiebreaker, Democrats would need to net four seats. That means defending all three of their competitive races in New Hampshire, Michigan, and Georgia while also flipping all three of the Republican-held seats in Maine, North Carolina, and Ohio, in addition to capturing a long-shot seat such as Texas or Iowa.

Here's where the six most competitive 2026 Senate races stand based on early survey averages from RealClear Polling.

Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) is seeking a second term as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent this cycle. Georgia Republicans are in the midst of a crowded and messy primary that has yet to see President Donald Trump become heavily involved. The contest is considered a toss-up by nonpartisan election forecasters.

Rep. Mike Collins (R-GA), the GOP front-runner based on recent surveys, has tied or slightly trailed Ossoff by an average of just over two points in head-to-head matchups. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) is losing by slightly more, an average of 3.5 points, and former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley trails by roughly six points.

Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) is retiring at the end of his second term. Former Michigan GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, who lost in 2024 to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) is running another campaign and is the presumptive Republican nominee.

But the Democratic side remains a contentious three-way contest between Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed.

Early polling shows Stevens with a slight primary lead, followed by McMorrow, then El-Sayed. Rogers leads all three in head-to-head matchups, beating Stevens by 2.4 points, McMorrow by four points, and El-Sayad by 8.5 points.

The race is considered a toss-up.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) is retiring at the end of her third term from a seat that forecasters say leans Democratic. Rep. Chris Pappas (D-NH) is the presumptive Democratic nominee.

On the Republican side, it's a two-man contest between former senators: John E. Sununu, former New Hampshire senator and brother of former Gov. Chris Sununu, and Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator. Establishment-backed Sununu currently leads by double digits.

In general election matchups, Pappas leads Sununu by an average of four points and Brown by 11 points.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the GOP's most vulnerable incumbent, is seeking reelection to a sixth term for her toss-up seat. Democrats Graham Platner and Gov. Janet Mills are locked in a competitive two-person primary, where the establishment-backed governor maintains an average single-digit edge over the more liberal outsider.

Recent surveys suggest Collins has an average lead over Mills of just two points, but trails Platner by 2.5 points.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) is retiring at the end of his second term. The race is considered a toss-up and is likely to feature a general election between former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley and former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.

Cooper maintains a single-digit lead over Whatley by an average of about 4.7 points.

Sen. Jon Husted (R-OH) is running for reelection in a special election to serve the remainder of Vance's term that ends in early 2028. Husted was appointed to the seat earlier in 2025 by Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH). Forecasters rate the contest as leaning Republican.

Former Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), who was ousted by Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH), is the presumptive Democratic nominee. Husted leads Brown by an average of just one point, well within the margins of error.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Andrej Karpathy has long been ahead.

He was ahead of the AI boom, having worked as a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, long before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He also got into self-driving vehicles early, steering Tesla's autopilot effort as its head of AI.

Now, he says, ""I've never felt this much behind as a programmer.""

In an X post on Friday, Karpathy wrote that the industry was being ""dramatically refactored,"" as individual programmers contribute fewer and fewer lines of code.

""I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year,"" he wrote. ""A failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue.""

I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become…

AI has radically transformed the software engineering industry, introducing code editors like Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex, along with a slew of agentic software development tools. Business Insider's Amanda Hoover called 2025 ""the year coding changed forever.""

Karpathy was a key player in the change. In February, he coined the term ""vibe coding."" To vibe code, one prompts AI to generate lines of code. (It gets its name because developers ""fully give in to the vibes,"" Karpathy wrote in his original post.) The Collins Dictionary named it the word of the year.

Still, Karpathy wrote that it's like a ""powerful alien tool"" was handed out without a manual.

""Everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession,"" he wrote.

In the comments, another one of the biggest names in vibe-coding agreed. Boris Cherny created Claude Code for Anthropic, now one of the most popular AI tools among developers.

Cherny wrote that he felt that way ""most weeks,"" and that he sometimes finds himself approaching a problem manually, not yet realizing AI can do it faster.

New graduates and early career coders may fare best in this new environment, Cherny wrote, because they don't assume what AI can and cannot do.

""It takes significant mental work to re-adjust to what the model can do every month or two, as models continue to become better and better at coding and engineering,"" he wrote.

Responding to Cherny, Karpathy wrote that he had similar experiences. He analogized the new tools to a weapon, one that sometimes ""shoots pellets"" or ""misfires"" — highlighting the work-in-progress nature of AI.

Other times, though, the tools work wonders.

""Once in a while when you hold it just right a powerful beam of laser erupts and melts your problem,"" he wrote.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Silver is on a wild ride. After surging to record highs this year, the metal saw its biggest intraday swing in more than half of a decade yesterday.

Here's the full story:

General Motors' investors were in the driver's seat this year. As CNBC's Michael Wayland reports, GM's stock is on track to outperform competitors in 2025 and notch its biggest one-year gain since the automaker exited bankruptcy in 2009.

Shares have hit new all-time highs this month, thanks in part to a roughly 13% rise so far in December alone. The automaker's stock is on track to see its fifth straight winning month as Wall Street cheers the Detroit-based company's record of cash generation and resilient earnings.

Meta said this morning that it has acquired artificial intelligence agent developer Manus.

The Singapore-based startup this year launched its first AI agent, which can complete tasks such as coding and data analysis. Meta said the acquisition should help accelerate its AI innovation and further integrate automation into products such as its AI assistant. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that it closed at more than $2 billion, citing sources familiar.

It's the latest AI investment for Meta, which earlier this month acquired wearables startup Limitless. In June, the tech giant invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI.

President Donald Trump didn't mince words when discussing Iran yesterday. Trump said he would ""knock the hell out of"" Iran if the country attempts to rebuild its nuclear program, but suggested Iran should negotiate a deal.

""Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down,"" Trump said. ""We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.""

Trump, who yesterday met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also said he would support an Israeli attack on Iran if the country tries to rebuild its ballistic missile reserve or reinstate its nuclear program.

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is falling out of favor with his state's tech elite after supporting a wealth tax.

California labor groups are pushing for a ballot measure that asks the state's billionaires to pay a one-time 5% tax to make up for an expected shortfall in the health-care system. In a social media post, Khanna reacted sarcastically to industry leaders' threats to leave the state if the ballot item succeeds.

As CNBC's Garrett Downs notes, those tech leaders made clear their displease with Khanna online. Look no further than Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, who wrote that it's ""time to primary him.""

Kiruna, Sweden's northernmost city, is being moved building by building due to ground subsidence caused by the expansion of the world's largest underground iron ore mine. CNBC's Sam Meredith takes you inside the process and what it means for Kiruna's residents.

Prenetics (PRE), a health-sciences company that raised $48 million earlier this year, partially to build a bitcoin treasury, said it decided to stop purchasing BTC amid prolonged weakness in the cryptocurrency market.

The company rolled out its bitcoin accumulation strategy in June, following a model championed by Michael Saylor's Strategy Inc, in which firms raise capital to buy and hold crypto on their balance sheets. The business model gained traction earlier this year as crypto prices rose, but enthusiasm faded after the steep market downturn in October.

On Oct. 27, Prenetics CEO and co/founder Danny Yeung announced the funding round, which included investors such as Kraken, Exodus (EXOD), GPTX and American Ventures. He said the funds would help its ""IM8"" business scale globally while accumulating 1 BTC daily toward a goal of $1 billion in revenue and bitcoin within five years.

However, the firm said in a statement on Tuesday that it stopped purchasing bitcoin on Dec. 4 to focus its resources exclusively on IM8, which it said has generated more than $100 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) since it launched 11 months ago.

“The phenomenal success of IM8 has exceeded all expectations and scaled much faster than we originally anticipated,” Yeung said. “Our board and management team unanimously agreed that the most promising path to creating significant, sustainable shareholder value is to devote our undivided attention to this opportunity clearly visible in IM8.”

Prenetics, backed and co-founded by English football icon David Beckham, said it won't allocate any existing or new capital for the purpose of buying additional bitcoin. However, it still plans to hold its existing 510 bitcoin as a reserve asset, worth nearly $45 million as of Tuesday afternoon ET.

Prenetics shares have risen 189% this year, while Michael Saylor's MSTR fell nearly 48% and bitcoin dipped about 5.6%.

Async Payjoin is the best hope for strong privacy in Bitcoin. Modeled after HTTPS, which enabled secure payments for the web, the Payjoin foundation has been quietly building up this privacy toolkit, which must be adopted by a large number of Bitcoin wallets, to deliver privacy at scale. 

Modeled after the Bitcoin and Lightning dev kits — which have become quite popular among wallet developers — and built with the same cryptographic primitives already in Bitcoin core, such that it can be easily integrated into the main Bitcoin implementation, Async Payjoin is designed from the bottom up for mass adoption. 

Following in the footsteps of Let's Encrypt, which in the 2010s led the mass adoption of HTTPS on the web via open source, free software tooling, Async Payjoin looks to solve Bitcoin's biggest privacy pain points through an open privacy standard. Unlike specific privacy-focused wallets like Samourai Wallet and Wasabi, Async Payjoin is a software library that any bitcoin payments app can integrate, joining an open standard of privacy, similar to HTTPS on the web. 

Async Payjoin is also referred to as Payjoin V2 by the Foundation, as it differs from V1, an older implementation that requires both users to be online while they transact for the Payjoin to work. A growing list of Bitcoin wallets support the Payjoin Foundation's V1 and V2 standards today, including:  

Async Payjoin is backwards compatible, such that users with wallets that do not support the standard yet can still send to Payjoin addresses and QR codes without friction to the users. Fans of Bitcoin privacy should ask their favorite wallet providers to integrate this open source standard, which developers can find a technical reference for at Bip 77, alongside their plug-and-play dev kit on GitHub. 

The nonprofit PayJoin Foundation, launched in August 2025 to sustain open-source privacy development, receives funding from OpenSats and Cake Wallet, while Spiral, Human Rights Foundation, Maelstrom, and Brink have supported many of the open-source developers who contributed to the project. Their GitHub shows 37 contributors just on the Rust implementation of Async Payjoin.

Development of the Async Payjoin protocol, also known as Payjoin V2 via Bip 77, is spearheaded by Dan Gould, executive director of the Payjoin Foundation and lead maintainer of the Payjoin DevKit. Dan has pioneered Bitcoin privacy tools since the TumbleBit era, forked Wasabi Wallet for mobile use, and co-authored BIP 77 with Yuval Kogman, advisory board member and Spiral Bitcoin Wizard with over two decades of programming experience. Kogman has done extensive work in the Bitcoin privacy field, such as developing WabiSabi DoS protections and whistleblowing vulnerabilities in various CoinJoin implementations. 

Armin Sabouri has also joined the team as R&D lead with prior roles as CTO at Botanix and engineer at Casa, co-winner of the 2021 MIT Bitcoin Hackathon by getting Bip 78 CoinJoin working on Mac OS via Tor, and is a co-author of BIP 347 (OP_CAT). 

Gould told Bitcoin Magazine that they are always fundraising and that “none of this work is possible without the funders.” He also went into detail about why they decided to start a Payjoin foundation rather than a for-profit entity, saying that “Bitcoin privacy — for-profits have basically been killed.” 

According to Gould, a nonprofit is more sustainable to solve the problem because it aligns the incentives; “I think the for-profits have an incentive to sell something that doesn't necessarily guarantee privacy because if they make a sale, they earn profit. And we've seen on the internet that it was attempted. Phil Zimmerman started a company that developed PGP. But HTTPS was a decentralized nonprofit effort, as was Tor”. Gould says the Payjoin Foundation has applied for 501 (c) (3) status, which is pending approval. Donors can contact him at donate@payjoin.org. 

Payjoin provides privacy to Bitcoin by breaking a common pattern of normal transactions, where the sender has one input that gets split up into two to make a payment. Of the resulting outputs, one is likely to be the payment and the other the change back to the sender. 

Users often have multiple UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs), which are like pockets of coins. If a transaction tries to send more than is in one UTXO, it will pull from another, linking two of these pockets of coins, which up until that point might have had no connection to each other on the chain. This reduces the privacy of users in the eyes of blockchain analysts, who can assume the two UTXO packets belong to the same entity. 

Payjoin dissolves the standard input heuristic by facilitating coordination between the sender and the receiver, resulting in transactions that appear to have two inputs and two outputs, where one of the inputs is from the receiver. The receiver gets the same amount he is expecting; both parties simply coordinate on the amounts and co-create the transaction. As a result, what would have been a single-input, two-output transaction now has two inputs and two outputs, confusing on-chain analysts. The more transactions of this type exist, the less reliable the single-input heuristic becomes, resulting in more privacy for all users, as the core assumption of on-chain analysis breaks down.   

This process is entirely non custodial, with full control over amounts signed and sent by both parties, it is atomic, if both parties don't agree, the transaction is not valid. 

Gould cautioned about how much information is leaked with normal bitcoin transactions today, referring to organizations like Chain Analysis, which can, in some circumstances, get access to exchange user data to try and identify owners of a given UTXO, “if you snoop on that, you can see who you've transferred money to in the past. You can see who someone transfers money to in the future. You can see how much money someone has. You can see how much money someone makes.”

Enhancements to Bitcoin privacy of this sort are crucial to the success of Bitcoin as they enforce the fungibility of the asset, an important quality of sound money. Fungibility means that all coins are considered equal and interchangeable; one is not different from the other based on its history. 

Cryptocurrencies that focus on maximizing on-chain privacy, like Zcash or Monero, offer higher default degrees of on-chain privacy by encrypting the amounts transferred among parties. This, however, comes at a high cost; validation of the total supply of coins in these alternative cryptocurrencies is much more complicated. As a result, bugs in the related cryptography could lead to inflation bugs that are undetectable, a risk which undermines scarcity, another critical quality of sound money.

Payjoin in turn provides Bitcoin a higher degree of on-chain privacy without encrypting the amounts transferred between parties, respecting the scarcity of Bitcoin while enhancing fungibility. The main trade-off is that it can not be a protocol-level change; it needs wallet adoption and thus user engagement.

It's also important to note that fiat-level privacy already protects users from third-party analysis by being a closed private system, or tries to anyway. Government agencies and executives working at banks have much greater visibility into user balances, but organized crime does not. There are also many laws in countries throughout the world defending user financial privacy, which Async Payjoin is looking to elevate Bitcoin to. 

One of the challenges historically with traditional Payjoin is that it required both parties to be online to coordinate the creation of the transaction. To solve this, Payjoin V2 introduces a blinded directory server to provide asynchronous Payjoin coordination among parties, using the well-known Internet standard, Oblivious HTTP.

Gould told Bitcoin Magazine that “the cool thing is the protocol has the directory server blinded. The directory server is only reachable by oblivious HTTP, which is basically a forced proxy. So the IP addresses (of users) are never leaked to the directory server.” Adding that, “the payload (pre-signed transaction) is actually end-to-end encrypted between the sender and the receiver anyway. So the directory just gets an 8-kilobyte uniform encrypted blob. They don't see anything.”

In fact, Gould compared the use of OHTTP to Tor, explaining that “The reason we used it is because it's a web standard. So it's gone through the rigorous review process. OHTTP is literally supported in the iOS operating system. It's used in browsers.” adding that “OHTTP it's kind of like the minimal viable product of Tor where Tor layers encryption and does multiple hops and this is just the most minimal version where you just have one hop. You just have one layer of encryption.” Similar multi-hop network encryption is used in the Lightning network to protect user privacy. 

The Payjoin V2 servers provide no financial reward to those who run them, similar to Tor exit nodes, which have sustained these privacy networks on a volunteer basis for decades.  

Regulators and, as a result, exchange operators often have concerns about Bitcoin privacy technologies, as they are perceived to be in conflict with topics of compliance. Gould considers this a misconception, saying that “the reality is that a compliance regime is totally independent from the nature of the chain. If an exchange wants to collect your baby's name, know the place you live, your phone number, and what source of funds, having privacy by default doesn't stop them from doing that. Doesn't stop them from asking for it in order to do business with the user.” Adding that “It just doesn't give them complete insight into your whole wallet, past, present, and future. So it puts the power to consent to reveal the information about your money in your own hands.”

Bitcoin traders appear to be making another last-ditch effort to to erase year-end losses during the final days of December.

The largest digital currency made a push toward the $90,000 price level for a second consecutive day before the rally stalled again. The token has settled into a trading range of roughly $85,000 to $95,000 following an October crash that has put it on pace for the first annual loss in three years. Bitcoin is down about 5% since last December, after being up around 30% while hitting an all-time high in early October.

On Earth, finding the exact time is effortless. Our planet relies on a sophisticated global system that combines atomic clocks, GPS satellites, and ultra-fast communication networks to keep everything in sync.

That precision does not extend naturally beyond Earth. Albert Einstein showed that time does not move at the same pace everywhere in the universe. The rate at which a clock ticks depends on gravity, meaning clocks run slightly slower in stronger gravity and faster in weaker gravity. Even coordinating time across Earth is complex. Extending that coordination across the solar system is far more challenging. For future explorers hoping to live and work on Mars, one fundamental question must be answered first: What time is it on Mars?

Scientists Calculate Mars Time for the First Time

Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have now produced a precise answer. Their calculations show that, on average, clocks on Mars tick 477 microseconds (millionths of a second) faster per day than clocks on Earth. That difference is not constant. Because of Mars' stretched orbit and gravitational influences from other bodies, the time difference can vary by as much as 226 microseconds per day throughout the Martian year.

The research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal and builds on a 2024 study in which NIST scientists outlined a framework for highly precise timekeeping on the Moon.

Understanding how time passes on Mars is essential for future missions, said NIST physicist Bijunath Patla. As NASA prepares for more advanced Mars exploration, accurate timing will be critical for navigation, communication, and coordination across planetary distances.

""The time is just right for the Moon and Mars,"" Patla said. ""This is the closest we have been to realizing the science fiction vision of expanding across the solar system.""

Mars Time Zone

Mars operates on a different schedule than Earth in more ways than one. A single Martian day lasts about 40 minutes longer than an Earth day, and a Martian year stretches across 687 Earth days compared with 365 days on Earth. Beyond those obvious differences, scientists needed to determine whether each second on Mars passes at the same rate as it does on Earth.

An atomic clock placed on the surface of Mars would function normally. The clock itself would tick just as it does on Earth. The problem appears when that Mars clock is compared with one on Earth. Over time, the two clocks drift apart. The task for scientists was to determine exactly how large that offset becomes, similar to defining a planetary time zone.

That calculation proved more complicated than expected. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, gravity alters the flow of time. Clocks slow down in stronger gravity and speed up where gravity is weaker. A planet's motion through space also affects how time passes, with orbital speed contributing additional changes.

Gravity, Orbits, and Relativity

To make the calculations possible, NIST researchers selected a specific reference point on the Martian surface, comparable to sea level at Earth's equator. Using data gathered from years of Mars missions, Patla and fellow NIST physicist Neil Ashby estimated surface gravity on Mars, which is about five times weaker than Earth's.

Gravity from Mars alone was not enough to explain the full picture. The solar system is a dynamic environment filled with massive objects that constantly pull on one another. The Sun contains more than 99% of the solar system's total mass, and its gravitational influence dominates planetary motion.

Mars' location in the solar system -- its distance from the Sun, its neighbors like Earth, the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn -- forces it into a more elongated and eccentric orbit. By contrast, Earth and the Moon follow relatively stable paths. As a result, time on the Moon consistently runs 56 microseconds faster per day than time on Earth.

""But for Mars, that's not the case. Its distance from the Sun and its eccentric orbit make the variations in time larger. A three-body problem is extremely complicated. Now we're dealing with four: the Sun, Earth, the Moon and Mars,"" Patla explained. ""The heavy lifting was more challenging than I initially thought.""

After accounting for Martian surface gravity, orbital motion, and the gravitational effects of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, Patla and Ashby arrived at their final calculation.

Paving the Way for Solar System Internet

A difference of 477 millionths of a second may seem insignificant. It is roughly one thousandth of the time it takes to blink. Yet such tiny differences matter greatly in modern technology. For example, 5G communication systems require timing accuracy within a tenth of a microsecond.

Today, messages sent between Earth and Mars take anywhere from four to 24 minutes to arrive, and sometimes even longer. Patla compared the situation to communication before the telegraph, when handwritten letters crossed oceans by ship and replies took weeks or months to return.

Developing a reliable framework for timekeeping between planets could eventually allow for synchronized communication networks across the solar system.

""The time is just right for the Moon and Mars. This is the closest we have been to realizing the science fiction vision of expanding across the solar system."" Bijunath Patla, NIST physicist

""If you get synchronization, it will be almost like real-time communication without any loss of information. You don't have to wait to see what happens,"" Patla said.

Preparing for Future Mars Exploration

Fully synchronized interplanetary networks remain far in the future, as do permanent human settlements on Mars. Still, studying these timing challenges now helps scientists anticipate the obstacles ahead, Ashby noted.

""It may be decades before the surface of Mars is covered by the tracks of wandering rovers, but it is useful now to study the issues involved in establishing navigation systems on other planets and moons,"" Ashby said. ""Like current global navigation systems like GPS, these systems will depend on accurate clocks, and the effects on clock rates can be analyzed with the help of Einstein's general theory of relativity.""

Patla added that the research also advances fundamental science. Measuring how time behaves on distant worlds provides new tests of Einstein's theories of special and general relativity.

""It's good to know for the first time what is happening on Mars timewise. Nobody knew that before. It improves our knowledge of the theory itself, the theory of how clocks tick and relativity,"" he said. ""The passage of time is fundamental to the theory of relativity: how you realize it, how you calculate it, and what influences it. These may seem like simple concepts, but they can be quite complicated to calculate.""

Garage 75 MB/s vs rest of the middle of the pack of 200(ish) MB/s. Is this just language choice? There has to be some poor tuning of code, settings to adjust, and libraries in there.Would be nice if the article listed the specs of their test machine: cpu, memory, disks, and network.

1. OverviewThis project enables deep code analysis with Large Language Models. By constructing a Neo4j-based Graph RAG, it enables developers and AI agents to perform complex, multi-layered queries on C/C++ codebases that traditional search tools simply can't handle. With only 4 MCP APIs and a vanilla agent, it is already able to accomplish lots of tasks related to the codebases.2. How it worksUsing clangd and clang, the system parses and indices your source files to create a high-fidelity code graph. It captures everything from high-level folder structures to granular relationships, including entities like Folders, Files, Namespaces, Classes/Structs, Variables, Methods, etc.; relationships like: CALLS, INCLUDES, INHERITS, OVERRIDES, and more.The system generates summaries and embeddings for every level of the codebase (from functions up to entire folders) using a bottom-up approach. This structured context helps AI agents understand the ""big picture"" without getting lost in the syntax.To get you started easily, the project includes: an example MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, and a demonstration AI agent to showcase the graph's power. You can easily build your own custom agents and servers on top of the graph RAG.3. Efficiency & PerformanceIncremental Updates: The system detects changes between commits and updates only what's necessary.
Parallel Processing: Parsing and summary generation are distributed across worker processes with optimized data sharing.
Smart Caching: Results are cached to minimize redundant computations, saving you both time and LLM costs.4. A benchmark: The Linux KernelWhen building a code graph for the Linux kernel (WSL2 release) on a workstation (12 cores, 64GB RAM), it takes about ~4 hours using 10 parallel worker processes, with peak memory usage at ~36GB. Note this process does not include the summary generation, and the total time may vary based on your LLM provider.

This project is by no means a replacement for the clangd language server used in IDEs. Instead, it is designed to complement it by enabling LLMs to perform deep architectural analysis. While clangd handles real-time coding assistance, this tool focuses on high-level reasoning, such as mapping project workflows, tracing complex call paths, and understanding system-wide architecture.

For months, Texas senators have made a controversial push to move NASA's iconic Space Shuttle Discovery from the Smithsonian to Houston's Johnson Space Center, a risky effort that could cost up to $150 million.

Like any NASA leader worth his salt, newly-confirmed Administrator Jared Isaacman has come up with a contingency plan.

In an interview with CNBC on December 23, Isaacman said relocating Discovery would depend on whether it could be done without damaging the space shuttle and within budget. If not, he suggested sending Houston a different spacecraft, such as an Orion capsule.

“If we can't do that, you know what, we have spacecraft going around the Moon with Artemis 2, 3, 4 and 5,” Isaacman said. “One way or another, we're going to make sure Johnson Space Center gets its historic spacecraft right where it belongs.”

In April, Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced legislation to “bring Discovery home to Texas.” The core provisions of that bill were ultimately included in H.R. 1, the budget reconciliation bill signed into law on July 4.

Unlike Cornyn and Cruz's original bill, these provisions do not specifically name Discovery or Johnson Space Center. Rather, H.R. 1 includes $85 million for a “space vehicle transfer” of a crewed spacecraft to a NASA center involved in the agency's commercial crew program and directs NASA to select a spacecraft to be transferred within 30 days of enactment.

The bill also states that the selected vehicle must have flown to space, carried astronauts, and must be selected with the approval of a third party chosen by the NASA administrator. Discovery, the most-flown shuttle during its 27 years in operation, fits that bill, but it's not the only option.

In August, NASA said then-Acting Administrator Sean Duffy selected a vehicle, but the agency declined to say which one. Sen. Cornyn's office later claimed the choice was a retired space shuttle bound for Johnson Space Center—without specifying which shuttle.

Despite the uncertainty, the very prospect of moving Discovery from its home at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum has spurred efforts to block the transfer. Senate Democrats, grassroots organizers, and the Smithsonian—which technically owns Discovery—have all voiced concerns about the costly and risky disassembly the move would require.

In a letter addressed to the relevant Congressional committees in early October, the Smithsonian said both the museum and NASA agree that Discovery will have to undergo “significant disassembly” to be moved, risking the destruction of the historic vehicle.

The letter also estimated that the minimal cost to move Discovery is in the range of $120 million to $150 million, not including the cost of building a new facility to house the shuttle in Houston.

Cornyn and Cruz disputed those claims, going so far as to call for a Department of Justice investigation into the Smithsonian's “illegal lobbying” against Discovery's move. The DOJ has yet to launch any such investigation.

Whether NASA and the Smithsonian move forward with Discovery's transfer remains to be seen, but a decision to give Houston an Orion capsule would likely be a much easier—and cheaper—alternative. Those spacecraft are significantly smaller than the space shuttles and can be transported by truck.

With Isaacman taking the helm of NASA in the midst of this space shuttle saga, it's clear he wants to find a solution that will appease both the powerful senators and the spaceflight community. In the interview, he stressed that preserving Discovery and conserving NASA's budget are his top priorities.

“My job now is to make sure we can undertake such a transportation within the budget dollars we have available and, of course, most importantly, ensuring the safety of the vehicle,” he said.

Children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) had reduced physical fitness and lower levels of physical activity than control individuals without the condition, but 1 year of growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) significantly improved body composition, muscle strength, levels of physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and quality of life.

""Our results documented that GHD in childhood can be associated to impaired health- related physical fitness and reduced physical activity, which can be restored by GHRT, eventually leading to a better HRQOL [health-related quality of life],"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Nicola Improda, Neuroendocrine Diseases and Obesity Unit, Department of Neuroscience, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, Napoli, Italy. It was published online on December 20, 2025, in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

The study was limited by the relatively small sample size and lack of data on dietary habits, energy and protein intake, sport participation, psychosocial factors, and treatment adherence. The absence of 1-year follow-up data in the control group limited the ability to compare improvements in the GHD group with natural changes in growth and pubertal development.

This study was supported by Merck Healthcare KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Coffee and tea consumption may have unique, but opposite, effects on bone health in postmenopausal women, a new long-term study has found. Coffee was linked to reductions in bone mineral density (BMD), though only at high levels of consumption, and tea was associated with improvements in total hip BMD, though only to a small degree.

“Our results don't mean you need to give up coffee or start drinking tea by the gallon,” said co-author Enwu Liu, PhD, adjunct associate professor with the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University, in Adelaide, Australia. “But they do suggest that moderate tea consumption could be one simple way to support bone health, and that very high coffee intake might not be ideal, especially for women who drink alcohol.”

Coffee and tea are among the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, but evidence of their effects on bone health remain inconclusive, Liu and colleague wrote in the study, published in Nutrients. Their research aimed to assess the longitudinal impact of coffee and tea in postmenopausal women.

For their study, the researchers analyzed data from 9704 women aged 65 years or older who participated in the prospective Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) and attended study visits 2, 4, 5, and 6, which spanned approximately 10 years.

SOF participants completed self-administered questionnaires about coffee and tea intake, which were used to assess consumption. The researchers also used measurements of femoral neck and total hip BMD taken using DEXA at the study visits.

Overall, patients had a mean age of 73 years at baseline, and their mean BMI remained relatively stable at about 26 throughout the study period.

After adjusting for key confounders, including demographic, physical activity, comorbidities, and medication use, tea consumption was positively associated with total hip BMD (least squares [LS] mean, 0.718 vs 0.715 g/cm2; mean difference, 0.003; P = .026) at a median follow-up of 8 years.

The dose-response relationship between tea consumption and total hip BMD was weak (β, 0.0006; P for linearity = .0887).

In terms of coffee consumption, the study showed no significant overall association between moderate coffee consumption (two or three cups per day) and femoral neck or total hip BMD. However, a natural spline regression analyses indicated that consumption of more than five cups of coffee per day may be associated with lower BMD.

Subanalyses showed that coffee consumption was negatively associated with femoral neck BMD among women with a higher lifetime alcohol intake (P for interaction = .0147).

“While moderate coffee drinking appears safe, very high consumption may not be ideal, especially for women who drink alcohol,” Liu said.

Meanwhile, women with obesity showed greater benefits from tea consumption than those without obesity (LS mean difference, 0.001).

“These subgroup findings should be interpreted with caution as they are likely underpowered and may be susceptible to type I error; they are primarily hypothesis-generating and warrant validation in future, larger studies,” the authors wrote.

In postmenopausal women, BMD normally declines with age at a rate of about 0.002-0.006 g/cm2/y, Liu said.

“Therefore, the observed difference of 0.003 g/cm2 at the hip corresponds to roughly a 1-year delay in age-related BMD decline among tea drinkers compared with nondrinkers,” he told Medscape Medical News. “Although this difference may appear modest at the individual level, when considered across the large population of tea consumers, the potential public health impact is meaningful.”

With BMD in human populations generally evenly distributed, “even a small shift in mean BMD reflects a true population-level difference between tea drinkers and nondrinkers,” he added.

The findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that tea consumption may support bone health in older women; however, the collective evidence is “not yet robust enough to support a formal clinical recommendation to drink tea solely for bone preservation,” Liu noted.

Study limitations included the self-reported nature of the questionnaires and the lack of information about cup size, brew strength, and beverage types, the authors noted. Additionally, the study population consisted almost entirely of older White women in the US, limiting its generalizability to other populations.

Caffeine may play a role in coffee's potential impact on health, the authors wrote. It acts as a nonspecific antagonist of adenosine receptors, which may inhibit bone formation and enhance bone resorption. In vitro studies have suggested that caffeine may downregulate vitamin D receptor expression and impair osteogenic actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in osteoblasts.

However, studies in humans suggest that in individuals with inadequate calcium intake, caffeine only has a minimal effect, “causing only a slight negative calcium balance due to reduced absorption efficiency,” the authors wrote.

Potential mechanisms underlying tea's effects on BMD may involve catechins, particularly epigallocatechin, which can promote osteoblast activity and inhibit osteoclast differentiation, the authors noted.

“Different types of tea, including black, green, oolong, and decaf tea, contain bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and catechins, which are also found in fruits, vegetables, and dark chocolate, and have been linked to better bone health,” Liu told Medscape Medical News.

However, to date, “there is no convincing evidence that any specific type of tea is more beneficial than others for bone health,” he said.

High consumption of sugar is associated with poorer bone health, so “if tea is consumed, it is preferable to choose unsweetened varieties without added sugar,” Liu said.

First author Ryan Liu, also of the College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, noted that the findings regarding tea are encouraging, even if the benefit is small.

“While calcium and vitamin D remain cornerstones of bone health, what's in your cup could play a role too,” he said. “For older women, enjoying a daily cup of tea may be more than a comforting ritual, it could be a small step toward stronger bones.”

The study had no external funding. The authors had no disclosures to report.

Megan  Brooks

 December 30, 2025  

For adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene, long-term treatment with tofersen (Qalsody, Biogen) was associated with slowed disease progression, longer survival, and improved muscle strength in some patients, final data from the VALOR study and its open-label extension (OLE) show.

Irreversible loss of muscle strength is a foundational symptom of ALS. In the VALOR study, 27% of patients who initiated tofersen early experienced improvements in muscle strength over about 3 years.

“This just does not happen in ALS,” Timothy Miller, MD, PhD, principal investigator of VALOR and ALS Center Director at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said in a Biogen news release.

“In the past, conversations with people living with SOD1-ALS were about how best to manage the progression of the disease; today, these conversations include the potential for how to maximize improvement,” said Miller.

The study was published online on December 22 in JAMA Neurology.

SOD1 mutations account for about 2% of all ALS cases. Over 200 ALS-associated SOD1 mutations have been identified, each associated with a wide range of disease progression rates.

Tofersen is an intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide that binds to SOD1 mRNA to reduce SOD1 protein production. The drug received accelerated approval in the US for SOD1-ALS based on the reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) observed in patients treated in the VALOR study.

VALOR was a 6-month, phase 3 study evaluating the effects of tofersen 100 mg vs placebo in 108 adults with ALS caused by 42 unique SOD1 pathogenic variants — with 72 participants randomized to tofersen (the early-start group) and 36 to placebo (the delayed-start group).

Of the 108 VALOR participants, 95 (88%) enrolled in the OLE (all receiving tofersen) and 46 completed it — 34 in the early-start group and 12 in the placebo/delayed-start group.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, combined 1-year data from VALOR/OLE showed significant and sustained reductions in levels of cerebrospinal SOD1 protein and plasma NfL.

In addition, by 1 year, a first clinical benefit emerged, with stabilization of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores observed in the early-start group compared with the placebo/delayed-start group.

The final VALOR/OLE data showed that reductions in SOD1 and NfL concentrations continued through week 148 in both the early-start and delayed-start groups.

Over 148 weeks, earlier (vs later) initiation of tofersen was associated with a smaller decline in clinical function (9.9 vs 13.5 points in ALSFRS-R score), compared with an expected decline of at least 22 points based on the natural history of ALS.

The investigators noted that the analyses were not powered to detect statistically significant long-term differences between groups because of the small sample size, and that all participants had the opportunity to receive tofersen starting at week 28.

Notably, tofersen treatment led to improvements in strength and function over 3 years in 21%-27% of early-starters, unlike the progressive decline expected — “reinforcing the remarkable impact of tofersen on slowing ALS disease course,” Miller and colleagues wrote.

Tofersen also conferred a survival benefit, with a 36% reduction in risk for death or permanent ventilation in the early-start group and a 48% reduction in risk for death 6 months later compared with the placebo/delayed-start group.

This was particularly notable in patients with ALS due to the most aggressive SOD1 variant (A5V), which typically predicts a 13-month survival. In this subgroup, early tofersen treatment prolonged survival to a median of 23.2 months.

No additional safety concerns emerged with longer-term follow-up. The common adverse events (AEs) were headache, procedural pain, falls, back pain, and extremity pain.

Serious neurological AEs, including myelitis or radiculitis, papilledema and/or increased intracranial pressure, and chemical or aseptic meningitis were reported in nine participants (8.7%). These events were manageable with standard of care and resolved. One myelitis event and one chemical meningitis event led to treatment discontinuation.

The co-authors of a linked editorial in JAMA Neurology said the potential for improvement in strength with tofersen is a “first in the ALS field” [and] would suggest that “re-innervation with recovery of strength is outpacing denervation in certain individuals.”

In the editorial, Lauren Elman, MD, Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, and co-authors noted that the findings offer “hope for the first time that ALS indeed is a treatable disease, not just for the 2% with the SOD1 variant but potentially for all patients with ALS as we define underlying causative factors.”

“Perhaps there will come a day when most patients with ALS will receive therapies that allow re-innervation to outpace denervation and ALS will be reclassified as a manageable disease,” they concluded.

The study was funded by Biogen. Miller reported that resources to complete the study were provided by Biogen during the conduct of the study and reported personal fees from Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Biogen, Arbor Bio, and BioMarin outside the submitted work. Elman reported receiving personal fees for advisory board participation from Biogen, Genentech, Scholar Rock, Novartis, Catalyst, and Edgewise, as well as royalties from UpToDate and consulting fees from Guidepoint and GLG.

Coming out of the 2022 World Cup, as North American attention turned toward 2026, there was a relatively clear hierarchy among the tournament's co-hosts — Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Only one had reached the knockout rounds in Qatar. That same team, the U.S., would go on to win consecutive Concacaf Nations League titles. At the start of this World Cup cycle, the Americans were rising, whereas Mexico was in decline and Canada's trajectory was murky. If you had to pick one of the three to make a run at their home World Cup, the choice, throughout 2023, was clear: the USMNT.

Then, over the years since, the pecking order began oscillating. Mexico rebounded. The U.S. plateaued, then dipped. All three fired and hired coaches. Canada went furthest at the 2024 Copa América but, unlike its rivals, hasn't won a trophy of any kind. All three have spent time as the region's highest-rated team (per Elo).

So, with 2026 upon us, and with World Cup openers roughly six months away, the answer to the question — which home team is best prepared for the tournament? — is very unclear.

The following is an assessment of their men's national team programs and their hopes of meeting the World Cup moment, as their summer in the spotlight nears.

For the U.S., the long and low-pressure runway to this World Cup has been a roller coaster.

It began with unprecedented optimism. After bossing Mexico at the 2023 Nations League finals, newly re-hired head coach Gregg Berhalter said: “If we continue to develop in the way that we have, if this group continues to go where we think they can go, the sky's the limit.”

A year later, they were losing to Colombia 5-1 and crashing out of the Copa América. Berhalter was fired. Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino brought hope, then a barrage of pessimism and doubt, and then — now — the mood has swung again, back to where it was at the start of the cycle.

It crept, cautiously, toward optimism again as the U.S. won friendlies against Japan, Australia and Paraguay this fall, with a draw against Ecuador in between. Then a team of reserves — Pochettino would hate that description, but it's accurate — smoked Uruguay, 5-1. A few weeks later, the USMNT drew a winnable World Cup group, and suddenly, Pochettino and American fans alike were invoking the Miracle on Ice and dreaming.

Pochettino and players have adopted a slogan: “Be realistic, and do the impossible.”

And a realistic “benchmark,” midfielder Tyler Adams said earlier this month, is “the furthest a U.S. team has gone” — which would be a World Cup semifinal or final.

Rationally, such a lofty goal still seems far-fetched. The recent friendlies that sparked renewed hope were, in fact, forgettable friendlies. The team that will likely take the field on June 12 has, due to injuries and other absences, hardly played together under Pochettino. Man for man, they still do not measure up to international soccer's giants.

They do, though, have things they didn't have in 2022 — namely, a striker (Folarin Balogun) and depth. Pochettino's masterplan, to light fires under “regulars” who'd grown too comfortable, has seemingly worked. “The moment that we identified the problems, we started to destroy the things that we need to destroy, and start to build the house from the ground up,” he said in October.

Entering 2026, the house is looking structurally sound. The question, now, is whether Pochettino can add an extra story and take the USMNT to a place it's never been. At the very least, its ceiling now seems higher than Mexico's and Canada's. – Henry Bushnell

This will be Mexico's third opportunity to host a World Cup, and the three host cities (Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey) should leave a wonderful impression on the world. But folklore and culture won't propel Mexico towards a World Cup semifinal. And this version of Mexico has shown to be far too inconsistent to inspire confidence.

Mexico won the Concacaf Nations League in March 2025 and then lifted the Gold Cup trophy in the summer. The Nations League run included a win over Canada in the semifinals. Life was good for head coach Javier Aguirre. It appeared as though the veteran manager had restored the grit and pride that has long defined the Mexico men's national team.

Since then, Mexico has fallen back down to earth. Losses to Switzerland (4-2) in June and Colombia (4-0) in October set Aguirre's project back. Against two World Cup-caliber opponents, Mexico was outplayed, both tactically and physically. Aguirre was dumbfounded by his team's performances in those friendlies, which caused great concern among the fanbase.

Today, Aguirre remains unsettled on a preferred starting XI. Yet, there will be few surprises in the teamsheet when Mexico kicks off the World Cup against South Africa on June 11. And that's where the problem lies for Mexico. The 2026 squad will have some new faces, like 17-year-old midfield prodigy Gilberto Mora of Club Tijuana and Toluca's central midfielder Marcel Ruíz. Santiago Giménez (AC Milan) and Germán Berterame (Monterrey) will compete with Fulham's Raúl Jiménez at the No. 9 position.

But beyond those names, this summer's World Cup squad will resemble the 2022 team that failed to progress from the group stage in Qatar. Mexico is a veteran-led team, and that, perhaps, is its greatest strength. Aguirre must hope that playmakers like Diego Lainez and Alexis Vega, two players who have not lived up to expectations with the national team, deliver top-tier performances next summer.

In recent friendlies against Ecuador, Uruguay and Paraguay, Mexico competed but lacked an attacking edge in the opponent's final third. Mexico battled Ecuador and Uruguay to 1-1 and 0-0 results, respectively, then lost to Paraguay 2-1. Draws against Japan (0-0) and South Korea (2-2) in September left Aguirre grasping for solutions in several key areas of the field, namely both fullback positions and goalkeeper.

On paper, Mexico's Group A opponents won't cause too much concern. There isn't a tournament contender among South Africa, South Korea, and the UEFA playoff entrant (either Denmark, North Macedonia, Czech Republic or Republic of Ireland). And yet still, there's a fear in Mexico that Aguirre's side could flop on home soil. On the other hand, there's hope that national pride and partisan crowds in Mexico City and Guadalajara will inspire Mexico in 2026.

Of the three host nations, Mexico appears to be under the most pressure. That could either spell disaster or push Aguirre and Mexico to do what no other Mexican national team has done in the past – in a good way. – Felipe Cardenas

The World Cup presents different pressures and expectations for Canada than its American and Mexican counterparts. Both Canadian players and Canada Soccer genuinely hope that this tournament irrevocably changes the sports landscape at home.

Canadian sports culture is dominated by hockey. But more children play soccer than any other team sport, and have for a generation. That generation is lacking results and heroes to attach themselves to. When you couple soccer's rise with a shift in demographics and hockey nursing a black eye in the court of public opinion – numerous scandals will do that – you can understand why Canada hopes this tournament becomes a historical inflection point.

Canada's World Cup group features Switzerland, Qatar and the winner of a UEFA playoff (Italy, Wales, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Northern Ireland). Getting to the knockout round for the first time constitutes the bare minimum for a successful World Cup.

Manager Jesse Marsch has done well to prepare his team for this opportunity. Whereas Pochettino spent 2025 rotating players for the United States to better understand his player pool, Marsch narrowed in on a pool of around 30 players and relied on them heavily through the final three international windows.

Canada played 14 games in 2025 and only lost two in regular time. That's fewer regular time losses than Mexico and the U.S. What was lacking, however, and what was a focus of Marsch's work late in the year was the cunning and strategies that will help Canada close out games. Canada lost its cool against lowly Guatemala (106th in the world) in the Gold Cup quarterfinals and suffered an early exit from a tournament it had designs on winning.

Canada was a lot of fun through Marsch's first year in 2024. To his credit, Canada's identity became solidified through 2025: Marsch's version of Red Bull soccer evolved with his player pool. Canada became the most defensively resolute team in Concacaf, allowing just one goal through its final six games – and that's without stalwart defenders Alistair Johnston and Moïse Bombito.

Canada was at its best playing European teams; easily handling Ukraine at home then getting back-to-back wins in Europe for the first time (against Romania and Wales) were highlights. That experience should serve them well at home this summer, where two European teams will be waiting in the group stage.

The most inspiring snapshot of Canada's World Cup readiness came in October. In an intense stadium in New Jersey filled with Colombian fans, Canada held Colombia, then ranked 13th in the world by FIFA, to a 0-0 draw and dominated play for long stretches. This game suggested Canada could grind out a result against a superior team with newfound resoluteness and confidence.

Canada still has to create and score in a way its co-hosts can, so it will still feel like an underdog in a way that Mexico and the United States won't. Yet just as much, its opportunity to surprise and change the way soccer is viewed at home feels like a much bigger motive is at play than that of their co-hosts. – Joshua Kloke","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

Jose Mourinho launched into an extraordinary sarcastic rant after Benfica's 2-2 draw with Braga, as he refused to accept the result, and instead insisted his side won 3-2. Controversial refereeing decisions were at the centre of his complaints, as Braga scored an equaliser after being awarded a penalty for handball, and Benfica's potential winner was ruled out for what appeared to be a soft foul in the build-up. 

Benfica and Braga drew 2-2 on Sunday evening but Mourinho was left fuming after some controversial refereeing. First, with his side leading 1-0, a penalty was awarded for handball, from which Braga equalised before, at 2-2, their potential winner was ruled out for a soft foul. After a cross was blocked, seemingly by a Braga hand, the ball fell to defender Vitor Carvalho, who attempted to clear. Richard Rios closed him down and after a shoulder barge, won the ball back, before squaring to Samuel Dahl, who finished. The referee, inexplicably, blew for a foul, and VAR agreed. Braga did have a man sent off for two yellow cards before full-time, but that did nothing to assuage Mourinho's fury.

Mourinho is no stranger to taking aim at referees, and he chose to do so this time via the medium of sarcasm.

He told reporters: ""Without humor, I congratulate SC Braga on many things. I congratulate the president, because I returned many years later and seeing this training center is fantastic. Congratulations to the team, which is good, to the coach who is building a great team, and even to the fans who create a great atmosphere. As for the game, I think it's a great victory for us. A great first half, in which we conceded two goals, due to two of our own mistakes. In the second half we were very strong, we completely dominated the game, we scored two goals, and winning the game in Braga is very difficult; after being down, winning was very complicated.""

Corrected on the scoreline by a journalist, he replied: ""We won 3-2! That's the football we have, I just do the best I can in my job and dedicate myself as much as I can. I'm not entirely happy with myself because I couldn't do what I wanted for 90 minutes. But we won 3-2, you know I'm speaking ironically, otherwise I would be severely penalised. 

""The club as an institution may or may not do something, possibly following the path we're getting used to and accustomed to. I just train and make the assessment. The fact that we played against SC Braga in a short time means I don't want to go into great tactical analysis. To dissect why they were better in the first half and why we were able to be superior in the second. Good game and good referee, he officiated a positive match, but games and points are decided by these kinds of decisions, and that's what happened.""

Mourinho was particularly unhappy with the fact that VAR backed the referee's initial on-field decision. 

He added: ""Obviously. We scored three clean goals. I repeat, I liked the refereeing, one or two yellow cards, one or two strange criteria, and one or two balls with the game stopped, negating the advantage for the team that wanted to come out. A difficult game to referee, with a good pace, honestly I liked it. 

""When it came time to make the mistake that decided the game, it was witnessed by the gentleman who was in the VAR room. These strange things happen, where there are clubs that win many games with mistakes and others that lose many points with mistakes. There's a long trip ahead and I wanted to leave here with the joy and conviction, even if they call me crazy, that we turned the game around.""

Mourinho will next have a chance to assess the Portuguese league's refereeing quality when Benfica play Estoril on Saturday. Benfica are currently third in the league table, having won 10 and drawn six of their 16 games thus far; while they are unbeaten, they are 10 points behind leaders Porto, who have won 15 and drawn one of their 16 games.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Romy Reiner and her brother Jake Reiner stepped out for a walk on the beach in their first joint sighting since the death of their parents.

On Monday, the siblings put on a united front outside a Malibu, Calif., beach house where they've reportedly been staying since their parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, were tragically murdered earlier this month.

In exclusive photos obtained by Page Six, the siblings appeared downcast while walking side-by-side.

At one point, the group was photographed standing in a circle and talking.

Romy wore a black sweater, jeans and a hat, while Jake wore a T-shirt, gray shorts and a hat for the outing.

Earlier in the day, Romy was seen being comforted by loved ones outside the home.

Romy, who lived across the street from her famous parents, was first seen outside the beach house on Saturday.

Jake joined his sister at the property on Sunday afternoon and was seen taking a somber stroll on the beach with his girlfriend.

The 34-year-old and Romy have been staying under the radar since their parents were murdered at their Brentwood, Calif., home on Dec. 14. 

Romy discovered Rob and Michele's bodies after she went to check up on them when they missed a massage therapy appointment, sources told The Post.

The legendary director, 78, and Michele, 70, were found with multiple stab wounds to their bodies, according to their death certificates.

According to the Post, the couple's youngest son, Nick, was being investigated as a person of interest ahead of his arrest later that evening.

The 32-year-old, who has a past of violence and substance abuse, was reportedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and had his meds changed leading up to the killings.

Dakota Johnson was spotted on a cozy date night with a pop star, seven months after her split from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.

The actress, who parted ways with Martin in June, appears to be moving on, as pictures obtained by TMZ showed her getting cozy with singer Role Model.

In the photos, Johnson and Role Model enjoy a candlelit dinner along with some friends. Onlookers told the outlet that the pair got “very close” during the dinner date. The source added that Johnson was “lying on him all cuddled up” at one point.

So far, both Johnson and Role Model have yet to address the dating rumors about them.

Role Model, whose real name is Tucker Harrington Pillsbury, is a singer-songwriter and former rapper. His debut studio album, “RX,” was released in 2022. In 2024, he released his second album, “Kansas Anymore.”

Aside from his music career, Role Model also turned to acting. He is set to star in Lena Dunham's rom-com film “Good Sex” alongside Natalie Portman and Mark Ruffalo. The movie is slated to premiere in 2027.

The singer's last known relationship was with influencer Emma Chamberlain. The two called it quits in 2023, after dating for three years, according to TMZ.

Meanwhile, Johnson and Martin had an on-off relationship for eight years before calling it quits for good in June. According to the Daily Mail, the two called off their engagement at the time and accepted that the relationship was over.

“Chris and Dakota have tried desperately hard over the past few months to make their relationship work,” a source told the outlet at the time. “They'll always have love for each other but they've both come to the conclusion the relationship cannot be sustained long-term.”

The source continued, “They wanted it to work, but it just hasn't, and they've now accepted it is best to move on.”

Recently, Martin has been romantically linked with “Game of Thrones” star Sophie Turner. According to a report by The Daily Mail, the actress went on a “secret date” with the singer after she and her aristocrat boyfriend, Peregrine “Perry” Pearson, broke up.

Meanwhile, fans took to the comment section to share their thoughts about Johnson's rumored new boyfriend.

One fan wrote, “I'm loving these two together,” while another chimed in, “Obsessed with this match up.”

Tom Brady is a celebrated sportsman, but he is also a dad, and during the Christmas holidays, he got to spend some quality time with all three of his kids. The former NFL superstar shared a photo of himself and his three children on Instagram, and fans have reacted with loving messages. 

Brady is a dad to three kids: His firstborn is son John “Jack” Edward Thomas, whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan. He also has two children with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, a son, Benjamin Rein, and a daughter, Vivian Lake (who looks strikingly similar to her supermodel mom). In the photo, Brady is posing in the middle of his children. They appear to be on a boat, and you can see the water behind them. 

He shared his thoughts in the caption, writing, “Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. Sending our love always – The Bradys.” Fans flooded the post with messages, eager to share their thoughts on Brady's children and how big they have gotten! 

“Jack is so so handsome wow,” a comment reads. “Your children have grown up so fast! They are getting as tall as you!!,” another fan shared. Other reactions include, “She looks like her mama,” “They are really growing up fast,” and “This is all ya need in life tom!!!”

Brady and Moynahan had already broken up when they learned she was pregnant. Jack was born on August 22, 2007, in Santa Monica, California. At the time, Bündchen and Brady had already started dating. 

Bündchen has discussed the situation and how it was initially challenging, but she also praised Moynahan in a 2018 interview with People. ​​”But I'm so grateful for [Bridget]. I know this was hard, but I couldn't imagine my life without [Jack]. I call him my bonus child,” she said. “He opened my heart in ways I didn't even know my heart could expand. I fell in love with him.”

Benjamin was born on December 8, 2009, and his sister Vivian was born on December 5, 2012. Brady was thrilled to become a girl dad. ​​”I grew up in a house with three sisters. I think it's great for my boys to have a girl in the house, just to understand at least a little bit about what makes a woman tick — not that I can certainly figure that out, because I can't,” he told ESPN days after his daughter's birth. “She's a beautiful little girl.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","The Kuntilanak Files","https://vocal.media/psyche/the-kuntilanak-files","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:44:56 GMT","

Indonesia is a country where the modern world never fully erased the old one. Glass towers rise beside centuries-old banyan trees. Smartphones glow in villages where spirits are still spoken of in whispers. In many parts of the archipelago, the supernatural is not dismissed—it is managed, respected, avoided.Among these beliefs, few names carry as much fear as Kuntilanak.Traditionally, the Kuntilanak is described as the spirit of a woman who died during childbirth—her grief twisting into something violent and restless. Pale-faced, long-haired, dressed in white, she is said to appear at night, often announced by the sound of soft laughter or a baby crying. In folklore, she haunts forests, abandoned houses, and roadside trees. She is not a metaphor. She is a warning.For generations, these stories remained where stories usually belong: around fires, in village advice, in cautionary tales meant to keep children close to home after dark.Until the deaths began.In the late 2000s and early 2010s, a pattern emerged across parts of Java, Kalimantan, and Sumatra that unsettled even seasoned investigators. The cases were not identical, but they echoed one another in troubling ways. Young men—often students, amateur paranormal investigators, or urban explorers—were found dead near abandoned locations tied to Kuntilanak lore.At first, authorities treated each death separately. Accidents. Exposure. Falls. Natural causes compounded by risky behavior.But local communities noticed something else.The locations were wrong.The timing was wrong.And the behavior of the victims before death was… off.One of the earliest widely discussed cases involved a university student in West Java who had joined a small group dedicated to documenting haunted sites for social media. Their goal was not worship or provocation—at least publicly—but proof. They filmed night visits to abandoned houses, cemeteries, and forest edges. Their content gained traction. Fear, after all, travels well online.According to friends, the student began experiencing disturbances weeks before his death. Sleep paralysis. Nightmares involving a woman laughing behind him. Sudden mood shifts. He became withdrawn, irritable, convinced that something was “following” him.They assumed stress.One night, he returned alone to an abandoned colonial-era building rumored to be a Kuntilanak site. His camera was later found intact. The footage ended abruptly, mid-sentence, as if he had turned suddenly toward a sound.His body was discovered the next morning beneath a staircase.There were no defensive wounds. No signs of assault. The autopsy cited internal injuries consistent with a fall.But the locals focused on something else.His face, witnesses said, was frozen in terror.More cases followed.In Central Java, two young men were found dead in a forest clearing after attempting a ritual they had read about online—one meant to “summon” or “record” paranormal entities. One died at the scene. The other survived long enough to be hospitalized, where he reportedly screamed about a woman sitting on his chest at night.He died three days later from organ failure.Doctors could not link the deaths to toxins or known disease. Stress-induced complications were mentioned. The files closed quietly.But the stories did not.By this point, Indonesian social media had already connected the dots. Videos surfaced showing shadowy figures, unexplained sounds, distorted faces caught in reflections. Most were easily debunked. Some were not.Then came the Kalimantan case that changed the tone entirely.A group of construction workers clearing land near a long-abandoned village reported nightly disturbances. Tools moved. Voices heard. One worker fled the site claiming a woman in white followed him through the trees. Days later, another worker was found dead near a large fig tree. No visible injuries. No signs of struggle.The project was halted after elders from a nearby village intervened, insisting the land was known Kuntilanak territory and had been avoided for decades.This was no longer just internet folklore.Authorities were placed in an impossible position. Acknowledge supernatural causation and risk panic—or reduce everything to coincidence and offend deeply held cultural beliefs.Official explanations remained clinical. Accidents. Psychological stress. Mass suggestion. Environmental hazards.Privately, some investigators admitted discomfort.What made the Kuntilanak Files different from typical ghost stories was the consistency of behavior before death. Victims reported similar experiences across regions that did not share immediate cultural circles. Nightmares. Pressure on the chest. The sensation of being watched. A fixation on returning to specific locations.Psychologists proposed sleep paralysis combined with cultural expectation—a known phenomenon where the mind fills terror with familiar symbols. But that explanation weakens when the final outcomes are fatal.No drugs. No poisons. No physical attackers.Just bodies and fear.The Indonesian government never officially linked the cases. But internally, some law enforcement documents reportedly advised officers to consult local religious leaders when dealing with deaths tied to supernatural belief systems. Not for investigation—but for prevention.The advice was simple:Don't provoke what you don't understand.In traditional belief, the Kuntilanak is not mindless. She appears when disturbed. When mocked. When summoned without respect. Modern behavior—cameras, flashlights, viral challenges—violates every boundary these stories were meant to enforce.This clash between digital bravado and ancient taboo may be the true heart of the mystery.Whether the Kuntilanak exists as a literal entity or as a psychological weapon shaped by belief, the outcome is the same. People died. And they died believing something was with them in their final moments.Today, many of the most notorious sites are quietly avoided. Content creators move on to safer myths. Elders still warn travelers not to laugh at night near certain trees. Not because they expect outsiders to believe—but because belief is not required for consequences.The Kuntilanak Files remain open, unofficially.Not because science failed.But because some questions refuse to stay within neat categories.In Indonesia, the past does not sleep easily.And some legends, when dragged into the light, do not fade—they follow.

Writing about what moves us, breaks us, and makes us human — psychology, love, fear, and the endless maze of thought.

      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are diverse and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed cases, along with the perspectives of various Redditors:
    


      Many Redditors find the statements from high-ranking officials and credible individuals particularly compelling:
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""It is time for the truth to be brought out. Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      Personal accounts, especially when detailed and potentially corroborated, are often considered convincing:
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: A Redditor describes seeing a silent, rectangular craft with curved corners and three large, dim, almost organic lights. ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



      Another Redditor shared a similar experience: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



      When multiple sightings match in description, it can add credibility:
    


Portugal and San Diego Sightings: A Redditor highlights the striking similarity between a UFO sighting in Portugal from the 90s and a video from San Diego in 2015. ""The ufo that the San Diego man recorded, matches exactly like the one reported in the Portugal sighting...""



      Another Redditor notes: ""There's definitely credibility with consistency in sightings, provided that these are two separate instances""



      While rare, official reports can offer a more objective perspective:
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: The Condon Committee report suggested a mechanical device of unknown origin. ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting.""



      It's important to consider skeptical explanations, which are also prevalent on Reddit:
    


Factual Errors in Official Accounts: One Redditor points out factual inaccuracies in the list of credible people, which can undermine the overall credibility. [""

President Donald Trump warned the US could carry out further military strikes against Iran if it attempts to rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. He made the remarks to journalists alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday.

In June, the US and Israel carried out coordinated airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, claiming they were intended to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program. Tehran has vehemently denied seeking nuclear weapons and condemned the strikes as unprovoked violations of its sovereignty. Iranian officials have stated that the damaged facilities will be rebuilt and uranium enrichment will continue.

“If it's confirmed, they know the consequences, and the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time,” Trump said on Monday. “We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.”

The US president indicated he would “absolutely” support Israeli military action against Iran's missile program, saying the US would act “immediately” against any nuclear advances.

.@POTUS on Iran: ""I hope they're not trying to build up again, because if they are, we're going to have no choice but very quickly to eradicate that buildup. So, I hope Iran is not trying to build up, as I've been reading."" pic.twitter.com/vcrqEQqA3J

“We know exactly where they're going, what they're doing, and I hope they're not doing it, because we don't want to waste the fuel on a B-2 – it's a 37-hour trip both ways,” he added.

Trump noted it would be “much smarter” for Tehran to “make a deal” with Washington, claiming that Iran missed an opportunity “the last time, before we went through a big attack on them.”

Omani-mediated US-Iran negotiations were suspended earlier this year after Washington joined Israel's 12-day bombing campaign. In October, the EU and UK reimposed sanctions on Iran, which had been lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear deal that the US withdrew from during Trump's first term in office. Tehran has since said it is no longer bound by the 2015 agreement.

Iran has insisted it remains open to reaching a deal with the US, but only if Washington stops setting what Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi previously described as “impossible and unacceptable preconditions.”

In a statement shared on Instagram, Nguyen says she faced a ‘tsunami of harassment' after the all-female spaceflight

Amanda Nguyen, the Vietnamese-American astronaut who was part of the all-female Blue Origin spaceflight, has opened up about her depression after she experienced a “tsunami of harassment” after the trip, in which she became the first Vietnamese woman to go to space.

Nguyen, 34, was part of April's historic 11-minute flight, whose crew included pop star Katy Perry, broadcast journalist Gayle King, and journalist and wife of Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sánchez. The flight was heavily criticized for its environmental impact and critics questioned its purpose and use of resources.

For Nguyen, who is a civil rights activist for sexual assault survivors as well as a bioastronautics research scientist, she said the backlash to flight saw her professional achievements and dreams “buried under an avalanche of misogyny”.

In a lengthy statement shared on Instagram on Tuesday, she said that when King called to check on her days after the flight, “I told her my depression might last for years.”

She said the volume of news coverage and social media reaction to the trip was so “unprecedented” that even a “small fraction of negativity becomes staggering”. “It amounted to billions of hostile impressions,” she said, “an onslaught no human brain has evolved to endure”.

“I did not leave Texas for a week, unable to get out of bed. A month later, when a senior staff at Blue [Origin] called me, I had to hang up on him because I could not speak through my tears,” she wrote.

In an interview with the Guardian in March, Nguyen said she had put her lifelong ambition of becoming an astronaut on hold after another student raped her at university and she pursued a years-long fight for justice, which she described as “all-consuming”. In 2019, her activism for sexual assault survivors led to Nguyen being nominated for the Nobel peace prize and in 2022, she was one of Time magazine's women of the year.

The onslaught after the spaceflight made her feel like “collateral damage”, Nguyen said: “my moment of justice mutilated.”

“In my moments of deep grief this year, I reached back out to a familiar place, to her – my survivor self – who found the strength to fight. How horrible that I needed to deploy that skill once again,” she said.

Now, eight months on from realising her dream of going to space, Nguyen said the “fog of grief has started to lift”, and thanked those who have supported her and sent her well wishes. “Vietnam saved me … You all saved me,” she wrote.

Nguyen, whose parents arrived in the US as refugees after fleeing Vietnam after the fall of Saigon, went on: “When Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon, bombs rained down on Vietnam. This year, when my boat refugee family looked at the sky, instead of bombs they saw the first Vietnamese woman in space.

“We came on boats, and now we're on spaceships,” she said.

Despite the backlash, she said there had been “overwhelming good that has come out of [the flight],” including the media attention brought to her women's health research and opportunities to meet world leaders in relation to her advocacy for rape survivors.

“It is the greatest gift this holiday season that I can feel the fog lifting,” Nguyen wrote. “I can tell Gayle it's not going to take years.”

She ended her post with a photo of herself as a young student at Harvard, captioned: “For her.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

It seems they want to make these settings usable without specialist knowledge, but the end result of their opaque naming and vague descriptions is that anybody who actually cares about what they see and thinks they might benefit from some of the features has to either systematically try every possible combination of options or teach themselves video engineering and try to figure out for themselves what each one actually does.This isn't unique to TVs. It's amazing really how much effort a company will put into adding a feature to a product only to completely negate any value it might have by assuming any attempt at clearly documenting it, even if buried deep in a manual, will cause their customers' brains to explode.

(The trickiest thing is actually brightness. LG originally used to set brightness to 100 nits in Filmmaker Mode for SDR, which is correct dark room behavior -- but a lot of people aren't in dark rooms and want brighter screens, so they changed it to be significantly brighter. Defensible, but it now means that if you are in a dark room, you have to look up which brightness level is close to 100 nits.)

I'd suggest living with it for a while; if you do, you'll quickly get used to it, and then going to the ""standard"" (sic) setting will look too blue.

It makes me wish that there was something like an industry standard 'calibrated' mode that everyone could target - let all the other garbage features be a divergence from that. Hell, there probably is, but they'd never suggest a consumer use that and not all of their value-add tackey DSP.

reply

When you say that ""HDR is static"" you probably mean that ""Dynamic tone-mapping"" was turned off. This is also correct behavior. Dynamic tone-mapping isn't about using content settings to do per-scene tone-mapping (that's HDR10+ or Dolby Vision, though Samsung doesn't support the latter), it's about just yoloing the image to be brighter and more vivid than it should be rather than sticking to the accurate rendering.What you're discovering here is that the reason TV makers put these ""garbage features"" in is that a lot of people like a TV picture that's too vivid, too blue, too bright. If you set it to the true standard settings, people's first impression is that it looks bad, as yours was. (But if you live with it for a while, it'll quickly start to look good, and then when you look at a blown-out picture, it'll look gross.)

“Filmmaker Mode” on LG OLED was horrible. Yes, all of the “extra” features were off, but it was overly warm and unbalanced as hell. I either don't understand “Filmmakers” or that mode is intended to be so bad that you will need to fix it yourself.

reply

TV producers always set their sets to way higher by default because blue tones show off colors better.As a result of both that familiarity and the better saturation, most people don't like filmmaker when they try to use it at first. After a few weeks, though, you'll be wondering why you ever liked the oversaturated neons and severely off brightness curve of other modes.Or not, do whatever you want, it's your TV!

It would also help if there was a common, universal, perfect ""reference TV"" to aim for (or multiple such references for different use cases), with the job of the TV being to approximate this reference as closely as possible.Alas, much like documenting the features, this would turn TVs into commodities, which is what consumers want, but TV vendors very much don't.

Watch An American Werewolf in London, Strange Days, True Lies, Blade Runner, or any other movie from the film era all up to the start of digital, and you can see that the sets are incredibly well lit. On film they couldn't afford to reshoot and didn't have immediate view of what everything in the frame resulted on, so they had to be conservative. They didn't have per-pixel brightness manipulation (feathering and burning were film techniques that could technically have been applied per frame, but good luck with doing that at any reasonable expense or amount of time). They didn't have hyper-fast color film-stock they could use (ISO 800 was about the fastest you could get), and it was a clear downgrade from anything slower.The advent of digital film-making when sensors reached ISO 1600/3200 with reasonable image quality is when the allure of time/cost savings of not lighting heavily for every scene showed its ugly head, and by the 2020's you get the ""Netflix look"" from studios optimizing for ""the cheapest possible thing we can get out the door"" (the most expensive thing in any production is filming in location, a producer will want to squeeze every minute of that away, with the smallest crew they could get away with).

On my TCL TV I can turn off ""smart"" image and a bunch of other crap, and there's a ""standard"" image mode. But I'm not convinced that's actually ""as close to reference as the panel can get"". One reason is that there is noticeable input lag when connected to a pc, whereas if I switch it to ""pc"", the lag is basically gone, but the image looks different. So I have no idea which is the ""standard"" one.Ironically, when I first turned it on, all the ""smart"" things were off.

It wasn't that long ago, that the manual spelled out everything in detail enough that a kid could understand, absorb, and decide he was going to dive into his own and end up in the industry. I wouldn't have broken or created nearly as much, without it.But, a few things challenged the norm. For many, many reasons, manuals became less about the specification and more about the functionality. Then they became even more simplified, because of the need to translate it into thirty different languages automatically. And even smaller, to discourage people from blaming the company rather than themselves, by never admitting anything in the manual.What I would do for a return to fault repair guides [0].[0] https://archive.org/details/olivetti-linea-98-service-manual...

It's so obvious in hindsight. Shows like the Big Bang theory, House and Scrubs I very rarely caught two episodes consecutively (and when I did they were on some release schedule so you'd forgotten half of the plot by next week). But they are all practically self contained with only the thread of a longer term narrative being woven between them.It's doubtful that any of these netflix series you could catch one random episode and feel comfortable that you understand what's going on. Perhaps worse is the recent trend for mini-series which are almost exactly how you describe - just a film without half of it being left on the cutting room floor.

If John dumped Jane at the beginning of the episode, they had to get back together at the end, otherwise the viewer who had to go to her son's wedding that week wouldn't know what was going on. There was no streaming, recaps were few and far between, and not everybody had access to timeshifting, so you couldn't just rely on everybody watching the episode later and catching up.Sometimes you'd get a two-episode sequence; Jane cheated on John in episode 1 but they got back together in episode 2. Sometimes the season finale would permanently change some detail (making John and Jane go from being engaged to being married). Nevertheless, episodes were still mostly independent.AFAIK, this changed with timeshifting, DVRs, online catchup services and then streaming. If viewers have the ability to catch up on a show, even when they can't watch it during first broadcast, you can tell a long, complex, book-sized story instead of many independent short-stories that just happen to share a universe.Personally, I much prefer the newer format, just as I prefer books to short stories.

This is not true as a generality. e.g. soap operas had long-running stories long before DVRs. Many prime-time dramas and comedies had major event episodes that changed things dramatically (character deaths, weddings, break-ups, etc.), e.g. the whole ""Who shot J.R."" event on *Dallas*. Almost all shows that I watched as a kid in the 80s had gradual shifts in character relationships over time (e.g. the on-again/off-again relationship between Sam and Diane on Cheers). Child actors on long-running shows would grow up and the situations on the show changed to account for that as they move from grade school, to high school, to college or jobs.

Sitcoms are - and I know this is a little condescending to point out - comedies contrived to exist in a particular situation: situation comedy → sitcom.In the old day, the ""situation"" needed to be relatively relatable and static to allow drop-in viewers channel surfing, or the casual viewer the parent described.Soap operas and other long-running drama series are built differently: they are meant to have long story arcs that keep people engaged in content over many weeks, months or years. There are throwbacks to old storylines, there are twists and turns to keep you watching, and if you miss an episode you get lost, so you don't ever miss an episode - or the soap adverts within them, their reason for being for which they are named - in case you are now behind with everything.You'll find sports networks try to build the story arc around games too - create a sense of ""missing out"" if you don't watch the big game live.I think the general point is that in the stream subscription era, everything has become like this ""don't miss out"" form, by doubling down on the need to see everything from the beginning and become a completist.You can't easily have a comedy show like Cheers or Married... With Children, in 2026, because there's nothing to keep you in the ""next episode"" loop in the structure, so you end up with comedies with long-running arcs like Schitt's Creek.The last set of sitcoms that were immune to this were probably of the Brooklyn 99, Cougartown and Modern Family era - there were in-jokes for the devotees, but you could pick up an episode easily mid-series and just dive in and not be totally lost.Interesting exception: Tim Allen has managed to get recommissioned with an old style format a couple of times, but he's had to make sure he's skewing to an older audience (read: it's a story of Republican guys who love hunting), for any of it to make sense to TV execs.

This doesn't make sense; no show I know from that time followed that principle - and for good reason, because they'd get boring the moment the viewer realizes that nothing ever happens on them, because everything gets immediately undone or rendered meaningless. Major structural changes get restored at the end (with exceptions), but characters and the world are gradually changing.> If John dumped Jane at the beginning of the episode, they had to get back together at the end, otherwise the viewer who had to go to her son's wedding that week wouldn't know what was going on.This got solved with ""Last time on ${series name}"" recaps at the beginning of the episode.

This is the point. There persistent changes in these shows tended to be very minor. Nothing big ever happened that wasn't fully resolved by the time the credits rolled unless it was a 2-part episode, and then it was reset by the end of the second episode.

Go back and watch any two episodes (maybe not the season finale) from the same season of Star Trek TOS or TNG, or Cheers, or MASH, or Friends, or any other prime time show at all prior to 1990. You won't be able to tell which came first, certainly not in any obvious way. (Networks didn't really even have the concept of specific episode orders in that era. Again looking back to Babylon 5 which was a pioneer in the ""ongoing plot arc"" space, the network deliberately shuffled around the order of a number of first-season episodes because they wanted to put stronger stories earlier to hook viewers, even though doing so left some character development a bit nonsensical. You can find websites today where fans debate whether it's best to watch the show in release order or production order or something else.)By and large, we all just understood that ""nothing ever happens"" with long-term impact on a show, except maybe from season to season. (I think I even remember the standard ""end of episode reset"" being referenced in a comedy show as a breaking-the-fourth-wall joke.) Yes, you'd get character development in a particular episode, but it was more about the audience understanding the character better than about immediate, noticeable changes to their life and behavior. At best, the character beats from one season would add up to a meaningful change in the next season. At least that's my memory of how it tended to go. Maybe there were exceptions! But this really was the norm.

Heh I was going to reply ""B5 is better than TNG"", but thought ""better check all the replies first"". Wherever there's discussion of extended plots there's one of us nerds. (If anyone hasn't seen it... yes half the first season is rough, but you get a season's worth of ""The Inner Light""-quality episodes by the end and for all the major characters; TNG, while lovely, has just a few because there's so little character development besides Picard)

Lots of novelizations fall into this category. Most decently dense and serious novels cannot be done justice to in 2 hours. The new TV formats have enabled substantial stories to be told well.The Godfather parts I and II is just one story cut in half in a convenient place. Why not cut it into 4 50 minute eps and an 80 minute finale?

The alternative is the 1980s version of Dune, which tried to fit a massive novel into a single mass-market film runtime. It was fantastic, but people who hadn't read the novel were left very short on story. The newer movies I've heard are much better in this regard, and it's understandable because the runtime of the combined films is longer. The Dune 2000 (AKA SciFi Presents Frank Herbert's Dune) miniseries was even better in some ways than the original film, largely for the same reasons.Ender's Game deserved to be at least two parts, because even the main character got no real character development. You barely learn Val exists, there's really no Peter, and you barely meet Bean or Petra. There's no Alai, Achilles, Fly, or Crazy Tom. There's no zero-G battles at Battle School. The computer game is never even mentioned but is integral to the book. I don't think it's even mentioned in the film that Ender is a third child and why that's important. It could have been a much better film in two or three parts.

TNG: You get e.g. changes in political relationships between major powers in the Alpha/Beta quadrant, several recurring themes (e.g. Ferengi, Q, Borg), and continuous character development.

In a way, this is IMO a golden standard for how to do this: most episodes were still relatively independent of each other, but the long story arcs were also visible and pushed forward.VOY: Different to DS9, with one overarching plot (coming home) that got pushed forward most episodes, despite individual episodes being mostly watchable in random order. They've figured out a way to have things have accumulating impact without strong serialization.> Last season of TNG they introduced the fact that warp was damaging subspace. That fact was forgotten just a few episodes later.True, plenty of dropped arcs in TNG in particular. But often for the better, like in the ""damaging subspace"" aspect - that one was easy to explain away (fixing warp engines) and was a bad metaphor for ecological anyway; conceptually interesting, but would hinder subsequent stories more than help.

Buffy is a great example: plenty of monster of the week episodes, but also season long arcs and character progression that rewarded continuity. The X-Files deliberately ran two tracks in parallel: standalone cases plus the mythology episodes. Lost was essentially built around long arcs and cliffhangers, it just had to make that work on a weekly broadcast cadence.What's changed is the delivery mechanism, not the existence of serialisation. When your audience gets one episode a week, with mid-season breaks, schedule slips, and multi-year gaps between seasons, writers have to fight a constant battle to re-establish context and keep casual viewers from falling off. That's why even heavily serialised shows from that era often kept an episodic spine. It's a retention strategy as much as a creative choice.Streaming and especially season drops flip that constraint. When episodes are on demand and many viewers watch them close together, the time between chapters shrinks from weeks to minutes. That makes it much easier to sustain dense long-form narrative, assume recent recall, and let the story behave more like a novel than a syndicated procedural.So the pattern isn't new. On demand distribution just finally makes the serialised approach work as reliably at scale as it always wanted to.

How does completely dropping a season flip that? Some shows with complicated licensing and rights have caused entire seasons to be dropped from a given streaming service and it's very confusing when you finish season N and go right into season N+2.

Multi-year gaps between seasons is a modern thing, not from the era you're talking about.  Back then there would reliably be a new season every year, often with only a couple of months between the end of one and the beginning of the next.

In a show like Stranger Things, almost none of the episodes are individually memorable or watchable on their own. They depend too much on the surrounding episodes.Compare to e.g. Strange New Worlds, which tells large stories over the course of a season, but each episode is also a self-contained story. Which in turn allows for more variety and an overall richer experience, since you can have individual episodes experiment with wacky deviations from the norm of the show. Not all of those experiments will land for everybody (musical episodes tend to be quite divisive, for example), but there is a density to the experience that a lot of modern TV lacks.

Which in turn allows for more variety and an overall richer experience, since you can have individual episodes experiment with wacky deviations from the norm of the show.

Our need to turn up the volume in dialog scenes and turn it back down again in action scenes (for both new and old content) got a lot less when we added a mid-range soundbar and sub to our mid-range TV (previously was using just the TV speakers). I'm not sure whether it's sound separation - now we have a ‘more proper' center channel - or that the ends of the spectrum - both bass and treble - are less muddy. Probably a combination of the two.

reply

Now, we have ""satellite"" speakers that are smaller than the tweeter and are touted as being all that's necessary. Sound bars are also using speakers the size of an old tweeter just in an array with separation between left/right sides smaller than the width of the TV. Some how, we let the marketing people from places like Bose convince us that you can make the same sound from tiny speakers.Multichannel mixes used to also include a dedicated stereo mix for those mere mortals without dedicated surround setups. These were created in the same studio with mixing decisions made based on the content. Now, we just get downmixes made by some math equation on a chip that has no concept of what the content is and just applies rules.

I also think the focus on surround means people don't consider stereo speakers. Good bookshelf speakers are better than surround kits and easier to install. I also wonder if normal speakers are no longer cool.Finally, I wonder if people don't like the big receivers. There are small amplifiers but I can't find one that works in home theater with HDMI port.

But here's the thing: Most movies are mixed for 5.1 or more surround setups, where the front middle speaker has most of the dialog. Just boost that speaker either via setting or in a stereo/virtual surround  by a significant amount and add some volume compression and you get something that's reasonable on a home theater setup.[0] https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/16/tenet-up-listen...

It only works if you're watching in a room that's acoustically quiet, like a professional recording studio. Once your heater / air conditioner or other appliance turns on, it drowns out everything but the loudest parts of the mix.Otherwise, the problem is that you probably don't want to listen to ear-splitting gunshots and explosions, then turn it down to a normal volume, only to make the dialog and whispers unintelligible. I hit this problem a lot watching TV after the kids go to bed.

As much as I enjoy deafeningly bright explosions in the movie theater, it's almost never appropriate in the casual living room.I recently bought a new TV, Bravia 8ii, which was supposedly not bright enough according to reviewers. In it's professional setting, it's way to bright at night, and being an OLED watching HDR content the difference between the brightest and darkest is simply too much, and there seems to be no way to turn it down without compromising the whole brightness curve.

It's the obsession with accents, mixed with the native speakers' conviction that vowels are the most important part.Older movies tended to use some kind of unplaceable (""mid atlantic"") accent, that could be easily understood.But modern actors try to imitate accents and almost always focus on the vowels. Most native speakers seem to be convinced that vowels are the most important part of English, but I think it isn't true.  Sure, English has a huge number of vowels, but they are almost completely redundant. It's hard to find cases where vowels really matter for comprehension, which is why they may vary so much across accents without impeding communication. So what the actors do is that they focus on the vowels, but slur the consonants, and you are pretty much completely lost without the consonants.

IMO, half the issue with audio is that stereo systems used to be a kind of status symbol, and you used to see more tower speakers or big cabinets at friends' houses. We had good speakers 20 years ago and good speakers today, but sound bars aren't good.

reply

They do sound pretty much ok for very discreet objects compared to tower speaker. I only occasionally rant when sound skip a beat because of WiFi or other smart-assery. (Nb: of course I never ever activated the smart assistant, I use them purely as speakers).

reply

Lower spec speakers have become good enough, and DSP has improved to the point that tiny speakers can now output mediocre/acceptable sound. The effect of this is that the midrange market is kind of gone, replaced with neat but still worse products such as soundbars (for AV use) or even portable speakers instead of hi-fi systems.On the high end, I think amplified multi-way speakers with active crossovers are much more common now thanks to advances in Class-D amplifiers.

Film makers want to preserve dynamic range so they can render sounds both subtle and with a lot of punch, preserving detail, whereas ads just want to be heard as much as possible.Ads will compress sound so it sounds uniform, colorless and as clear and loud as possible for a given volume.

She shouldn't need to constantly adjust sound volume or settings, or spend another thousand on equipment and refurbishment to access to decent sound.In contrast, they say the old TV that's now at nan's house has much better sound (even if the screen is smaller) and are thinking of swapping the TVs since nan moved back in with my mum.

Phone/tablet/laptop etc. in my top comment was not a technological limitation, like ""oh no, we don't have a port or protocol to connect o speakers and so we can't use them"". It was a logistical limitation. Like being physically in place without speakers or possibility to even buy them. Traveling, renting, having big family and only one set of speakers, and so on. Situations where you can't just pluck a Dolby setup from a thin air but do still watch movies.Here is a datapoint - in the whole world around 1-2 *billion* headphones are sold, every single year. I would bet that at least a double digit percentage of those numbers had been used to watch a movie at least once. Proposing that all those people in all those situations bought themselves a surround speaker setup just to understand voice track in the movies is an inane take.

Voice boost makes the dialogue louder.Everyone in the house loves these two settings and can tell when they are off.

Depending on what you're using there could be settings like stereo downmix or voice boost that can help. Or see if the media you're watching lets you pick a stereo track instead of 5.1

reply

Also, in consumer setups with a center channel speaker it is rather common for it to have a botched speaker design and be of a much poorer quality than the front speakers and actually have a deleterious effect to dialog clarity.

reply

Try listening to some mono pink noise on a stereo loudspeaker setup, first hard-panned to a single speaker, and then centered. The effect is especially obvious when you move your head.

Yes we know how to mix for stereo. But do we still pay attention to how we do?

It mostly boils down to filmmaker choices:1. Conscious and purposeful. Like choosing ""immersion"" instead of ""clarity"". Yeah, nothing speaks ""immersion"" than being forced to put subtitles on...2. Not purposeful. Don't atttibute to malice what can be explained by incompetency... Bad downmixing (from Atmos to lesser formats like 2.0). Even if they do that, they are not using the technology ordinary consumers have. I mean, the most glaring example is the way the text/titles/credits size on screen have been shrinking to the point of having difficulties reading them. Heck, often I have difficulties with text size on by FullHD TV, just because the editing was done on some kind of fancy 4k+ display standing 1m from the editor. Imagine how garbage it looks on 720 or ordinary 480!For the recent example check the size (and the font used) of the movie title in the Alien Isolation movie and compare it to the movies made in the 80-90s. It's ridiculous!There are many good youtube videos that explain the problem in more details.https://youtu.be/VYJtb2YXae8https://youtu.be/wHYkEfIEhO4

I use a Playstation 5 for everything including Netflix, Apple TV and so on. But every time I turn on the PS5, my TV detects the Playstation and automatically changes the TV's Sound and Video modes to ""Gaming"", which makes dialog difficult to hear on TV. So I change the setting manually using its horrible remote control, only for it to change back to Gaming the next time I use it.

reply

What you describe about it being hard to hear dialog is exactly what I'd expect from someone who has their TV turned down as a result of using the score/soundtrack and loud sound effects as a reference point, which consequently is too low a volume to hear the dialog.I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually experiencing what your TV's processing turned off is like and sound balancing is actually what you (as in you, personally) _want_ it to be doing.

I agree with you though. We have a Sony Bravia purchased back in 2016 for $900. It has thr Android TV spam/bloat/spyware but it's not used and never connects to the Internet which has made the TV quite usable over the years. Apple TV is connected, Sonos too, and everything works fine without any crazy settings changes. I'm not looking forward to whenever this thing needs replaced (which will likely be it actually breaking versus being outdated).

reply

Something that recently changed my viewpoint a little bit was that I was noticing that 24-30 fps content was appearing very choppy. I couldn't figure out why it looked like that. It turns out it's because modern OLED TVs can switch frames very cleanly and rapidly, CRTs or older LCDs were not like that, and their relative slowness in switching frames created a smoothing or blending effect.Now I'm considering turning back on my TVs motion smoothing. I'm just hoping it doesn't do full-blown frame interpolation that makes everything look like a Mexican soap opera.

To be fair, 24p is crap. You know and agree with that, right? Horizontal pans in 24p are just completely unwatchable garbage, verticals aren't that much better, action sequences in 24p suck, and I somehow didn't fully realize this until a few years ago.A lot of motion-smoothing TVs are indeed changing framerate constantly, they're adaptive and it switches based on the content. I suspect this is one reason kids these days don't get the soap-opera effect reaction to high framerate that old timers who grew up watching 24p movies and 60i TV do. They're not used to 24p being the gold standard anymore, and they watch 60p all the time, so 60p doesn't look weird to them like it does to us.TVs with motion interpolation fix the horizontal pan problem, so they have at least one thing going for them. I'm serious. Sometimes the smoothing messes up the content or motion, it has real and awful downsides. I had to watch Game of Thrones with frame interp, and it troubled me and it ruins some shots, but on the whole it was a net positive because there were so many horiz pans that literally hurt my eyeballs in 24p.Consumers, by and large, don't seem to care about brightness, color, or framerate that much, unless it's really bad. And most content doesn't (and shouldn't) depend on brightness, color, or framerate that much. With some real and obvious exceptions, of course. But on the whole I hope that's also something film school taught you, that you design films to be resilient to changes in presentation. When we used to design content for analog TV, where there was no calibration and devices in the wild were all over the map, you couldn't count on anything about the presentation. Ever had to deal with safe regions? You lost like 15% of the frame's area! Colors? Ha! You were lucky if your reds were even close to red.BTW I hope you take this as lighthearted ribbing plus empathy, and not criticism or argument. I've worked in film too (CG film), and I fully understand your feelings. The first CG film I worked on, Shrek, delivered final frames in 8bit compressed JPEG. That would probably horrify a lot of digital filmmakers today, but nobody noticed.

Basically I think the main problem with the show is the character of eleven. She's boring. She isn't even really a character as she has no thoughts or desires or personality. She is a set piece for the other characters to manipulate. That works in the first season. But by season 3 it's very tiring. She just points her hands at things and psychic powers go. This is why it might feel weird when Will tells everyone he is gay and all the original boys are like dude we are totally cool with you being gay and give him a group hug then eleven joins too it feels weird. To use the show's language, she isn't really part of the party.Season 3 is a great example of how the show pays too much attention to eleven without developing her character while giving her lots of screen time. billy is a very interesting character you could spend a lot of time understanding why billy is the way he is but instead you get one dream sequence because eleven sees his dreams and oh his dad sucks.  Except you knew that already from season 2. And most of elevens screen time when not shopping at the mall is spent pointing her hands at things to make psychic powers go boom.But this is basically the problem with the show. The writers like eleven too much. And she is incredibly boring as a character after season 1.I think the show succeeded greatly in the first season at creating actions for the characters to do that developed both their characters and the narrative. And those happen in this 1980s nostalgic world. But I think the shows attachment to eleven has ultimately harmed the narrative.That being said, I do think that the general narrative of the show going from the demogorgon to the mindflayer to vecna and the abyss is very dungeons and dragons. Haha. That would be a fun campaign to play.

1. Millie Bobbie Brown, the actor of Eleven, is unfathomably stupid (watch any out-of-character interview with her) and the role has simply outgrown her acting abilities. They can't make Eleven do anything interesting because Millie can't act it.2. Writers have introduced so many supporting characters and separate story lines that it is impossible to give any of them enough screen time for proper character development.There are other major writing problems with the show, like the overreliance on cheap 80s culture references, but I think the main problem is with the characters. The writers simply don't understand what made the first season so good.

Movies have dark scenes nowadays mainly because it is a trend. On top of that dark scenes can have practical advantages (set building, VFX, lighting, etc. can be reduced or become much simpler to do which directly translates into money saved during shooting).If I had to guess, the trend of dark scenes are a direct result of the fact that in the past two decades we our digital sensors got good enough to actually shoot in such low-light environments.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35398576

The ""soap opera"" feel is NOT from bad interpolation that can somehow be done right. It's inherent from the high frame rate. It has nothing to do with ""video cameras"", and a lot to do with being simply too real, like watching a scene through a window. There's no magic in it.Films are more like dreams than like real life. That frame rate is essential to them, and its choice, driven by technical constraints of the time when films added sound, was one of happiest accidents in the history of Arts.

reply

Yes! The other happy accident of movies that contribute to the dream-like quality, besides the lower frame rate, is the edit. As Walter Murch says in ""In the Blink of an Eye"", we don't object to jumps in time or location when we watch a film. As humans we understand what has happened, despite such a thing being impossible in reality. The only time we ever experience jumps in time and location is when we dream.I would go further and say that a really good film, well edited, induces a dreamlike state in the viewer.And going even further than that, a popular film being viewed by thousands of people at once is as though those people are dreaming the same dream.

I don't see how it's the case for frame rate, except perhaps for CGI (which has also improved).I think just like with games, there's an initial surprised reaction; so many console-only gamers insisted they can't see the point of 60 fps. And just like with games, it only takes a little exposure to get over that and begin preferring it.

You've just learned to associate good films with this shitty framerate. Also, most established film makers have yet to learn (but probably never will) how to make stuff look good on high frames. It's less forgiving.It'll probably take the next generation of viewers and directors..

To be fair, ""vivid"" mode on my old Panasonic plasma was actually an impressive option compared to how an LCD would typically implement it. It didn't change the color profile. It mostly changed how much wattage the panel was allowed to consume. Upward of 800w IIRC. I called it ""light cannon"" mode. In a dark room, it makes black levels look like they have their own gravitational field despite being fairly bright in absolute terms.

Are movies produced in this colour space?  No idea.  But they all look great in SRGB.A work colleague got himself a 40"" HD TV as a big computer monitor.  This is a few years ago.  I was shocked at the overamped colour and contrast.  Went through all the settings and with everything turned to minimum - every colour saturation slider, everything that could be found - it was almost realistic but still garish compared to SRGB.But that's what people want, right?  Overamped everything is how those demo loops at Costco are set up, that's what sells, that's what people want in their living rooms, right?

It is perfectly understandable that the people who really care about how their work was colour-graded, then suggest you turn off all the features that shit all over that work.

Major characters have fallen to the wayside, other side characters are now main.  Tons of stupid, ""I'm angry at you"" followed by splitting up while being hunted by monsters, or hashing out some grievance while being chased by monsters in an end of the world scenario.The cast is not awkwardly cute anymore.  They are full grown adults playing children.  I can forgive this as I know the difficulties in getting a production together.  But it does make the petty squabbles -- which are constant -- more unbearable.I'll watch the last episodes at they come out this week, but I have low hopes.  It would be nice to see something actually wrapped up nicely even if the show is stumbling to the finish. So help me though, if they win through the power of friendship and love...

Here's how bad it was in 2017. One of the earliest things I watched on that TV was ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" on some expanded basic cable channel. The fight between Peter and Gamora over the orb looked very jerky, like it was only at about 6 fps. I found some reviews of the movie on YouTube that included clips of that fight and it looked great on them, so I know that this wasn't some artistic choice of the director that I just didn't like. Some Googling told me about the motion enhancement settings of the TV, and how they often suck. I had DVRed the movie, and with those settings off the scene looked great when I watched it again.

Real artists understand the limits of the medium they're working in and shape their creations to exist within it.   So even if there was no artistic or technical merit in the choice to standardize on 24 FPS, the choice to standardize on 24 FPS shaped the media that came after it.  Which means it's gained merit it didn't have when it was initially standardized upon.

Obviously not, because generations of people saw ""movement"" at 24 fps. You're railing against other people's preferences, but presenting your personal preferences as fact.Also, there are technical limitations in cameras that aren't present in video games. The higher the frame rate, the less light that hits it. To compensate, not only do you need better sensors, but you probably need to change the entire way that sets, costumes, and lighting are handled.The shift to higher frame rates will happen, but it's gonna require massive investment to shift an entire industry and time to learn what looks good. Cinematographers have higher standards than random Youtubers.

It is a fact that motion is smoother at 120 fps than 24, and therefore easier to follow on screen.

Since consumers are not trained to critically discern image and video quality, the ""Wow!"" often wins the sale.  This easily explains the existence of local dimming solutions (now called miniLED or some other thing).  In a super bright Best Buy or Walmart viewing environment they can look fantastic (although, if you know what to look for you can see the issues).  When you get that same TV home and watch a movie in the dark...oh man, the halos jump off the screen.  Now they are starting to push ""RGB miniLED"" as if that is going to fix basic optics/physics issues.And don't get me started on horrible implementations of HDR.This is clearly a case of the average consumer not knowing enough (they should not have to be experts, BTW) and effectively getting duped by marketing.

But vivid mode (et al) literally loses information. When the TV tries to make everything look vibrant, it's effectively squishing all of the colors into a smaller color space. You may not be able to even tell two distinct objects apart because everything is similarly bright and vibrant.Same with audio. The famous “smile” EQ can cause some instruments to disappear, such as woodwinds.At the end of the day, media is for enjoyment and much of it is subjective, so fine do what you need to do to be happy. But few people would deliberately choose lower resolution (except maybe for nostalgia), which is what a lot of the fancy settings end up doing.Get a calibration if you can, or use Filmmaker Mode. The latter will make the TV relatively dark, but there's usually a way to adjust it or copy its settings and then boost the brightness in a Custom mode, which is still a big improvement over default settings from the default mode.

Went to the in-laws over the holidays and the motion smoothing on the otherwise very nice LG tv was absolutely atrocious.My sister had her Nintendo Switch connected to it and the worst thing was not the low resolution game on the 4k display - it was the motion smoothing.  Absolutely unbearable.  Sister was complaining about input lag and it was most definitey caused by the motion smoothing.I keep my own TV on game mode regardless of the content because otherwise all the extra “features” - which includes more than just motion smoothing - pretty much destroys picture quality universally no matter what I'm watching.

To preempt replies: ask yourself why 24 frames per second is optimal for cinema instead of just being an ancient spec that everyone got used to.

Also imagine the hand of a clock rotating at 5 minutes' worth of angle per frame, and 1 frame per second. If you watched that series of pictures, your brain might still fill in that the hand is moving in a circle every 12 seconds.Now imagine smoothing synthesizing an extra 59 frames per second. If it's only consider the change between 2 frames, it might show a bright spot moving in a straight line between the 12 and 1 position, then 1 and 2, and so on. Instead of a circle, the circle of the hand would be tracing a dodecagon. That's fine, but it's not how your brain knows clocks are supposed to move.Motion smoothing tries to do its best to generate extra detail that doesn't exist and we're a long way from the tech existing for a TV to be able to do that well in realtime. Until then, it's going to be weird and unnatural.Film shot at 60FPS? Sure. Shot at 24 and slopped up to 60? Nah, I'll pass.

But synthesizing these frames ends up with a higher frame rate but with the same shutter angle / motion blur of the original frame rate, which looks off to me. Same reason the shutter angle is adjusted for footage that is intended to be slow motion.

""Everyone"" includes the filmmakers. And in those cases where the best filmmakers already found all kinds of artistic workarounds for the lower framerate in the places that mattered, adding interpolation will fuck up their films.For example, golden age animators did their own interpolation by hand. In Falling Hare, Bugs' utter despair after looking out the window of a nosediving airplane is animated by a violent turn of his head that moves farther than what could be smoothly animated at 24fps. To avoid the jumpcut, there is a tween of an elongated bunny head with four ears, seven empty black eye sockets, four noses, and eight teeth. It's absolutely terrifying if you pause on that frame[1], but it does a perfect job of connecting the other cells and evoking snappier motion than what 24fps could otherwise show.Claiming that motion interpolation makes for a better Falling Hare is like claiming that keeping the piano's damper pedal down through the entirety of Bach's Prelude in C produces better Bach than on a harpsichord. In both cases, you're using objectively better technology poorly, in order to produce worse results.1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAPf5fSDGVk

People are “used to” high FPS content: Live TV, scripted TV shot on video (not limited to only soap operas), video games, most YouTube content, etc are all at 30-60FPS. It'd be worth asking yourself why so many people continue to prefer the aesthetic of a lower framerates when the “objectively better” higher FPS has been available and moderately prevalent for quite some time.

reply

Higher frame rates are superior for shooting reality. But for something that is fictional it helps the audience suspend their disbelief.

reply

reply

With one caveat, some games that use animation-inspired aesthetics, the animation itself is not smoothed out but basically ran on the slower framerate (see guilty gear games) while everything else (camera movement, some effects) is silky smooth and you still get quick reaction time to your inputs.

If it did horror films would be filmed at higher frame rates for extra scares.Humans have a long history of suspending belief in both oral and written lore.  I think that 'fps' may be as functionally equivalent as the santa clause stories, fun for kids but the adults need to pick up the bill.

But then getting into recommendations like ""turn off vivid mode"" is pretty freaking pretentious, in my opinion, like a restaurant where the chef freaks out if you ask for salt. Yes, maybe the entree is perfectly salted, but I prefer more, and I'm the one paying the bill, so calm yourself as I season it to my tastes. Yes, vivid modes do look different than the filmmaker intended, but that also presumes that the viewer's eyes are precisely as sensitive as the director's. What if I need higher contrast to make out what's happening on the screen? Is it OK if I calibrate my TV to my own personal viewing conditions? What if it's not perfectly dark in my house, or I want to watch during the day without closing all the blinds?I tried watching the ending of Game of Thrones without tweaking my TV. I could not physically see what was happening on the screen, other than that a navy blue blob was doing something against a darker grey background, and parts of it seemed to be moving fast if I squinted. I cranked the brightness and contrast for those episodes so that I could actually tell what was going on. It might not have aligned with the director's idea of how I should experience their spectacle, but I can live with that.Note that I'd also roll my eyes at a musician who told me how to set my equalizer. I'll set it as I see fit for me, in my living room's own requirements, thanks.

The point you make isn't incorrect at all.  I would say that TV's should ship without any such enhancements enabled.  The user should then be able to configure it as they wish.Plenty of parallel examples of this:  Microsoft should ship a ""clean"" version of Windows.

I strongly agree with that. The default settings should be… well, “calibrated” is the wrong word here, but that. They should be in “stand out among others on the showroom floor” mode, but set up to show an accurate picture in the average person's typical viewing environment. Let the owner tweak as they see fit from there. If they want soap opera mode for some bizarre reason, fine, they can enable it once it's installed. Don't make the rest of us chase down whatever this particular brand calls it.

On the other hand, things that are objective like color calibration, can be hard to “push down” to each TV because they might vary from set to set. Apple TV has a cool feature where you can calibrate the output using your phone camera, it's really nifty. Lots of people comment on how good the picture on my TV looks, it's just because it's calibrated. It makes a big difference.Anyways, while I am on my soap box, one reason I don't have a Netflix account any more is because you need the highest tier to get 4k/hdr content. Other services like Apple TV and Prime give everyone 4k. I feel like that should be the standard now. It's funny to see this thread of suggestions for people to get better picture, when many viewers probably can't even get 4k/hdr.

I know I'm pretty unsophisticated when it comes to stuff like art, but I've never been able to appreciate takes like this. If I'm watching something on my own time from the comfort of my home, I don't really care about what the filmmaker thinks if it's different than what I want to see. Maybe he's just trying to speak to the people who do care about seeing his exact vision, but his phrasing is so exaggerated in how negatively he seems to see these settings makes it seem like he genuinely thinks what he's saying applies universally. Honestly, I'd have a pretty similar opinion even for art outside of my home. If someone told me I was looking at the Mona Lisa wrong because it's ""not what the artist intended"" I'd probably laugh at them. It doesn't really seem like you're doing a good job as an artist if you have to give people instructions on how to look at it.

reply

I hear you, artists (and fans) are frequently overly dogmatic on how their work should be consumed but, well, that strikes me as part-and-parcel of the instinct that drives them to sink hundreds or thousands of hours into developing a niche skill that lets them express an idea by creating something beautiful for the rest of us to enjoy. If they didn't care so much about getting it right, the work would probably be less polished and less compelling, so I'm happy to let them be a bit irritating since they dedicated their life to making something nice for me and the rest of us, even if it was for themselves.Up to you whether or not this applies to this or any other particular creator, but it feels appropriate to me for artists to be annoying about how their work should be enjoyed in the same way it's appropriate for programmers to be annoying about how software should be developed and used: everyone's necessarily more passionate and opinionated about their domain and their work, that's why they're better at it than me even if individual opinions aren't universally strictly right!

That's arguably a thing, due to centuries of aged and yellowed varnish.You can watch whatever you want however you want, but it's entirely reasonable for the creator of art to give tips on how to view it the way it was intended.  If you'd prefer that it look like a hybrid-cartoon Teletubby episode, then I say go for it.

When walking past a high end TV I've honestly confused a billion dollar movie for a teen weekend project, due to this. It's only when I see ""hang on, how's Famous Actor in this?"" that I see that oh this is a Marvel movie?To me it's as if people who don't see it are saying ""oh, I didn't even realise I'd set the TV to black and white"".This is not high art.

This is more comparable to color being turned off. Sure, if you're completely colorblind, then it's not an issue. But non-colorblind people are not ""snobs"".Or if dialog is completely unintelligible. That's not a problem for people who don't speak the language anyway, and would need subtitles either way. But people who speak English are not ""snobs"" for wanting to be able to understand dialog spoken in English.I've not seen a movie filmed and played back in high frame rate. It may be perfectly fine (for me). In that case it's not about the framerate, but about the botched interpolation.Like I said in my previous comment, it's not about ""art"".

People like you insisting on 24 fps causes people like me to unnecessarily have to choose between not seeing films, seeing them with headaches or seeing them with some interpolation.I will generally choose the latter until everything is at a decent frame rate.

The “soap opera effect” is what people call video at higher than 24 fps in general, it has nothing to do with interpolation. The term has been used for decades before interpolation even existed. You seem to be confused on that point.Source video at 120 looks no worse than at 24, that's all I'm saying.

Docker was conceived to solve the problem of things ""working on my machine"", and not anywhere else. This was generally caused by the differences in the configuration and versions of dependencies. Its approach was simple: bundle both of these together with the application in unified images, and deploy these images as atomic units.Somewhere along the lines however, the problem has mutated into ""works on my container host"". How is that possible? Turns out that with larger modular applications, the configuration and dependencies naturally demand separation. This results in them moving up a layer, in this case creating a network of inter-dependent containers that you now have to put together for the whole thing to start...  and we're back to square one, with way more bloat in between.Now hardware virtualization. I like how AArch64 generalizes this: there are 4 levels of privilege baked into the architecture. Each has control over the lower and can call up the one immediately above to request a service. Simple. Let's narrow our focus to the lowest three: EL0 (classically the user space), EL1 (the kernel), EL2 (the hypervisor). EL0, in most operating systems, isn't capable of doing much on its own; its sole purpose is to do raw computation and request I/O from EL1. EL1, on the other hand, has the powers to directly talk to the hardware.Everyone is happy, until the complexity of EL1 grows out of control and becomes a huge attack surface, difficult to secure and easy to exploit from EL0. Not good. The naive solution? Go a level above, and create a layer that will constrain EL1, or actually, run multiple, per-application EL1s, and punch some holes through for them to still be able to do the job—create a hypervisor. But then, as those vaguely defined ""holes"", also called system calls and hyper calls, grow, won't so the attack surface?Or in other words, with the user space shifting to EL1, will our hypervisor become the operating system, just like docker-compose became a dynamic linker?

Unfortunately containers have always had an absolutely horrendous security story and they degrade performance by quite a lot.The hypervisor is not going away anytime soon - it is what the entire public cloud is built on.While you are correct that containers do add more layers - unikernels go the opposite direction and actively remove those layers. Also, imo the ""attack surface"" is by far the smallest security benefit - other architectural concepts such as the complete lack of an interactive userland is far more beneficial when you consider what an attacker actually wants to do after landing on your box. (eg: run their sotware)When you deploy to AWS you have two layers of linux - one that AWS runs and one that you run - but you don't really need that second layer and you can have much faster/safer software without it.

(eg: run their sotware)When you deploy to AWS you have two layers of linux - one that AWS runs and one that you run - but you don't really need that second layer and you can have much faster/safer software without it.

The story is quite different in HP-UX, Aix, Solaris, BSD, Windows, IBM i, z/OS,...

I think you're over-egging the pudding. In reality, you're unlikely to use more than 2 types of container host (local dev and normal deployment maybe), so I think we've moved way beyond square 1. Config is normally very similar, just expressed differently, and being able to encapsulate dependencies removes a ton of headaches.

Unikernels don't work for him; there are many of us who are very thankful for them.

Why?  Can you explain, in light of the article, and for those of us who may not be familiar with qubes-mirage-firewall, why?

Also always a little wary of projects that have bad typos or grammar problems in a README - in particular on one of the headings (thought it's possible these are on purpose?). But that's just me :\

Neat.

I was not expecting Pascal, thats an interesting choice. One thing I do like is that Freepascal has one of the better ways of making GUIs meanwhile every other language had decided that just letting Javascript build UIs is the way.

Now I write Javascript and SQL.:)

Plus these might be smaller and might run faster than containers too.

A fan group have hit out supporters being ""priced out and let down""

A FAN group has warned Fifa “alarm bells should be ringing” over England fans NOT taking up their full quota for the World Cup final.

It's the same for the semi-final with the number of tickets available to members of England's travel club exceeding the total of applications received at this stage.

In short, that means that everyone in the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) who has applied for a ticket to the final and last four ties would get one.

We told you on Monday how Three Lions fans are shunning rip-off trips to the US – and planning their own parties in Spain instead.

Bookings for flights to Benidorm have rocketed amid the fury over the prices for the tournament finals.

The cost structure for the major global event held in the United States, Canada and Mexico has been widely criticised – but Fifa president Gianni Infantino has defended the cost of tickets.

However, the Football Supporters' Association's Fans' Embassy – speaking via the BBC – say that England fans not taking up their allocation should be a major concern.

They've also hit out saying loyal fans feel “completely let down” and are being priced out.

A group statement read: “Whilst unsurprisingly the group games are oversubscribed, as well as the possible glamour tie in Mexico City in the round of 16, the numbers for the semi-final and final speak for themselves.

“The numbers are reflective of a fan base that has been priced out, and some of the most loyal supporters of the international game feel completely let down.

“Alarm bells should be ringing whenever participating member allocations, meant for the most loyal fans, are not sold out for any game at a World Cup.”

Harry Kane and Co will be in Group L alongside Croatia, Panama and Ghana.

Before then, those in Thomas Tuchel's plans and on the fringes will be looking to impress to get a shot in the national team camp.

England will face Uruguay at Wembley on Friday, March 27 before welcoming Japan to the same venue three days later.

They will then play a further two matches in June before the finals kick-off – with those games likely to be staged at Inter Miami's ground in Florida.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man City set low price tag for Nathan Ake","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/man-city-low-price-tag-nathan-ake-defender-rejects-premier-league-strugglers/blte384413911c9b147","Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:16:26 GMT","

Manchester City have set a low price tag for Nathan Ake, though the Dutch defender has rejected a chance to join Premier League strugglers West Ham United. Ake has experienced limited game time at Etihad Stadium in 2025-26 as he has fallen down the pecking order in Pep Guardiola's backline. The Netherlands international has started in just five matches, with the majority of his minutes coming in the Carabao Cup.

According to talkSPORT, Ake is open to a move away from Etihad Stadium in the January transfer window after clocking just 596 minutes on the pitch in the 2025-26 campaign at City. However, the Dutch centre-back has rejected a chance to join Premier League strugglers West Ham United as the defender does not want to sign for a club who are currently 18th in the league and are at risk of relegation. City are open to selling the defender in the upcoming window and have even set his price lowly at just £21 million ($28m).

Ake has also attracted interest from three other Premier League clubs, namely Bournemouth, Newcastle and Crystal Palace, who are monitoring the 30-year-old's situation at the Etihad Stadium. Reports have also emerged that Barcelona have also shown interest in the City star, despite being cash-strapped. The Catalan giants are looking for a replacement for Andreas Christensen, who is out with a long-term injury.

Ake would bring versatility that Flick's Barcelona squad currently lacks. Comfortable both as a left-sided centre-back and at left-back, he offers tactical flexibility at a time when fixture congestion is beginning to affect the Spanish champions. That adaptability is especially valuable for a side operating with a thin defensive unit and limited rotation options.

However, any move for Ake would almost certainly need to be structured as a loan, given the Catalan club's ongoing financial challenges. While City are more keen on a permanent sale, the relationship between the clubs and the respect Guardiola commands in Barcelona could play a role in facilitating discussions.

Beyond Ake's positional flexibility and years of experience, the fact that the defender has trained under Guardiola at City is viewed as a major asset by the Barcelona hierarchy. His familiarity with positional play, ball progression from deep areas and defensive discipline aligns closely with Catalan giants' footballing identity. 

For the club's sporting department, the logic is clear: a player already schooled in Guardiola's methods is likely to settle quickly into a system that values control, structure and intelligent movement. In a short-term loan scenario, immediate adaptability is crucial, and Ake is seen as capable of delivering that without a prolonged settling-in period in the second half and the most important juncture of the season.

While City will push for Ake to exit in the January window, the club's immediate priority remains securing the transfer of Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo as early as possible. talkSPORT reported on Monday that the Cherries and the Cityzens have held positive talks over the structure of payments for Semenyo's £65 million ($87.5m) transfer fee and Bournemouth are now preparing to sell their star player in the next few days. 

Semenyo, though, is expected to travel with the squad to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday and that match could be his farewell outing for the club. Semenyo has given his verbal consent to complete the transfer and the formal process will begin once the transfer window officially opens on January 1.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
