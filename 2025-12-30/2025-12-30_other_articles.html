Over the last three decades, Yellowstone National Park has undergone an ecological cascade. As elk numbers fell, aspen and willow trees thrived. This, in turn, allowed beaver numbers to increase, creating new habitats for fish and birds. But their return may not have reshaped the entire ecosystem in the way that scientists thought, and has sparked a fierce debate among scientists over exactly why and how Yellowstone has rebounded. But now, scientists have written a response letter to the editor, published in Oct. 13 in the journal Global Ecology and Conservation, in which they argue that the original study's methodology was flawed, and that Yellowstone wolves' effect on willow shrubs is not so clear. Their disappearance created an ecological imbalance — the elk population exploded, which decimated plant populations and in turn threatened beavers, among other impacts. The study converted willow height measurements collected and published by another research group into a metric called crown volume, response author Daniel MacNulty, a wildlife ecologist at Utah State University, told Live Science in an email. Crown volume was used as a proxy for willow size, meant to capture the shrub's entire three-dimensional growth more than simply measuring its height. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. "They did not reveal anything new about how willow growth changed after wolf reintroduction." The response letter suggests other inconsistencies in data analysis, like comparing willow measurements from different locations across years. This is problematic because it shows a misleading time series of willow growth, and MacNulty's research group has previously published research noting sampling biases in other studies supporting this same trophic cascade theory. But the effect of wolves on vegetation is less clear because it operates through the decline of elk populations, which wolves were likely not solely responsible for. As MacNulty points out, humans, grizzly bears and cougars also hunt elk. William Ripple, an Oregon State University wildlife ecologist and author of the original paper, stands by the original conclusions of the paper, maintaining that a large carnivore, elk, and willow trophic cascade occurred in Yellowstone. "Our methods are sound, the modeling approach is standard," Ripple told Live Science in an email. "So we reject the idea that there are fatal flaws." While scientists widely agree that there is a trophic cascade in Yellowstone, its strength — and which predators are most responsible for it — form the center of the disagreement, MacNulty said. "There are reasons other than trophic cascades by which carnivores and plants can be positively associated," Jake Goheen, a wildlife ecologist at Iowa State University told Live Science in an email. Goheen, who was not involved in the research or response, said he doesn't believe that the authors of the original study provided enough evidence to support their conclusion that reintroducing wolves in Yellowstone caused a strong trophic cascade that affected willows. "There is a growing body of literature at this point that has scrutinized the hypothesized cascade in Yellowstone," Goheen said. He adds that this does not mean there's no wolf-to-elk-to-willow trophic cascade in Yellowstone, only that the evidence presented so far is not clear enough. —Yellowstone holds potentially untapped cache of 'carbon-free' helium for rockets, reactors and superconductors —We finally know where the Yellowstone volcano will erupt next The ideal study would then analyze how much more total willow biomass there is now compared with before wolf introduction, to identify the strength of the effect; then calculate how much of that increase can be attributed solely to wolves, to identify its cause. Ripple and his research team are now preparing a detailed reply, which explains that criticisms of the original study come from misunderstandings of what they did, Ripple said. Conservation priorities might be fueling the controversy over large carnivores' beneficial effects on ecosystems, said Goheen, adding that even if wolves are not definitively causing a trophic cascade to willows, they are still important to conserve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to longtime researcher and filmmaker L.A. Marzulli, the conversation has reached a tipping point. Marzulli's recent reaction video centers on the new film Disclosure Day, which he believes is less entertainment and more ideological groundwork. Marzulli's response is pointed: “But what truth are we going to hear? Throughout his breakdown of the movie's trailer, Marzulli highlights imagery he believes is doing heavy theological lifting. Scenes of altered consciousness, possession-like behavior and religious symbolism are not incidental. “There's no way around that,” he said of one scene depicting a woman losing control of her faculties. She no longer is in possession of her faculties.” He also noted the film's use of Catholic imagery, saying it subtly suggests that faith can be reinterpreted to accommodate non-human entities. “They're already spinning this thing within a certain theological framework,” he said. More broadly, Marzulli rejects the film's assumption that alleged non-human intelligences are benevolent extraterrestrials. They are the fallen angels with a very nefarious agenda.” He ties this directly to biblical prophecy, warning that such revelations could trigger what Scripture calls a great falling away. “When they reveal themselves, that's the game changer,” Marzulli said. “And we are being set up for it.” The push for disclosure is shaping how people think, believe and interpret reality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers are developing a real-life tractor beam, with the goal of pulling defunct satellites out of geostationary orbit to alleviate the space junk problem. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This tractor beam wouldn't suck in helpless starship pilots, however. Instead, it would use electrostatic attraction to nudge hazardous space junk safely out of Earth orbit. This bonanza of new satellites will eventually wear out and turn the space around Earth into a giant junkyard of debris that could smash into working spacecraft, plummet to Earth, pollute our atmosphere with metals and obscure our view of the cosmos. The electrostatic tractor beam could potentially alleviate that problem by safely moving dead satellites far out of Earth orbit, where they would drift harmlessly for eternity. A prototype could cost millions, and an operational, full-scale version even more. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Such technology is likely beyond anything humans will ever achieve. But the concept inspired Hanspeter Schaub, an aerospace engineering professor at CU Boulder, to conceptualize a more realistic version. Schaub first got the idea after the first major satellite collision in 2009, when an active communications satellite, Iridium 33, smashed into a defunct Russian military spacecraft, Kosmos 2251, scattering more than 1,800 pieces of debris into Earth's orbit. To do this, he realized you could pull spacecraft out of harm's way by using the attraction between positively and negatively charged objects to make them "stick" together. Now, they hope it can someday be used to move dead satellites out of geostationary orbit (GEO) — an orbit around Earth's equator where an object's speed matches the planet's rotation, making it seem like the object is fixed in place above a certain point on Earth. The electrostatic tractor would use a servicer spacecraft equipped with an electron gun that would fire negatively charged electrons at a dead target satellite, Champion told Live Science. The electrostatic attraction between the two would keep them locked together despite being separated by 65 to 100 feet (20 to 30 meters) of empty space, she said. Ideally, the defunct satellite would be pulled into a "graveyard orbit" more distant from Earth, where it could safely drift forever, Champion said. Related: 15 of the weirdest things we have launched into space So the servicer would have to move very slowly, and it could take more than a month to fully move a single satellite out of GEO, he added. That's a far cry from movie tractor beams, which are inescapable and rapidly reel in their prey. This is the "main difference between sci-fi and reality," Hammerl said. The electrostatic tractor would have one big advantage over other proposed space junk removal methods, such as harpoons, giant nets and physical docking systems: It would be completely touchless. "You have these large, dead spacecraft about the size of a school bus rotating really fast," Hammerl said. "If you shoot a harpoon, use a big net or try to dock with them, then the physical contact can damage the spacecraft and then you are only making the [space junk] problem worse." Scientists have proposed other touchless methods, such as using powerful magnets, but enormous magnets are both expensive to produce and would likely interfere with a servicer's controls, Champion said. Related: How do tiny pieces of space junk cause incredible damage? If satellites were moved one at a time, then a single electrostatic tractor wouldn't keep pace with the number of satellites winking out of operation. Another limitation of the electrostatic tractor is that it would work too slowly to be practical for clearing smaller pieces of space junk, so it wouldn't be able to keep GEO completely free of debris. The team has not yet done a full cost analysis for the electrostatic tractor, Schaub said, but it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars. The researchers are currently working on a series of experiments in their Electrostatic Charging Laboratory for Interactions between Plasma and Spacecraft (ECLIPS) machine at CU Boulder. The bathtub-sized, metallic vacuum chamber, which is equipped with an electron gun, allows the team to "do unique experiments that almost no one else can currently do" in order to simulate the effects of an electrostatic tractor on a smaller scale, Hammerl said. However, the researchers would ideally like to launch two satellites for the first tests, a servicer and a target that they can maneuver, which would give them more control over their experiments but also double the cost. If they can somehow wrangle that funding, a prototype tractor beam could be operational in around 10 years, the team previously estimated. While tractor beams may sound like a pipe dream, experts are optimistic about the technology. Removing space junk without touching it would also be much safer than any current alternative method, Crassidis added. The electrostatic tractor "should be able to produce the forces necessary to move a defunct satellite" and "certainly has a high potential to work in practice," Carolin Frueh, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University in Indiana, told Live Science in an email. —World's largest communication satellite is a photobombing menace, astronomers warn —Chinese scientists call for plan to destroy Elon Musk's Starlink satellites Scientists should continue to research other possible solutions, Crassidis said. Even if the CU Boulder team doesn't create a "final product" to remove nonfunctional satellites, their research will provide a stepping stone for other scientists, he added. If they are successful, it wouldn't be the first time scientists turned fiction into fact. "What is today's science fiction could be tomorrow's reality," Crassidis said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Mexico really can be out of this world. With high altitude, dark skies, and vast expanses populated by few people, it's no wonder that New Mexico has a longstanding history as a hotspot for stargazing, rocket launches, and possible UFO sightings. "New Mexico's connection to space is woven into our landscape, our history, and our spirit of exploration,” says Lancing Adams, acting cabinet secretary of the New Mexico Tourism Department. The road trip consists of 52 historic sites related to space—from ancient rock art to modern laboratories—that give insight and unique perspectives on the state's important role in the space industry. “Dating back to the 1990s, the development and promotion of the Space Trail has been an ongoing initiative of multiple organizations, including the New Mexico Museum of Space History, which continues to play a key role in space education in the State,” says Sheli Hinds Armstrong, director of space tourism for the SpaceValley Foundation and owner and CEO of Destination Southwest, based in New Mexico. Here's what you need to know before planning a trip on New Mexico's Space Trail. The state's low levels of light pollution and vast open spaces make it perfect for stargazing. Attend a free open house viewing session at The University of New Mexico Campus Observatory in Albuquerque or The Tombaugh Campus Observatory at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, to use a wide variety of telescopes. The Magdalena Ridge Observatory in Socorro hosts Enchanted Skies Star Parties that include a tour of the observatory and professional astronomers, who explain what attendees are seeing in the sky. There are a variety of space museums in New Mexico that cover everything from planetary science to the Atomic Age. For a broader history of space, visit the New Mexico Museum of Space History in Alamogordo. UFO enthusiasts will want to stop in Roswell, best known for two alleged crash sites that date back to 1947. Conspiracy theorists believe extraterrestrials were pulled from the wreckage, but the government maintains that it was simply a fallen weather balloon filled with anthropomorphic dummies. Once a year, in October, visitors can attend an open house at the Trinity Site—where the first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945. It's part of the White Sands Missile Range, an active United States Army facility, known as the "Birthplace of America's Missile and Space Activity." But New Mexico's role in aerospace isn't just a thing of the past, as is evident at Spaceport America—the world's first facility designed for commercial suborbital space travel. Records of astronomical events date back thousands of years, and you can see ancient renderings created by the ancestral Pueblo people at Chaco Culture National Historic Park. You'll need to factor in things like the distance between points of interest, which sites require reservations, and how much time you'd like to spend at each. Some parts of the state do not have reliable cell service, so it's a good idea to print out a map with directions before hitting the road. New Mexico is largely a high-desert environment, which can mean triple-digit temperatures and monsoon rain in the summer months. Fall is the ideal time to take on a Space Trail road trip, with cooler weather, colorful fall foliage, fewer crowds, and the ExxonMobil Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta—the largest in the world—held annually in October. Albuquerque is the largest city in New Mexico and is also home to the Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ). Grab a bite to eat at a retro diner on Route 66, such as The Range Café or 66 Diner, or try authentic New Mexico cuisine at Church Street Cafe. Stop by Sawmill Market for a food hall experience or Itality, the only Indigenous, woman-owned, plant-based eatery in the city. It is home to the newly opened Hotel Willa with the on-site Juliette restaurant serving seasonal New Mexico cuisine. Picks up snacks for the road at Cid's Food Market and snag a reservation at The Love Apple. In the small alien-themed town of Roswell, you'll mostly find small motel options, such as the Roswell Inn. For a truly immersive experience, just outside of town, spend the night in an underground bunker attached to a 180-feet-deep Atlas F nuclear ballistic missile silo. Make time to sample local wines and cuisine at Pecos Flavors Winery & Bistro. Soak in geothermal hot springs baths in Truth or Consequences, at hotels such as the Sierra Grande, Hoosier Hot Springs & Inn, or Mothership Yoga Lounge & Hot Springs. For the best pizza in town, head to Outer Edge Pizzeria and swing by Passion Pie Cafe for delicious pastries and freshly brewed coffee.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Angry residents say the Louisiana skies are being sprayed with chemicals, creating “tic-tac-toe” shapes up above, or in one case, an “Acura logo.” The supposed culprit: Chemtrails, a long-debunked conspiracy theory that scientists say is not accurate. A handful of Republican state lawmakers have encouraged their constituents to write in, propping up the conspiracy theory that the condensation trails airplanes leave behind are, in fact, dangerous chemicals or heavy metals. It also banned climate geoengineering and cloud seeding, which are real technologies designed to combat climate change or generate greater precipitation for agricultural or other purposes. Neither are used in Louisiana, according to state and federal regulators. The debate about chemtrails among state lawmakers prompted a clash over longstanding farming practices, nascent climate technology and outright conspiracies. And as a result, the state environmental regulator is now required to collect reports of such alleged activities. Records show that more than 400 of the reports received by LDEQ allege that condensation trails long left by airplanes are the long-debunked “chemtrails.” “This garbage has been going on here for years,” one resident reported to the state system. “At some point We the People need a Say about this.....We are being poisoned and Our tax dollars are funding this.” As usual they remained in place and gradually spread out to form cloudlike areas. This summer, President Donald Trump's administration sought to dispel the chemtrails theory and published webpages addressing chemtrail conspiracy theories and explaining how condensation trails work. The Environmental Protection Agency calls chemtrails “a term some people use to inaccurately claim that contrails resulting from routine air traffic are actually an intentional release of dangerous chemicals or biological agents at high altitudes for a variety of nefarious purposes, including population control, mind control, or attempts to geoengineer Earth or modify the weather.” Still, the EPA's efforts have not dissuaded at least one state lawmaker. That advice appears to have prompted an uptick in reports. Hodges didn't respond to messages for this story. “Have you noticed strange white trails crisscrossing our skies lately? Many residents across our state are reporting heavy chemtrails, contrails, geoengineering, and cloud-seeding activity — and now there's a new Louisiana law addressing it,” Hodges posted on Facebook, prompting hundreds of comments. Louisiana for decades had a process for permitting cloud seeding, a practice of releasing tiny silver iodide particles into clouds to enhance precipitation. A handful of studies have suggested silver iodide is not harmful, though questions remain about whether the prolonged use and accumulation of the compound may cause health or environmental problems. The state's new law also bans solar geoengineering, a technology that does exist but is still in its infancy. Louisiana has felt the effects of climate change particularly acutely, with worsening hurricanes, rising heat-related deaths and more. State Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, sponsored the bill to ban cloud seeding and climate geoengineering. Throughout the legislative debate, Fesi repeated debunked theories that people are spraying hazardous chemicals in Louisiana to modify the weather or climate, though he offered no evidence. “It does not interfere with our daily regular duties we have by law to go and investigate things that are actually in our purview, like spills. “It is our job to take any and all reports from concerned citizens,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAS VEGAS (FOX5) — A Discovery Channel TV star says he used his “supernatural ability” to find out his cellmate was a predator before killing him, an arrest report says. Chad Ollinger, 41, is accused of killing his cellmate on Dec. 26 after the evening meal at the Clark County Detention Center. According to an arrest report from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the victim was identified as Christopher Kelly. The report says an officer discovered Kelly unresponsive while making rounds for medication. Ollinger was his cellmate and told police Kelly “was not feeling well.” Police entered the cell and found Kelly with blood on his face. Ollinger was placed in a temporary holding cell while police investigated. Police said they took photographs of the cell and Kelly's body. When it was time to photograph Ollinger's injuries, he told officers, “good luck cracking the case.” Officers interviewed nearby inmates in other cells. According to the arrest report, they told police they heard a fight, and someone was screaming for their life. According to the arrest report, Ollinger said he had a “supernatural ability” to read people and know things about them. The report says his ability told him Kelly was a predator and he had a “responsibility” to identify predators because he had his own children taken away from him. Ollinger said Kelly screamed for help as he strangled him for about four to five minutes. Ollinger found fame on The Discovery Channel's show, “Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch.” He was sentenced for the contempt charge on December 18. The records show he was scheduled for release on January 12, 2026. The arrest report says Ollinger was rebooked for open murder. He is scheduled in court for a hearing Tuesday.</p>
