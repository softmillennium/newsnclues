                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The association between periodontitis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is stronger than previously recognized, a new scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) suggests. Evidence also shows that treatment of periodontal disease can reduce inflammatory factors and improve certain intermediate risk markers associated with ASCVD. However, there is still insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship, the statement authors said. “There has been increasing research showing an association between periodontal disease and heart disease; however, additional studies are needed to further clarify mechanisms and long-term effects from childhood into adulthood,” said lead author of the statement, Andrew H. Tran, MD, MPH, assistant professor of pediatric cardiology and director of preventive cardiology at The Heart Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. “We hope that this scientific statement brings attention to a modifiable risk factor that could decrease the risk of heart disease if addressed and spur additional research in this area,” he said. Previous research indicates periodontal treatment improves inflammation-related blood markers and some intermediate cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In the US, 42% of adults aged 30 years or older have periodontitis, with 7.8% experiencing severe disease. Severe periodontitis is more common among older adults, smokers, non-Hispanic Black people, and Mexican Americans. These populations also carry a disproportionately high burden of ASCVD risk. Those studies include a 2024 umbrella review of periodontal disease and CV risk published in BMC Oral Health and a look at the association between these two diseases in a 2025 study published in The International Journal of Molecular Sciences. The statement authors also cited additional proposed pathways, including immune cross-reactivity, prothrombotic effects through increased platelet activation, and oral microbiome dysbiosis, all of which may contribute to vascular disease. Reviews of multiple Cochrane systematic analyses and key clinical trials indicate that evidence remains insufficient to conclude that periodontal treatment prevents adverse CV events. Establishing a direct causal link is challenging, largely because both conditions share common risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and socioeconomic disadvantage. “This important new American Heart Association scientific statement brings attention to an often-overlooked potential risk factor for heart problems — gum disease,” said Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, MPH, MBA, director of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, New York City. He noted that a prior analysis from the US NHANES registry found a clear relationship between increasing severity of periodontitis and CV risk. “While a cause-and-effect relationship has not been definitively established, regular brushing, flossing, and dental visits remain sound advice regardless of their direct impact on cardiovascular risk,” said Bhatt, who was not part of the statement writing group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI model using deep transfer learning – the most advanced form of machine learning – predicted with 92 % accuracy spoken language outcomes at one-to-three years after cochlear implants (implanted electronic hearing device), according to a large international study published in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery. Although cochlear implantation is the only effective treatment to improve hearing and enable spoken language for children with severe to profound hearing loss, spoken language development after early implantation is more variable in comparison to children born with typical hearing. Researchers trained AI models to predict outcomes based on pre-implantation brain MRI scans from 278 children in Hong Kong, Australia and U.S., who spoke three different languages (English, Spanish and Cantonese). Such complex, heterogenous datasets are problematic for traditional machine learning, but the study showed excellent results with the deep learning model. It outperformed traditional machine learning models in all outcome measures. "Our results support the feasibility of a single AI model as a robust prognostic tool for language outcomes of children served by cochlear implant programs worldwide. This is an exciting advance for the field," said senior author Nancy M. Young, MD, Medical Director of Audiology and Cochlear Implant Programs at Ann & Robert H.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gestational diabetes rose every single year in the U.S. from 2016 through 2024, according to a new Northwestern Medicine analysis of more than 12 million U.S. births. The condition, which raises health risks for both mother and baby, shot up 36 % over the nine-year period (from 58 to 79 cases per 1,000 births) and increased across every racial and ethnic group. "Gestational diabetes has been persistently increasing for more than 10 years, which means whatever we have been trying to do to address diabetes in pregnancy has not been working," said senior author Dr. Nilay Shah, assistant professor of cardiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Gestational diabetes, a form of glucose intolerance first diagnosed during pregnancy, carries immediate pregnancy risks and increases the chance of future diabetes and heart disease for both the mother and the child. Shah said the alarming trend likely reflects worsening health among young Americans. "The health of young adults has been persistently worsening - less healthful diets, less exercise, more obesity," he said. These trends likely underlie why the rates of diabetes during pregnancy have gone up." It will publish on Dec. 29 in JAMA Internal Medicine. The team then broke down the data by race and ethnicity and found that women who are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or from other Pacific Islander groups had substantially higher gestational diabetes rates than other groups. "This is particularly important because these populations tend to be the least well-represented in health research, so we actually understand very little about why these groups have such high rates," Shah said. Here's how many women per 1,000 births had gestational diabetes in 2024: "The reasons for the differences in gestational diabetes rates across individual groups are an important area for further research," Shah said. "We saw a lot of variation within Asian and Hispanic groups, which often gets overlooked in research," noted first author Emily Lam, a third-year medical student at Feinberg. "These data clearly show that we are not doing enough to support the health of the U.S. population, especially young women before and during pregnancy," Shah said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During their preparation for this battle, B cells transiently revert to a more flexible, or plastic, stem-cell-like state in the lymph nodes, according to a new preclinical study from Weill Cornell Medicine investigators. The results could help explain how many lymphomas develop from mature B cells rather than from stem cells, as many other cancers do, and guide researchers in developing better treatments. The study, published Dec. 29 in Nature Cell Biology, reveals a paradox: as mature B cells get prepped to make antibodies, a highly specialized process, they temporarily gain plasticity, a feature normally reserved for unspecialized stem cells. They do this by partially erasing their B cell features and activating stem-like programs, which are normally silenced in mature, differentiated cells. Thus, the cells can turn these changes on or off as needed. "Lymphomas are mostly driven by genetic mutations, but our study suggests that some of these mutations can take advantage of this epigenetic plasticity to drive tumor growth and fitness," said Dr. Effie Apostolou, associate professor of molecular biology in medicine and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine. Dr. Laurianne Scourzic, a former instructor of molecular biology in medicine, also co-led the work in collaboration with Dr. Ari Melnick, adjunct professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and director of the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona. After B cells encounter an antigen, a special environment called the germinal center forms around them in the lymph nodes, in which they cycle between two zones: In one zone, called the dark zone, B cells rapidly divide and mutate to make a random array of antibodies; then they move to the other zone, called the light zone, where they stop dividing and compete for selection from helper T cells in order to either form antibody-secreting cells or memory B cells, long-lived cells that help the body remember the antigen it encountered. If the B cells are not chosen for either of these options, they will undergo apoptosis (programmed death) or a minor fraction will recycle back for additional rounds of proliferation, mutation and selection. These rapid and multidirectional changes are unusual in normal mature cells and prompted Dr. Apostolou's team to hypothesize that the B cells might be reverting to a stem cell-like state during process. This goes against the central dogma that cells lose their plasticity and stemness as they develop." The team employed stringent functional methods to test the plasticity of these cells and found that indeed, germinal center B cells have drastically higher capacity to reprogram to a stem cell-like state compared with other mature B cells. Indeed, using various means to modulate the communication between B cells and T cells, the team could enhance or reduce B cell plasticity. Using single-cell techniques, Dr. Scourzic found that the B cells that interacted with helper T cells showed reduced expression of B cell-specific genes, weakening their B cell identity, while they re-activated stem and progenitor-like programs and regulatory elements, which are usually repressed during development. In another experiment, the researchers deleted a protein called histone H1, which is commonly mutated in lymphoma patients and normally keeps chromatin tightly packaged inside the B cells. "All the signatures that we identified for this highly plastic state seem to be even further upregulated in many lymphoma patients, and they correlate with worse prognoses," Dr. Apostolou said. "We believe that the normal, tightly regulated plasticity during immune reaction can be hijacked by specific mutations to promote lymphomagenesis or enhance fitness." Ultimately, identifying the mechanisms involved in germinal center B cell plasticity and their functional links to lymphoma mutations could help researchers find biomarkers indicating which patients would respond better to therapies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children with peanut allergies may not need large doses of peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) to build protection to peanut, finds a new study led by The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and Montreal Children's Hospital. Researchers found that a small dose can help children with their peanut allergy and reduce the risk of severe reactions from accidental exposures, with less side effects than the current standard treatment. Children receiving peanut OIT eat a gradually increasing amount of peanut over time until they reach a "maintenance" dose that is eaten regularly, even after the treatment, to help keep up the benefits. While peanut OIT can help children with peanut allergies to build protection, current approaches use large doses that require lengthy treatment, close medical supervision and often can result in discontinuation due to dislike of the taste and side effects of allergic reactions like anaphylaxis. The study is the first of its kind to compare a commonly used peanut OIT treatment to reduced doses in children, and provides evidence to support a significantly lower dose that could increase treatment accessibility and help protect more children with peanut allergy. To investigate the safety and effectiveness of a very low maintenance dose of peanut OIT, the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology – In Practice, randomly assigned 51 children with peanut allergy to three groups: low-dose treatment (30mg maintenance), standard-dose treatment (300mg maintenance) or avoidance (no peanut OIT). Both peanut OIT treatment groups experienced significant and similar increases in their allergic reaction threshold to peanuts, showing that eating even small amounts is better than avoidance when it comes to training the immune system to manage more peanut. "We were excited to find that peanut OIT maintenance doses can be much lower than previously thought and still contribute to positive outcomes," says Dr. Julia Upton, Head of the Division of Immunology & Allergy, Project Investigator in the SickKids Research Institute, Co-Director of the SickKids Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Program and co-first author. Children who were in the 30 mg maintenance group had fewer adverse reactions than the 300 mg maintenance group, and none withdrew from treatment. "This is a small enough dose that even children who do not like the taste can continue treatment," says co-senior study author Dr. Thomas Eiwegger, Adjunct Scientist in the Translational Medicine program. "This is the first time we've compared standard doses to such a low dose, but the minimum maintenance dose to provide benefit may be even lower than 30mg." The research team notes that some children and families may choose to remain on very low doses, while others may prefer to increase over time depending on their goals. This study marks an important step to further the development of safe and effective protocols for peanut OIT. "The study found that very small amounts of peanuts, that are associated with less reactions, could be used as effectively as large amounts for oral immunotherapy, making it safer and accessible to more Canadians, even those who are very sensitive to the allergen," says Dr. Moshe Ben-Shoshan, co-senior author of the study, a pediatric allergy and immunology specialist at the Montreal Children's Hospital and Scientist in the Infectious Diseases and Immunity in Global Health Program at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.

While treatments such as physical therapy, medication, or surgery can help, recovery tends to be slower in older adults, and pain may not fully resolve. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), data from 2023 showed that 24.3% of United States adults reported having chronic pain. Additionally, 8.5% of adults had chronic pain that affected their daily life and work. Studies using MRI scans have indicated that aging is associated with the shrinking of some regions of the brain, as well as with changes in gray and white matter, which are linked to slower processing speed and memory deficits. However, in conditions such as dementia, the brain often appears older than expected. The participants were part of a larger observational study on pain and osteoarthritis risk. At the start of the study, people with a higher protective score, including those with chronic pain, had brain ages that were up to 8 years younger than their chronological age. The researchers said their results show lifestyle and social habits matter more than pain severity alone. They emphasized that many of these factors can be changed, and people should speak with their healthcare providers about how to develop healthier habits. For example, they could speak with their providers about improving sleep, stopping tobacco use, and finding ways to improve social support. “It's a compelling practical study linking chronic pain and everyday lifestyle psychosocial factors to an MRI-based ‘brain age' measure,” Trinh who was not involved in this research, told us. He added that one of the study's strengths is using multiple brain scans. Trinh emphasized that brain age is “a biological risk marker, not a direct guarantee of better memory or dementia prevention,” and said that because the study is observational, it does not prove cause and effect. Still, he noted that modifiable factors such as sleep, stress, smoking, and social connection can add up over time. “Even if we can't change age or genetics, we can influence sleep quality, stress load, physical activity pacing in the presence of pain, smoking status, and social connection,” Trinh explained. Hanul Bhandari, MD, a neurologist and Chief Medical Officer at Vistim Labs, likewise not involved in this research, also spoke with MNT about the study. Bhandari said the study stands out for showing that brain aging is shaped by daily habits: “This study is compelling because it reframes brain aging as a dynamic process shaped by daily behaviors, psychosocial context, and chronic health stressors rather than as an inevitable consequence of time alone.” “Preserving brain health supports not just memory, but independence, adaptability, and overall lifespan quality,” Bhandari emphasized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite this poor prognosis, SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy. However, patients typically relapse and experience very rapid disease progression. Current research into the biological mechanisms behind SCLC remains essential in order to prolong treatment responses, overcome relapse and, ultimately, improve long-term patient outcomes. A research team led by Professor Dr Silvia von Karstedt (Translational Genomics, CECAD Cluster of Excellence on Aging Research, and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne – CMMC) has discovered a novel mechanism used by this type of cancer that helps explain its aggressive nature. The study titled "Lack of Caspase 8 Directs Neuronal Progenitor-like reprogramming and Small Cell Lung Cancer Progression" was published in Nature Communications. Unlike other epithelial cancers, SCLC shares features with neuronal cells, including lack of caspase-8 expression, a protein involved in programmed, non-inflammatory cell-death (apoptosis), a mechanism that is essential to eliminate faulty or mutated cells and to maintain health. To better mimic the features of human SCLC, the team generated and characterized a novel genetically engineered mouse model lacking caspase-8. Using this new model, the team observed that when this protein is missing, an unusual chain reaction sets off. "The absence of caspase-8 leads to a type of inflammatory cell death called necroptosis that creates a hostile, inflamed environment even before tumors fully form" explains von Karstedt. We were also intrigued to find that pre-tumoral necroptosis can in fact promote cancer by conditioning the immune system." The inflammation creates an environment where the body's anti-cancer immune response is suppressed, preventing immune cells from attacking threats like cancer cells. Surprisingly, the researchers observed that this inflammation also pushes the cancer cells to behave more like immature neuron-like cells, a state that makes them better at spreading and that is associated with relapse. While it remains unknown whether similar pre-tumoral inflammation also occurs in human patients, this work identifies a mechanism contributing to the aggressiveness and patient relapse in SCLC that could be exploited as a way to improve the efficiency of future therapies and early-stage diagnostic methods. Lack of caspase 8 directs neuronal progenitor-like reprogramming and small cell lung cancer progression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team at Oregon Health & Science University has discovered a promising new drug combination that may help people with acute myeloid leukemia overcome resistance to one of the most common frontline therapies. In a study published today in Cell Reports Medicine, researchers analyzed more than 300 acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patient samples and found that pairing venetoclax, a standard AML drug, with palbociclib, a cell-cycle inhibitor currently approved for breast cancer, produced significantly stronger and more durable anti-leukemia activity than venetoclax alone. That really motivated us to dig deeper into why it works so well - and why it appears to overcome resistance seen with current therapy," said Melissa Stewart, Ph.D., research assistant professor at OHSU and lead author of the study. Since the drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019, venetoclax combined with azacitidine has rapidly become a go-to treatment for many people with AML. "Unfortunately, almost everyone will eventually have drug resistance," said the study's corresponding author, Jeffrey Tyner, Ph.D., professor of cell, developmental and cancer biology in the OHSU School of Medicine. This regimen has improved initial response rates and quality of life, but the five-year survival rate for AML is still only about 25 % to 40 %. We have a lot of work to do." Tyner, a co-leader of the national Beat AML 1.0 program said the new study builds directly on the work of that national initiative to help transform and expand treatments for AML. "This combination was nominated from the Beat AML data, and Dr. Stewart validated that prediction, showing not only that it works, but why," Tyner said. The study found that AML cells exposed to venetoclax alone try to adapt by increasing protein production, a shift that helps them survive. Adding palbociclib, a drug approved for breast cancer, blocked this adaptation by regulating protein-production machinery inside the cell. "Patient samples that responded strongly to the combination showed clear downregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis," Stewart said. A genome-wide CRISPR screen also revealed that while venetoclax alone becomes more effective when protein-production genes are lost, the combination therapy does not rely on that same vulnerability - a sign the two drugs work together to shut down multiple survival pathways. The research team tested the combination using mouse models implanted with human AML cells carrying mutations known to cause venetoclax resistance. "In this model, venetoclax alone didn't extend survival at all - just as we'd expect based on the genetics," Stewart said. In fact, one mouse was still alive when the study ended." "I'm a breast cancer survivor and was treated here at OHSU, so I know what it's like to be a cancer patient," she said. Working on AML gave me a way to contribute." Both researchers emphasized the importance of following scientific data even when it leads outside traditional boundaries. "Some might ask why a breast cancer drug would work in AML," Tyner said. "But biology can be shared across very different cancers. This is a great example of why keeping an open mind matters and following the data where it leads." Stewart said that the team is already evaluating other drugs similar to palbociclib - many of them also approved for breast cancer - to expand future clinical trial options. "We haven't tested it in patients yet, but based on everything we've seen, our prediction is that this combination would mitigate most known resistance mechanisms to the current standard therapy," Tyner said. CDK4/6 inhibition overcomes venetoclax resistance mechanisms with enhanced combination activity in acute myeloid leukemia.
