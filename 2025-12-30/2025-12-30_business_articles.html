AI has radically transformed the software engineering industry, introducing code editors like Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex, along with a slew of agentic software development tools. Business Insider's Amanda Hoover called 2025 "the year coding changed forever." "Everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession," he wrote. Boris Cherny created Claude Code for Anthropic, now one of the most popular AI tools among developers. New graduates and early career coders may fare best in this new environment, Cherny wrote, because they don't assume what AI can and cannot do. Responding to Cherny, Karpathy wrote that he had similar experiences. He analogized the new tools to a weapon, one that sometimes "shoots pellets" or "misfires" — highlighting the work-in-progress nature of AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a claim by President Donald Trump's administration that it is legally barred from securing funding for the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, noting that a court order already bars the administration from shutting the agency down. The Trump administration has denied the CFPB additional cash to meet expenses since taking control of the agency in February but ithas been repeatedly blocked in the courts from firing workers en masse. CFPB representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Officials say cash on hand could be exhausted in early 2026 and the CFPB announced last month that an administration legal opinion held that, under the agency's governing statute, it could not seek additional funding from the Federal Reserve so long as the central bank is losing money. But in a stinging 32-page ruling, Berman Jackson said Tuesday this was a legally baseless pretext to get around her original order, finding that "the defendants are unabashedly trying to shut the agency down again, through different means." "It appears that defendants' new understanding of 'combined earnings' is an unsupported and transparent attempt to achieve the very end the court's injunction was put in place to prevent," Berman Jackson wrote, adding that the administration's "unilateral decision" to decline further CFPB funding would therefore be in violation. The agency's supporters say that without it the public will be more exposed to predatory lending practices, scams and other abuse. Trump and others have accused it of politicized enforcement and called it a burden on free enterprise. The agency was started to protect financial services consumers after the financial crisis of 2008. Unlike many federal agencies, the CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve, rather than through a budget set annually by Congress. But lawmakers this year slashed the CFPB's maximum allowable funding, meaning the agency may face tighter funding constraints regardless. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SoftBank has completed its $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI, sources told CNBC's David Faber. The Japanese investment giant sent over a final $22 billion to $22.5 billion last week, according to sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named in order to discuss details of the transaction. SoftBank had previously invested $8 billion in the ChatGPT maker and syndicated another $10 billion with co-investors. CNBC reported in February that the company was finalizing a $40 billion investment in the Sam Altman-run startup at a $260 billion pre-money valuation. At the time, Faber reported that the funding would be paid out over a 12-to-24-month period. Some money was slated to support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure Stargate joint venture with Oracle and SoftBank. Companies have been spending big in recent months to build out infrastructure to support a frenzy for AI solutions and growing compute needs. OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments over the next several years, including agreements with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Over the years, SoftBank has been betting big on technology and AI companies and was an early investor in chipmaker Nvidia. On Monday, the conglomerate agreed to pay $4 billion for data center investment firm DigitalBridge to strengthen its AI push. Last month, SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in major AI beneficiary Nvidia. The startup, which is reportedly preparing for an initial public offering, has received billions in funding over the years from tech juggernaut Microsoft. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that OpenAI was exploring the potential for a more than $10 billion investment from Amazon. Disney is also a recent backer, following a $1 billion equity investment deal that allows users of OpenAI's video generator Sora to generate content with licensed characters such as Mickey Mouse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eurostar urged passengers to change their travel plans on Tuesday as a problem with the overhead power supply forced the Channel Tunnel to close. "Due to a problem with the overhead power supply and a subsequent failed Le Shuttle train the Channel tunnel is currently closed. Unfortunately, this means we have no choice but to suspend all services today until further notice," Eurostar said in a statement warning of "major disruption" on its website. "Please do not come to the station. The disruption brings one of Europe's busiest international rail corridors to a near standstill during the New Year travel season. Photos published showed scores of people sitting around their bags at St. Pancras train station in London, as well as long queues of traffic as passengers waited to enter the Eurotunnel site in Folkestone in Kent. A statement from LeShuttle, which provides a railway service for people and their vehicles between Folkestone in the U.K. and Calais in France through the Channel Tunnel, said services were "temporarily suspended" for up to three hours due to a power supply issue. LeShuttle apologized for any inconvenience caused. The Eurostar service, by contrast, is just for passengers traveling to cities like Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. Getlink, which owns and operates Channel Tunnel infrastructure, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC. Eurostar, which runs services from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, carried 19.5 million passengers in 2024, marking the most successful year in its history. We want to hear from you.

After surging to record highs this year, the metal saw its biggest intraday swing in more than half of a decade yesterday. General Motors' investors were in the driver's seat this year. As CNBC's Michael Wayland reports, GM's stock is on track to outperform competitors in 2025 and notch its biggest one-year gain since the automaker exited bankruptcy in 2009. Shares have hit new all-time highs this month, thanks in part to a roughly 13% rise so far in December alone. The automaker's stock is on track to see its fifth straight winning month as Wall Street cheers the Detroit-based company's record of cash generation and resilient earnings. Meta said this morning that it has acquired artificial intelligence agent developer Manus. The Singapore-based startup this year launched its first AI agent, which can complete tasks such as coding and data analysis. Meta said the acquisition should help accelerate its AI innovation and further integrate automation into products such as its AI assistant. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that it closed at more than $2 billion, citing sources familiar. It's the latest AI investment for Meta, which earlier this month acquired wearables startup Limitless. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. President Donald Trump didn't mince words when discussing Iran yesterday. Trump said he would "knock the hell out of" Iran if the country attempts to rebuild its nuclear program, but suggested Iran should negotiate a deal. Trump, who yesterday met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also said he would support an Israeli attack on Iran if the country tries to rebuild its ballistic missile reserve or reinstate its nuclear program. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., is falling out of favor with his state's tech elite after supporting a wealth tax. California labor groups are pushing for a ballot measure that asks the state's billionaires to pay a one-time 5% tax to make up for an expected shortfall in the health-care system. In a social media post, Khanna reacted sarcastically to industry leaders' threats to leave the state if the ballot item succeeds. As CNBC's Garrett Downs notes, those tech leaders made clear their displease with Khanna online. Look no further than Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, who wrote that it's "time to primary him."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday said it was pulling out its remaining forces in Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for UAE forces to leave the country within 24 hours. The attack on what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date in a widening rift between the two Gulf powers. Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence. Declaring its national security a red line, Saudi Arabia earlier on Tuesday alleged the UAE had pressured Yemen's southern separatists to conduct military operations that had reached the kingdom's borders. It was Riyadh's strongest language yet against the UAE in the falling-out between the neighbours, who once cooperated in a coalition against Yemen's Iran‑aligned Houthis but whose interests in Yemen have steadily grown apart in recent years. Frictions grew inside the coalition as Abu Dhabi backed southern separatists seeking self-rule, while Riyadh kept supporting Yemen's internationally recognised government, eventually creating an open rift between the Gulf allies. On Tuesday the coalition struck what it said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the UAE-backed separatists. The head of Yemen's Saudi-backed presidential council gave Emirati forces an ultimatum of 24 hours to leave. The UAE said in a statement that it had been surprised by the airstrike, and that the shipment that had been attacked did not contain weapons and was destined for Emirati forces. Yemen's presidential council head, Rashad al-Alimi, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, the Yemeni state news agency said, and accused the UAE in a televised speech of fuelling strife in Yemen with its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC). The UAE earlier stressed that "dealing with recent developments must be done responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing coordination between the concerned parties." Major stock indexes in the Gulf fell. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both major players in the OPEC oil exporters' group, and any disagreements between the two could hamper consensus on oil output decisions. They and six other OPEC+ members are meeting online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates say they will continue their current policy for no change in first-quarter production.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It seemed investors had largely given up on Novo's ability to translate its strides in pioneering GLP-1 drugs to financial gains as the lucrative market attracts new players. Scientists, however, say that the medicine still has potential. What started with a focus on the drug's ability to manage weight and blood sugar, and combat related conditions such as heart disease, is now expanding further with growing interest in how it might also impact the brain. Semaglutide, or as it is better known, Ozempic and Wegovy, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that was originally developed for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugar levels. Now, the medical community is discovering a growing list of added benefits from these drugs. "Wegovy promotes weight loss and potentially other mechanisms not fully understood," the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote in a statement in August when it approved the drug for treating liver disease. Semaglutide is also cleared by regulators to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in overweight people with cardiovascular disease, as well as to treat chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients. Meanwhile, a rival drug by U.S. competitor Eli Lilly, tirzepatide (known as Mounjaro and Zepbound), which also targets the GLP-1 hormone as well as another gut hormone called GIP, is approved for treating moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity. Observational studies have shown that GLP-1s appear to quiet cravings not just for food, but also for alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, as they affect the brain's reward pathway. By seemingly changing dopamine signals in the brain, these drugs could reduce cravings and allow the individual to be more rational when faced with tempting options. "There is interest in understanding the potential of semaglutide on various brain functions," Laura Nisenbaum, executive director at Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), told CNBC. "Understanding that inflammation and energy usage in the brain is going to be so important for our normal cognitive function," Nisenbaum said. Recognizing that link will be useful in many different neurological and neuropsychiatric indications where changes or damage to the brain impact mood, behavior or cognition, she added. Evolving data suggest that semaglutide and rival drug tirzepatide made by Eli Lilly might be the first effective "anticonsumption" agents with the potential to treat excessive food cravings, obesity, alcohol consumption, nicotine addiction, recreational drug use, and even uncontrollable shopping behaviors, a study by researchers at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute and University of Missouri found. Another small-scale randomized clinical trial found that low-dose semaglutide reduced alcohol consumption and significantly reduced cravings compared to placebo in patients with alcohol use disorder over nine weeks of treatment. In November, Novo disappointed investors when it published data on a two-year-long clinical trial testing whether semaglutide could slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hopes had run high that the medicine might be able to help people suffering from the most common type of dementia, as it had been observed in real-world studies that diabetes patients taking semaglutide developed Alzheimer's at a lower rate than those who didn't. But the late-stage trial failed to meet its main goal, showing that semaglutide didn't significantly impact cognition in Alzheimer's patients. However, some scientists told CNBC it shouldn't be seen as a failure. They say that even if the results were disappointing, it was a well-conducted trial that the science community was able to learn from. "It just gave a negative result as far as the drug is concerned in that particular population," said Ivan Koychev, associate professor in neuropsychiatry at Imperial College London. "They're impacting Alzheimer's disease-linked proteins, they reduce their quantity in the cerebrospinal fluid, which suggests that it is interacting directly with the alternative pathology." There was also an observed reduction in systemic inflammation biomarkers, according to Novo. Similarly, Nisenbaum said a next useful step would be to test semaglutide and other GLP-1s earlier in the course of the disease as a preventative therapy. Novo Nordisk said it was reviewing all data from the trial, but that it was too early to speculate any further on the effect semaglutide might have on dementia patients. The stock's year-to-date drop of 50% is being driven by increased competition from U.S. rival Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies making cheaper, copycat versions of semaglutide. A failure to convince investors that its pipeline will bring significant financial gains amid a flurry of hopeful market entrants also adds to the pressure. The Alzheimer's trial data readout in November led shares to drop 5.8% on the day, despite analysts saying it was always a long shot and Novo management themselves called it a "lottery ticket," — underlining its highly uncertain outcome. "It's absolutely about the long game," she added, hopeful that semaglutide or other novel drugs that target risk factors could be used in combination with Kisunla and Leqembi. But the market doesn't see it like that, and there are many reasons why. First of all, investors' time horizons are much shorter than the decades-long process it typically takes to bring a drug to market, meaning pharmaceutical development often clashes with the speedier pace of public markets. Adding new indicators for a drug also takes time, as they need to be backed up by often lengthy clinical trials. Secondly, semaglutide is facing key patent expiries in 2031 and 2032, which will give the green light to others to make generic versions of semaglutide. "We don't see a good argument for a valuation floor," Jefferies analysts said late November, noting that Novo now enters the 5-year patent expiry window with no real moat. "Lower U.S. prices may stimulate additional volume demand and enhance patient retention, but we are not of the view that, at these prices, generics and compounders cannot compete," they added, rating shares at Underperform. Pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for Americans, and the threat of high import taxes, have served as additional headwinds for Novo, as well as for many of its pharma peers over the past year. Goldman Sachs analysts, led by James Quigley, are slightly more optimistic. "We remain Buy-rated on Novo Nordisk, as while expectations have reset sharply downwards for near/medium-term estimates, we continue to believe there could be some volume opportunity for Novo as the obesity market evolves," they wrote in a note late November. "While Novo are unlikely to take a leading share, we still see opportunities for Wegovy, CagriSema and oral Wegovy to drive value in excess of what the market currently believes, although we acknowledge that this will likely take time and evidence of an uptick in scripts before investors give credit," they added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billionaire Elon Musk has put humanoid robots in the spotlight this year, positioning them as central to Tesla's valuation, which he thinks could hit tens of trillions of dollars. But Tesla is yet to sell its flagship humanoid robot Optimus. "While both countries are expected to build similarly large markets over time, China is scaling more rapidly in this initial phase." Humanoid robots are designed to be shaped and move like a human. Artificial intelligence algorithms power their abilities along with complex hardware like semiconductors. Proponents say they could be used across various settings, from factories to hospitality and even in the home. Over the past few years, China has made robotics a key focus of its tech strategy, unveiling plans to create supply chains and mass production of the machines. "Embodied artificial intelligence," a term that refers to AI-driven hardware like robotics or driverless cars, was mentioned in the text. For China, humanoid robots represent an opportunity to address labor challenges in the world's second-largest economy as well as advancing Beijing's quest for tech supremacy. "China's push into humanoid robotics development is driven by a combination of addressing demographic pressures, driving the next horizon of economic growth, and strengthening its role in global competition," Karel Eloot, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, told CNBC. China's birth rates are declining and the population is aging, leading to a reduced number of people in the workforce and rising labor costs. Meanwhile, China is locked in an ongoing tech race with the U.S. across multiple sectors. Politico reported this month that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been meeting with the CEOs of robotics companies to form a plan to accelerate the industry. Washington is considering issuing an executive order on robotics next year, Politico reported, citing people familiar with the matter. "China could be the most important market for humanoids," RBC Capital Markets said in a note this month. Analysts at the bank forecast a global total addressable market for humanoids of $9 trillion by 2050, with China accounting for more than 60% of that. Chinese robotics firms are attempting to power ahead with mass production. Unitree, which is gearing up for an initial public offering that could value it at around $7 billion, is one of China's buzziest robotics players. It makes humanoid robots for both an industrial setting, like a factory, as well as commercial applications, like being a tour guide. The company is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and this month carried out a share placement to raise around $400 million to fund its expansion. AgiBot is another player that said this month its 5,000th humanoid robot rolled off the production line. Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng also debuted its second-generation humanoid robot called Iron last month, and plans to begin mass production of the product next year. China's manufacturing prowess and success in ramping up production in other products like electric vehicles, may give it an edge when it comes to robotics, analysts said. "The depth of China's supply chain means companies can develop and manufacture robots at a significant cost advantage compared to other regions," Ethan Qi, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. The U.S. however, has "advantages in AI, autonomy and advanced algorithmic development," Horváth's Brauchle said. American firms are "betting on vertical integration" — which means owning and controlling more of the supply chain — according to McKinsey's Eloot. This includes components like actuators, which power a robot's movement, as well as the AI software that is integrated into the final product. "The belief is that tighter ownership of the full system will deliver superior performance, stronger safety cases, and defensible intellectual property," Eloot said. "Over the long term, both countries are expected to converge toward similarly large markets, whereby absolute mass-market penetration is expected after 2040, driven primarily by high-volume adoption in private households," Brauchle said. One bottleneck is its restricted access to certain chips required for robots. "I think there's a very high reliance on U.S. chips, for example, Nvidia chips," Jacqueline Du, head of China industrial tech research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC's "The China Connection" last month. Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester, noted a number of other potential hurdles, such as AI limitations in unpredictable operating conditions for humanoids and regulatory barriers. "Most robotic hands fall well short in effective degrees of freedom, sharply limiting their range," McKinsey's Eloot notes. Eloot said that product costs for today's advanced humanoid prototypes range from $150,000 to $500,000 per unit. In November, China's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), warned there is a risk of a bubble forming in the humanoid robotic market. The NDRC said that there are more than 150 humanoid robotics companies in China, with that number growing, and many of them are bringing out similar products. In the past, there have been boom and bust cycles around technology that Beijing has given strategic importance, such as electric vehicles. "Many assume that humanoid robots will soon exceed human-level versatility, speed and autonomy. Manufacturers reinforce this perception through polished demonstration videos and staged trade-show performances that present capabilities not yet reproducible in real industrial environments," Horváth's Brauchle said. "This gap between perception and reality increases the risk of an investment bubble." "A market correction could slow innovation and commercialization momentum," Forrester's Dai added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million. Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant. "Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses," Meta said. According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added. Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent. The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn. "Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made," Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies. Meta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models. In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team. Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion "tokens" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers. Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google.
