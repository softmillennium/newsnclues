Rob Reiner, who tragically died along with his wife Michele earlier this month, will be remembered for making unforgettable movies that touched generations of viewers. This week, Elwes — who was in his early 20s when he played Westley, the dashing but often hapless hero of the film — joined his co-stars and many of Reiner's other collaborators and colleagues in paying tribute to the filmmaker, actor, and philanthropist known for titles like “Stand by Me” and “When Harry Met Sally.” Like many who spoke out after the couple's alleged murder, Elwes described Reiner's warm personality and graciousness on set, something that often set him apart from other big names in the industry, as well as his willingness to take a chance on a young, relatively unknown actor.

And from that very first meeting I fell in love with him. I was already a fan of his work so meeting him in person was a dream come true. I also knew that by casting me as Westley he was giving me the keys to the castle,” the actor wrote in an Instagram post on December 29, adding that the first thing he noticed about the director was that “he wore his heart on his sleeve.” “This was a man who felt deeply. Whose heart was filled with love and compassion. He just wanted to know if you were a ‘good guy. But while you are making it, that's your time on the planet, so you wanna make it good.' And boy was my time with him on The Princess Bride beyond great. I can't remember a single day without laughter,” he wrote of the film, which was based on a 1973 romantasy novel by William Goldman. Praising her talent and passion for lifting others up, he wrote, “To say that they were a great team would be an understatement. Their only interest in fame was that it allowed them to shine a light on causes they believed in, especially helping those who were marginalized. But without fail Rob would always find a way to make us laugh. His laugh was one of the greatest sounds I've ever known — so heartfelt it still rings in my ears.” As the British actor — who went on to star in a string of ‘90s commercial and cult hits, including “Days of Thunder,” “Bram Stoker's Dracula,” “The Crush,” and “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” — closed his message, he referenced a line from the film that changed the course of his career. “Sure, death cannot stop true love but life is pain without you. In the hours and days following the Reiners' death on December 14, the people whose lives they touched, either directly or indirectly, expressed both heartbreak and gratitude for what they left behind. But many of those closest to the couple have taken time to process their thoughts and mourn in privacy. Given the immense legacy that Reiner alone forged, it's safe to assume that it will be a long time before the actors, writers, and directors who had the pleasure of working with him — along with the many people affected by his warmhearted films — will be finished reflecting on the once-in-a-lifetime cinematic personality.

Meanwhile, Gaby (Jessica Williams) is reconsidering her career choices, and Paul navigates his Parkinson's disease and gets some tips from Michael J. Fox isn't the only guest star in need of therapy. Season three also features Brett Goldstein, Damon Wayans Jr., Wendie Malick, Cobie Smulders, and Jeff Daniels. After debuting to positive reviews in 2023, Shrinking grew in esteem throughout season two and received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series.

In an unusually competitive documentary landscape this awards season — featuring the return of an Oscar-winning Ukrainian filmmaker from a warzone, a critical and audience phenomenon that reached millions via Netflix — one especially unlikely contender has still managed to stand out. With her first documentary feature in nearly 30 years, Julia Loktev (The Loneliest Planet) is striking a chord with My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow, a vérité portrait of journalists in Russia as their country launches a war with Ukraine. In just under five and a half hours of runtime, these subjects feel the tightening, irreversible grip of authoritarianism forcing them out of their home — but they still live life, sharing meals and making jokes, and taking things day by day. Taken together, My Undesirable Friends weaves an epic tapestry of humanity. Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Awards Nominations: 'Frankenstein,' 'One Battle After Another,' 'Sinners,' 'Weapons,' 'Wicked: For Good' Lead Film Nods Oscars: Read THR's Reviews of the Shortlisted Documentary Features (It was self-distributed to qualify for Oscars consideration this cycle.) In the time since, My Undesirable Friends has won top documentary prizes from the New York Film Critics' Circle and other regional groups, been shortlisted for the best doc Oscar, and dominated publications' year-end best-of lists among nonfiction movies. Accordingly, just as Loktev finishes work on her second, equally lengthy installment, the film's fortunes may soon change. “We should hopefully have news soon,” Loktev tells The Hollywood Reporter. “When you see on paper, ‘Oh, it's a five and a half hour film about Russian journalists,' you go, ‘Scary, I'm not sure about that,'” she says. See below for THR's Q&A with Loktev. Did an episodic format ever come up, especially with the existing chapter structure? I shot it alone with an iPhone, no crew, and basically have been the director, producer, cinematographer — and I had a co-editor and an assistant editor, so literally most of the film has been three people. I started filming a film in Russia four months before the full scale war, when nobody knew that Russia would start this horrific war in Ukraine, and then history just started unrolling super fast, and I was there and filming it all. I continued to film all the characters in exile and then I just thought, I have this incredible historic footage, captured through people you get to know as characters the way you would in a fiction film. I let the film become what it needs to be rather than have somebody tell me what it should be. There was a point very early in the editing process that I walked away from equity that would've funded the whole film. As you were starting to put this together, what told you that this was the final format, a five-plus-hour film? It's not typical, obviously, even if you had so much footage to work with. If you make it into an hour and a half film or a two hour film, yes, you could do it and it would be this condensed version where you get the information — and you can get the information in a New York Times article, you can find the information elsewhere. You're having trouble sometimes keeping up reading the subtitles so fast, but it's dense. (Laughs) I would've had a lot more money to make it if they did — and a lot more money now for an awards campaign, God knows. We don't question, now, is War and Peace a novel? The beauty of the film is that this feeling of real life happening, but you are still a filmmaker and there is a certain rigor to your approach. I just tried to work really organically, even in the shooting: Something is happening in front of you and you're just trying to keep up and frame the shot. Because I do come from fiction, I don't know if I filmed them any differently than I would an actor giving a great performance, except it happens to be true in their real life and all the more tragic for that. One of the things that I learned so much from this as a filmmaker is that people are so much more complicated and so much more contradictory and interesting than I could ever write them, to be honest. When we write fiction, so often people go a little bit more on the nose — if people are going through a tragic moment, they stay in that tragic moment. What I constantly observed with people here is this shift from the most terrible horrible things, to sudden humor, back to the terrible horrible things — very inappropriately and wonderfully and in a way that I'd think, “Wow, I wish I could write like this.” This taught me so much in having to observe in a very focused way as you're filming, and seeing people joke in the middle of their lives falling apart. What was your relationship to the subjects like? I knew Anna Nemzer, who leads us into this world. She knew all the other characters in some way professionally or as peripheral acquaintances, friends to different degrees. She brought me into this world as a trusted person. It would be a completely different relationship if I was coming in without that. That's a huge part of the film because you experience it with me — you literally meet a lot of these characters as I'm meeting them. They're “undesirable” only because that's what the Russian government has marked them as. That's an actual legal category in Russia where they have marked most journalist organizations and most of civil society as “undesirable organizations.” They're undesirable to their authoritarian project. How have you experienced screening the film over the last few months, getting it out there in an awards context? When I heard what the streamers spend on their films, my jaw dropped. We are just doing our best on a micro budget. You're feeling small and insignificant and feeling FOMO when you have no budget to do anything about it. It's unfortunate that that's how things are, but it is how things are and all you can do is your best. We just want the film to reach an audience. It must feel like a nice bit of vindication, then, when you hit the Oscars short list or pick up these critics' awards. And $1 or $2 million for a campaign couldn't hurt. Can I ask what you are working with in terms of money? We're just trying to extract so little — like, well, I shouldn't say that in print. In all honesty, it's production money that was supposed to eventually pay me, and literally the characters in the film. Laura Poitras did an event with us at my house and I went to Tashkent Supermarket, which has all this post-Soviet food in New York. There were no waiters with tiny hors d'oeuvres. Laura's been supportive, and I love her film [Cover-Up] as well. The film's portrait of living under creeping authoritarianism has certainly resonated in the U.S., as it's a relevant topic these days. How people perceive the film has shifted so much since we opened at the New York Film Festival [in 2024]. What's interesting to me is it's not just about the larger picture, but very specific details in the film that were specific to something happening in Russia that suddenly took on resonance. Somebody has a throwaway joke about when they shut down Russia's biggest comedy show. Or when Russia shuts down its oldest human rights organization, which was dedicated to preserving the memory of political repression and addressing political repression in the current times, the judge says, “Why must we talk about our unpleasant history? We must be proud.” Of course, I'm watching Trump with the Smithsonian now and saying, “Why must we talk about unpleasant things like slavery?” Last night I read about the 60 Minutes piece being pulled. The crackdown on journalism with Russia, they didn't go straight for charging journalists with treason and extremism or terrorism. They started with economic pressure, pulling advertisements or threatening to sue journalists for libel — various kinds of strong-arm techniques that all looked perfectly so-called “reasonable.” One of the nicest things that I've heard from people is that it gives them a way of processing the current moment because we're living through something unprecedented and we don't know how to deal with it emotionally. There is this cognitive dissonance or horrible things happening in our country. If you look around your neighborhood, it looks more or less the same. Life looks nice, and yet what's actually happening is horrific. They don't look like V for Vendetta. Authoritarianism is really good for some people, and for the rest of us, it is this cognitive dissonance where parts of our lives remain intact and seem very normal, and meanwhile, people are being snatched into unmarked vans by masked men. I've edited four out of the five chapters, and so now I have to edit the last one. I'm in the process of doing that now. It's scary, but I am being given a little bit of hope. But if the Vladimir Putin regime ever falls, we're going to go back and make a third installment. We may be very, very old by then because it's not going to go well probably right after. Do you know where this story ends for now, as a film? I'm not actively filming a lot, but as I'm meditating on the last chapter, I want to end as closely to where we leave off as possible because the story keeps unfolding. Once I get three quarters of the way or 80% of the way with editing this chapter, I want to film that one thing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Burchett's post, on Monday, retweeted a five-second clip of White saying, “Don't even think about listening to my music, you fascist.” In his response, White said that the video was AI-generated. All of Trump's lackeys and bootlicks like this elected official are cowards that would never talk this way to anybody like me or you in person. Trump really lowered the bar when he brought his scourge to this government.” White's response criticized what he characterized as “sycophantic” politicians who lack dignity and “regurgitate … fake Christian(!) rhetoric.” He expressed a wish that “the average American conservative” could converse with people from other countries to learn “what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become.” Ultimately, he described Congressman Burchett, and those like him, as embarrassing. “I've said it before and I'll say it again: There will come a time in the future when none of these right wingers will admit to being a part of this cult from this time period,” he wrote. … I'm wondering if half of these so called representatives have ever actually read the Constitution that they pledged an oath to.” Chappell Roan Removes Brigitte Bardot Tribute After Learning About ‘All That Insane Shit' NewJeans' Label Terminates Danielle's Contract, Puts Full Group's Return in Limbo Although White did not tell MAGA supporters not to listen to his music, he has called Donald Trump “a disgusting, vile, egomaniac loser, child,” for the president's response to Rob Reiner's death, and has said that he considers Trump's insults a “badge of honor.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And so the scene is set for Thor‘s story in Avengers: Doomsday, the highly anticipated Marvel movie reuniting its most famous superheroes against a new enemy: Robert Downey Jr's Doctor Doom. Chris Hemsworth will return as the God of Thunder, and the Doomsday teaser features him on bended knee in a sepia-lit forest praying to his late father, the Norse god Odin. He is pleading for a safe return to his daughter, Love, who will be played by Hemsworth's real-life daughter, India. The character first appeared in 2022's Thor: Love and Thunder. The Thor-themed trailer is the second to be released, following a teaser revealing the return of Chris Evans as Steve Rogers — another character doting on their child ahead of impending doom. The Doomsday teasers are playing in cinemas attached to showings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. Avengers: Doomsday will be the big Christmas movie next year, premiering on December 18, 2026. Joe and Anthony Russo's last Avengers title, Endgame, is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.799 billion at the global box office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Brigitte Bardot just died at 91, and it's hard to imagine anything she would have liked less than a curated list of movie recommendations from her brief, inescapable film career. But to let the controversial French icon's death go by as yet another moment of her quiet, confused erasure would be to knowingly repeat a mistake audiences have made with Bardot countless times before. Love her, hate her, or lust after her, cinema's original and most contentious “cool girl” still deserves better.When Bardot abruptly exited the film business at age 39, she was an international sex symbol and one of the most famous faces in the fashion industry. In Hollywood, that denial was treated as permission to collapse the Bardot persona into a static set of visual signifiers, which were swiftly Americanized. Her artistic essence was reduced to a repeatable French “look,” and the woman herself pivoted into animal activism. and was soon recognized as an emblem of the jeune fille. That youthful, “clean girl” aesthetic rewired European style back then and laid the groundwork for the '50s/'60s mod chic we're still chasing in design today. Bardot's entrance onto the film scene was an act of romantic, rich-girl defiance, too, one that hinged on her turning 18. Traveling to auditions, Bardot rebelled against her parents by dating Roger Vadim, then a director's assistant whom she met on a failed casting call. The first of Bardot's four husbands, Vadim eventually cast her as Juliette Hardy in 1956's “And God Created Woman.” The filmmaker didn't sexualize his star so much as relocate erotic agency into her hands, and Bardot changed the cinematic framing of physical desire as a result. The character of Juliette Hardy was a feminine force driven by so-called “masculine” urges, and Bardot's memorable portrayal — ethereal, emotionally detached, and energized rather than disgusted by the novelty of sex — had consequences that continue to ripple through film, gender, and politics today. Already successful but not yet seismic when she broke out 70 years ago, Bardot became a cultural symbol almost overnight. In the actress' own writing (Bardot authored a memoir and several quasi-memoirs beginning in the 1990s), she reflected on a profound ambivalence toward feminism, fame, and family. An unattainable reflection of sexual mystique, Bardot is often compared to Marilyn Monroe, and she's acknowledged that both were exploited as young women in Hollywood. Her withdrawal from film was never fully forgiven by the fans who didn't understand it, and you can view what followed as a deeply unlikable attempt to wrestle control of a mythic image far bigger than Bardot herself. By the mid-1970s, Bardot had withdrawn from performing entirely, and she increasingly framed that alienation as a kind of moral clarity. Bardot was fined by the French government repeatedly for racist and hateful rhetoric. That trajectory has made it easier to dismiss Bardot rather than reckon with her contradictions. But what's been lost in the repeated calls for her metaphorical dismissal is the degree to which Bardot's acting presence forever changed our understanding of female autonomy. What's more, we've missed her resistance to a tidy moral arc off-screen as an extension of that flawed legacy. At Bardot's most famous, her work didn't offer apology but friction-filled pleasure and unresolved playfulness. The face that redefined desirability ultimately spent years fleeing visibility. That trajectory says as much about the culture that consumed Bardot as it does the icon herself, and revisiting these seven movies in the wake of her death isn't an act of absolution or nostalgia. It's an insistence on contending with women's complexity, however uncomfortable, and letting their imperfections pierce through to become poetry. Listed in chronological order, seven essential feature films of Brigitte Bardot. Shot in sunny Saint-Tropez (not far from where Bardot spent her final days in 2025), director Roger Vadim's debut follows Juliette Hardy (Bardot) as she ricochets between lovers, marriage, and rejection — refusing to organize her passion around punishment or repentance. She's revolutionary because “And God Created Woman” refused to moralize her desire. Bardot behaves as if wanting is instinctual, not reward-based, and that seemingly obvious assumption about women subtly rewired film culture. The performance is raw, alluring, and executed without perceptible strategy. Directed by Michel Boisrond, 1957's “La Parisienne” is a fizzy romantic comedy that stars Bardot as a naive yet calculating young woman navigating Parisian high society and political intrigue as the daughter of the French president. Breezy and knowingly lightweight, the film captures Bardot at the precise moment she was transforming her rumored sex appeal into silly charm that could sell tickets. The role also shows how quickly autonomy can be stylized into something consumable, even as Bardot remains magnetic. Jean-Luc Godard's exquisite “Contempt” from 1963 would indirectly look at the contradictions lesser Bardot films exposed, folding her ever-evolving reputation as a sex icon into a self-conscious meditation on art, commerce, and betrayal. The script unfolds during the collapse of both a marriage and a movie, and shot in widescreen color with aggressively composed primary hues, the film foregrounds Bardot's body even as it withholds access to her inner life. “Contempt” doesn't see Godard rescue Bardot's warping ingénue image; he anatomizes it with exacting style. In Louis Malle's “Viva Maria!,” Bardot stars opposite Jeanne Moreau as an opportunistic music hall performer out for a big adventure. The two women accidentally become revolutionaries alongside a strapping George Hamilton while traveling through a fictional Latin American country, and Bardot fully immerses herself in that theatrical fantasy. Her years of ballet as a young girl show immediately, and Bardot is funny and self-aware — having too much fun for any serious misunderstanding. Here, her liberation is still thrilling but it's also absurd. Desperate for privacy in a world that refused to grant it, the real Bardot embraced a premise that audiences interpreted as a kind of confession, even as the movie was badly received by critics and bombed at the box office. It presents attraction itself as a kind of quiet violence but fails to achieve the meta impression made by the earlier “Contempt,” a sure sign that Bardot's grasp on her own persona was already slipping away five years before she quit. Transplanted into another Western framework she only sort of fit after “Viva Maria!,” Bardot was miscast by Edward Dmytryk not because she lacked the presence for a romantic gunslinger but because the film offered no language for her flavor of autonomy. Rather than diminishing Bardot, that mismatch quietly exposes the limits of global stardom in the late '60s, and Bardot comes out looking not neutral but stripped of her specificity. That's why “Shalako” best captures Hollywood's inability to understand her as one of its all-time greatest assets — with or without the cowboy hat. A kind of anti-farewell for Bardot, her final film from 1973 is uncomfortable, unsentimental, and largely denied audiences the artistic grace note they wanted from the actress. In Nina Companeez's “The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot,” the star appears as an ensemble player in a bawdy historical farce about a sexually innocent young man (Francis Huster) and his belated awakening amid a kidnapping. Bardot is deliberately ungainly here, reinforcing her lifelong resistance to seeming palatable even as she's walking out the door. It's a shrugging kind of comedy from her, but also an indelible reminder that, for better or worse, Bardot rarely allowed her history to seem simple.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gia Giudice is speaking candidly about what it took to bring her family back together. The “Next Gen NYC” star recently confirmed she spent Christmas Eve with her uncle Joe Gorga and his wife Melissa Gorga — a major step forward for a family once plagued by tension. During a December 26 appearance on Jeff Lewis Live on SiriusXM, Gia shared that her mom, “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” star Teresa Giudice, initiated the reunion with Joe at their parents' gravesite. “After that conversation went really well, they were like, ‘OK, now it's time to have a conversation, us four. She added that Teresa's husband, Luis “Louie” Ruelas, and Melissa joined the conversation later at a nearby park, before all four continued the discussion at Willow & Whisk, a popular Bergen County brunch spot. This year's Christmas Eve was particularly meaningful, marking the first time Gia had ever visited Joe and Melissa's Franklin Lakes home. She said the evening was filled with heartfelt moments — including one with her cousins, Antonia, Gino, and Joey Gorga. “I even said something to my cousins,” Gia recalled. “I said I am sorry for the disconnect and that I'm so happy we're here in a place where we're together… My mom and my aunt, everyone chimed in, and they were just like, let bygones be bygones, and we have to move on.” “Even next year — my mom even said it — we should all cook together because [the food] is always better.” Still, one thing impressed the Bravo star: her aunt Melissa's Let's Sprinkle dessert line. Gorga initially launched her dessert line in December 2024 with a debut batch of soft, baked-to-order rainbow sprinkle cookies. The brand was inspired by a now-infamous scene from “The Real Housewives of New Jersey,” when Teresa Giudice criticized Melissa's contribution to their family's Christmas celebration. “She came to my house Christmas Day, she brought me sprinkle cookies,” Teresa recalled in the viral moment. “I said to her, ‘Melissa, nobody touched the cookies you brought. You know what my favorite cookies are? Despite the brand's origins, Gia has since embraced her aunt's dessert line, saying, “I like crumb cake… I thought the cake was very moist,” she said.

Elwes also shared his memories of Reiner's wife, Michele Singer Reiner, who was stabbed to death alongside her husband on Dec. 14. “Besides being a gifted photographer she was an incredibly loving, intelligent person,” Elwes shared. To say that they were a great team would be an understatement. Their only interest in fame was that it allowed them to shine a light on causes they believed in, especially helping those who were marginalized.

Tributes for Reiner and Michele have poured in since their deaths. Last week, Martin Scorsese published a moving essay in The New York Times about Reiner, who he first met in the 1970s. “Right away, I loved hanging out with Rob,” he wrote. “We had a natural affinity for each other. He was hilarious and sometimes bitingly funny, but he was never the kind of guy who would take over the room.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Big Brother” fans are mourning the sudden loss of Mickey Lee, and revisiting moments from her time in the house through a new, heartbreaking lens. After Lee's family announced that the 35-year-old season 27 star died on Christmas following flu complications, viewers resurfaced an old clip in which she casually discussed a palm reading from a fellow houseguest. A moment that once felt playful but is now being described by fans as “eerie” in hindsight. After the passing of Mickey Lee, a “Big Brother” 27 clip has resurfaced that shows Lee discussing a palm reading she received from fellow houseguest Ava Pearl. Oh, it's kinda short.” Then Ashley Hollis added, “[Pearl] freaked out, Mickey's like, ‘Does that mean I'm going to die early?' While the houseguests are joking in the video and having fun during an HOH sleepover, fans were quick to jump on social media to share how eerie the clip is following Lee's unexpected death. 💔 Gone too soon,” while another added, “I think Ava was being nice. Another fan happened to show concern for Ava's well-being after the news of Lee's passing, saying, “Does anyone know how Ava is doing btw? According to Parade, Pearl did speak on her Instagram Story following Lee's death. Pearl said, “Was hoping for different news regarding Mickey, a genuine tragedy for anyone to pass as young as she did.” No matter what, we lost a member of the ‘Big Brother' family, and she will be missed.” After her passing, Mickey's family started a GoFundMe page to help support them with medical expenses. She experienced a series of cardiac arrests due to complications from the flu and has since transitioned, surrounded by loved ones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 53 days in theaters (and a buzzy, fashion-filled press tour), “Wicked: For Good” will finally be available to stream on video-on-demand (VOD) retailers like Prime Video. The film's already generating early awards season buzz, with stars Ariana Grande (Glinda) and Cynthia Erivo (Elphaba) both clinching individual Golden Globes nominations. Read on for everything you need to know to catch act two of the much-discussed story — and change your at-home movie nights for good. Luckily for “Wicked” obsessives, purchased movies live in your Amazon account indefinitely and can be watched and rewatched as much as you'd like. While there's no word yet on when you'll be able to stream “Wicked: For Good” without purchasing it, the buzzy sequel will eventually make its way to Peacock, given it's owned by the same parent company as Universal Pictures. The first part of “Wicked” is already available to stream on Peacock. (If your 2026 plans also involve binging Apple TV shows, you can bundle the two services for $12.99/month.) As of now, “Wicked: For Good” is still in theaters. Given its predecessor became the highest-grossing Broadway adaptation of all time in 2024, in addition to taking home two Oscars, its run isn't done quite yet.

On Monday, the siblings put on a united front outside a Malibu, Calif., beach house where they've reportedly been staying since their parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, were tragically murdered earlier this month. In exclusive photos obtained by Page Six, the siblings appeared downcast while walking side-by-side. They were joined by Jake's girlfriend, Maria Gilfillan, and another female. At one point, the group was photographed standing in a circle and talking. The date marked her 28th birthday, and she spent it surrounded by loved ones. Jake joined his sister at the property on Sunday afternoon and was seen taking a somber stroll on the beach with his girlfriend. The 34-year-old and Romy have been staying under the radar since their parents were murdered at their Brentwood, Calif., home on Dec. 14. Romy discovered Rob and Michele's bodies after she went to check up on them when they missed a massage therapy appointment, sources told The Post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a time when Sony's universe of Spider-Man villains really looked like it might have been something. Or, rather, it looked that way to executives counting the surprising $850 million box office of Venom. Assuming that all Spider-Man's villains were as popular and beloved as Eddie Brock, Sony pressed forward with films about Dr. Michael Morbius, Madame Web, and a hunter named Kraven. The quick diminishing returns felt by audience members who didn't know they were buying tickets to an off-brand superhero franchise eventually led to the series flaming out with the unsurprising disappointment of Kraven The Hunter last December. If Sony hadn't been so protective of characters that really need a good and recognizable hero to give them some juice, they may have been able to make a pretty good Kraven movie directed by Ryan Coogler. In fact, during Coogler's interview with Happy Sad Confused today, the director revealed that he originally wanted the character for his first Black Panther, but Sony put the kibosh on Kraven. To be clear, Kraven wouldn't have been the film's big bad, nor would Michael B. Jordan have played the Hunter. Coogler tells host Josh Horowitz that he and co-writer Joe Robert Cole took inspiration from Christopher Priest's run of comics, which starts with Black Panther, Kraven, and Everett Ross fighting in a kitchen.
