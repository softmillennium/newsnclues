                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Timing the market and tracking rights reversions paid off for the hitmaker, who landed a mid-seven-figure deal for a portion of his publishing relatively early in his career. Yung Lan, a songwriter/producer who has worked with chart-topping artists including Morgan Wallen, Roddy Ricch and Youngboy Never Broke Again, has sold a portion of his publishing rights to GoldState Music in a mid-seven-figure agreement. “Despite his relatively young career, he has built up and managed a catalog of successful work across genres,” Yonas Aregai, chief of staff at GoldState, tells Billboard. GoldState, which was launched by Charles Goldstuck three years ago, and in April secured $500 million in financing to grow its music portfolio, says it acquired Lan's publishing rights to songs including Wallen's “Cowgirls,” a 2023 single with Ernest that hit No. 1 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart; Fetty Wap's “RGF Island”; and “Bacc Seat” by Roddy Ricch featuring Ty Dolla $ign, off Ricch's Billboard 200 chart-topping debut album Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial. Outside of the Lan acquisition, GoldState owns rights to notable tracks including Kanye West's “Flashing Lights,” Sheryl Crow's “If It Makes You Happy” and Panic! At The Disco's “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” — all included in catalogs it acquired from Catchpoint Partners and AMR Songs. But the firm also targets deals like the one with Lan that fit within “a sweet spot,” Aregai says: active music creators selling off a portion of their recent repertoire. There is evidence of that for “Cowgirls” and another Wallen track that Lan co-wrote, 2023's “Good Girl Gone Missin,'” both of which experienced a pickup in streaming in March and April ahead of the release of Wallen's fourth studio album, I'm the Problem, in May, according to data from Luminate. For Lan, who emerged from humble roots as a teenage Kanye West fan in rural Virginia, it took observing professional friends and collaborators selling their publishing rights to do it himself. Preparation for the deal began a year in advance and involved getting an independent evaluation, says Ruchir Mohan of 1916 Enterprises, who helped broker the agreement alongside lawyer Ben Cline. Lan — an active investor in Atlanta real estate, private lending and French bulldogs who also has his own studio, Defiant Studios, and production group, Milan Production Group — had kept close track of his publishing rights and the dates when they would revert to him. “The kind of work he and his team did up front before going to the marketplace, that adds to a catalog's price point,” says Aregai. After an introduction was made by Goldstate's lawyer at Fox Rothschild, Mohan, Lan and Goldstate were able to reach an agreement in six months, says Aregai, adding it is one of the “easiest deals” he's ever done. “At this point in my career, I'm interested in developing new talent, developing [Milan Production Group] and a lot more No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the fantasy explored by Weapons, writer-director (and former Whitest Kids U' Know member) Zach Cregger's thrilling follow-up to Barbarian. An unthinkable tragedy befalls a suburban town, and the ensuing coping—ranging from uncontrollable emotions, relapsed addictions, stress dreams, obsessive behavior, and conspiratorial thinking—drives the film through its perversely delightful horrors. As Cregger's script unfolds, doubles back, and reveals new details around events the film has already shown, it's more clever than terrifying, relying on its mystery and its likably frayed characters to propel a story that incorporates the wackiest tinfoil-hat thinking and most grounded emotional suffering spiraling out from the only things that arbitrarily rob Americans of classrooms full of kids: school shootings. But, despite its title, Weapons isn't a cheap allegory. The fast-twitch brutality of a cop (Alden Ehrenreich, channeling a slimy, self-loathing Bill Hader), the discarded despair of a homeless drug addict (Austin Abrams, just as funny and film-stealing as in Wolfs), the off-putting eccentricity of a visiting aunt (Amy Madigan, staggeringly versatile), and the by-the-book bureaucracy of a school principal (Benedict Wong) have nothing to do with kids stiffly running out of their homes and into the unknown, but they are real, recognizable elements of a flawed town. When these flailing characters ricochet off the fantastical disappearance (and each other, as many parents aggressively turn on Justine, who must know something), it's just as honest as the use of doorbell cams to document this modern nightmare. Those pushing too hard on the internal logic may, like with Barbarian, find themselves dissatisfied, but this is a far more satisfying riddle than Cregger's debut, even if it's in keeping with some emerging pet themes for the filmmaker. The underlying truth, the feeling that this is really how people would respond to something so senseless, allows dread to naturally build, and for the steam releases—whether in moments of sleep-depriving terror or through hilariously frustrated dialogue (many characters echo an inevitably arising audience concern: “What the fuck?”)—to just as naturally relieve it. This is aided by Larkin Seiple's flexibly slick camerawork, which shifts accordingly depending on the character the film is following, wobbling a little too closely to the vodka-chugging Justine or zipping in a rapid, nightmarish zoom when Archer's having a bad dream. Cregger's aesthetic is constantly playful and energetic, even when incorporating his patient, well-framed scares. For every gross-out Day Of The Dead moment or freaky-faced jumpscare, there are just as many invigorating sight gags or edge-of-your-seat beats of tension. Weapons rudely disrupts the illusion of suburban safety with impish delight and a fully stocked horror arsenal. This manifests in the real world all around us, as conspiracy theories infect our peers and Jim Acosta interviews a technozombified school-shooting victim. Weapons alchemizes this grasping, grotesque attempt at closure into bold, crowd-pleasing, gleefully R-rated horror.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teri Hatcher is showing fans what authenticity looks like—and encouraging others to do the same. On Aug. 5, the 60-year-old actress known for her roles in “Desperate Housewives” and “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” shared a series of makeup-free photos on Instagram. In her caption, the Hallmark actress reflected on aging, confidence, and how beauty is framed through different perspectives. “Walking at sunset in that magical golden hour any Oscar-winning DP would chase,” she wrote, posting a four-image collage of her evening stroll. “So, here's a no-filter shot of me facing the sun, and with it at my back. Every line…a story of real human effort, successes & flaws. Hatcher continued by emphasizing gratitude for what her face represents. “I choose gratitude for the time gifted in every wrinkle,” she said. The “Kiss Before Christmas” actress also shared screenshots from her 2010 press coverage, including headlines like “Teri Hatcher Moves Forehead, Squints Eyes,” as she publicly proved she hadn't used Botox at the time. In 2019, she went viral after sharing bikini photos at age 55, following an eight-week F45 challenge. In the post, she reflected on the empowerment that came with embracing her body as it was, writing, “this is my truth and being in this 55 year old body actually feels liberating. I've finally figured out how to be comfortable in my own skin.” The actress has often spoken about her wellness journey, revealing on TODAY with Hoda & Jenna that her goal was never just about weight loss.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Howard Stern unexpectedly returned from his long summer break on Wednesday morning (Aug. 5) to pay tribute to one of his favorite musicians, longtime friend of the show Ozzy Osbourne. With Ozzy's “Mama, I'm Coming Home” playing the background, Stern said he was playing the song because, “Ozzy's gone and I'm profoundly sad.” Calling him “one of the fabulous guests” of all time on his SiriusXM show, Stern invited Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich on to discuss Osbourne's passing on July 22 at age 76 of a heart attack and the to describe the vibe at at Osbourne's final concert, the all-star Back to the Beginning gig on July 5 in Birmingham, England. Ulrich first recalled the time in 2006 when Metallica inducted Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and played a few of their songs as Ozzy, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward looked on from the audience. “They were the generation that helped shape, and ultimately dictate, what we became” he said of Sabbath and their ilk. That's why when Back to the Beginning musical director Tom Morello called in September asking Metallica if they'd take part in what was being billed as Ozzy's final show the answer was a quick hell yes. Stern reminded Ulrich that he once said that heavy metal should have probably just been called “Black Sabbath” given how influential the band was to the genre. He described longtime Ozzy photographer Ross Halfin pulling together group shots of Ozzy and his Sabbath bandmates on one of the first rehearsal days, with Ozzy taking his seat on the huge throne he performed from during the gig. “He was there and the Sabbath guys were there and we all positioned ourselves around [Ozzy] and Ross was directing traffic and he asked me to sit on the armrest of Ozzy's throne next to Ozzy,” Ulrich said during the shoot that he said felt like a “class reunion.” Oh my God there's Yungblud!,'” Ulrich said before describing sitting on the armrest and hugging it out with Ozzy before asking him what it felt like to be back in his hometown for this final bow. “He was very eloquent and very sharp in his answer,” Ulrich said of Osbourne, who grew up about a mile or two from the stadium where the show took place. He and his Metallica mates were also among the few on hand who got to watch Black Sabbath's soundcheck the next day. “All the rest of us were just losing our f–king minds and then they started playing ‘War Pigs' with the lights on and the show and air raid sirens and then we were obviously, as fans — and I don't think I'm speaking out of turn here or being disrespectful — as fans I think there was a sense from all the other musicians and friends of Black Sabbath who were there… we were hoping for the best. We wanted it to be a grand slam, but we didn't know, because ultimately none of us knew what kind of shape they were in.” As they continued playing “War Pigs,” Ulrich said everyone realized that Sabbath sounded just as good, if not better than ever. There were no final goodbyes, Ulrich said, because nobody felt that this was the definitive end. “We were all just so stunned,” Ulrich said of the universal reaction among Ozzy's many musical compatriots and friends. and I think probably if you're going go play [a] little quarterback/psychiatrist, Monday morning, maybe it was just a load off his shoulders and he got to accomplish what he wanted and maybe he just sort of let go.” Stern praised Osbourne as a great friend, but also a “great radio guest,” who would always do something wacky on his show, with both men also noting that Ozzy was funny, warm and caring and, as Ulrich said, “made everybody laugh that was in the room.” Ulrich also said he's spent his time off this summer checking out Oasis on their reunion tour, including a gig at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday night (Aug. 3). Asked by Stern if he went backstage to “counsel them” on how to get along — in reference to formerly battling brothers and Oasis co-founders Liam and Noel Gallagher who split for 16 years following a last straw backstage row in 2009 — Ulrich said he could assure Howard that “the love up on stage and the love in the stadium… they don't need any counseling. Metallica famously brought in a therapist in the early 2000s to hash out their toxic intergroup dynamics, but when Ulrich noted that he was also at the first Oasis reunion shows in Cardiff, Wales on July 4, he said there's nothing the Gallaghers need from him. “As awesome and as next level as it was in Cardiff a month ago, which was the first show in 15 years, it was even better at Wembley a couple days ago. They don't need any counseling or advice from me,” said self-proclaimed “huge” Oasis fan Ulrich, who has seen the band between 20-30 times over the years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hulu will replace Star as a tile on the international Disney+ service. This marks the first major international expansion for Hulu and closely follows Disney buying Comcast out of the U.S. streamer last month. As Disney's streaming business once again shone in its latest earnings quarter results Wednesday, the company's executive commentary for Q3 revealed Hulu would become a “global general entertainment brand” that in the fall “will replace the Star tile on Disney+ internationally.” “Work is already underway to continue enhancing our technology, and over the coming months, we will be implementing numerous improvements within the Disney+ app, including exciting new features and a more personalized homepage,” said Disney in the executive commentary that preceded an analyst call later this morning. “All of this work will culminate with the unified Disney+ and Hulu streaming app experience that will be available to consumers next year.” While “fully integrating” the services, in the words of execs, will mean one tech stack and a more streamlined ad sales proposition, multiple press reports about a “wind-down” or “phase out” of Hulu as a stand-alone U.S. service appear to be premature. Even into 2026, a person familiar with the streaming strategy at Disney tells Deadline that stand-alone Hulu will still be available for customers not interested in a bundle with Disney+. Hulu has little to no brand recognition outside of the U.S. and Japan, but some market watchers are positive about its prospects. “I actually think it's a better brand than Star for international,” said Guy Bisson, Executive Director at Ampere Analysis. As for axing Hulu in the States, Bisson said: “Any U.S. phase-out would need to be gradual, as I do think the brand carries weight there for a certain type of content – particularly among viewers interested in more network-type content.” RELATED: Disney To Stop Providing Quarterly Streaming Subscriber Data, Following Netflix However, that didn't materialize and Hulu has ever since remained a U.S.-only brand, bar a service in Japan in 2011 that was sold to Nippon three years later. Coincidentally – or not – ITV and Disney+ recently began a content-sharing partnership that sees their services in the UK running select batches of the other's content. Disney launched Disney+ in 2019 and rolled out over following years. The Star brand, which was widely used and well-known across Latin America and Asia, was designated as the general entertainment tile. Disney only a few weeks ago completed the process of buying out Comcast's stake in Hulu. The streaming service, which started off as a joint venture and at one point involved four media giants as stakeholders, came under Disney's operational control in 2019 as part of the company's $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. Disney CEO Bob Iger and CFO Hugh Johnson, in Wednesday's pre-call comments, said Hulu had been fully integrated into Disney+, calling it a “major step forward” that will “create an impressive package of entertainment.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. This is just so they can get everyone to sign up for one, more expensive plan. There is already a network called Starz over here in the US. That would be a mind-numbing marketing issue if Disney brought Star into the mix. The U.S. market is resigned to channel drift and brand atrophy. So will the Star tile remain on Disney+ in Japan to avoid confusion with Hulu Japan or will they rename it HuluStar? Or just simply Hulu if it's integrating the programming.

It's been 40 years since Pee-wee Herman lost his bike, and to be honest, we're still not over it. Released in August 1985, “Pee-wee's Big Adventure” not only introduced audiences at large to Paul Reubens' wild comic creation, it also welcomed us into the heightened world of Tim Burton. Then just an animator with a couple of credits under his belt, Burton was personally picked by Reubens to bring Pee-wee's living-cartoon aesthetic to life on screen. Turns out, it was a match made in heaven. Together, they sent viewers on a rip-roaring road trip following Reubens' grey-suit-and-red-bowtie-loving manchild as he hitchhiked across America to find his beloved stolen bicycle. With Pee-wee's unpredictability and Burton's eye for detail, “Pee-wee's Big Adventure” defied expectations and more than tripled its $7million budget. What's more, it propelled the duo to household-name status. Related Stories ‘Paradise' Executive Producer Knew ‘We Were Onto Something' Before the Writers Room Even Convened ‘Him' Trailer: Tyriq Withers Is Corrupted by Marlon Wayans in Jordan Peele-Produced Football Horror Film Four decades on, a lot has changed. Reubens returned for a Burton-less sequel, 1988's “Big Top Pee-wee,” that failed to hit the same heights as its predecessor. Thankfully, his beloved kids' show “Pee-wee's Playhouse” quickly followed before a double-punch of career-careening scandals hit. Reubens only just survived, eventually reviving Pee-wee more than 20 years later. First, in 2010, he returned to the Broadway show that first helped him gain traction, and later in 2017, he starred in Judd Apatow's Netflix movie “Pee Wee's Big Holiday.” Meanwhile, Burton became one of Hollywood's most in-demand directors. “Beetlejuice,” two Batman movies, and “Edward Scissorhands” helped cement his playfully sinister style. His “Big Adventure” composer Danny Elfman joined him on the ride to the top too, scoring most of his movies, leading all the way to last year's mega-hit, “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” Cut to 2025, and the world is a less playful place following Reubens' sudden death in July 2023. However, the legacy of Pee-wee's joyous first adventure feels more alive than ever. To celebrate its 40th, IndieWire reunited the movie's key players, including Burton, Elfman, Simone star Diane Salinger, Dotty actress E.G. Daily, Mark Holton aka the bike-stealing Francis, and Large Marge effects creator Stephen Chiodo. Together, they reflect on their time making a modern pop-culture classic, one with an afterlife that continues to grow like a cableknit sweater that someone keeps knitting, ah-ha-and knitting, ah-ha-and knitting, and ah-ha-and knitting… After a sell-out tour proves Pee-wee Herman can draw big crowds, Warner Bros. is ready to bring Reubens' comic creation to the big screen. Phil Hartman, Michael Varhol, and Reubens write a script, and even though the studio has its own directors in mind, it's the work of a newbie animator (recommended by Shelley Duvall) that catches Reubens' eye… Tim Burton (Director): It was my first movie and a major experience. I'd only done a couple of little short films, so to get the opportunity to do this — I found it at the time, and when I think back at it now, as quite an incredible thing to have happened. I didn't have any expectations about anything. I'd just show up and be pleasantly surprised if it was good. I remember they saw a lot of really talented actresses and comedians [for Dottie]. I couldn't really tell you what it was [in my audition that worked] for them, but I think what I brought was something a little scrappier, innocent, sweet, and tomboyish. I was very bad at it when I was 15 growing up in Delaware and kept getting fired. That's why I did a Southern accent. Burton: [Paul] was instrumental in picking me. Obviously, he was the most important aspect of it. I just felt really kind of strange and lucky. I had a harder time getting my restaurant job. I just loved the character, and it was an opportunity to do a movie where you try all sorts of different, weird little ideas. Mark Holton (played Francis): I had seen Pee-wee on Letterman and thought, “This guy's nuts.” That was my only encounter with the character until I went in to audition. Paul was reading with me, and Tim was also in the room with the casting director. Paul was sitting next to me, and in the middle of the scene, I started biting his finger. He was sort of shocked, and the others were laughing. They didn't want me to do that in the movie. Later on set, Phil Hartman told me Dottie had a crush on [Pee-wee], but I was the more mature version of a woman for Pee-wee. Danny Elfman (Composer): I got the call randomly. I didn't learn until later just how crucial Paul was in the decision [that got me hired]. Five years prior, Paul had seen a midnight film my brother made called “Forbidden Zone.” Before I was in a rock band, I was in a musical theatrical troupe called The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, and they did the score. Paul saw it and made a little note. “If I ever make a movie, I gotta call this guy.” Well, amazingly, he didn't lose that scrap of paper. When it came time for him and Tim to talk about music for “Pee-wee's Big Adventure,” my name came up. Holton: They had another actor [in mind for the role of Francis]. Louie was a lot taller than me and bigger, even though I was quite rotund at the time. I think they just looked at what was on the written page and thought, “This guy's a better choice — and he's cheaper.” Elfman: When I had my meeting with Tim, the first thing I thought was that maybe they wanted a song. I just assumed that's what the meeting was about. When he informed me, “No, I'd like you to do the score,” I was like, “A score? Me?” I didn't know how to do a score. Daily: I felt that Dottie couldn't be glamorous. I don't think [Pee-wee] sees things like that. I had to pull in elements of childlike innocence. I pulled out the childlike parts of myself. There was a scene in the script that never made it into the movie with Spec, Pee Wee's dog. It was a sweet scene, but I thought, “I did not do 10 years of Shakespeare to do a movie where a dog licks its butt, then the star's mouth.” I was thinking of cancelling after I got the role, but thought, “No, you shouldn't cancel. Elfman: I was filled with excitement and dread. When I got the call that I'd gotten the job, I told my manager, “Tell him I can't do it.” He goes, “Why?” “Because I don't know how to score a film and I don't want to f*ck up their film!” He says, “You call them and tell them you can't do it. I was in a weird rock band that seemed motivated by irritating people. Burton: In a strange way, I wasn't really nervous. I mean, you have those normal nerves of something new and all of that, but I was sort of blessed with not being too worried about what people think. I just tried to go with what I felt was the spirit of [the script] and didn't have any grand major [plan]. I liked doing it and went with that vibe, which kind of protected me. I felt supported by everybody, which is not always the case in films. With Burton on board, Reubens' script received a quick revision before shooting began in January 1985. Captured in just four months, Burton's first film took its colorful cast and crew across California and deep in the heart of Texas, where Pee-wee would (supposedly) find his stolen bike, hidden in the basement of the Alamo… I'd show up and they'd say, “OK, you're dressed as the devil today” or “Today we're hooking you up to a telescopic frame and flying you in front of a movie screen at night at an outdoor theater,” or “You're on a tightrope in a bear costume,” a scene which didn't make the movie but almost killed me. I'm sure he and Paul had gone over everything because it was Paul's baby, but I just felt like Tim was all the things he is today: brilliant, artistic, and not typical. Elfman: The music that came out was all my first impulse. Now, I'm more likely to approach a scene two or three different ways. It was really hairy having no piano experience at all and trying to play this very simple piece of music. In rehearsal, Paul said, “I'm going to let you kiss me with your side facing the camera so that you have this moment.” It was very generous. I came from the theater and didn't know about camera stuff. Burton: There were lots of meetings where Paul, Phil, Michael, and I were trying to throw ideas around a little bit, almost like animation meetings – but the script was always pretty much as it was. I remember we were always kind of working on it, but it was a little budget [movie]. It almost felt like a European comedy. It reminded me of something I might see in France or England, like “Mr. Salinger: There was no improvisation, but in the drive-in scene at the end, where Pee-wee tries to imitate French with me and Pierre? He was a brilliant improviser, but we mostly stuck to the script. Daily: Tim was able to execute what Paul really wanted and add his own thing. I think that's why it was so magical. As far as who was the director, that was clear, but Paul was very hands-on, as he should have been because he created the whole thing. Those are his characters, but Tim was respectful of all the things about Paul that were so established. Burton: [Paul] was the character, so there was never any conflict, like, “No, Pee-wee wouldn't do that” or that kind of thing. That was strongly there from the beginning. Paul was very meticulous about some things. Most of the time, [Tim] left me alone and didn't say a thing. It's the sign of a really good director. Burton: I didn't really speak very much early on in life. Communicating with people was very difficult for me, but it was kind of necessary, so [working on Pee-wee] actually did open up something in me. Nobody could really understand what I was talking about. I tried to calm down a little bit. It was a really good thing for me to learn how to do because, as an animator, you usually sit in a dark room all day and talk to yourself. I had a knack for finding tempos and timings. When Pee-wee's riding in the park, he's kind of humming, and I decided I'd try to put music to it and make it sound like he was hearing the score and singing along with it. Today, with time code locks, you can do that relatively easily, but at the time, it was tricky. Burton: Danny and I talked about trying to get into that kind of scenario, without being overly cartoony. With cartoons, it's almost like silent movie music, where the music tells the story of what you're seeing. When it fit with that sort of structure, he'd do it, like little sing-songy things or Pee-wee knocking on Francis's front door. We treated it like a silent movie. As Pee-wee sets off to find his bike, he crosses paths with giant dinosaurs, Simone's big butt, and the eye-popping trucker ghost Large Marge, all the while being plagued by visions of his nemesis: the bike-stealing Francis… Stephen Chiodo (Large Marge effects artist): I'd worked with Tim and [Producer] Rick Heinrichs on Tim's Vincent short. A couple of years later, Rick contacted me about the stop-motion effects in Pee-wee. Burton: It was a nice low-budget movie, and [stop motion] fit very clearly. It was fun to use a little bit of those techniques, even though it's a live-action film. The character [played by Alice Nunn] had to change from her normal view, then kind of squash down to an anticipation for the first look. Tim wanted to go beyond the extreme and then back again. As an animator, his sketches helped me tremendously. Salinger: It was my first day on the set, and I hadn't done many movies. This woman got on and said, “What the fuck, god damn it, son of a bitch… I couldn't find this piece of shit place.” She sat down next to me in the makeup chair, and I said, “I take it you're Large Marge?” Burton: Sometimes you get these people and go, “Oh my God, it is Large Marge.” There she is for real. Some people don't need to act. Chiodo: We decided to do a head casting of [Nunn]. The real trick was being able to match her as best we could. We had Alice's wig and costume, but it still didn't match. We found out what makeup was used on the live shoot and duplicated that. It builds so well to that really great boo. A scare with a laugh is the best kind of relief, and I think Tim has done that consistently with his work. He's really walked that tightrope of being scary but still keeping it fun. Burton: If you can emotionally scar one person, that's OK with me. Salinger: When me and Paul were in the dinosaur mouth together, I remember Tim telling me to lower my voice when I said, “Do you have any dreams?” I didn't even realize that it was sexual. That's the biggest direction I think Tim gave me. He had this dream of building a giant woolly mammoth that was bigger than the other two. He described it all to me, and I felt very blessed to hear this amazing guy talk about his one final dinosaur. I don't usually get depressed, but for some reason, right before we shot the interior of it in the Warner Bros. sound stage, I was depressed. I leant into it, which was perfect for the scene. Holton: There was a dream sequence that nearly killed me but didn't make it into the final film. Pee-wee's on a tightrope in the circus, and there's a bear on his bicycle riding towards him. They'd rigged the bike on a track, and the handlebars gave out and went straight down instantly. I'm about 15 feet from a concrete floor and thought, “Oh my God, here comes the emergency room.” Out of nowhere, there were hands grabbing every point of the bicycle. They fixed the handlebars and said, “Let's go for another take!” I'm going, “Holy shit.” I went up to Paul and Tim when they were taking a break and said, “This movie is going to be bigger than anyone has any idea about” — and I was right. I knew it was going to be enormous. After a limited July release, “Pee-wee's Big Adventure” opened across America on August 9, 1985. It was a surprise hit — recouping most of its $7 million budget before its opening weekend was over. When all was said and done, Burton's film would go on to gross more than $40 million, helping Pee-wee Herman become a pop-culture icon. Daily: I didn't have any expectations. I just moved on to whatever the next thing was that I was doing, so when we had this huge premiere and I got to see the movie, that was super exciting. They had Hollywood Boulevard blocked off, and all the stars dropped by. Burton: I don't remember there being any studio notes. It was a low-budget movie, so there weren't high expectations like you'd get nowadays. It was kind of under the radar. Daily: I ended up singing [at the premiere] and me and Paul rode in on a bicycle carriage. I didn't know it was going to open up so wide. Holton: I went to the party on the top floor of a parking garage somewhere on Hollywood Boulevard. They had mimes riding on a bicycle for two, which was quickly stolen by Mr. T. He crashed into a bunch of tables, came over, gave me a high-five, and said, “You are a bad brother.” I thought, “Did that just happen? Burton: I sat next to Mr. T during the premiere. He didn't lean across the aisle and choke me to death. I laughed my butt off watching it with an audience in a packed house that was laughing at all the right moments. I feel very vulnerable when a movie is playing. I can't really tell what the reactions are. From that moment on, it doesn't change much. Elfman: As I wrote the score, I really did seriously feel that it would be thrown out when Warner Bros. heard it. I thought they'd want a real composer. I mainly wrote it for the experience. Burton: It was my first movie, and it was [Danny's] first movie where he had to go into Warner Bros. with a full orchestra, so it was kind of amazing to see him do his first orchestral thing. It felt like there was a connection on that level, a certain newness to the whole process. Chiodo: I went to the premiere with Bonnie DeHaven because she was essential in making Large Marge. We were both happy with the audience's reaction. Holton: One part of filming that my mind goes back to was when Tim, Paul, and I were in a van after we'd had to switch locations. They started talking about their ideas for part two. Burton: At one point, Paul and I discussed the idea of doing a version later on, like a “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?” kind of thing. I think a lot of that was just joking around. 40 years later, “Pee-wee's Big Adventure” remains a pop-culture touchstone and a movie that, much like the character at its core, has helped audiences across the world stay in touch with the carefree innocence of youth. Then I began this lifelong association with him. Later in life, I started doing “The Nightmare Before Christmas Live,” and it was a great pleasure inviting Paul to sing the Lock, Shock, and Barrel song [“Kidnap The Sandy Claws”] every year. It was the beginning of me wanting to increase my skills. Chiodo: Years later, I got married to a California girl who told me she saw “Pee-wee's Big Adventure” with her girlfriend Cynthia Garris, [director] Mick Garris' wife. When she saw Large Marge, she told Cynthia, “I want to marry the guy who made that.” She told me that when I first met her, but I didn't really believe her. I later asked Cynthia, and she said, “Oh yeah. She said, ‘I want to marry the kind of guy who makes things like this. Salinger: Fans come up to me and say, “I was going through a really bad time as a child, and I'd put this movie on all the time, and it saved me.” Some would say, “You were my rock during my childhood.” I've had amazing parts, but I have to say, “Pee-wee's Big Adventure” is my heart. I always feel very grateful if somebody connects with it. It's not just someone giving you a compliment. I'm always very happy to see that. This movie lets people tap back into that fun childhood stuff that everybody remembers and relives as an adult. We get to relive it through Pee-wee. Holton: Years later, Paul talked me into doing conventions. It's great seeing two or three generations of people showing up with their kids dressed like Pee-wee. I once had a father and son both dressed as Frances Buxton. I've only run into one of those so far. Chiodo: The special effects we create are memorable because they're unique and special — and Large Marge is one of them. When you think about Pee-wee's Big Adventure, you think about Large Marge, and I'm so proud to be one of the people that created that. Elfman: Paul was instrumental in my life. I don't know if Tim would've thought of coming to me just from my association with a rock band. It was just one of those lucky breaks. Burton: [It taught me to] keep the passion, fun, and newness of what you're doing. It was the first movie I made, and it being such a positive experience kind of sets you up for trying to feel that positivity as best you can whenever you're making something.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has publicly floated the idea of suspending habeas corpus to aid the president's efforts to arrest and deport immigrants: “The writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion, so that is an option we're actively looking at,” Miller said in May. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who's helping lead Trump's mass deportation campaign, tried to claim that month that habeas corpus is “a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country” — which is effectively the opposite of what habeas corpus means. Earlier in the month, Trump was asked about due process, and whether as president he has an obligation to uphold the Constitution. As a result, personnel scrambled to fix the issue, figure out how exactly it happened, and also review other parts of the website to see if there were any other conspicuous deletions. “It has been brought to our attention that some sections of Article 1 are missing from the Constitution Annotated website,” the library wrote. “We've learned that this is due to a coding error. We are working to resolve this issue and regret the inconvenience.” “Funny coincidence,” one federal employee dealing with this situation tells Rolling Stone dryly.

After a judge refused to block Hayden's termination, she filed an appeal last week to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

As Hallmark Channel celebrates 24 years of “its mission of bringing you all the love, laughter, and romantic magic you could ever dream of,” as one of the network's social media posts touted on August 5, it seems fitting that it would bring back a leader so dedicated to its mission and excited about its new vision of “One Hallmark.” During her tenure at Hallmark Channel, Vicary launched the network's annual Countdown to Christmas programming and several beloved series, including “When Calls the Heart,” and the since-canceled “Good Witch,” and “Chesapeake Shores.” According to Variety, she also “expanded the company's commitment to diverse storytelling, including hiring multiple LGBTQ+ actors.” Vicary will report to Chief Brand Officer Darren Abbott, who stepped into that role in early January, charged with overseeing all of Hallmark's “consumer-facing” endeavors, from its greeting card division to its cable channels and streaming platform, Hallmark+. And so the future, at this point in my mind, is pretty much unlimited.” It's about the Hallmark brand, and how we are tying all of those things together in really unique ways.” A likely example of that vision playing out will be when Hallmark Channel queen Lacey Chabert launches her own line of Hallmark greeting cards, gift wrap, and “unique entertaining essentials,” which was announced in January and will launch for the holiday season. Under Vicary, the programming on Hallmark Channel will not necessarily change as much as it will enhance the network's commitment to diverse stories and casts. It is at the foundation of who we are, so we're going to continue to lean in on that as well. Multiple Hallmark stars have celebrated the news of Vicary's return on social media. When Hallmark Media Chief Communications Officer Annie Howell shared the Variety article in her private Instagram Stories and wrote “Welcome home, @michellevicaryhc,” stars who shared it to their own Stories included Taylor Cole, Brennan Elliott, and Brendan Penny. Victor Webster shared it too, and wrote, “This is great news! Hallmark Channel has gone through several leadership changes in the last five years. In 2020, former Hallmark Media CEO Bill Abbott left amid a public relations crisis and later launched a competing network, Great American Family. Daly's position was eliminated in January 2025 as Darren Abbott, who'd been with the company for three decades, was named Chief Brand Officer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Hader joked about the numerous afflictions and anxiety-induced maladies he suffered while a cast member on Saturday Night Live during a new interview with his old coworker, Seth Meyers, on Late Night. Despite the challenges he endured, Hader maintained his sense of humor about his time on SNL, laughing as Meyers joked, “The top 10 weirdest things that happened to any cast member I ever worked with were all Bill Hader. For instance, Hader said he frequently got (and still gets) severe migraines. During his first season in 2006, one came on as he was preparing to go out for an “Appalachian Emergency Room” sketch that also featured Jason Sudeikis and cameos from Johnny Knoxville and musical guest Neil Young. I get aura — I don't know if anybody has ever had migraine aura, where suddenly it's like you can't see anything. Hader said he remarked out loud, “I can't see,” then joked that Young replied, “Oh no!

He also just went through a bout of shingles, another malady brought on by stress. I had to get a shot in my eye.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It could have gone totally off the rails and gotten weird in a bad way,” KPop Demon Hunters co-director Maggie Kang jokes to The Hollywood Reporter. 4 spot on Netflix's most popular English-language films list with 158.8 million views, according to data released Tuesday. 'Wednesday' Season 2 Review: Jenna Ortega Gets Lost Amid Addams Family Mayhem in Overcrowded Netflix Return Molly Shannon Boards Will Ferrell's Netflix Golf Comedy, Ramy Youssef Exits Going into the film, Netflix execs say they knew they had an audience who would tune in, but the scope of Demon Hunter's reach has grown far past that initial target demographic. The film has inspired TikTok trends — real K-pop groups, like Zerobaseone, has recreated the film's fictional boy group Saja Boys — along with a dedicated fanbase online. “It's also so fun to see the KPDH music covers, cosplay, dance reels and fan art online, made by everyday fans all the way to BTS,” Lin says. BTS' youngest member Jungkook even broke down in detail his thoughts on the movie for his fans on a livestream, leading the streamer's social media page to change its bio to, “Jungkook watched KPop Demon Hunters.” Kang worked on the project for seven years, even before her co-director Chris Appelhans got involved. Kang notes that during those seven years the film went through many different phases, which is process she admits could be grueling. “I feel like at every stage we've had to do that.” “KPDH is a perfect example of this approach,” he says, adding that he and Netflix's head of animation, Hannah Minghella, are thrilled to be supporting Kang and Appelhans on this journey. “Netflix allows our films to build their audience organically and over time,” says Lin. “As word of mouth spread and social media caught on, we saw viewing really take off and the movie became a cultural phenomenon — it's one of the only animated films to grow its audiences in its fifth and six weeks of release.” But also here's this talented person who's been working in the animation industry. She has collected things that mean something to her [and] that she wants to see in a film and it hasn't happened yet,” he explains. I want to make a thing like this,” Appelhans continues, adding that his wife, an author, has always urged him to make his female characters more real. Kang and Appelhans say they and their crew never took themselves too seriously, something they think helped take this unique premise to the next level. “We joked through the entire production that this idea is completely wackadoo and kind of stupid. Despite previous reports that a live-action version of the film is forthcoming, sources tell THR that Netflix has no plans for a live-action film at this time. “I think it's going to be part of our lives for a bit. Lin notes that Netflix is proud of Demon Hunter's success and “are excited to explore what could be the next adventure for Huntrix.” Says Lin: “KPDH‘s success comes from its original, fresh story so if we do embark on a sequel, we would want to take our time to make sure that any future stories we tell with our favorite demon hunters retains the flair and uniqueness of the first film.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

The legendary auteur went in for a scheduled procedure with Dr. Andrea Natale, a renowned heart doctor who has treated Coppola for more than 30 years. Amid the flurry of reports about his health, Coppola took to Instagram on Tuesday evening to offer an update and confirm the procedure with Natale. “Da Dada (what my kids call me) is fine, taking an opportunity while in Rome to do the update of my 30-year-old afib procedure with its inventor, a great Italian doctor — Dr. Andrea Natale!” posted Coppola to his nearly 500,000 followers.
