                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After missing out on the points again in Hungary, Isack Hadjar was critical of his performance. Isack Hadjar believes he needs to "put it together when it matters the most" during a Formula 1 weekend having just missed out on points in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The French rookie was left a frustrated 11th in Budapest, having been unable to find a way ahead of Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes in the closing stages. "The car is there, I am fast, I just need to put it together when it matters the most. We've been very unlucky the last few races and there's all signs to say that we're going to have a good second half of the year, I'm sure." Hadjar qualified 10th for the race but admitted that Q3 was the only part of the weekend where he felt he underperformed, which in turn meant he was always stuck in traffic during a race where overtaking proved difficult. "This weekend just feels so unfair because the other car scored points and we've been on it the whole weekend except when it mattered yesterday in Q3," he said. "Just a very frustrating race, the pace was very strong again but I was just being backed up by slower cars." Team mate Liam Lawson did finish in the points, making it four times in the last seven races, having improved on his P9 starting position to finish ahead of Max Verstappen at the chequered flag courtesy of a one-stop strategy. "I think it's been a pretty tough race," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yuki Tsunoda insisted that the gap he has to Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen has continued "to close" as he revealed car damage played its part in a disappointing Hungarian Grand Prix result. However, he was unable to make progress as damage picked up midway through the Grand Prix hampered his efforts on his way to a P17 result. While Verstappen also had a disappointing race in finishing ninth, Tsunoda's result means he has not scored for seven races and he still has just three top-10 finishes in Grands Prix since joining Red Bull. “The gurney flap fell off halfway through and that cost us a lot of pace and worsening grip, so we then lost the ability to make a positive strategy call that would benefit us.” “Also, something we can improve a lot communication wise is that if I was fighting for the points, there was a situation that could cost quite big,” he added. “It has happened the last two weeks, the last two races back-to-back in a row so it is starting to get very frustrating with that. Something we have to improve a lot and fight hard the second half.” For example, since he got his hands on the RB21 floor upgrade to make his car the same spec as Max Verstappen's, his pace has improved – even if results do not reflect that at this stage. “Looking back on the season so far, I can feel pretty positive, we've made progress, especially since the new floor upgrades were brought to Spa," he continued. "The gap with Max continues to close, it may not feel like we are getting there but on paper we are only one tenth off his pace. I'm not sure many other drivers could get as close to him. It's frustrating but we will stay positive and bounce back stronger."</p>
