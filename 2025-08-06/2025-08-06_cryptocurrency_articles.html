                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has announced a series of proposed changes to its online tracking and advertising strategy that build directly on the reforms introduced by the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUA Act) in June 2025. (See our 1 July 2025 client alert “Something Is Better Than Nothing: UK and EU GDPR Reform Finally Arrives.”) The ICO's main proposal, announced on 7 July 2025, is to “relax enforcement of [cookie] consent requirements,” allowing publishers to set certain advertising cookies — such as fraud-prevention cookies that only pose “a low risk to privacy” — without user consent. This would mean that companies would only need to obtain consent for advertising that uses more invasive practices, such as detailed behavioural targeting and profiling. At present, almost all cookies — even those with minimal privacy impact — can only be set with user consent, which has led to widespread “consent fatigue” and little incentive for businesses to adopt less intrusive technologies. While the ICO's initiative represents a welcome attempt to balance privacy protection and commercial realities, several questions remain. Companies that rely on online cookies may want to assess whether that loosening justifies changes to their UK cookie consent systems. Companies that rely on online advertising to generate revenue may also want to consider making submissions on the UK guidance, as the exact scope of any enforcement relaxation will determine the viability of “less intrusive” advertising models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies that are buying ether (ETH) for their treasury strategy are a better buy for investors than ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), said Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick. “The NAV multiples (market cap divided by value of ETH held) have now also started to normalise for the ETH treasury companies,” said Kendrick, adding that this dynamic is making the "treasury companies now very investable for investors seeking access to ETH price appreciation." Many publicly traded firms have jumped on board and seen their share prices surge initially, boosting their market cap and NAV multiples. Some of the top companies enjoying this market euphoria include BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Among these companies, Kendrick highlighted SharpLink Gaming's (SBET) NAV multiple, which at its peak was around 2.50 and is now coming down to a more normalized level of near 1.0. To be sure, the analyst said that he doesn't see any reason for the NAV to go below 1.0, as these treasury firms provide investors with "regulatory arbitrage opportunities." Kendrick also highlighted that these treasury companies have bought just as much ETH as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since June. Both groups now hold around 1.6% of the total circulating ETH supply — just under 2,000 ETH — over that time period, adding to his call that both the treasury stocks and ETF holders now provide similar exposure to ETH, all else being equal. The combination of these two factors is now adding to his thesis that ETH treasury plays are a better buying opportunities than ETFs. "Given NAV multiples are currently just above 1 I see the ETH treasury companies as a better asset to buy than the US spot ETH ETFs," he said. Standard Chartered is maintaining its year-end price target of $4,000 for ether. ETH is currently trading at $3,652, up 2% over the past 24 hours.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Satsuma Technology has raised $218 million, with over half funded in Bitcoin, marking the UK's first major institutional crypto treasury commitment. Satsuma Technology, a London-listed company formerly known as Tao Alpha, completed an oversubscribed $218 million convertible note raise. Significantly, $125 million of that total was settled directly in Bitcoin, representing the first institutional-scale BTC subscription for a UK public firm. This bold move positions Satsuma as a pioneering force in merging digital assets with traditional corporate finance in the UK. Massively oversubscribed.£163.66m secured — fuelling decentralised finance AI infrastructure and long-term Bitcoin accumulation.Listed on the Main Market (@LSEplc ). This marks a significant milestone for the UK crypto ecosystem, making Satsuma the first company to receive such a large-scale BTC-based investment. The company is planning to convert its loan notes into ordinary shares priced at £0.01 each, subject to a formal prospectus with the UK Financial Conduct Authority and a general meeting. Satsuma's CEO, Henry K. Elder, described the raise as a “landmark validation” of the company's thesis that blending a Bitcoin-native balance sheet with decentralized AI represents the next wave of corporate innovation. Satsuma's Bitcoin holdings now total 1,126 BTC, acquired at an average price of $115,149, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Although this currently reflects a marginal unrealized loss, the firm is undeterred, following a long-term accumulation strategy similar to companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Despite the funding success, Satsuma's stock fell sharply. As of August 6, shares were trading at 3.77 GBX, down 1.33 points or 26.15% for the day. This volatility hasn't stopped broader interest in crypto treasury strategies: Over $7.8 billion in crypto treasury commitments were announced globally last week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum as the leading choices. I see this as a watershed moment for the UK crypto scene. Satsuma's bold use of Bitcoin in a major institutional raise could open doors for more public companies to follow suit. Institutional money backing Bitcoin in this way sends a loud signal.</p>

Bakkt Holdings (ticker BKKT) has agreed to acquire about 30% of Marusho Hotta Co., Ltd. from RIZAP Group, becoming the Tokyo-listed company's largest shareholder and installing Phillip Lord, Bakkt International's president, as CEO as part of a pivot into the crypto treasury trend. Subject to shareholder approval, Marusho Hotta will be renamed “bitcoin.jp,” and its corporate policy will include investing in bitcoin and other digital assets, Bakkt said in an announcement. The transaction is part of Bakkt's evolution into a crypto treasury firm. Last month, Bakkt unveiled a $75 million public offering, with proceeds earmarked in part for bitcoin purchases, and a broader plan filed in late June to raise up to $1 billion for a crypto asset treasury push. On Wednesday, Bakkt co-CEO Akshay Naheta said Japan's regulatory environment makes the firm an “ideal platform for a Bitcoin-centered growth business,” framing the deal as the kickoff to Bakkt's BTC treasury play. The company said it intends to work with the Marusho Hotta team to integrate bitcoin into operating and financial plans. Bakkt said it will provide additional details on execution once the transaction progresses. Bakkt has been the subject of strategic speculation over the past year, including talks reported in November 2024 that Trump Media & Technology Group was exploring a potential acquisition. No deal to that effect has been announced yet. Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital and an early bitcoin investor, recently addressed this topic when his company reported second-quarter earnings. When asked by an analyst what he expects to see regarding crypto treasuries in the near future, Novogratz revealed that he believes the rush on creating companies with crypto-heavy balance sheets may be over. "We are seeing a tremendous amount of opportunities there," he stated, referring to the crypto treasury space. "But I think we've probably gone through peak treasury company issuance of new companies." Even so, Novogratz made it clear that he has high hopes for the crypto treasury space. Novogratz also flagged newer crypto treasuries, including Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee's recent ethereum treasury venture, Bitmine Immersion. The firm's tactic mirrors Michael Saylor's Strategy playbook: "accumulating digital assets, raising new capital by issuing debt or equity, and then using proceeds to buy more crypto" in hopes that it spurs growth for the market. "I think you're gonna continue to see those companies grow, and I think the new companies in those ecosystems will have a harder time getting oxygen," Novogratz said. He also predicted that as the crypto market evolves, new ecosystems will be formed, creating opportunity for companies. "These treasury companies have done an amazing job of bringing people into the crypto tent," he said. "I think they're gonna continue to play a pretty important part."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH Net Taker Volume hit -$418.8 million, the second-largest daily sell imbalance ever. Price is retesting a major resistance zone near $4,000, echoing the December 2024 top. ETH could drop 25%–35% toward key trendlines by September. Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), may establish a local top signal as its selling pressure nears historic extremes. As of Tuesday, ETH's Net Taker Volume dropped to -$418.8 million, the second-largest daily outflow ever, with 115,400 more ETH sold than bought via market orders, according to CryptoQuant data. Net Taker Volume tracks the difference between buying and selling executed through market orders. These “taker” trades prioritize execution speed over price, typically indicating urgency or fear. Such massive sell-side imbalances have historically marked local tops,” wrote CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, casting doubt on the sustainability of Ethereum's current rally. The latest surge in ETH sell-side pressure came as the price tests a historically significant distribution zone between $3,600 and $4,000, a level that has repeatedly acted as resistance since 2021. At the time, the Net Taker Volume turned sharply negative, and ETH also traded near this same resistance zone. A similar outcome may unfold, with ETH retesting the $3,600–$4,000 resistance, Net Taker Volume plunging, and weekly relative strength index (RSI) cooling from overbought.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KakaoBank, South Korea's leading digital bank known for innovative mobile banking services and rapid user growth, is exploring stablecoin issuance and custody services, with plans to actively participate in the fast-growing market valued at approximately $275 billion. The stablecoin move was confirmed by Tae-Hoon Kwon, Chief Financial Officer at Kakaobank Corp., during the company's H1 2025 performance announcement on Wednesday. It was first reported by ZDNet Korea. “Kakao Bank is exploring various approaches, including issuance and custody, to engage with the digital asset ecosystem,” Kwon said in a statement. “We're building our capabilities in coordination with Kakao Group's Stablecoin Task Force and will adapt proactively to market trends.” Kwon said that the bank aims to leverage its existing infrastructure and experience in the crypto sector for stablecoins. Over the past three years, the bank has issued real-name verified accounts for virtual asset exchanges and implemented risk controls such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)-based monitoring, according to him. Kwon added that the bank has also built technical expertise through its participation in central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives, citing operational experience from successfully handling wallet creation, exchanges, and remittances during the first and second phases of the Bank of Korea's CBDC simulation experiment. These entities collaborate to develop and launch a Korean won–backed stablecoin. In June 2025, KakaoPay applied for 18 stablecoin-related trademarks and patents with the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), aiming to develop a blockchain-based stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Korean won.</p>

The analyst shares a chart suggesting that ETH has one final resistance level to breach at around $4,000 before erupting to new record levels. “Where we're going, you won't need charts. Clean $4,000, and this is going to get quite crazy.” At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,594. Another altcoin on the trader's radar is Mantle (MNT), an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. Inmortal believes that MNT, which is up about 60% since July, looks primed for a surge toward $1.25. Next up is the memecoin Floki (FLOKI), which the trader believes is also setting up for an upside move. Based on the trader's chart, he seems to suggest that FLOKI will hit $0.00016.

Santa Cruz County has shelved its ambitious blockchain wallet project after two years, citing complexity and low public adoption. Santa Cruz County has quietly abandoned an ambitious plan to build a blockchain digital wallet for residents to store permits and other government documents. Once touted by local leaders as carrying bleeding-edge potential, the program attracted few users and the tech was too complex, officials said. Facilitated by Friend, the county agreed to contract with Humbl Inc., a San Diego-based financial technology startup specializing in the blockchain and digital asset investment. The company offered to work without pay on the pilot program to develop the new county mobile app, MySCCounty+, and a digital wallet where residents could store their county permits and registrations. “No other local government in California is as dedicated to leveraging the power of technology to serve residents,” Friend said at the time. In the end, however, it was too complicated. The pilot program ended in April, and on Tuesday, the board of supervisors quietly received a memo that county staff preferred to abandon its blockchain pursuits. Tammie Weigl, the county's information technology director, told Lookout that the county sought to develop a digital wallet for documents like parking placards for recreational vehicles, bicycle registrations, over-the-counter planning permits, and swim club passes. However, she said her team found that blockchain, which is an advanced system for recording and verifying digital information such as documents and transactions, was overly complex for these purposes. The technology ultimately represented a Ferrari, when Santa Cruz County residents “really just need that simple Toyota.” “Tammie Weigl getting a swim pass and making sure that the pass really belongs to Tammie Weigl doesn't really require blockchain,” she said. And, Weigl said, “only five to 10” people actually used it. Neither representatives from Humbl Inc. nor Friend responded to requests for comment. “There may be a future want and need for this kind of technology,” Weigl said, particularly if residents can one day carry around more sensitive documents, such as a digital version of a driver's license.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In its belly, it carried precious cargo: 3,000 kilograms of specialized bitcoin mining equipment bound urgently for New York. The company, which trades bitcoin mining hardware and provides related software services, was importing the equipment on behalf of a client. A week earlier, on April 2, US president Donald Trump had announced sweeping tariff hikes on goods from 57 countries, effective April 9. Although Trump's tariff deadline has since been repeatedly delayed, most recently to August 7, the initial announcement set in motion an almighty scrap spanning practically every time zone and every link in the supply chain. To clear US customs before the April 9 deadline, importers fought over whose goods would be released earliest by manufacturers, trucks and barges to ferry cargo from warehouses to airports, passage through airport security, and limited airfreight capacity, sources say. The sources that spoke to WIRED for this story largely declined to name their clients, suppliers, or supply chain partners for confidentiality reasons. “It was kind of like one of those movies where you get on the plane and everyone starts clapping,” says Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at Luxor. Tariff hikes are costly to all importers, but the US bitcoin mining industry is both particularly import-dependent and in the midst of a period of instability that already threatens to undermine profitability. The bitcoin mining hardware market is an oligopoly dominated by two Chinese companies—Bitmain and MicroBT—which together account for an estimated 97 percent of sales. After the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese goods during Trump's first term, those firms moved a proportion of manufacturing to Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. But under Trump's initial tariff announcement, these countries faced tariffs between 24 and 36 percent, too. Meanwhile, a vicious combination of other factors—steep competition, a slump in transaction fees, diminishing bitcoin rewards, surging energy demand, and so on—have strangled margins for US-based mining companies. Under these conditions, says Vera, the additional tariff cost threatens to undermine the economics of less well-capitalized bitcoin mining operations. “On the high end, adding [more than 30 percent] to your capital expenditure really destroys unit economics for mining,” he says. When Trump announced the hikes, mining companies whose pending hardware orders were not yet ready for collection had no choice but to brace for the additional cost or place shipments on hold in the hope that negotiations between the US and its trading partners might yield less punitive rates. On April 2, Vera was sitting in a hospital unit in Uruguay, he says, an IV bag feeding painkillers into his system, after damaging a knee ligament playing soccer earlier in the day. Vera and two other Luxor staff members—Lauren Lin, head of hardware, and Nicole Caldwell, head of shipping—convened in a virtual “war room” to form a response to the tariffs and divide up the most urgent tasks. “I didn't even know it was possible to raise tariffs in, like, a two-day period,” says Vera. Soon, Lin had identified two Luxor shipments ready for collection: the $1.3 million order from Indonesia and, for a separate client, a $12 million order split between warehouses in Malaysia and Thailand. “It was a very urgent situation,” says Lin. Typical of global supply chains, whose elaborate theater is normally concealed from view, transporting bitcoin mining hardware across the world involves many steps and requires coordination between many parties. After manufacturing, hardware is usually held at the factory or a third-party warehouse. It takes time for mining machines to make their way through this funnel, particularly during a period of heightened demand. “It's all very finely tuned,” says Christopher Berschel, president at freight forwarding company Sealion Cargo, whose clients include multiple bitcoin mining hardware importers. “There was this very clear tariff clock—the deadline whereby landing one hour or taking off one hour later just made a massive difference,” says Berschel. Initially, Luxor's attempts to arrange collection went unanswered. On April 3, Luxor began to bid for a charter plane for the $12 million order, which was large enough to fill a jet. Lin set up camp at the client's office, so she could directly relay messages from the freight forwarder, which was negotiating with air carriers. Each time Luxor's client lodged a bid, another party came in over the top, and the negotiation cycle started over. I don't think it's the norm to need to make a multimillion-dollar decision within such a short time window,” says Lin. By midnight, Lin had ironed out a final $1.76 million bid, she says. According to Sealion Cargo, prices for some types of air freight peaked at 10 times the regular rate in the first week of April. Luxor and its client gave up on the plan to charter a plane. Meanwhile, at the cargo terminals of some major airports in Southeast Asia, things had begun to unravel. At Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Berschel recalls, the buildup of pallets had created a logjam. With little available dock space, truckers were hauling boxes from their vehicles toward the airport terminal. Police officers were on hand to control the swelling crowds. Airports of Thailand, which manages Suvarnabhumi Airport, did not respond to a request for comment. On April 8, Vlad Siniavsky sat in his office in Montreal awaiting the arrival of his final pieces of cargo and calculating how much money he had lost. The company had split around 60 pallets of equipment across planes departing from Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The bidding process, says Siniavsky, “was just a free-for-all.” “It ended up costing us a lot of money, obviously,” says Vera. As it turned out, importers had wasted their efforts. The president's equivocations have given rise to a joke at his expense: TACO, short for Trump always chickens out. The new tariff regime is set to take effect on August 7. Under the latest rates, outlined in an executive order on July 31, imports from Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are set to incur a 19 percent import duty—slightly lower than previously threatened. “There's more preparedness now, in terms of pushing over shipping lanes and getting aircraft to Southeast Asia.” “It was probably one of the most stressful things in my career,” says Siniavsky.

The guidance sets out practical measures to lower data breach risk. Laura Gillespie, data security expert at Pinsent Masons, was commenting after the ICO issued guidance aimed at helping organisations securely disclose documents to the public, which comes following a number of “serious data breaches” linked to human error. The guidance provides practical steps and tools to identify and remove hidden personal information from documents before they are shared – particularly in response to subject access requests (DSARs) and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) requests. The ICO urges all organisations to have robust measures in place to protect the personal information they hold and prevent it from being inadvertently disclosed. The guidance aligns with aligns with findings from Pinsent Masons' 2025 Annual Cyber Report (36 pages/4.4 MB PDF), which revealed that 10% of cyber incidents handled by the firm in 2024 were caused by misdirected communications, such as emails sent to the wrong recipient. “This underscores the ongoing risk that human error poses to businesses in managing personal data,” said Gillespie. While ransomware remained a significant concern – amounting for 48% of Pinsent Masons' cases – it prevalence dropped from 58% in 2023, with business email compromise rising sharply to 26%. Gillespie said: “In light of recent breaches attributed to human error, the ICO guidance serves as a timely reminder for those handling DSARs as well as FOIA and EIR requests and emphasises practical measures to reduce the risk of accidental breaches. In addition, given the persistent threat of ransomware, it is crucial that cyber readiness programmes incorporate appropriate staff training, subject to regular review.” Property owners in Britain are facing increasing regulation following the Grenfell Tower fire in London and because of policy reactions to the climate emergency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At this pace, T2 (No data) is not only reversing losses of late July, but there is a high probability that the token could soar, printing fresh all-time highs in August. Most of them are also leaning bullish, looking at Gecko Terminal DEX data. Behind this surge is confidence that Talos, an AI-driven treasury protocol on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2, could be the next crypto to explode, thanks to its unique value proposition. It offers a treasury management system that automatically optimizes capital allocation and executes onchain transactions. Additionally, by riding on Arbitrum, all transactions happen in a low-latency environment where fees are low and secure. Accordingly, Talos can deliver while automatically learning, adapting, and evolving in real-time. This feature allows it to compute optimal capital paths so that its strategies, including liquidity provision deployed via ERC-4626 vaults, can maximize real onchain returns. Notably, the collaboration will make use of PancakeSwap's expertise in DeFi to boost Talos' reach and help it position itself as a cornerstone in Arbitrum. Moreover, Talos has been endorsed by high-profile projects across DeFi. Recently, Ethereum mentioned the project, lending credibility to its vision. Earlier this month, an account linked to Arrington Capital, a popular crypto VC, reportedly staked over 170,000 T tokens. On X, one user said people don't know how big Talos and T crypto is. It reminds me of $yfi or innovative projects like that. Talos, he added, won't be a short-term project now that the entire crypto and DeFi sector has matured.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) remain a vital fundraising mechanism for blockchain startups, especially in a world increasingly embracing decentralized finance (DeFi), digital identity, tokenized assets, and smart contracts. However, the ICO landscape has matured significantly since its boom in 2017–2018. Investors are more cautious, regulatory scrutiny is tighter, and market dynamics have become complex. In this environment, professional ICO development services have emerged as essential partners for startups aiming to conduct successful token launches. These services do far more than create tokens—they offer a holistic approach encompassing compliance, investor trust, technology robustness, strategic marketing, and post-launch support. While ICOs once had an “anything goes” reputation, that narrative has shifted. In 2024 alone, blockchain-based startups raised over $3.2 billion through ICOs and similar token sales, with DeFi and AI-based Web3 projects leading the charge. This shows that well-executed ICOs are still incredibly powerful fundraising vehicles—if done right. ICO development services offer deep expertise in crafting tailored token launch blueprints based on the client's business model, market niche, and regulatory environment. For example, a startup developing a decentralized AI model marketplace would need careful modeling of how tokens are earned, spent, staked, or burned. ICO consultants ensure that token supply dynamics support long-term growth and investor confidence, avoiding inflationary risks or centralized ownership. A 2023 report by Chainalysis found that over 25% of failed ICOs lacked adequate legal preparation, leading to project shutdowns, fines, or loss of investor funds. Professional ICO development services work with experienced blockchain lawyers to: For instance, a European project may need to register under MiCA's provisions, while a U.S.-based project might be subject to Reg D or Reg S exemptions. Token creation may seem simple on the surface—mint a smart contract and you're done. But a scalable, secure, and gas-efficient token requires careful development. Professional teams also manage the backend dashboard, token sale portal, and real-time analytics, enabling founders to monitor investments, KYC verifications, and conversion funnels during the ICO. These materials are often the first touchpoint investors have with a project. Their quality directly influences perceived credibility and fundraising potential. No matter how great a token's technology or vision is, it won't raise capital without visibility. Marketing is the engine behind every successful ICO—and professional agencies know how to build global reach. A well-executed marketing campaign can raise up to 70% of total funds through early bird participants alone. This not only maximized capital but also gave the project lasting brand equity. For example, getting listed on Binance or Coinbase requires rigorous documentation, compliance, and often community support. Professional services can position your token strategically, enabling better liquidity and long-term trading volume—key elements for investor satisfaction and future fundraising. Success doesn't end at the ICO—it begins there. This post-sale support is essential for retaining investor trust and demonstrating project longevity. For instance, Uniswap's early post-ICO token utility around governance, staking, and LP incentives helped it scale exponentially, becoming a top DEX. It requires strategic vision, legal acumen, technical precision, and relentless marketing. Most founders, especially those focused on building products, cannot handle all these moving parts simultaneously. This is where professional ICO development services add irreplaceable value. They bring together legal experts, blockchain architects, marketing professionals, token economists, and listing advisors under one roof—creating a coordinated force that maximizes fundraising while de-risking operations. In 2025's competitive Web3 world, leveraging expert services isn't just helpful—it's essential. For any startup serious about scaling through token issuance, partnering with a seasoned ICO development agency is the smartest investment you can make. In the fast-evolving world of blockchain and Web3, a successful token launch is no longer just about writing smart contracts and listing on an exchange. With thousands of tokens flooding the market, what separates a high-performing launch from one that goes unnoticed is the buzz generated beforehand. In today's rapidly evolving Web3 landscape, where hundreds of new crypto tokens are launched every month, standing out is not just about having solid technology or a visionary whitepaper. What increasingly determines whether a token captures sustained user attention and achieves long-term adoption is mindshare the share of collective awareness and recognition a project holds in the minds of its target audience. Nowhere is this more important than within the Kaito ecosystem, a rising powerhouse in the decentralized finance and AI token space. Increasing mindshare on this platform can directly impact your token's investor appeal, community growth, and post-launch resilience. Recovering scammed funds is possible with expert assistance. Act fast—delays increase the risk of scammers moving funds to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or converting them to assets like DAI, complicating recovery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A quant has explained how altcoin inflows into cryptocurrency exchange Binance might act as a leading indicator for the market. Spikes In Binance Altcoin Inflows Tend To Precede Corrections In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the trend in the altcoin exchange inflows going to Binance. The indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Inflow Transaction Count,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of deposit transactions that investors are making to a given centralized exchange. Generally, investors transfer their coins to exchanges when they want to sell, so spikes in exchange inflows can lead into bearish price action. This appears to be what happened in these two instances. Interestingly, during the latest market drawdown that has occurred over the past few days, inflows on only one exchange have seen a spike: Binance. There have also been other instances in the past where this pattern developed. “Spikes in Binance inflows (represented by the purple area) frequently precede downward price movements or market corrections,” notes the analyst. The quant has also explained that Binance is not only the largest exchange in the sector in terms of trading volume, but also a hub for altcoin activity from both retail and institutional entities. Speaking of alts, CryptoQuant has shared a few new indicators that can be used to track smart money. One of these is the Average Order Size, which differentiates between futures buy orders by their scale. Another indicator is the Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency. From this graph, it's apparent that overheated periods of retail interest coincided with price highs in Gala (GALA).</p>

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) could see a strong end to the year, according to fresh technical analysis by a prominent market observer. What Happened: Pseudonymous analyst Virtual Bacon stated that a Q4 rally hinges on whether August's uncertainty clears by September. He highlights Bitcoin dominance as a critical factor for altcoin strength, which could drop going into Q4. The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. Bacon warned that even a slight rise in Bitcoin dominance could hurt low-cap altcoins, while larger caps like ETH or Binance Coin (CRYPTO: BNB) remain resilient. Bacon expects possible weakness in August, targeting the 20-week SMA near $103,000 — aligning with weekly candle closes from December 2024. The ETH/BTC pair is crucial — Ethereum must avoid underperforming BTC to preserve its uptrend. "We don't want Ethereum to drop faster than Bitcoin," the analyst noted. "BNB is still massively undervalued compared to Bitcoin," he said. He projects a 40–60% move in Bitcoin once consolidation resolves, targeting $140,000 to $150,000 by year-end. What's Next: Bacon expects August market uncertainty to resolve by September as Trump's tariff implementation and improved Fed rate cut odds create short-term volatility before a Q4 rally.
