                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here, I'd like to address some myths about influenza shots that our patients believe. Frequently, I will hear about the time they did get a flu shot and shortly afterward got sick. This myth has been well studied with well-designed trials. Govaert and colleagues studied more than 1800 patients over the age of 60 who were randomly assigned to receive flu vaccine or placebo saline injection; side effects were tracked over 4 weeks. There was no significant difference in systemic side effects. Margolis et al conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover trial in 336 veterans aged 65 or older. Trial participants were randomly assigned to receive influenza vaccine followed 2 weeks later by placebo injection or placebo followed 2 weeks later by vaccine. The only significant difference after receiving vaccine compared with placebo was a sore arm. Another interesting study looked at patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received influenza vaccine or placebo; side effects and respiratory infections were evaluated in the first week after vaccination. This was because of the concern that potentially minute particles of egg protein could contaminate the vaccine and individuals with severe allergy could have a bad reaction. Turner and colleagues recruited 779 young people (2-18 years) with egg allergy to receive influenza vaccine. The cohort included 270 young people with previous anaphylaxis to egg. None of these patients developed a serious reaction when they received influenza vaccine. A 2017 joint practice parameter by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology stated that all patients with egg allergy of any severity should receive inactivated influenza vaccine annually, using any age-approved brand, and there are no special waiting periods after vaccination of egg allergic patients beyond what is standard practice for any vaccine. Pearl: Influenza vaccine can cause local discomfort but is no different from placebo in producing systemic symptoms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a chronic condition, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can't be cured, so treatment focuses on managing the disease and controlling its progression. Although current treatments help control RA symptoms in most people, they cannot prevent the onset of RA or painful flare-ups. Now, researchers publishing in ACS Central Science have developed nanoparticles that could slow disease progression and reduce flare severity, based on results from tests with human blood and mice models with RA-like disease. For a person diagnosed with RA, their immune system attacks tissue that makes up the joints, causing inflammation, swelling and pain. However, as the disease progresses, serious cartilage and bone damage can occur if left uncontrolled. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as abatacept reduce disease activity and slow progression of symptoms, but most people taking DMARDs still experience symptom flare-ups. And for people with pre-RA, who have detectable levels of RA autoantibodies but don't have symptoms, there are no approved treatments to prevent disease onset. In previous research published in ACS Nano, a research team led by Nisarg Shah and Nunzio Bottini reported that calcitriol-loaded nanoparticles, termed CLNP, help regulate immune responses and decrease inflammation for autoimmune diseases in joints. To expand on their previous work, the researchers wanted to see if the modified nanoparticles could treat RA flares and pre-RA. This helped ensure that the nanoparticles were free from any contaminants and could be frozen for a month without any damage. The researchers then confirmed that the nanoparticles regulate dendritic cell activity, a type of immune cell responsible for initiating inflammation and flare-ups in RA. By suppressing the immune response, Agg-CLNP could help alleviate RA symptoms such as inflammation and swelling. The researchers also tested Agg-CLNP in a mouse model for RA. Agg-CLNP delayed inflammation and swelling when administered as a preventative treatment, but it had little effect when administered after the onset of RA. Additional tests in mice also showed that Agg-CLNP reduced future RA flare severity when administered after corticosteroid treatment, which is often used to provide symptomatic relief. The researchers say that these results highlight Agg-CLNP as a potential therapeutic to address current limitations in RA treatments. Johnson, W. T., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers analyzed the profile of adults who claim to have past-life memories, the features of these memories, and their associations with mental health, happiness, and religiosity/spirituality. The results indicated a high prevalence of mental disorder symptoms, with religiosity and spirituality being protective factors. Most religious and spiritual traditions worldwide share a belief in a transcendental realm and/or the continuity of life after physical death. This belief is common among the adult population of 35 countries across six continents, with percentages ranging from 38% in Sweden to 85% in Indonesia. A recent survey, involving nationally representative samples in 22 countries across all continents, concluded that there are no countries where most of the population said they did not believe in life after death, with the majority answering "yes" or "unsure" to this question. While there are studies of claims of past-life memories (PLM) in children, there is still little knowledge about cases in adults and the impact of PLM on claimers. To fill this gap, Sandra Maciel de Carvalho and her team analysed the profile of adults who claim to have PLM, including sociodemographic data, the features of these memories, and their associations with mental health, happiness, and religiosity/spirituality. With support from the BIAL Foundation, researchers from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (Brazil) and the University of Virginia (USA) performed an online survey for the first time among a sample of 402 adults living in Brazil who reported having memories of past lives. In this country, 66% of citizens say that there is probably, or definitely, life after death, and 33% believe that people will be reborn in this world. Most of the sample participants were middle age 41.6 years, female (79%), with higher education (68%), Spiritists (54.5%), and very/moderately spiritual (91%). PLM started spontaneously in 82%, on average, at 19.9 years old. In this sample, childhood philias and phobias were associated with lower happiness and more symptoms of mental disorders (46%), which may indicate a lasting psychological impact associated with PLM. Post-traumatic stress disorder (36%) was associated with phobias. Religion/spirituality was associated with greater happiness and lower mental disorder outcomes, potentially acting as a protective factor. According to Sandra Maciel de Carvalho, "this study demonstrated that PLM in adults may be more prevalent than previously thought and may be associated with significant suffering and distress". PLM may constitute a "relevant issue in mental health, and further studies are needed on its prevalence, impact, and proper clinical management", the researcher emphasizes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new toolkit is designed to support the implementation and scale-up of hepatitis B and C interventions in prisons across Europe. It also reinforces the principle of 'equivalence of care', ensuring that people in prison receive healthcare comparable to that available in the community. People in prison experience higher levels of viral hepatitis than the general population, making them a key group for targeted prevention and treatment. In Europe, individuals entering prison are also more likely to have a history of injecting drug use - a major risk factor for hepatitis B and C virus transmission. Sharing of injecting equipment and other risk factors - such as unsafe tattooing or body piercing practices, sharing of razors and unprotected sex - make prisons a priority setting for targeted viral hepatitis prevention and treatment interventions. For this reason, tackling health problems such as viral hepatitis in prison settings can also deliver health benefits to the wider community by driving down the overall disease burden and preventing future transmission of infections. Examples from prisons in Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Luxembourg, are provided, illustrating models of care. In the toolkit, the EUDA and ECDC provide practical, evidence-based information for those working in prison healthcare on how to set up interventions to prevent and control viral hepatitis in these settings. The information is also likely to be relevant to other audiences, including policymakers, security staff, people living in prison, peer support workers, and voluntary workers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children and young adults who spend excessive hours glued to screens and electronic devices may have higher risks for cardiometabolic diseases, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insulin resistance, according to new research published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association, an open-access, peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association. A 2023 scientific statement from the American Heart Association noted that "cardiometabolic risk is accruing at younger and younger ages," and only 29% of American youth, ages 2 to 19 years, had favorable cardiometabolic health based on 2013-2018 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. This analysis of more than 1,000 participants in two studies in Denmark found that increased recreational screen time was significantly associated with higher cardiovascular risks and cardiometabolic risks among children and adolescents. Our study provides evidence that this connection starts early and highlights the importance of having balanced daily routines." Using data from a group of 10-year-olds studied in 2010 and a group of 18-year-olds in 2000 that were part of the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood cohorts, researchers examined the relationship between screen time and cardiometabolic risk factors. Researchers developed a composite score based on a cluster of metabolic syndrome components - waist size, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein or HDL "good" cholesterol, triglycerides and blood sugar levels – and adjusted for sex and age. "It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up," he said. "Multiply that across a whole population of children, and you're looking at a meaningful shift in early cardiometabolic risk that could carry into adulthood." The analysis also found that both sleep duration and sleep timing affected the relationship between screen time and cardiometabolic risk. Children and adolescents who had less sleep showed significantly higher risk associated with the same amount of screen time. "In childhood, sleep duration not only moderated this relationship but also partially explained it: about 12% of the association between screen time and cardiometabolic risk was mediated through shorter sleep duration," Horner said. "These findings suggest that insufficient sleep may not only magnify the impact of screen time but could be a key pathway linking screen habits to early metabolic changes." In addition, a machine learning analysis identified a unique metabolic signature in the blood that appeared to be associated with screen time. "We were able to detect a set of blood-metabolite changes, a 'screen-time fingerprint,' validating the potential biological impact of the screen time behavior," he said. This suggests that screen-related metabolic changes may carry early signals of long-term heart health risk. "Recognizing and discussing screen habits during pediatric appointments could become part of broader lifestyle counseling, much like diet or physical activity," he said. "These results also open the door to using metabolomic signatures as early objective markers of lifestyle risk." Amanda Marma Perak, M.D., M.S.CI., FAHA, chair of the American Heart Association's Young Hearts Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Committee, who was not involved in this research, said focusing on sleep is a great starting point to change screen time patterns. "If cutting back on screen time feels difficult, start by moving screentime earlier and focusing on getting into bed earlier and for longer," said Perak, an assistant professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. "All of us use screens, so it's important to guide kids, teens and young adults to healthy screen use in a way that grows with them. And as kids get a little older, be more explicit, narrating why you put away your devices during dinner or other times together. Boredom breeds brilliance and creativity, so don't be bothered when your kids complain they're bored. Loneliness and discomfort will happen throughout life, so those are opportunities to support and mentor your kids in healthy ways to respond that don't involve scrolling." As an observational study using prospectively collected data, the findings reflect associations rather than proving cause and effect. Horner suggested that future research could explore whether limiting screen use in the hours before sleep, when light from screen exposure may disrupt circadian rhythms and disrupt sleep onset, may be an avenue to help reduce cardiometabolic risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new article in the peer-reviewed journal Psychedelic Medicine takes aim at one of the most influential, and controversial, narratives in comparative psychedelic culture: the idea that ancient Greek mystery rites at Eleusis were fueled by psychedelic drugs. In the current article, Dr. Sharday Mosurinjohn and Dr. Richard Ascough, religious studies professors from Queen's University, critique what they call "the psychedelic mysteries hypothesis." Rather than dismissing psychedelics or ancient spirituality, the article advocates responsible curiosity and better historical scholarship. The authors argue that clinicians and scientists should not rely on this ancient psychedelic mysteries narrative to justify the use of a psychedelic treatment, participating in a research study, or to otherwise validate psychedelic treatments or research as legitimate. "Psychedelics should not be framed as somehow more credible, or more safe, or more therapeutic on the basis of a flawed idea that they were used by ancient Pagans at Eleusis, and inherited by early Christians after them," says Dr. Mosurinjohn. "The idea that Eleusis was secretly psychedelic is often treated as a proven fact in psychedelic science publications and presentations, even though the speculative and circumstantial evidence does not bear it out," says Dr. Mosurinjohn. "This narrative is being used as part of a campaign for modern legal and religious legitimacy, but it risks undermining the broader psychedelic movement by standing on shaky historical ground. There have been, and are, lots of religious and spiritual drug practices - but according to the evidence to date, Eleusis wasn't one of them. Instead of continuing to reiterate a moribund thesis on drug usage at Eleusis, the article urges the psychedelic community to focus on locating resources for transformative practice when it's looking into the psychedelic past and present, and to see drug and non-drug methods of spiritual transformation together as part of the big picture of the right to liberty. The article closes with a call for deeper engagement with both ancient and contemporary traditions-not to prove psychedelics were always there, but to ask how they can be more skillfully used today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solastalgia is caused by changes to the home or surrounding environment and is associated with depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the findings show. A blend of the words 'solace' and 'nostalgia', the term solastalgia was first coined in 2003 to refer to the lack of solace and feelings of pain or sickness caused by changes in a person's immediate or surrounding environment. The study findings of the core search consistently showed positive associations between solastalgia and mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, PTSD and somatisation-physical symptoms caused or worsened by psychological distress. The extended search backed up these findings, with qualitative studies suggesting that solastalgia is a very useful concept to understand the emotional responses of people affected by environmental change, including pessimism and lowered resilience. "These findings are in line with the literature on positive links between environmental distress more generally and mental ill health. Notably, solastalgia is one of several eco-emotions, such as eco-anxiety, eco-grief, or eco-shame/-guilt, which might be important in explaining mental health problems arising from ecological crises," point out the researchers. "This suggests that solastalgia might either be more intense or salient in scenarios of ongoing environmental destruction as opposed to one-time events, or in scenarios which are clearly human-made and not attributable to any other causes (eg, the weather instead of climate change). This notion fits in well with long-standing evidence in trauma research, according to which interpersonal traumas are most likely to cause PTSD," they explain. One plausible explanation for the link between solastalgia and mental health problems lies in the theory of learned helplessness, which suggests that depressive symptoms stem from a perceived loss of control and resulting powerlessness," they suggest. "Indeed, studies have shown that solastalgia often involves feelings of helplessness and resignation, as environmental changes typically lie beyond the affected individual's control." The researchers acknowledge that they were only able to draw on a limited number of published studies on solastalgia, added to which all the included studies were observational, making it impossible to establish cause. Nevertheless, they conclude: "Solastalgia can be seen as a valuable concept for assessing the mental health risks among populations exposed to environmental change. While solastalgia is a rational response to environmental change, it appears correlated with worse mental health." Further research is needed to tease out exactly how it might affect mental health, say the researchers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian research has shown that a personalized program that helps people with chronic, disabling low back pain better understand their condition and take charge of its management produces large benefits that are sustained over three years. In the RESTORE trial, conducted at centres in Sydney and Perth, a seven-session program of cognitive functional therapy (CFT) delivered by specially trained physiotherapists significantly reduced people's back pain and improved their function, compared with usual care. Data just published in medical journal The Lancet Rheumatology show these improvements were largely maintained over three years of follow-up. The persistent effect of CFT over time is a new and very important finding, says lead author Professor Mark Hancock, Professor of Physiotherapy at Macquarie University. This the first large, high-quality study investigating the long-term impact of CFT, and shows that it's effective and remains effective. In fact, our previous systematic review shows there are relatively few long-term outcome studies of other treatments for chronic low back pain." Around 4 million Australians – one in six – live with back problems, making them the third leading cause of disease burden overall, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. "An episode of back pain can understandably cause anxiety and fear, leading people to overprotect their body and avoid usual movements," says study co-author Professor Peter O'Sullivan, John Curtin Distinguished Professor in the School of Allied Health Sciences at Curtin University. "When this persists, it can set up a vicious cycle of pain sensitivity and limitation of activities," he explains. In Australia, an estimated $3.4 billion was spent treating and managing back problems, representing 2.2% of total health system expenditure in 2020-21. "Things like massage, manipulation and medication can provide short-term symptom control but in the longer term, mind and body approaches that give patients the skills and confidence to self-manage, are much more effective," says Professor Hancock. "Our findings suggest the massive burden of low back pain could be markedly reduced if health policies supported widespread implementation of high-value, low-risk and sustained interventions like CFT, instead of less effective, short-term and potentially harmful interventions like opioids or surgery."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from researchers at the Advanced Science Research Center at the CUNY Graduate Center (CUNY ASRC) reveals that extremely simple peptides can mimic a biological process that protects sensitive proteins from environmental stress. The findings, published today in Nature Materials, offer a promising new approach to stabilizing biomolecules like vaccines and therapeutic proteins-potentially without the need for refrigeration. The interdisciplinary study, led by Rein Ulijn, founding director of the CUNY ASRC Nanoscience Initiative and distinguished professor of chemistry at Hunter College, and co-led by Ye He, director of the CUNY ASRC Live Imaging and Bioenergetics Core facility and research associate professor with the Neuroscience Initiative, demonstrates how short peptides-just three amino acids long-can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation through a drying process that enables the peptides to encapsulate proteins, protect them, and release them intact upon rehydration. Inspired by how organisms like tardigrades survive extreme dehydration, we asked whether we could replicate nature's strategy using minimal synthetic materials. In biology, cells often respond to stress by creating protective compartments through a process known as phase separation. These compartments stabilize vulnerable proteins and can dissolve again when conditions improve. The research team applied this principle to design adaptable peptide-based materials that mimic this process-offering a simple and effective alternative to conventional methods for biomolecular stabilization, which often require complex formulations and cold-chain logistics. "The protein encapsulation was remarkably efficient," said Ye He.. "This minimalistic approach achieved a level of protection we didn't expect from such short peptide sequences." "This work not only reveals a novel mechanism of peptide self-organization but also introduces a minimalistic material platform for applications in biotechnology," added Ulijn. From vaccine distribution in regions without reliable refrigeration to new classes of smart, responsive materials, the study lays foundational work for both practical innovations and further scientific exploration. The research was supported primarily by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, with additional contributions from City College of New York, Hunter College and Columbia University collaborators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest partnership between AXT and Iconeus delivers groundbreaking functional ultrasound technology to Australian researchers, promising new insights into brain function and accelerated progress in neuroscience and preclinical studies. AXT has extensive experience with bringing new technologies to the Australian and New Zealand markets. Another addition is the recent signing of a new distribution agreement with Iconeus, pioneers of functional ultrasound (fUS). This technology affords neuroscience and preclinical researchers an unprecedented ability to non-invasively image the blood vessels in the brain and observe brain activity in real-time. Their unique technology, embodied in the commercially available Iconeus One, combines sensitivity, speed, and high resolution, producing detailed vascular maps of the brain. The direct correlation between brain activity and blood flow allows this technology to be used to study such things as neuropharmacology, neurovascular imaging, resting state functional connectivity, functional neuroimaging, as well as drug and treatment therapies. Functional ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves similar to conventional ultrasound, except that it uses plane-waves as opposed to point-focused waves. Thus, a full 2D image can be generated with every pulse. By sending a sequence of plane waves from different angles, fUS significantly improves signal-to-noise ratio, allowing visualization of the brain vasculature at the finest scale and the detection of subtle changes in blood flow with exceptional sensitivity. Higher resolution studies are also possible by performing Ultrasound Localised Microscopy (ULM). Richard Trett, AXT Managing Director, said, “We are committed to supporting Australian medical research by sourcing the latest technologies and Iconeus' functional ultrasound technology certainly fits the bill. I have no doubt that adopters of this technology will make rapid strides to better understand brain functions and treating brain disorders.” Ludovic Lecointre, CEO at Iconeus, followed up and replied, “we are excited to work with AXT who have extensive experience in bringing new technologies into their territory. We look forward to a successful relationship, further building on their well-established footprint in the preclinical imaging sector.” For more information on the Iconeus One functional ultrasound system, please visit the Iconeus One page.
