                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This cosmic megastructure may be the key to resurrection—and immortality. So will everyone else who ever had a hand in the history of human civilization. Once it's finished, you'll live your whole life (again) in a simulated reality, and when the time comes for you to die (again), you'll be transported into a simulated afterlife, à la Black Mirror's “San Junipero,” where you'll get to hang out with your friends, family, and favorite celebrities forever.Yes, this is mind-boggling. This is Plan C of the “Immortality Roadmap,” a project on which Russian transhumanist and life extensionist Alexey Turchin has been working since 2014. Turchin has laid out the details in a paper he published with fellow transhumanist Maxim Chernyakov called “Classification of Approaches to Technological Resurrection.” (Plans A, B, and D involve life extension, cryonics, and quantum immortality, respectively. When Turchin was 11 years old, a girl in his class died. “I started to think in science-fiction terms about what could be done,” Turchin tells Pop Mech. In 2007, he became a member of the Russian Transhumanist Movement, a community that works to prepare Russians to embrace the technologies that will help them transcend their current physical and mental limitations. Turchin cofounded Russia's first transhumanist political party in 2012, and he's since been perfecting his Immortality Roadmap and proactively recording every tidbit of his life. This practice of “ubiquitous surveillance”—throughout which Turchin says he even records his own biases—is necessary because the superintelligent AI needs to subject future resurrectees to the exact same developmental conditions they went through when they lived for the sake of their “authenticity,” he says. Once the AI creates your precise digital copy, anything is possible—even restoration to biological life, says Turchin. There's no way Earth's power output could provide us with the computational resources for this endeavor. Better yet, we need a Dyson Sphere around the sun. The late physicist Freeman Dyson proposed his megastructure concept in a 1960 Science paper, “Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation.” The gist: It's a hypothetical shell encircling the sun to harness a large part of the majestic 400 septillion watts per second of energy our star emits on any given day. That's on the order of a trillion times our current worldwide energy usage. Think of a Dyson Sphere as many separate satellites with separate orbits, as one enormous structure would be gravitationally unstable, says Turchin. He envisions the megastructure as a fleet of black or slightly orange solar farms, bonded together into a staggering 300 million-kilometer shell around the sun. It will be the ultimate alien megastructure, one that will signal the passage of our species from a planetary species to an interstellar one. There's just one small problem: We can't actually build such a thing. “An actual sphere around the sun is completely impractical,” Stuart Armstrong, a research fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute who has studied megastructure concepts, previously told Pop Mech. The tensile strength needed to prevent the Dyson Sphere from tearing itself apart vastly exceeds that of any known material, Armstrong said. Plus, the sphere wouldn't gravitationally bind to its star in a stable fashion. Okay, so humans can't construct a Dyson Sphere (yet). The baby bots could start mining a small planet for iron and oxygen, and use these resources to create a reflective hematite surface around the sun. Even if machines pitch in and solve the problem of how to harness all that energy, however, the concept of digital resurrection still doesn't sound feasible to Stephen Holler, an associate professor of physics at Fordham University. “I don't think you could subject somebody to the same developmental conditions they had in life, because that presupposes you know all their developmental conditions, from the guy who picked on that person that day when they were very young to what day the person received that award,” Holler tells Pop Mech. “There are many things we don't know that historically molded the way a person's life turned out,” says Holler. “Those aren't part of any record, making it a very hard thing to resurrect somebody.” Kelly Smith, professor of philosophy and biological sciences at Clemson University who researches the social, conceptual, and ethical issues surrounding space exploration, sees manufacturing a mammoth Dyson Sphere as more of a political problem than an engineering challenge. “All of humanity would have to work on it for 100 years,” Smith tells Pop Mech. But people have evolved to be short-term thinkers, preoccupied with matters of profit and loss in their short lifetime. Blame entropy: “The star that's powering the Dyson Sphere is going to go supernova at some point, so there goes our power source,” Smith says. No, Turchin's Plan C for immortality can't bring humans back in the way Abrahamic religions, which encompass the concept of a soul, can. Think about the end of your life and what might happen next. There are two possible outcomes: If your soul exists, you continue on after death and everything is wonderful. And if it doesn't and your fate is utter demise, well, some part of you could still continue infinitely as a digital copy. “It's a win-win situation in both scenarios,” Turchin says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dramatic CCTV video of fault slip during a recent large earthquake in Myanmar thrilled both scientists and casual observers when it was posted to YouTube. But it was on his fifth or sixth viewing, said geophysicist Jesse Kearse, that he spotted something even more exciting. When Kearse and his colleague Yoshihiro Kaneko at Kyoto University analyzed the video more carefully, they concluded that it had captured the first direct visual evidence of curved fault slip. Earthquake geologists often observe curved slickenlines, the scrape marks created by blocks of rock moving past each other during faulting. But until now there has been no visual proof of the curved slip that might create these slickenlines. The video confirmation of curved fault slip can help researchers create better dynamic models of how faults rupture, Kearse and Kaneko conclude in their paper published in The Seismic Record. The video comes from a CCTV security camera recording along the trace of Myanmar's Sagaing Fault, which ruptured 28 March in a magnitude 7.7 earthquake. "I saw this on YouTube an hour or two after it was uploaded, and it sent chills down my spine straight away," Kearse recalled. "It shows something that I think every earthquake scientist has been desperate to see, and it was just right there, so very exciting." "Instead of things moving straight across the video screen, they moved along a curved path that has a convexity downwards, which instantly started bells ringing in my head," Kearse said, "because some of my previous research has been specifically on curvature of fault slip, but from the geological record." Kearse had studied curved slickenlines associated with other earthquakes, such as the 2016 magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand, and their implications for understanding how faults rupture. With the Myanmar video, "we set about to quantify the movement a bit more carefully, to extract objective quantitative information from the video rather than just pointing at it to say, look, it's curved," he said. This shows that the earthquake was pulse-like, which is a major discovery and confirms previous inferences made from seismic waveforms of other earthquakes. In addition, most of the fault motion is strike-slip, with a brief dip-slip component. "These transient stresses push the fault off its intended course initially, and then it catches itself and does what it's supposed to do, after that."

(2025)Cite this article Glycosylation is central to the localization and function of biomolecules1. We recently discovered that small RNAs undergo N-glycosylation2 at the modified RNA base 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine (acp3U)3. However, the functional significance of N-glycosylation of RNAs is unknown. Here we show that the N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs. We found that de-N-glycosylation of cell-culture-derived and circulating human and mouse glycoRNA elicited potent inflammatory responses including the production of type I interferons in a Toll-like receptor 3- and Toll-like receptor 7-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that N-glycans on cell surface RNAs prevent apoptotic cells from triggering endosomal RNA sensors in efferocytes, thus facilitating the non-inflammatory clearance of dead cells. Mechanistically, N-glycans conceal the hypermodified uracil base acp3U, which we identified as immunostimulatory when exposed in RNA. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of an enzyme (DTWD2) that synthesizes acp3U abrogated innate immune activation by de-N-glycosylated small RNAs and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, synthetic acp3U-containing RNAs are sufficient to trigger innate immune responses. Thus, our study has uncovered a natural mechanism by which N-glycans block RNAs from inducing acp3U-dependent innate immune activation, demonstrating how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses.

Migration of transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells into the brain following systemic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transplantation (HCT) holds great promise as a therapeutic modality to correct genetic deficiencies in the brain such as lysosomal storage diseases.1–3 However, the toxic myeloablation required for allogeneic HCT can cause serious, life-threatening side effects limiting its applicability. Moreover, transplanted allogeneic myeloid cells are highly vulnerable to rejection even in an immune-privileged organ like the brain. Here we report a brain-restricted, high-efficiency microglia replacement approach without myeloablative preconditioning. In contrast, Sca1- committed progenitor cells were highly efficient to replace microglia following intracerebral injection. This finding enabled the development of brain-restricted preconditioning and avoided long-term peripheral engraftment thus eliminating complications such as graft-vs-host disease. Evaluating its therapeutic potential, we found that our allogeneic microglia replacement method rescues the murine model of Sandhoff disease, a lysosomal storage disease caused by hexosaminidase B deficiency. In support of the translational relevance of this approach, we discovered that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myeloid progenitor cells display a similar engraftment potential following brain-restricted conditioning.

Scientists are testing the limits of consciousness to find new ways to bring patients back from a vegetative state—and raising uncomfortable questions about the limits of consciousness. “I think I was probably 28,” says Daniel Toker, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). But for one person that night, the lightning disappeared. Someone full of life, just enjoying himself, was gone—just like that. Though his Ph.D. had focused on perception and memory, not clinical care, the shock of seeing consciousness end so abruptly sent him deep into coma literature. After finishing his doctorate, he sought out a lab at UCLA that specializes in coma research. Toker is pioneering new ways to understand and potentially reverse coma. He studies brain organoids—miniature, lab-grown models of the human brain—to simulate unconscious states. He also uses deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) to identify promising parts of the brain that might respond to treatment and help bring back  awareness. And he analyzes electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from real patients to map how awareness reemerges across different unconscious states. These methods are still preclinical (researchers  have tested them only in the lab, not yet in patients), but his early findings are drawing interest. One of the most surprising discoveries from Toker's research is saxagliptin—a diabetes drug in the same class as Ozempic and DPP-4 inhibitors (which preserve GLP-1, a hormone that controls blood sugar and appetite). His AI model first identified brain circuits that might respond to treatment—and saxagliptin emerged as a top candidate for potentially restoring  consciousness in some brain-injured patients. This reverse-engineering approach could radically change how scientists find new coma therapies. The UCLA researcher's work builds on a now-famous body of work suggesting that patients diagnosed as unaware may still possess hidden awareness. Take the landmark 2010 New England Journal of Medicine study led by Martin Monti and Adrian Owen, in which vegetative patients were asked to imagine playing tennis during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. A few responded with the same brain activity as healthy volunteers—evidence they were conscious but unable to move or speak. Or the August 2024 global trial that found that about 25 percent of patients who seemed totally unresponsive could actually follow commands using just brain activity, a condition known as cognitive motor dissociation. These findings raise uncomfortable questions: How many patients might be aware, yet misdiagnosed? And are we making the right calls when deciding to unplug comatose patients? “We have heuristics—rules of thumb [to make these decisions]—but yeah, it's almost certain that we've unplugged people who would've otherwise regained awareness,” Toker says. “Patients who are vegetative might transition to a minimally conscious state… and have better odds of eventually fully waking up.” “Using AI to come up with a new treatment, like the saxagliptin… I thought that was very elegant,” says Olivia Gosseries, PhD, a neuropsychologist and director of the Coma Science Group at the University of Liège in Belgium, a leading center for research into coma and related states. Because most of it is still at the theoretical level.” “Now, more than ever, more centers believe we can cure coma,” Gosseries says, referencing the Curing Coma Campaign, the first global public health initiative that considers coma a treatable medical condition, launched by the Neurocritical Care Society in October 2019. Perhaps that's why she confidently emphasizes one crucial point: Don't assume unresponsive means unconscious. “We never really know if someone is conscious or not,” she says. Those Hollywood scenes—where desperate relatives sit beside the listless body of a loved one in a coma, speaking softly about quotidian matters, convinced their words might reach them—may hold an instinctive truth now backed by science. “Be careful what you say around the patient,” Gosseries warns. Clinicians often  assume the threshold is: full cognition, ability to walk—high-functioning  recovery, Gosseries says. But what we see from patients and families is  different. Gosseries says her team is studying how patients who    recover from severe brain injury reassess what makes life worth living. Before the injury, many said they would have rejected life with major    disabilities. Afterward, she says, “we see something different,” with some    telling her team that “just being able to communicate is enough.” This    shift, she quickly adds, is why we need to move fast: “...Because if you    don't stimulate or wake up the brain early, the brain might get used to    being in that state—and then it's too late.” Once you cross that line, the door of return shuts down forever. “Some types of drug overdoses can make someone appear completely brain-dead,” he says. “But once the drug clears out, they wake up.” One example is tricyclic antidepressants, an older class of drugs used to treat depression. Even more unsettling, Toker adds, is that the brain can still be electrically active [meaning neurons are still firing] yet somehow blocked from generating consciousness. “It's not so much that the brain is on or off,” he stresses. Consciousness seems to arise when a certain large-scale network pattern emerges,       he says, pointing toward a neuroscientific mystery we haven't fully cracked. “And we exist, our experience exists somehow in that pattern,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to lightning, it only takes learning a few facts to learn that these brief moments of raw atmospheric power have precisely zero chill. For one, there are roughly 8.6 million lightning strikes on Earth per day, and those terrifying bolts can temporarily superheat the surrounding air to a toasty 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (a.k.a. Incredibly, lightning can even briefly produce gamma-rays, which are typically spewed from things like supernovae or black hole jets. While scientists have a pretty firm grasp on why lightning forms in cumulonimbus clouds, they don't exactly understand the atomic phenomena underpinning the phenomenon. Now, in a new study from Pennsylvania State University, scientists used mathematical models combined with ground observations to discern the exact atomic workings that create lightning bolts in the first place. “We demonstrated how electrons, accelerated by strong electric fields in thunderclouds, produce X-rays as they collide with air molecules like nitrogen and oxygen, and create an avalanche of electrons that produce high-energy photons that initiate lightning.” Two years ago, Pasko and his team published a Photoelectric Feedback Discharge model, which simulates conditions ripe for lightning activity. And earlier this year, an unrelated study from the University of Osaka observed and detailed the extremely brief moments of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, or TGFs, using a multi-sensor set-up. This new study wanted to understand why these TGFs were often produced without flashes of light or radio wave bursts. Driven by the photoelectric effect, which explains how materials or atoms release electrons when struck by light, the variable strength of the runaway chain reaction that occurs in lightning bolts can precisely produce these initially unintuitive conditions. “In addition to being produced in very compact volumes, this runaway chain reaction can occur with highly variable strength, often leading to detectable levels of X-rays, while accompanied by very weak optical and radio emissions. This explains why these gamma-ray flashes can emerge from source regions that appear optically dim and radio silent.” Lightning has long been an atmospheric phenomenon on Earth, and one leading theory even speculates that it might have helped kickstart life on the planet. Now, a couple billion years later, that life is finally revealing its high-energy secrets. Mystery on Easter Island: More Moai Found in Lake This Clay Seal Might Belong to a Biblical Figure</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deepest depths of our planet's surface do not disappoint. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Recently, a manned submersible (not a robot, but one with actual people inside) brought this truth into sharp focus by diving over 31,000 feet into the world's deepest ocean trenches. The hadal zone contains some of Earth's least explored and understood environments. These communities of extreme deep water life forms are sustained not by sunlight—which can't even begin to penetrate water to hadal-zone depths—but by hydrogen sulfide- and methane-rich fluids found along faults that carve their way through the deep sediment layers found in the trenches. “Given geological similarities with other hadal trenches, such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated,” the authors wrote. “These findings challenge current models of life at extreme limits and carbon cycling in the deep ocean.” But evidently, even at these extremes, life will win out. “Each descent transported me to a new deep-sea realm. “The presence of these chemosynthetic ecosystems,” Du continued, “challenges long-standing assumptions about life's potential at extreme depths.” Xiao Xiang, convening scientist of the Mariana Trench Environment and Ecology Research and professor at the School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, told China Daily that these deep-sea organisms could be a massive boon for science. “Such resources,” Xiang continued, “may provide a new option to solve the dilemma of global depletion of biological resources and also open up prospects for innovative application in the areas of biotechnology, medicine, and energy, among others.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To make fusion reactors, we need materials that can withstand its punishing environment, and a new Chinese-made material can survive reactors' intense conditions. Scientists are confident that if a reactor contains a superheated plasma, fueled by heavy hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium, at temperatures approaching 100 million degrees Celsius, you will produce a self-sustaining reaction, generating near endless amounts of clean energy. Give me the materials that can hold this thing together, at temperature, to be efficient,” Phil Ferguson, Ph.D., Director of the Material Plasma Exposure eXperiment (MPEX) Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory told Popular Mechanics in 2024. Not only does a fusion reactor need parts, such as the divertor, to handle the plasma's extreme heat, other parts of the very same machine need to withstand and operate at temperatures approaching absolute zero. The shield, or jacket, for the central solenoid needs to be a steel material that can retain superior mechanical and thermal properties at cryogenic temperatures while also withstanding intense magnetic fields. The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the world's most advanced tokamak that's due for first plasma by 2034, uses a material known as 316LN stainless steel designed to operate at a maximum of 11.8 Tesla. Now, a new report from the state-run South China Morning Post (SCMP) suggests that Chinese scientists have come up with a new material that has even ITER's steel jacket of choice beat. 1, or CHSN01, can withstand up to 20 Tesla and 1,500-megapascal (MPa) of stress. “While ITER's maximum 11.8 Tesla field design is enough for itself, future higher-field magnets will require advanced materials,” said Li Laifeng, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' (CAS), reports SCMP. “Developing next-gen cryogenic steel isn't optional – it's essential for the success of China's compact fusion energy experimental devices.” CHSN01 will be in the central Solenoid of China's Burning Plasma Experiment Superconducting Tokamak (BEST), an intermediary reactor between the country's first-generation fusion reactors and the Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor—the country's first fusion plant demonstrator. Scientists aim for the BEST reactor to achieve first plasma in late 2027.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international team of scientists have provided an unprecedented tally of elemental sulfur spread between the stars using data from the Japan-led XRISM (X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) spacecraft. "Sulfur is important for how cells function in our bodies here on Earth, but we still have a lot of questions about where it's found out in the universe," said Lía Corrales, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The XRISM spacecraft provides the resolution and sensitivity we need to find it in both forms and learn more about where it might be hiding." Using ultraviolet light, researchers have found gaseous sulfur in the space between stars. In denser parts of the interstellar medium, such as the molecular clouds where stars and planets are born, this form of sulfur quickly disappears. To study sulfur, Corrales and her team did something similar. Using the Resolve instrument on XRISM, the scientists were able to measure the energy of GX 340+0's X-rays and determined that sulfur was present not only as a gas, but also as a solid, possibly mixed with iron. "Chemistry in environments like the interstellar medium is very different from anything we can do on Earth, but we modeled sulfur combined with iron, and it seems to match what we're seeing with XRISM," said co-author Elisa Costantini, a senior astronomer at the Space Research Organization Netherlands and the University of Amsterdam. Iron-sulfur compounds are often found in meteorites, so scientists have long thought they might be one way sulfur solidifies out of molecular clouds to travel through the universe. In their paper, Corrales and her team propose a few compounds that would match XRISM's observations -- pyrrhotite, troilite, and pyrite, which is sometimes called fool's gold. The researchers were also able to use measurements from a second X-ray binary called 4U 1630-472 that helped confirm their findings. "NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has previously studied sulfur, but XRISM's measurements are the most detailed yet," said Brian Williams, the XRISM project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. There's still so much to learn about the galaxy we call home." NASA and JAXA developed Resolve, the mission's microcalorimeter spectrometer. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA faces historic budget cuts that could shutter missions and stall vital research, prompting a bipartisan outcry from all of the agency's living former science chiefs. By Rachel Feltman, Lee Billings, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio The White House recently proposed slashing NASA's science budget nearly in half and reducing the space agency's overall funding to just three quarters of what it received last year. But these days NASA is responsible for much more than keeping up with the space race. NASA's work touches our daily lives in ways most people never realize, from the weather forecasts that help you decide what to wear to the climate data that helps farmers know when to plant their crops. The stakes are so high that every living former NASA science chief—spanning from Ronald Reagan's administration through Joe Biden's—recently signed a letter warning that these cuts could be catastrophic for American leadership in space and science.

Today we're joined by Lee Billings, a senior editor at Scientific American who covers space and physics. He spoke with one of those former NASA science chiefs about why this moment feels different—and why the scientific community is sounding the alarm. Lee, thanks so much for coming on to chat. Lee Billings: It is my pleasure, as always, Rachel. Feltman: Right, things aren't looking great for NASA. What exactly is going on with the agency's funding? And there's been a lot of pushback about that, of course, because if you cut NASA's science budget in half, for instance, then you're probably gonna have to shutter, cancel, decommission dozens of active missions across the solar system and in Earth orbit, and you're going to really hamstring a lot of good science, a lot of things that feed forward into other aspects of national economies and competitiveness. I don't think that we're entirely out of the woods yet—things are not fully finalized—but it is looking a bit brighter. And one contributor to that pushback from Senate and House appropriators might have been a letter that was recently sent to them—an open letter from all the living previous science chiefs of NASA, the associate administrators of the Science Mission Directorate of NASA. Every single one who's still alive, from serving [in] the Reagan administration all the way through the Biden administration, signed on to this letter on a bipartisan basis and said, “We're really not cool with these proposed changes; they're potentially catastrophic for the nation and for NASA as a whole, so let's not do them.” Feltman: So this pushback is like really seriously bipartisan effort. And none of them seemed too happy about the potential changes that these budget cuts would've wrought on NASA. Feltman: Let's talk some more about those potential changes. What are the signatories of this letter most concerned about? Billings: You know, it—it's hard to reel out a concise laundry list because the cuts [laughs] were so large, they threatened to affect almost everything. And I'm gonna read just a couple of quick excerpts. So they say that these budget cuts would, quote, “cede U.S. leadership in space and science to China and other nations,” would “severely damage a peerless and immensely capable engineering and scientific workforce” and would “needlessly put to waste billions of dollars of taxpayer investments.” They would, quote, “force the U.S. to abandon its international partners who historically contribute significantly to U.S. space science missions.” And then they spend a paragraph going into more details. And we're talking about things like winding down Hubble, even starting to wind down the James Webb Space Telescope, which only launched a few years ago. We're talking about turning off missions that are currently at Jupiter, like NASA's Juno mission. We're also talking about closing some of NASA's eyes to Earth. We're talking about cuts that would affect things like the Landsat program, which NASA manages [with] the United States Geological Survey, which, you know, looks at things like weather and precipitation and, and helps people avoid dangerous storms or know when to plant or harvest their crops—things like that. It even cuts into things like aeronautics; people forget that that—the first A in NASA stands for “aeronautics,” I'm pretty sure, and there's lots of work that's done there, too. Billings: Yeah, his name's John Grunsfeld; sometimes he's called “Dr. He is a five-time spaceflight veteran—a former NASA astronaut who went up to fix the Hubble Space Telescope and service it, hence the “Dr. John Grunsfeld: There's no question that science in the United States is under attack, and the president's budget request shows that NASA, you know, is not at all spared. I really feel like some of his strongest material was when we prompted him by saying things like, you know, “What—why is this happening right now? Grunsfeld: You know, I can only speculate that this is part of a deliberate attempt to dumb down America. Like, this guy—that was the other thing that he said that I thought was really good: when I challenged him directly, I was like, “You know, you can look through your socials and your history and I can see that, you know, you were a supporter of Kamala Harris. But when he does talk in a concerted way that's trying to get attention, I do think it's worth listening. Feltman: Yeah, and what is he most concerned about? Grunsfeld: I'm an astrophysicist, so that actually has me seriously depressed. There's especially one cut, which is eliminating the high-altitude balloon program, which—I have to say, having run NASA Science—is probably the most efficient and productive program in all of NASA and in all of the federal government because it always has a tiny budget and it does tremendous science. Billings: And it seems to be one of the areas where NASA and, by proxy, the United States is really in a pole position. We're really leading the world in a lot of domains of astrophysics in terms of building telescopes to see further and more clearly deeper out into the cosmos, and he definitely thinks that that is at risk. And the other one that he pointed out has—it hits a little closer to home. And one of the things we know is that the Earth as a system is incredibly complex, and it's that view from space—not only, you know, seeing the whole Earth with our fleet of satellites but also over a long period of time—that allows us to develop models to accurately predict what the future will be. And we need to know how that works. Feltman: Of course NASA has faced potential budget cuts before. So, what does John say is different about this? Billings: One thing that's indisputable is: if you look at these proposed budget cuts and you look at NASA's funding over time, across the entirety of its nearly 70-year history, the budget cuts, if they went through, would be bringing NASA to its lowest state, its lowest budgetary state, since before the [beginnings of the] Apollo program—since, really, its founding. And of course, NASA is doing a lot more with its money than it did back in the Apollo days. You know, back then it was all about a moonshot and beating the Soviet Union in this new “High Frontier,” and it was a very focused, almost singular goal. If you look at all the different things it's doing and all the different types of science that it supports, all the different technology development that it supports, all the different aspects of our lives that these things filter into, it's just grown so much. So we're pairing a historically low budget with an immensely expanded portfolio of responsibilities, obligations and opportunities, and I think it's that combination that really set the alarm bells off and that really brought not just John Grunsfeld to the table to write this letter but also all of his predecessors within NASA's Science Mission Directorate. Billings: Woo, well, I think that our listeners should care for many different reasons, and, and it kind of depends upon one's point of view. If you're really enthused and excited about just fundamentally expanding the frontiers of our knowledge about the universe, right, if you are captivated and awestruck by pretty pictures from space telescopes and other worldly vistas from interplanetary spacecraft, you should be concerned about that window closing on the universe. Well, in that case maybe you don't care so much about pretty pictures from space telescopes and rovers on Mars looking for signs of life, but maybe you just want the U.S. to be the best, right? And if these sorts of budget cuts go through, then it's very hard to see how we're still gonna be the best in these domains, instead of some other competitor nations, particularly China. They have a space station up there right now. They are going to be launching almost, like, a Hubble Space Telescope–like orbital observatory that's gonna hang out near their space station for servicing in [the] coming years. They are probably going to pull off the first successful Mars sample return mission before NASA and the European Space Agency, its key partner, will manage to retrieve a bunch of samples that they already have stored there on Mars. You know, attracting the best and the brightest to our shores from all across the world, because who wouldn't want to work on a mission to land people on Mars? Those things are fundamentally attractive and cool to a lot of people—again, the best and the brightest—and we want to have them here, I think. There's also the direct-utility angle of people wanting to know if it's gonna be rainy or sunny tomorrow, what they need to wear if they're going out to work: Should they wear a light sweater, or should they, you know, wear seersucker because it's gonna be 90 percent humidity? Is there gonna be a big squall or hurricane that might blow in? Those things depend on forecasts, which are based on data that, to some degree, comes from NASA assets—NASA satellites, NASA computers crunching the numbers, all that stuff. So Earth observations have a very strong, direct influence on our daily lives, whether we really recognize it or not, and it's threatened by these sorts of budget cuts. Feltman: Lee, thank you so much for coming on to chat. Again, I wish the circumstances were a little better, but hey, hope springs eternal.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by inclusions of α-synuclein (α-syn) and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Patients with PD anecdotally experience symptom improvement at high altitude; chronic hypoxia prevents the development of Leigh-like brain disease in mice with mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Here we report that intrastriatal injection of α-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) in mice resulted in neurodegeneration and movement disorder, which were prevented by continuous exposure to 11% oxygen. Specifically, PFF-induced α-syn aggregation resulted in brain tissue hyperoxia, lipid peroxidation and DA neurodegeneration in the SNpc of mice breathing 21% oxygen, but not in those breathing 11% oxygen. This neuroprotective effect of hypoxia was also observed in Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover, initiating hypoxia 6 weeks after PFF injection reversed motor dysfunction and halted further DA neurodegeneration. These results suggest that hypoxia may have neuroprotective effects downstream of α-syn aggregation in PD, even after symptom onset and neuropathological changes. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive multisystem neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of individuals. The cardinal motor symptoms of PD include tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and akinesia, and postural instability. However, the clinical presentation includes a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms1. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the accumulation of intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs), which mainly consist of aggregated fibrillar α-synuclein (α-syn)2. α-Syn is a presynaptic protein consisting of 140 amino acids and encoded by SNCA. While the function of α-syn is not well understood, α-syn fibrils formed during the early stages of aggregation are considered highly toxic to many intracellular processes and organelles, notably mitochondria3,4. Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in PD5. Pathological α-syn can inhibit mitochondrial complex I (MCI), leading to mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced membrane potential, impaired axonal transport, decreased mitochondrial gene expression, disrupted oxidative phosphorylation and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Chemical inhibitors of MCI, notably the pesticide rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (a product of meperidine analog synthesis), are toxic to DA neurons and can induce parkinsonism13,14. In addition, biochemical MCI deficiencies occur in the SNpc of cases with sporadic PD5, and many recessive forms of familial PD affect mitochondrial proteins15,16. Genetic ablation of MCI in DA neurons is sufficient to cause parkinsonism in mice17. Collectively, these observations underscore the critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial forms of PD. Unfortunately, no therapies currently exist to halt or slow the progression of neurodegeneration in patients with PD. Monogenic defects in MCI are a common biochemical cause of Leigh syndrome, the most prevalent pediatric manifestation of mitochondrial disease characterized by neurodegeneration affecting the deep gray matter18. Mice deficient in Ndufs4, which encodes the MCI subunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S4, have decreased MCI activity and serve as a model of Leigh syndrome by recapitulating many of the neuropathological and clinical features19. Previous research demonstrated that continuous exposure to 11% O2 prevents neurodegeneration and markedly extends the lifespan (approximately fivefold) in Ndufs4−/− mice20. When administered to mice with advanced disease, it can halt and even reverse pathology21. More recent studies demonstrated that hypoxia rescue of MCI deficiency is evolutionarily conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans22. Moreover, patients with PD anecdotally experience improvement in their symptoms at high altitude, where inspired oxygen levels are reduced23. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that hypoxia treatment might prevent degeneration of DA neurons in the SNpc and alleviate movement disorder in PD. We investigated whether chronic exposure to moderate environmental hypoxia, that is, continuously breathing 11% O2 at sea level, could ameliorate neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction in mice subjected to intrastriatal injection of α-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs). We recently reported that chronic, continuous breathing of 11% O2 is well tolerated by healthy volunteers after several days of stepwise acclimatization in a hospital setting25. Injection of α-syn PFFs induces endogenous α-syn to form inclusions that biochemically and morphologically resemble those found in PD4,26. After receiving a unilateral injection of PFFs or monomeric α-syn as control into the right striatum, mice were housed in custom-made chambers where they continuously breathed either normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (11% O2) gas at normobaria for 12 weeks (Fig. To examine the effects of hypoxia treatment on PFF-induced α-syn aggregation and the integrity of DA neurons, we immunolabeled α-syn phosphorylated at Ser129, a marker of human LBs and LNs, and performed unbiased stereological counting of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ DA neurons in coronal brain sections containing the SNpc of brain obtained 12 weeks after intrastriatal injection of PFF or α-syn monomer (Fig. In mice breathing 21% O2, PFFs induced the formation of dense LB-like inclusions (Fig. 1c,d) and the loss of TH+ DA neurons (Fig. 1e,f) in the ipsilateral SNpc by 12 weeks. In mice breathing 11% O2, PFF-injected individuals showed a similar degree of phosphorylated α-syn deposition as the PFF-injected mice breathing 21% O2 (Fig. However, breathing 11% O2 rescued the loss of TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc of PFF-treated mice (Fig. These results indicate that hypoxia treatment in mice with PFF-induced α-syn inclusion formation mitigates the loss of TH+ DA neurons, without preventing the formation of Lewy pathology-like inclusions in the SNpc. a, Schematic depicting the experimental groups and timeline. b, Schematic depicting stereological cell counting in the SNpc.

Motor function and behavior were assessed using the pole, cage hang and open field tests 12 weeks after injection26,28. The pole test models motor coordination and bradykinesia. The cage hang test (also known as the wire hang test) measures muscle strength and endurance29,30. The open field test (OFT) assesses anxiety-like behavior. When breathing 21% O2, compared to monomeric α-syn-treated controls, mice with PFF-induced α-syn aggregates exhibited prolonged time to climb down in the pole test (Fig. 1g) and reduced latency to hang onto the wire in the cage hang test (Fig. Moreover, they exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the OFT as evidenced by decreased time spent in the inner zone (Fig. 1i) and increased total distance traveled (Fig. In contrast, when breathing 11% O2, PFF-injected mice performed similarly to control mice on all three tests. In monomeric α-syn-treated mice, breathing 11% O2 did not affect latency in the pole and cage hang tests, nor did it affect the time spent in the inner zone or the total distance moved in the OFT compared to breathing 21% O2 (Fig. Although breathing 11% O2 caused a transient decrease in body weight of approximately 10% in all mice for the first few days, it did not affect the rate of body weight gain thereafter (Extended Data Fig. PFF-treated and α-syn-monomer-treated mice exhibited similar increase in hemoglobin concentration in response to hypoxia (Extended Data Fig. There was no correlation between body weight and the results of the pole and cage hang tests (Extended Data Fig. These results suggest that continuous exposure to 11% O2 prevents the development of movement disorder and anxiety-like behavior in mice with α-syn aggregates. Neuronal iron accumulation in the substantia nigra (SN) is a hallmark of PD pathology31. To determine whether hypoxia affects iron metabolism in the SN after α-syn aggregation, we examined iron levels in the SNpc. The area of the SNpc was delineated based on anatomical landmarks using a mouse brain atlas by an investigator blinded to the identity of the samples. Iron accumulation, as measured using Perls-3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, increased in the SNpc at 12 weeks after PFF injection, compared to α-syn monomer injection (Fig. Hypoxia had no effect on iron levels in the SNpc of both α-syn-monomer-injected and PFF-injected mice, indicating that the beneficial effects of hypoxia after PFF injection are not mediated by attenuation of iron accumulation. Because prior studies showed mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction induced by α-syn6,7,8, and because primary mitochondrial dysfunction can result in tissue hyperoxia32, we wondered if the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) is elevated in the SNpc of our PD mouse model. To our knowledge, no prior study measured brain pO2 in patients with PD or in mouse models of α-syn toxicity. We measured the pO2 in the SNpc using a fiber-optic fluorescence oxygen sensor 6 weeks after intrastriatal injection of PFF or monomer. When breathing 21% O2, mice injected with PFF exhibited higher brain tissue pO2 in the SNpc compared to mice injected with α-syn monomer (Fig. There could be multiple mechanistic explanations for the observed relative hyperoxia, including decreased oxygen consumption by the mitochondrial respiratory chain due to PFF inhibiting MCI6,7,8. We hypothesized that local hyperoxia in the PFF-injected SNpc of mice breathing 21% O2 could promote lipid peroxidation. Recent genome-wide CRISPR genetic screens revealed a strong synthetic lethal interaction between mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition and genetic loss of GPX4, a lipid hydroperoxidase33. Moreover, oncocytic thyroid carcinoma is associated with somatic genetic loss of MCI and is highly sensitive to death from lipid peroxidation34. To test this hypothesis, we measured malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the SN 6 weeks after intrastriatal injection of α-syn PFF or monomer. In mice breathing 21% O2, those with PFF-induced α-syn aggregates exhibited higher MDA levels in the SN compared to monomer-injected mice (Fig. These observations suggest that hypoxia attenuates lipid peroxidation in the SN after α-syn aggregation by mitigating brain tissue hyperoxia without affecting iron accumulation. To better understand how hypoxia confers neuroprotection against α-syn aggregates, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the SN (Methods). We observed that α-syn aggregation induced remarkable changes in the transcriptome of mice breathing 21% O2, as evidenced by a striking eruption in the volcano plot (Fig. However, it elicited no such transcriptional eruption in mice breathing 11% O2 (Fig. In fact, the transcriptional changes induced by α-syn aggregates in mice breathing 21% O2 were very similar to the changes in control mice (treated with α-syn monomer) breathing 11% O2 compared to α-syn monomer treatment in mice breathing 21% O2 (Extended Data Fig. We conclude that PFF-induced α-syn aggregation triggers toxicity and is associated with many transcriptional changes, but that hypoxia gives rise to a cellular state such that PFF aggregates have little additional differential impact. Among the genes most upregulated by PFF-induced α-syn aggregation in mice breathing 21% O2, and also increased by breathing 11% O2, is Tfrc (Fig. 3c), which encodes TFR1 and is central to the endocytic import of transferrin-bound iron. We also observed a significant increase of Slc40a1 (ferroportin, Fpn), the main iron transporter, by breathing 11% O2 in the SN (Fig. Neuronal iron accumulation in the SNpc is a hallmark of PD pathology31 and is recapitulated in our model (Fig. A recent study using the same mouse model of PD reported that after PFF exposure, activated microglia secrete interleukin-6, which leads to transcriptional upregulation of Tfrc in neurons and contributes to neuronal iron accumulation35. Although our bulk RNA-seq of the SN of mice with intrastriatal injection of PFF does not show an interleukin-6 signature, we observed a marked increase of Iba1 mRNA levels by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) in the SN of an independent cohort of mice 3 months after PFF injection (Extended Data Fig. Upregulation of Tfrc and Fpn by hypoxia and or α-syn PFF observed in the RNA-seq was also corroborated using RT–qPCR in the independent cohort of mice (Extended Data Fig. These observations are consistent with the role of microglial activation in iron accumulation in PD, and the profile of iron accumulation in the SN observed in our study (Fig. a, Representative photomicrograph of Perls-DAB-stained SNpc in mice treated with PFF or α-syn monomer and breathing 21% or 11% O2 for 12 weeks. b, Ratio of Perls-DAB+ area to SNpc area in mice treated with PFF or α-syn monomer and breathing 21% or 11% O2 for 12 weeks. a,b, n = 4 for mice injected with α-syn monomer; n = 11 or 12 for mice injected with PFF. c, Brain tissue pO2 in the SNpc of mice treated with PFF or α-syn monomer and breathing 21% or 11% O2 for 6 weeks. d, MDA levels in the SN of mice treated with PFF or α-syn monomer and breathing 21% or 11% O2 for 6 weeks.

SNpr, substantia nigra pars reticulata. A number of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) targets are upregulated in response to hypoxia, some of which may be important in conferring neuroprotection. Canonical HIF targets, including Vegfa, Kdr, Adm, Ldha, Cxcl12 and Slc16a3 are upregulated with hypoxia (Fig. 3e); we corroborated many of these further using either RT–PCR (Extended Data Fig. 2e–i) or tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics (Fig. 3f) in independent cohorts of mice (Methods). Ldha, which encodes lactate dehydrogenase, elevated at the RNA level and trending up at the protein level, and Slc16a3, which encodes the Mct4 monocarboxylate transporter, elevated at the RNA and protein level, are both particularly interesting because recent studies have shown that the HIF-dependent lactate axis drives resistance against ferroptosis in the context of cancer36. Another notable known HIF target is Ndufa4l2, which is upregulated by hypoxia both at the RNA and protein levels. It encodes a component of the electron transport chain that dampens its activity as a protective mechanism37,38, which may be particularly relevant in the setting of PFF toxicity as it is known to affect mitochondria. a, Volcano plot showing the log2 fold change of transcripts in the SN 12 weeks after striatal injection of PFF versus α-syn monomer in mice breathing 21% O2, plotted against the −log10(Padj).

Significance is indicated using Padj calculated in the DESeq2 analysis of all genes (that is, DESeq2 Wald test with multiple testing correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure). e, Box plot showing HIF targets upregulated in the SN of mice breathing 11% O2. The box plots are annotated with the adjusted P values calculated in the DESeq2 analysis of all genes (that is, DESeq2 Wald test with multiple testing correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure). f, Box plot showing HIF target proteins upregulated in the SN of mice breathing 11% O2. Box plots are annotated with the adjusted P values calculated in the differential expression analysis of all proteins using limma (that is, a two-tailed moderated t-test with multiple testing correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure). To determine the long-term effects of breathing 11% O2 in the PD model, motor function was examined using the pole and cage hang tests in a cohort of mice that breathed 21% or 11% O2 for 10 months after injection of PFF or α-syn monomer (Fig. Continuously breathing 11% O2 for 10 months after injection of α-syn PFF was well tolerated and remained beneficial; breathing 11% O2 for 10 months prevented PFF-induced prolongation of latency in the pole test and tended to prevent PFF-induced shortening of latency in the cage hang test (Fig. While body weight was lighter in mice breathing hypoxia than mice breathing normoxia, there was no correlation between the body weight of mice and latency of either test (Extended Data Fig. HIF targets involved in vasculogenesis, including Vegfa, Kdr and Adm, remained upregulated in the SN after breathing 11% O2 for 10 months, suggesting robust impact of HIF-dependent signaling after chronic hypoxia breathing (Fig. These observations support the protective effects of continuously breathing 11% O2 at least up to 10 months after α-syn aggregation. a, Schematic depicting the experimental groups and timeline. b,c, Results of the pole (b) and cage hang (c) tests in mice treated with PFF or α-syn monomer and exposed to 21% or 11% O2 for 10 months. d, Relative gene expression levels of Vegfa, Kdr and Adm in the SN of mice treated with PFF or α-syn monomer and exposed to 21% or 11% O2 for 10 months. b–d, A two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's correction for post-hoc comparisons was conducted. Data are presented as box plots showing the median value and IQR, with the whiskers denoting the maximum and minimum values. To determine if hypoxia rescue of α-syn-induced neurodegeneration is evolutionarily conserved, we analyzed a well-established C. elegans system in which overexpression of human α-syn causes age-dependent loss of DA neurons39,40. We compared strains expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone (wild-type (WT)) or GFP and α-syn in DA neurons and grew animals continuously in either 21% or 1% O2, a condition previously shown to rescue certain forms of complex I dysfunction in C. elegans22. In animals grown in 21% O2, at day 7 of adulthood, α-syn expression caused 38.1% of animals to have completely lost at least one DA neuron, compared to 8.75% in WT animals (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. One percent O2 reduced α-syn-induced neurodegeneration by half, demonstrating a protective effect (Fig. Interestingly, the level of α-syn-induced neurodegeneration at 1% O2 was not significantly different from WT animals grown in 1% O2, suggesting that 1% O2 may increase basal-age-related DA neurodegeneration. Taken together, the C. elegans results further support our model that α-syn expression induces MCI dysfunction that can be alleviated by hypoxia. a, Schematic depicting the experimental groups and timeline. b, Percentage of C. elegans in which at least one DA cephalic (CEP) neuron is absent at day 7 of adulthood. Each point represents one cohort in which approximately 30 animals were analyzed (the number of C. elegans in each group was 21% O2, GFP (n = 80); 21% O2, α-syn (n = 84); 1% O2, GFP (n = 82); and 1% O2, α-syn (n = 81)). b, Data are presented as a box plot showing the median and IQR, with the whiskers denoting the maximum and minimum values. A Fisher's exact test was conducted to compare each of two groups with a two-sided P value. Having observed the prevention of PFF-induced neurotoxicity and motor deficits by breathing 11% O2, we next investigated whether normobaric hypoxia could halt or even reverse the loss of DA neurons and the progression of movement disorders. For this experiment, the first group of mice received α-syn monomer in the right striatum and breathed 21% O2 for 12 weeks (monomer, normoxia-normoxia (mon, Nx-Nx)). Other mice received PFF injection in the right striatum and breathed 21% O2 for 6 weeks; then, they were divided into three groups (Fig. The second group was euthanized at 6 weeks after PFF injection for tissue collection (PFF, Nx). The third group continued to breathe 21% O2 for another 6 weeks for a total of 12 weeks (PFF, Nx-Nx). The fourth group breathed 11% O2 starting 6 weeks after PFF injection for another 6 weeks (PFF, normoxia-hypoxia (Nx-Hx)). The pole and cage hang tests were performed every 2 weeks in ‘PFF, Nx-Nx' and ‘PFF, Nx-Hx' mice for 12 weeks until euthanized for tissue collection. In addition, the OFT was conducted at 12 weeks after injection in ‘mon, Nx-Nx', ‘PFF, Nx-Nx' and ‘PFF, Nx-Hx' mice, and at 6 weeks after injection in ‘PFF, Nx' mice. However, while motor function continued to worsen in ‘PFF, Nx-Nx' mice, it returned to baseline in ‘PFF, Nx-Hx' mice during the subsequent 6 weeks of breathing 11% O2. In the OFT, the time spent in the inner zone did not change in mice that breathed 21% O2 for 6 weeks (PFF, Nx), but markedly decreased in mice that continued to breathe 21% O2 for 12 weeks after PFF injection (PFF, Nx-Nx). In contrast, breathing 11% O2 from 6 weeks after PFF injection prevented the reduction of the time spent in the inner zone (PFF, Nx-Hx) (Fig. The total distance covered by mice was not affected by PFF injection or breathing 11% O2 (Fig. Breathing 11% O2 starting 6 weeks after PFF injection decreased body weight and increased hemoglobin levels in ‘PFF, Nx-Hx' mice compared to ‘PFF, Nx-Nx' mice (Extended Data Fig. There was no correlation between body weight and the results of the pole and cage hang tests (Extended Data Fig. The number of LB-like inclusions in the SNpc increased similarly among the three groups that received PFF, suggesting that the number of LB-like inclusions had already plateaued 6 weeks after PFF injection (Fig. The number of TH+ neurons in the SNpc did not change in mice that breathed 21% O2 for 6 weeks, but significantly decreased in mice that continued to breathe 21% O2 for 12 weeks after PFF injection (PFF, Nx-Nx) compared to monomer-treated mice that breathed 21% O2 (mon, Nx-Nx) (Fig. In contrast, breathing 11% O2 starting 6 weeks after PFF injection (PFF, Nx-Hx) mitigated loss of TH+ neurons. These results suggest that breathing 11% O2 after the development of movement disorders and formation of LB-like inclusions can reverse motor symptoms and prevent further loss of TH+ dopamine neurons in the SNpc after PFF injection. a, Schematic depicting the experimental groups and time course. b,c, Results of pole (b) and cage hang (c) tests in mice that had a PFF injection in the ‘PFF, Nx-Nx' and ‘PFF, Nx-Hx' groups. b,c, A two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's correction for post-hoc comparisons was conducted.

The current study reports that breathing chronic normobaric hypoxia (11% O2) not only prevents but also reverses motor deficits in a PD mouse model subjected to striatal injection of α-syn PFF. Immediate initiation of hypoxia treatment upon PFF injection prevents loss of TH+ DA neurons. Delayed initiation of hypoxia treatment halts neuronal loss, which is sufficient to restore motor function and prevent the development of anxiety-like behavior in PFF-injected mice. These observations suggest that it is possible to reverse motor and non-motor symptoms even if the treatment is started after LB-like inclusions have accumulated in the SNpc and symptoms become clinically evident, a situation that more closely recapitulates a treatment scenario in human PD. To the best of our knowledge, hypoxia is the only intervention that not only prevents, but also reverses, neurological defects in this model. Hypoxia does not prevent the formation of α-syn aggregates. Rather, hypoxia confers neuroprotection in the face of these aggregates. This hypothesis is supported by the remarkable reversal of motor symptoms and prevention of further loss of DA neurons by breathing 11% O2 from 6 weeks after PFF injection, when the number of LB-like inclusions had already plateaued at the maximum level detected. Reducing α-syn levels or targeting α-syn aggregates has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target. However, there are concerns that reducing levels of α-syn can have detrimental consequences because of its physiological role in the synaptic vesicle endocytic and exocytic cycles. The data in this study suggest a treatment according to which loss of dopamine neurons can be prevented without having to target α-syn aggregation. The ability of hypoxia to protect against the toxicity of α-syn is evolutionarily conserved in C. elegans overexpressing α-syn. While breathing 1% O2 on its own increased basal-age-related DA neurodegeneration, in the context of chronic hypoxia, overexpressed α-syn does not cause further toxicity on DA neurons. This result is analogous to what we have reported in the context of certain complex I mutants22 and frataxin loss41; both of these sets of mutants are also rescued by hypoxia in worms and in C. elegans. We have proposed that the ability of hypoxia to rescue certain mutants is analogous to the concept of temperature sensitivity42; by analogy, we find that in normoxia, α-syn aggregates form and are toxic to neurons, but that hypoxia creates a ‘permissive' environment in which α-syn aggregates are no longer toxic, that is, α-syn aggregates and hypoxia are epistatic with each other. While the precise mechanisms responsible for the toxicity of α-syn aggregates to neurons remain an unsolved problem, many prior studies have shown that PFF-induced α-syn aggregation compromises the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in DA neurons of the SNpc11,43. Because more than 90% of oxygen is consumed by mitochondria, unused oxygen is theorized to accumulate when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired. Classic studies have shown that patients with inherited mitochondrial disease can exhibit tissue hyperoxia because of poor oxygen extraction, especially during exercise32. In fact, we previously reported hyperoxia in the vestibular nucleus and striatum of the Ndufs4−/− mice breathing 21% O2. In this study, we uncovered that α-syn aggregation induced brain tissue hyperoxia in the SNpc of mice. It will be interesting to determine whether brain hyperoxia is also a feature of human PD. Although tissue hyperoxia could be a direct consequence of respiratory chain impairment and oxygen use, we acknowledge that there could be other mechanistic bases (for example, changes in vascularity, low neuronal and hence metabolic activity, changes in pH leading to more O2 offloading). Regardless, the brain tissue hyperoxia observed in the SNpc of mice breathing 21% O2 that also had PFF-induced α-syn aggregation supports the notion that high oxygen itself may be mediating the neurotoxic effects of α-syn aggregates. α-Syn aggregation induces neuronal iron accumulation in the SNpc35. Our RNA-seq results, which revealed upregulation of Tfrc and Fpn by PFF and breathing 11% O2, support the potential role of iron accumulation in PD pathogenesis. Along this line, a recent study using a nonhuman primate model of PD reported that intranasal administration of α-syn PFF increased iron deposition and protein levels of TFR1 (encoded by Tfrc) and FPN in DA neurons in the SN of Macaca fascicularis44. We speculate that the combination of iron accumulation and tissue hyperoxia can jointly lead to neuronal toxicity via Fenton chemistry, which contributes to lipid peroxidation. IRP2 is a key posttranscriptional regulator in the iron starvation pathway including TFR1 and FPN. We previously reported that genetic ablation of FBXL5, the ubiquitin ligase that targets IRP2 for degradation, is tolerated in hypoxia but not normoxia41. Hence, activation of this pathway in normoxia is detrimental. Moreover, recent CRISPR genetic screens and cancer literature revealed that cells with compromised MCI are particularly susceptible to loss of GPX4, the key phospholipid hydroperoxidase that guards against death caused by lipid peroxidation33,34. The inhibition of tissue hyperoxia and lipid peroxidation by breathing 11% O2 for 6 weeks in PFF-treated mice further supports the critical pathogenic role of tissue hyperoxia that is probably induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition to directly attenuating brain tissue hyperoxia, the protective effects of hypoxia breathing may be mediated by inhibition of lipid peroxidation through the activation of HIF-dependent signaling. In fact, strong upregulation of HIF targets was observed in our RNA-seq and corroborated using either TMT proteomics or RT–qPCR in separate cohorts of mice that breathed hypoxia for 3 or 10 months. A recent study showed that HIF1α-induced lactate contributes to the resistance to lipid peroxidation of solid tumors in a pH-dependent manner36. Upregulation of Ldha and Slc16a3 (Mct4) support this hypothesis given their roles in lactate generation and transport. We also note that the HIF targets Ndufa4l2 is elevated by hypoxia, according to evidence both at the RNA and protein level. It has been reported to modulate mitochondrial electron transport chain activity and ROS production as a protective mechanism37. Our data support the notion that both HIF-dependent and HIF-independent mechanisms may be at play in conferring the observed neuroprotection. This study has some limitations. We used the entire SN tissue, not the SNpc, for our RNA-seq, TMT proteomics, RT–qPCR and MDA assay because of the technical difficulty of selectively collecting the SNpc from mouse brains. Although DA neurons are concentrated in the SNpc, it is possible that the signals we observed may not reflect changes specific to DA neurons. Future studies using single-cell or single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis may enable further characterization of the mechanism of hypoxia rescue. In addition, unbiased transcriptomic analysis was performed after a relatively short follow-up (that is, 12 weeks) after PFF injection in the current study. A longer follow-up after PFF injection may reveal additional pathological signals, such as neuroinflammation and blockade of autophagy45. Lastly, efficacy and the possible untoward effects of hypoxia remain to be further examined especially in models of age-dependent neurodegeneration. Our work may help to reconcile longstanding epidemiological observations for PD. One of the strongest (and troubling) epidemiological associations for PD is the protective effects of long-term, heavy smoking on the risk of developing PD46. Although multiple mechanisms have been put forward, we note that heavy smoking is associated with elevation in carbon monoxide (CO) levels (evidenced by high carboxyhemoglobin), which can slow down oxygen delivery. In fact, we have previously shown that sublethal doses of CO are protective in genetic MCI models of Leigh syndrome47. It is tempting to speculate that one of the reasons why heavy smoking is protective is because of mild reduction of oxygen delivery induced by smoking CO. There is growing interest in the role of hypoxia in PD, both as a pathogenic mechanism and as a potential therapy48. The beneficial effects of hypoxia breathing in PD have been suggested based on a few anecdotal reports of patient experiences at high altitude23 and hypothetical benefits of intermittent hypoxia breathing in other neurological disorders, presumably via the activation of HIF signaling49,50. Along the line of the latter, a protocol for a clinical trial to study the effects of intermittent hypoxia breathing in individuals with PD has been published51. Because our RNA-seq and proteomics results showed upregulation of several HIF-dependent genes in the SN of mice breathing 11% O2, it is possible that the beneficial effects of hypoxia breathing are partially mediated via HIF-dependent mechanisms. Alternatively, it is also conceivable that chronic continuous hypoxia breathing prevents and reverses the progression of PD pathology through distinct mechanisms (for example, mitigating brain tissue hyperoxia) from intermittent hypoxia breathing. Our current study provides timely evidence showing robust neuroprotective effects of chronic continuous hypoxia breathing in a mouse model of PD induced by a templated conversion of endogenous α-syn to inclusions. Because chronic continuous hypoxia has been shown to be beneficial also in mouse models of Friedreich's ataxia41, multiple sclerosis52 and premature aging53, it is likely to be broadly neuroprotective via multiple mechanisms. Further preclinical studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of chronic hypoxia breathing, including the optimal concentrations of hypoxic gas mixtures, longer durations of exposure and the effects of hypoxia at different disease stages. These results motivate more research into the effects of chronic continuous hypoxia breathing42, or pharmacological strategies that reduce oxygen delivery54, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies to prevent and even halt the progression of PD. All animal experimentation was approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We used 14–17-week-old, age-matched and weight-matched male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory). The design of experiments involving animals followed the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. To minimize variability, we used a randomized paired (matched pairs) design. Mouse α-syn synthesis and purification was performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham as described previously55. The α-syn protein underwent endotoxin removal with Pierce High-Capacity Endotoxin Removal Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The amount of endotoxin in the purified α-syn was determined using the Pierce Chromogenic Endotoxin Quant Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and confirmed to be below the threshold of 5 EU mg−1. The concentration of monomeric α-syn was measured using absorbance at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 7,450 M−1cm−1. Fibrils were generated by incubating monomeric α-syn (300 μM, 5 mg ml−1) in 150 mM KCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl at 37 °C with constant agitation for 7 days56. To determine the resulting concentration of α-syn, 5 μl of fibrils were incubated with 8 M guanidinium chloride to dissociate the fibrils into monomer; the concentration was measured via NanoDrop. Fibrils were brought to 5 mg ml−1 with the aforementioned buffer and 25-μl aliquots of fibrils were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. Before injecting, the fibril aliquots were thawed and sonicated in volumes of 22–25 μl per tube using a Qsonica 700 W cup horn sonicator system. The pre-optimized sonication program runs at 30% amplitude for 15 min in a 3 s ON/2 s OFF cycle, for a total sonication time of 30 min. A recirculating water chiller system with filter was used to maintain the temperature of the water bath during sonication at 15 °C. The size of sonicated fibrils was measured to ensure proper fragmentation28 using dynamic light scattering on a DynaPro NanoStar Dynamic Light Scattering Detector (Wyatt Technology). Sufficient fragmentation of the fibrils is essential in the fibril model to induce α-syn seeding and subsequent formation of α-syn inclusions. Using a sample of the sonicated PFFs diluted 1:500 in 1× Dulbecco's PBS, five measurements consisting of ten averaged acquisitions each were calculated to assess sample quality and estimate fibril fragment length. The desired size range of the fibrils for optimal seeding was between 20 and 70 nm. The average size of the sonicated fibrils for each experiment was between 25 and 50 nm. Sonicated fibrils were snap-frozen in 25-μl aliquots and shipped on dry ice overnight to Harvard where they were kept at −80 °C until the day of use. Before injection of monomeric α-syn, protein was thawed on ice, spun at 20,000g at 4 °C and kept on ice until injected. Only the supernatant from the α-syn monomer was injected and any post-centrifugation pellet was avoided. At 3–4 months of age, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane on a stereotaxic frame (MM-8000/3, ASI instruments). Animals were unilaterally injected with 2 μl of 300 μM sonicated fibrils, or 300 μM monomeric α-syn as a control, into the right striatum. Solutions were injected at a constant rate of 0.5 μl min−1 and the needle was left in place for 2 min; this was followed by slowly withdrawing the needle. All mice survived after stereotaxic injection of α-syn monomer or PFF and were used for the following experiment with breathing 21% or 11% O2. Mice that breathed 21% or 11% O2 were housed in cages kept inside transparent acrylic boxes. O2 levels were monitored daily using an O2 sensor (MiniOX 1, Ohio Medical Corporation). CO2 concentrations inside the chamber were kept below 0.8% (monitored using an Extech CO200 Monitor, Extech Instruments) using soda lime (Sodasorb, Smiths Medical). Temperature (24–26 °C), humidity (30–70%) and light cycle (12 h light–dark) were maintained. Mice were allowed to freely access food and drinking water bottles. To examine whether hypoxia treatment prevented neurodegeneration and behavior disorders after injection of PFF, mice started to breathe 21% or 11% O2 in a chamber 1 h after the injection of α-syn monomer or PFF (Fig. To examine whether hypoxia treatment halted or reversed neurodegeneration and behavior disorders, mice were housed in a chamber with 21% O2 for 6 weeks starting 1 h after the injection of α-syn monomer or PFF and were either kept breathing 21% O2 or transferred to a chamber with 11% O2 for the following 6 weeks. Eleven cohorts of mice were studied as shown in Supplementary Table 1. Three mice in the 10-month cohort were euthanized because of limb injury from fighting after injection of PFF and were excluded from the statistical analysis. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS via the left ventricle to collect whole brains. After further fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 h, brains were sent to NeuroScience Associates. Brains were treated overnight with 20% glycerol and 2% dimethylsulfoxide to prevent freeze artifacts. Specimens were then embedded in a gelatin matrix using the MultiBrain/MultiCord technology (NeuroScience Associates). Blocks were rapidly frozen, after curing by immersion in 2-methylbutane chilled with crushed dry ice and mounted on a freezing stage of an AO 860 sliding microtome. All sections were cut through the entire length of the specimen segment and collected sequentially into series of 24 containers. All containers contained Antigen Preserve solution (50% PBS, pH 7.0, 50% ethylene glycol, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone); no sections were discarded. For immunohistochemistry, free-floating sections were stained with the desired stain. All incubation solutions from the primary antibody onward used Tris-buffered saline with Triton X-100 as the vehicle; all rinses were with Tris-buffered saline. After hydrogen peroxide treatment, sections were immunostained with the primary antibodies for α-syn phosphorylated at Ser129 (1:18,000 dilution, cat. 010-26481, Wako Chemicals) or TH (1:15,000 dilution, cat. p40101, Pel-Freez Biologicals) overnight at room temperature. Vehicle solutions contained Triton X-100 for permeabilization. After the rinses, a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution for TH, cat. We did not use the secondary antibody for α-syn phosphorylated at Ser129 because the primary antibody was already biotinylated. After further rinses, Vector Laboratories ABC solution (avidin–biotin–horseradish peroxidase complex; details in the instructions for VECTASTAIN Elite ABC, Vector Laboratories) was applied. Sections were again rinsed, then treated with DAB with hydrogen peroxide for TH or DAB with hydrogen peroxide and nickel(II) sulfate for α-syn phosphorylated at Ser129 to create a visible reaction product. After further rinses, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, air-dried and run through the following sequences for Nissl counterstaining. For the thionine Nissl counterstain on TH, slides were fixed with 95% ethanol/formaldehyde and then rehydrated before incubation in thionine (thionine/acetate buffer, pH 4.5). For Neutral Red counterstaining on α-syn pSer129, slides were rehydrated and then placed into the Neutral Red solution (neutral red/acetate buffer, pH 4.5). After counterstaining, slides were dehydrated in alcohol, cleared in xylene and coverslipped using Permount Mounting Medium. Bright-field images were acquired using an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon Instruments). Image analysis was performed by an experimenter blinded to the identity of the images analyzed using ImageJ v.1.53k. The deposition score of phosphorylated α-syn in SN was evaluated using previously reported scoring criteria28. Results are reported as the average of the analyzed 2–4 sections of each biological replicate. To assess the loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, the number of TH+ and Nissl+ cells in the SN was counted using stereological analysis as described below. Unbiased stereology was conducted to count TH+ and Nissl+ neurons in the SNpc region by a researcher blinded to the experimental conditions and groups. Quantitative analysis was performed using an Olympus BX51 bright-field microscope to examine 40-μm-thick brain sections containing the SNpc. Sections at the anteroposterior coordinates, relative to bregma, were between −2.92 mm and −3.64 mm. An average of six sections containing the area of interest, spaced 160 μm apart, were included and stained to identify TH+ cells in the SNpc. Quantification was performed using an Optical Fractionator probe (Stereo Investigator v.2021, MBF Bioscience). The sampling parameters for each section were established as follows: a section thickness of 40 µm and an evaluation interval of six sections. At ×40 magnification, the remaining parameters necessary for stereological analysis were set: a counting frame of 50 × 50 µm, a mounted thickness of 33 µm, a grid size of 100 × 100 µm and an optical dissector height of 22 µm. Quantification variability, as assessed using the Schmitz–Hof coefficient of error, was below 0.270 for all animals across experimental groups, with a median of 0.065 and a mean of 0.0737. Behavioral tests were conducted between 8:00 and 12:00 for the pole test and the cage hang test or 12:00 and 17:00 for the OFT considering circadian rhythm, as reported previously29,58. To conduct the pole test, a vertical metal pole with 2-cm diameter and 40-cm length was placed on the floor of a housing cage. To conduct the cage hang test, a metal wire frame of the housing cage (WBL7115SMD-AMG, Allentown) was placed approximately 40 cm above the cage floor. Mice were hung on the metal wire frame and the time needed to drop onto the cage floor was measured. Each test was conducted five times and the average of the last three trials was used for the analysis. We performed the OFT to evaluate motor function and behavior across treatment groups. The OFT apparatus consisted of four boxes measuring 50 × 50 cm each. In addition to the opaque black walls of each field, the whole apparatus was surrounded by a 1.5-m wall to reduce outside interferences, such as air drafts or visual distractions. An indirect light source was used to ensure even and dim illumination of all fields. Mice were kept in the procedural room for at least 60 min before testing. A maximum of four mice were tested simultaneously. Mice were then allowed to explore the field for 15 min. During the test, an overhead camera was used to record each mouse with the ANY-maze software v.7.3 (Stoelting). The ANY-maze software was used to automatically track and analyze the animals' positions. Before and after each test run, all surfaces of the apparatus were wiped with 70% ethanol and left to air-dry. Experimenters were blinded to the treatment groups. Heatmaps showing integration of the movement trace from all mice in each group were created with R v.4.3.2 (packages: tidyverse, ggpubr). To detect ferric and ferrous iron in the brain, Perls-DAB staining was performed59. Three sections containing the SNpc were processed for each biological replicate. Sections were rinsed in deionized H2O (dH2O) then placed in a freshly prepared (1:1) 2% HCl and 2% potassium ferrocyanide solution. Sections were again rinsed, then treated with a DAB solution (0.05% DAB and 0.011% hydrogen peroxide) to amplify the Perls reaction product. After further rinses, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, then air-dried. The mounted slides were then counterstained with a light thionine (Nissl) counterstain. Slides were then stained in a thionine solution made in an acetate buffer (pH 4.5), rinsed in dH2O and visually assessed. After the dH2O rinses, slides were dehydrated in alcohol, cleared in xylene and coverslipped with Permount Mounting Medium. Bright-field images were acquired using an Eclipse 80i microscope. Image analysis was performed by an experimenter blinded to the identity of the images analyzed using the QuPath (v.0.3.2) software. Color deconvolution was performed to separate Nissl from the Perls-DAB signal60. The SNpc area was manually annotated by an experimenter blinded to the identity of the images using a brain atlas of the mouse as a ref. Perls-DAB was quantified by thresholding the DAB signal using ImageJ (v.1.53k), with a threshold of 220. Results are reported as the average of the analyzed three sections of each biological replicate. Rectal temperature was kept at 37 °C using a heating pad seated under the mouse during the whole procedure. Mice were placed in a prone position with the head stabilized using a stereotaxic frame. After incision and dissection of the skin, an opening in the skull was created on the ipsilateral side of the PFF or monomer injection using a Micro-Drill (MD-1200, Braintree Scientific). We measured the concentration of MDA in the SN to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on lipid peroxidation using a commercially available kit (cat. RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing was conducted at Azenta Life Sciences. Total RNA was extracted from dissected fresh-frozen SN samples using the QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA integrity was checked using the Agilent Technologies TapeStation 4200. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina using the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Briefly, mRNAs were initially enriched with Oligod(dT) beads. Enriched mRNAs were fragmented for 15 min at 94 °C. First-strand and second-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was subsequently synthesized. cDNA fragments were end-repaired and adenylated at the 3′ ends; universal adapters were ligated to the cDNA fragments, followed by index addition and library enrichment using PCR with 13 cycles. The sequencing library was validated on the Agilent TapeStation and quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer, as well as by qPCR (KAPA Biosystems). The sequencing libraries were clustered on a flowcell. Samples were sequenced using a 2× 150-bp paired-end configuration to at least 20 million reads per sample (median = 27 M reads). Image analysis and base calling were conducted using the Control software. Raw sequence data (.bcl files) generated by the sequencer were converted into .fastq files and demultiplexed using the Illumina bcl2fastq v.2.17 software. One mismatch was allowed for index sequence identification. Read quality was verified using FastQC61 (v.0.11.9); then, the reads were processed using a custom bulk RNA-seq processing pipeline. First, any rDNA-derived transcripts remaining after poly(A) selection were filtered out by aligning the reads to the mouse rDNA reference and annotation (GenBank ID: BK000964.3) with STAR aligner62 (v.2.7.5a), keeping only the unaligned reads. After this in silico rRNA depletion step, STAR was used again to align the remaining reads to the mouse reference genome (mm10 with GENCODE annotation v.M24) with the parameters --outSAMattributes NH HI NM MD AS XS nM and --twopassMode Basic. Next, for any reads that mapped equally well to the nuclear and mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial alignment was set as the primary alignment. Then, duplicate reads were removed with the Picard MarkDuplicates tool63,64 (Picard v.2.21.9, as distributed in the Genome Analysis Toolkit v.4.1.5.0-9-g227bef6-SNAPSHOT); reads were assigned to genes using featureCounts (v.2.0.1)65 with the parameters -p, -M, and --primary. The SAMTools suite (v.1.12)66 was used throughout to manipulate, sort and filter the sequencing data in BAM format. After all samples made it through the pipeline, the read counts per gene were aggregated from the featureCounts output files into a single read count matrix with a row for each sample and a column for each gene for downstream analysis. The raw count matrix was joined with the metadata about the samples and genes using anndata (v.0.7.5)67; scanpy (v.1.8.1)68 was used to conduct a principal components analysis (PCA). Raw counts were first normalized using TPM, then log-scaled with the scanpy.pp.log1p function. The gene list was filtered to only contain protein-coding genes; then, highly variable genes were identified with the scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes function with min_mean = 1.25, max_mean = 7 and min_disp = 1.5. This initial PCA highlighted some outliers, so an iterative procedure of removing outliers and updating the PCA was used until there were no outliers dominating the variance in principal components 1 or 2. Six of 48 samples were removed in this way. In addition, the PCA analysis revealed a batch effect that was associated with the date on which mice were euthanized. The ComBat-seq69 tool (loaded with R v.4.0.5, via the sva v.3.38.0 package) was applied on the 42 non-outlier samples to adjust for the batch effect, while specifying the O2 status (hypoxia or normoxia) and injection type (PFF or monomer) as additional covariates to preserve the signal associated with our experimental variables. A final PCA on the batch-corrected count matrix returned by ComBat-seq confirmed that the batch effects were successfully mitigated (Extended Data Fig. After PCA, DESeq2 (v.1.30.1)70 was used to test all protein-coding genes for differential expression across our experimental conditions. This was accomplished by using the batch-corrected count matrix as the input and applying DESeq2 with a single categorical ‘experimental condition' covariate that combined each sample's oxygen status and injection type. The resulting DESeq2 model was used to compare the samples from each of our four experimental conditions: monomer air; monomer hypoxia; PFF air; and PFF hypoxia. Genes were called differentially expressed if they had a Padj < 0.05 and log2 fold change > 0.25 (Supplementary Table 2). Mass spectrometry proteomics experiments were performed by the ThermoFisher Center for Multiplexed Proteomics at Harvard Medical School, using methods that have been previously described for sample preparation, phosphopeptide enrichment, reverse phase separation, tandem mass spectrometry and protein identification71,72,73,74,75,76,77. More details on TMT sample acquisition and initial mass spectrometry data processing are available in the metadata of our PRIDE repository submission with the PXD063553 dataset identifier (see Data availability). Column-sum-normalized data were assembled with the sample metadata into an annotated data object (AnnData v.0.9.1) in Python (v.3.10.11); Scanpy (v.1.9.3) was used for the initial analysis. Normalized data were log-transformed using scanpy.pp.log1p with default parameters; highly variable proteins were detected using scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes, with min_mean = 0, max_mean = 10 and min_disp = 0.5; then, data were z-score-scaled using scanpy.pp.scale, with zero_center = True. Next, scaled data were used in the PCA, using scanpy.tl.pca, with n_comps = 15, random_state = 2 and use_highly_variable = True. We removed these three outliers, recomputed the PCA and verified that none of the other samples were outliers and that they clustered according to experimental condition when plotting principal component 1 versus principal component 2. Next, we performed differential expression analysis using limma (v.3.54.0)78 in R (v.4.2.0). We loaded the column sum-normalized data into R, log2-transformed it after adding one to all values and applied a median normalization across samples using the limma's function normalizeMedianValues. We used the lm.fit function to fit a linear model based on a simple formula of ~condition − 1, where condition is a factor containing four levels representing our experimental conditions: monomer treatment in normoxia; monomer treatment in hypoxia; PFF treatment in normoxia; and PFF treatment in hypoxia. We used limma contrasts to extract the differential expression results for individual comparisons, using the makeContrasts, contrasts.fit and eBayes functions for each comparison to create the contrast matrix, fit the model using that contrast and perform empirical Bayes smoothing, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). Total RNA was extracted from the SN tissues using TRIzol and phase separation, followed by column purification using the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (cat. Reverse transcription was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (cat. 4374967, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR reactions were performed using TaqMan and standard amplification protocols on the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to 18S or Gapdh and calculated using the ΔΔCt method. TaqMan probes for 18S (Mm03928990_g1), Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1), Vegfa (Mm01281449_m1), Kdr (Mm01222421_m1), Adm (Mm00437438_g1), Iba1 (Mm00479862_g1), Tfrc (Mm01344477_g1), Slc16a3 (Mm00446102_m1) and Slc40a1 (Mm01254822_m1) were used for the qPCR reactions. Strains BY200: Is[dat-1p::gfp] and UA44: baIn11[Pdat-1::alpha-syn + Pdat-1::gfp] were maintained on nematode growth medium seeded with Escherichia coli strain OP50. Strains were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (no. Animals were grown in 21% or 1% oxygen using a hypoxic in vitro cabinet (Coy Laboratory Products) at room temperature for many generations before the experiment. To measure DA neurodegeneration, 50 L4 stage animals were picked to fresh nematode growth medium plates; worms were moved to fresh plates every day until no longer producing progeny. Seven days after picking L4 stage animals, animals were picked into a 1-μl drop of sodium azide on a microscope slide with an agar pad (2% low electroendosmosis agarose in M9). Immediately after sodium azide paralysis, worms were gently covered with a coverslip and imaged and scored using a ZEISS Axio Imager Z1 microscope equipped with a ZEISS AxioCam HRc digital camera. GFP-tagged CEP neurons in the head of each animal were scored as ‘intact', ‘degenerating' or ‘missing' based on the presence or absence of a clear cell boundary and intensity of GFP. Neurons were scored as ‘missing' when not visible according to GFP. Representative images of intact and degenerating neurons in the 21% oxygen condition were captured. Approximately 30 worms were analyzed per condition and repeated in triplicate for a total of at least 80 worms scored per strain and per condition. A one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's, Šídák's or Dunnett's correction for post-hoc comparisons was used. A Fisher's exact test was conducted to compare two groups with a two-sided P value in the study of C. elegans. A two-tailed t-test was used to compare two groups. Compared groups are shown as box plots or mean values with s.e. A Pearson correlation coefficient (r) with two-tailed hypothesis was conducted for correlation. Significance was considered at P < 0.05. Prism v.10.3.1 (GraphPad Software) was used for the statistical analysis. Differential expression testing was conducted using DESeq2 (v.1.30.1 with R v.4.0.5) for the RNA-seq data, and limma (v.3.54.0 with R v.4.2.0) for the TMT proteomics data. To minimize variability, we used a randomized paired (matched pairs) design. We paired mice to two or more treatment groups on the basis of similar weight, age, delivery date and, when possible, holding cage. After pairing, mice were randomly assigned to the experimental groups by an investigator who did not perform the experiments. Investigators were blinded to group assignment when performing the behavioral tests, sample collections, DA neuron counting and histological analysis. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications28,80. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. For the histological analysis, the mean value from multiple brain sections (2–4 sections for α-syn phosphorylated at Ser129 and Perls-DAB staining) in each biological replicate was used for the statistical analysis. For the stereological analysis to count TH+ neurons, 5–7 brain sections were analyzed in each biological replicate. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article. The RNA-seq data discussed in this publication have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus81 and are accessible through accession no. The RNA-seq data were aligned to the mm10 mouse genome and transcript counts were assessed using the GENCODE v.M24 genome annotation. The mass spectra generated in the TMT proteomics experiment were searched against the mouse UniProt database downloaded in May 2021 (release 2021_04). Source data are provided with this paper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has slipped laterally a total of 450 km in its lifetime but was previously believed to have been inactive for at least 40 million years. However, using new high-resolution topographic data collected from satellites, airplanes and drones, researchers have identified a 130-km-long segment of the fault near Dawson City where there is evidence of numerous large earthquakes in the much more recent geologic past (the Quaternary Period, 2.6 million years to present), indicating possible future earthquakes. Collectively, these records only cover the last couple hundred years. However, for many active faults, thousands of years can elapse between large ruptures. When earthquakes are large and/or shallow, they often rupture the Earth's surface and produce a linear feature in the landscape known as a fault scarp. These features, which can persist in the landscape for thousands of years, are typically tens to hundreds of kilometers long, but only a few metres wide and tall. Crucially, they observed that glacial landforms 2.6 million years in age are laterally offset across the fault scarp by 1000 m. Others, 132,000 years old, are laterally offset by 75 m. These findings confirm that the fault has slipped in multiple earthquakes throughout the Quaternary period, likely slipping several meters in each event. What's more, landforms known to be 12,000 years old are not offset by the fault, indicating no large ruptures have occurred since that time. "We determined that future earthquakes on the Tintina fault could exceed magnitude 7.5," says Finley. If this were to be released, it would cause a significant earthquake." An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 or greater would cause severe shaking in Dawson City and could pose a threat to nearby highways and mining infrastructure. Canada's National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) includes the potential for large earthquakes in central Yukon Territory, but the Tintina fault is not currently recognized as a discrete seismogenic fault source. The recent findings by this team will ultimately be integrated into the NSHM, which informs seismic building codes and other engineering standards that protect human lives and critical infrastructure. The findings will also be shared with local governments and emergency managers to improve earthquake readiness in their communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mainstream superfoods are typically part of the Mediterranean Diet and generally rich in natural plant compounds that are beneficial to a person's health. Pezzuto addresses the broader topic of superfoods in detail, then makes the scientific case for grapes, noting that fresh grapes are underplayed in this arena and often not included with mention of other similar foods, such as berries. Grapes are a natural source of over 1,600 compounds, including antioxidants and other polyphenols such as flavonoids, anthocyanidins, catechins, phenolic acids, resveratrol, and more. Polyphenols are credited with the health benefits of grapes, via antioxidant activity and influencing cellular processes. Over sixty peer-reviewed studies have been published in the scientific literature on grapes and health. The role of grapes on cardiovascular health is well established, including promoting relaxation of blood vessels and healthy circulation, as well as modulating cholesterol levels. Clinical trials also show that grapes support brain health (help maintain healthy brain metabolism and beneficial impacts on cognition), skin health (enhanced resistance to UV radiation and DNA damage in skin cells), gut health (modulating the gut microbiome and increasing diversity in the gut), and eye health (retinal impact via increase in macular pigment optical density). "Dr. Pezzuto shows that based on the science, grapes are indeed a superfood, and should be recognized as such," said Ian LeMay, president of the California Table Grape Commission, "and we are hopeful that using this nomenclature in association with grapes becomes common practice.
