One of the victims of a viral brawl that happened in Cincinnati July 26 says she's been forced into hiding after the incident that left her severely injured. The victim, who is identified only as "Holly," appeared on "The Benny Show" Wednesday and revealed she's had to hire security and temporarily relocate after she was beaten. "So I've had to have security crew and go into a super-secret spot, which we allowed the security guys to come into today," Holly said. While discussing her injuries, Holly said she won't know the extent of those injuries until after healing from a concussion, adding that doctors are concerned there might be some neurological damage. She added some of the damage might be permanent. "I have giant welts all over my body. My neck, you know, right now I don't have it, but I've been wearing an airport neck pillow because I didn't wanna wear a complete neck brace, so I can try and strengthen the neck muscles," she said. So, I literally have to just walk around and hold my head up." "Yeah, they said 25% of the time, people die instantly when they hit their head like that," Holly said, repeating what doctors told her. "And then there's another 25% to 40% chance that I could have, like, gone into a coma and been a vegetable my whole life." (L-R) Jermaine Matthews, Dominique Kittle, DeKyra Vernon, Montianez Merriweather, Patrick Rosemond and Aisha Devaughn are facing various charges for their alleged roles in the viral beatdown in Cincinnati July 26, 2025. Police in Cincinnati on Wednesday announced officers have arrested a sixth suspect allegedly linked to the July 26 brawl. Devaughn was arrested by the Cincinnati Police Department's Fugitive Apprehension Unit. Several individuals can be seen punching and kicking the victims, with one woman being knocked unconscious and lying in the street. Authorities have also arrested Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, and Dominique Kittle, 37, for their alleged roles in the brutal brawl. Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge said that only one witness called 911 out of 100 people. Aisha Devaughn was arrested and charged with felonious assault and aggravated riot for her alleged role in a July 26 brawl in Cincinnati Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2025. A fundraiser set up for Holly has raised over $500,000. Actor Charlie Sheen is among those who donated. "My Ohio connections run deep, and what happened to you will NOT be tolerated by the "true" Ohioans (like yourself), as justice will reign supreme. heal well, young lady, and know that we are all rooting for you!" Sheen wrote when making the donation, according to a post on X from Benny Johnson. Adam Sabes is a writer for Fox News Digital. Story tips can be sent to Adam.Sabes@fox.com and on Twitter @asabes10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The current Supreme Court has a decent record on free speech issues. There have been some worrisome moves, such as the Court's decision not to immediately reverse an appeals court decision that stripped activists of their right to organize street protests. But a bipartisan alliance of six justices have largely resisted efforts by states and the federal government to regulate speech. Most significantly, in Moody v. Netchoice (2024) three Republican justices — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — joined the Court's three Democrats in rejecting a Texas law that attempted to take control of content moderation at major social media sites like Facebook or YouTube. Last June, however, the Supreme Court, in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, upheld a Texas law requiring pornographic websites to verify that their users are over age 18, effectively overruling Ashcroft v. ACLU, a 2004 Supreme Court decision that struck down a virtually identical federal law. The Court's decision to uphold age-gating laws for porn sites is defensible. I wrote before oral arguments in Free Speech Coalition that some age-gating laws should be allowed, though I also said that Texas's specific law should be struck down because it is not well-crafted to survive a First Amendment challenge. The fact that the Court was willing to shrink Americans' free speech rights in Free Speech Coalition suggests that they may do so again in a future case. And a case asking the justices to do so is now before them. NetChoice v. Fitch, which is currently on the Court's “shadow docket,” concerns a Mississippi law that requires social media platforms to verify the ages of their users, and to require young people to obtain a parent or guardian's permission before they can set up an account with one of these platforms. Under existing Supreme Court precedents, this Mississippi law is clearly unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the Court's decision to abandon Ashcroft in its more recent porn case suggests that it could also abandon Brown and uphold Mississippi's social media restrictions. Fitch, in other words, is worth watching closely, not necessarily because the justices are likely to roll back First Amendment rights even further, but more so because it is the first significant First Amendment case to reach the Court since Free Speech Coalition. The Court's decision in Fitch could reveal whether Free Speech Coalition was the first phase of a broader attack on free speech, or whether the Court's recent pornography decision should be read as a one-off that applies solely to porn. It prohibits these platforms from allowing someone “who is a known minor to be an account holder unless the known minor has the express consent from a parent or guardian.” And it requires these sites to “develop and implement a strategy” to shield minors from topics such as suicide, bullying, or “illegal activity.” It's also far from clear that the Mississippi law will actually succeed in preventing any children or teenagers from setting up a social media account. Realistically, nothing prevents a child who wants to set up a YouTube account from printing out this form, forging their parent's signature, and then creating the account. It's not at all clear how social media platforms are supposed to determine who actually signed this form. Again, this isn't a particularly difficult question under Brown. Brown held that California's law restricting video game sales to minors is subject to “strict scrutiny,” the toughest legal test that courts apply in constitutional cases. The overwhelming majority of laws subject to this test are struck down. Under intermediate scrutiny, the Court said in Free Speech Coalition, “a law will survive review ‘if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests. Specifically, it claims that the law was inspired by the tragic death of a 16-year-old boy, who died by suicide after someone he met online recorded him engaging in sexual activity and then threatened to send that recording to his family. But even if you assume Mississippi's law should only be subject to intermediate scrutiny, it's hard to see how this law could possibly survive that test. As the plaintiff in Fitch, NetChoice — a trade group representing many major tech companies — argues in its brief, Mississippi's law sweeps far broader than one that simply targets online sexual predators. Under the state law, the plaintiffs' lawyers argue, young people would have to obtain their parents' permission before “‘discussing their faith in religious forums,' ‘petition[ing] their elected representatives' on X, ‘shar[ing] vacation photos' on Facebook, looking for work around the neighborhood on Nextdoor, or learning how to solve math problems on YouTube.” There is a procedural issue lurking in Fitch that the justices could latch onto if they want to delay resolution of this case. The most important thing to understand, however, is that this procedural issue could delay resolution of the Fitch case — but it can't put it off forever. And there are a ton of hugely important First Amendment questions lurking in this case. After Free Speech Coalition, are all laws that purport to protect minors from sexual speech only subject to intermediate scrutiny, even if they are as overbroad as Mississippi's? Was Free Speech Coalition solely about pornography, or does it extend to other speech that the government thinks may be harmful to minors? What about non-sexual speech, like the violent video games at issue in Brown? Does strict scrutiny still apply to laws regulating speech and art that isn't about sex? And then there's the biggest question looming over every free speech case that reaches this Supreme Court. The government routinely prosecuted people who sold books or other works of art with sexual themes, including famous works of nude art. Then, in the later half of the 20th century, the Supreme Court started taking free speech seriously, giving a great deal of protection not just to political speech, but also to erotica, pornography, and other forms of sexual speech. Last year's Moody case, for example, arose out of Texas and Florida laws which attempted to seize control of content moderation at social media platforms. President Donald Trump routinely attempts to punish his perceived enemies for ordinary political speech — one of his many executive orders targeting law firms, for example, singled out a firm because of its representation of Trump's opponent in the 2016 election. The Trump administration arrests grad students for speaking in favor of Palestine. Now, both the Texas law at issue in Free Speech Coalition and the Mississippi law at issue in Fitch are signs that many state lawmakers want more leeway to regulate sexual content online. The Court's decision in Fitch could tell us a great deal about whether this line will continue to hold. The justice has one half of a really good idea. Senate Republicans are taking an enormous risk with the federal bench right now. The Black civil rights movement's greatest legal achievement is now on a Republican Supreme Court's chopping block.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Texas House Democrats were evacuated from their Illinois hotel on Wednesday due to a bomb threat. In a statement, Texas House Democrats said they are safe and “undeterred.” A group of Democratic state lawmakers has been staying in Illinois after leaving Texas to deny their Republican counterparts a quorum to vote on a new congressional map that would favor the GOP even more than the current map does. JB Pritzker (D-IL) said he was aware of the threats made. “I've had my life threatened before as a chief human trafficking prosecutor,” Johnson said. This is harmful discourse that emboldens bad actors and encourages violence.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a social media post that lawmakers who left the state should be arrested and brought back to the State Capitol. “Democrats in the Texas House who try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately,” he wrote. “We should use every tool at our disposal to hunt down those who think they are above the law.” Texas House Republicans voted to arrest Democratic members who did not show up for the vote on Monday. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) was slated to speak at a press conference with Texas Democrats in St. Charles, Illinois, on Wednesday, but the event has been canceled.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time since revealing last week that the Trump administration began freezing its federal research funding, the University of California, Los Angeles has put a number on how much is at stake. And it's far bigger than previously thought. “Currently, a total of approximately $584 million in extramural award funding is suspended and at risk,” Chancellor Julio Frenk wrote Wednesday to the university community. The extent of UCLA's financial challenge comes as the Trump administration – citing a wish to quell what it describes as rampant antisemitism on US campuses – has inked deals with several prominent universities, including Columbia, which agreed to give the White House “relevant data” on hiring and admissions, “strengthen oversight of international students” and have an independent monitor oversee the agreement. While UCLA and the Trump administration previously declined to give a specific figure publicly for the amount of federal research money frozen, it was “greater than $300 million,” documents given to the Los Angeles Times on Friday showed. “We will not fund institutions that promote antisemitism,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN last week. UCLA loses federal research funding in administration's ongoing fight with top universities UCLA in March launched its own Initiative to Combat Antisemitism and last week settled a lawsuit that accused the university of letting Jewish students get targeted and harassed during 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on campus. “Jewish and Israeli students at UCLA were subjected to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment that created a hostile environment by members of the encampment,” said a notice from the Civil Rights Division, asking for a “voluntary resolution” with the school. Both Columbia and Brown universities recently signed settlements with the Trump administration to restore federal grants blocked over similar claims, restoring hundreds of millions of dollars to those institutions. Already facing Trump administration cuts, US colleges risk losses from another revenue source: foreign students Harvard, which saw more than $2 billion in government funds frozen this year, is battling the Trump administration in court. The nation's oldest and wealthiest university awaits a judge's decision on whether the White House should be forced to release the money while also reportedly discussing its own settlement options.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chat GPT app icon is seen on a smartphone screen, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025, in Chicago. The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury. The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous. “The visceral initial response is, ‘Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' Imran Ahmed with the Center for Countering Digital Hate, speaks at The Elevate Prize Foundation's Make Good Famous Summit, on May 13, 2025, in Miami Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier, File) “Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,” the company said in a statement. OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on “getting these kinds of scenarios right” with tools to “better detect signs of mental or emotional distress” and improvements to the chatbot's behavior. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase. “It's technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,” Ahmed said. “And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.” Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl — with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends. The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was “for a presentation” or a friend. The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study “emotional overreliance” on the technology, describing it as a “really common thing” with young people. “People rely on ChatGPT too much,” Altman said at a conference. “There's young people who just say, like, ‘I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics. One is that “it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.” Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. “Absolutely,” responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as “emotionally exposed” while “still respecting the community's coded language.” The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy — a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear. Chat GPT's landing page is seen on a computer screen, Monday, Aug. 4, 2025, in Chicago. It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable. Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are “fundamentally designed to feel human,” said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report. Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice. A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide. Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a “moderate risk” for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners. But the new research by CCDH — focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage — shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour “Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan” that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs. “A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say ‘no' — that doesn't always enable and say ‘yes.' To another fake persona — a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance — ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs. “No human being I can think of would respond by saying, ‘Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ESPN Monday Night Football TV camera is seen during the second half of an NFL football game between the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings, Monday, Dec. 20, 2021, in Chicago. Philadelphia Eagles' Jalen Hurts, left, is interviewed by NFL Network talent Mike Garafolo, center, and Gerald McCoy, right, following practice at the team's NFL football training camp, Saturday, July 26, 2025, in Philadelphia. Ever since the NFL announced it was looking to sell NFL Network and other media assets, ESPN had been seen as one of the favorites to make a deal. Nearly five years later, a framework is finally in place. The NFL announced Tuesday night that it has entered into a nonbinding agreement with ESPN. The agreement will also have to undergo regulatory approvals. And we both feel that it is at this stage,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a call with The Associated Press. “We have been talking about it in earnest for the last few years. And we got back at it when I came back to Disney after my retirement,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a call with the AP. ESPN is expected to launch its direct-to-consumer service before the end of September. The service would give cord-cutters access to all ESPN programs and networks for $29.99 per month. Many viewers will receive the service for free as part of their subscription to cable, satellite and most streaming services. “When I came back to Disney and assessed essentially the future of ESPN, it became clear that ESPN had to launch a bigger and more robust and digital or direct-to-consumer product, not only for the sake of ESPN's business, but for the sports fan,” Iger said. “And obviously, when you start thinking about high-quality sports content, your eyes immediately head in the direction of the NFL because there's really nothing more valuable and more popular than that.” NFL Network — which has nearly 50 million subscribers — would be owned and operated by ESPN and would be included in ESPN's direct-to-consumer product. The NFL RedZone channel would be distributed by ESPN to cable and satellite operators. ESPN would also get rights to the RedZone brand, meaning RedZone channels for college football and basketball or other sports could be coming in the future. NFL Network will still air seven games per season. Four of ESPN's games, including some that are in overlapping windows on Monday nights, would move to NFL Network. Aidan O'Connor, a senior vice president at the Prosek Partners marketing firm, estimates the value of that would be $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. ESPN is currently 80% owned by ABC Inc. as an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. It had that in the past with Sirius Satellite Radio and SportsLine. “This is new as far as a partner now operating a business that we built, ran and grew,” said Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president of media distribution. “It'll also be a little bit new again with some of the dynamics here, but we'll continue to balance that in a really arm's length way where we'll think about how we manage and work across to all our partners.” “The moves align with the NFL's longstanding ambition to reach $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027 — a target first set in 2010, when league revenue stood at approximately $8.5 billion,” O'Connor said. “Financially, the move also signals to investors that ESPN is doubling down on differentiation and content stickiness by offering a scarce and premium product in a crowded marketplace. Intentionally ceding equity to the NFL transforms ESPN from a media licensee into a true platform partner — with few properties rivaling the league in terms of cultural significance, appointment viewing, audience reach, and monetization efficiency.” Viewers will likely not see any immediate impacts until next year once everything is approved. Besides ESPN, the biggest winner in this could be NFL Network, which had seen reductions in original programming the past couple years. “Total Access,” the network's flagship show since its launch in 2003, ended in May 2024 amid a series of layoffs and cost-cutting moves. “Good Morning Football” also moved from New York, where it had been since its start in 2016, to Southern California last year. They will do a fantastic job of operating the network and taking it to another level.”</p>

New York Senator Kristen Gillibrand speaks to Fox News Digital about the 2024 election and voter support after being appointed DCCC Chair As they mount their uphill effort to win back the Senate majority in next year's midterm elections, Democrats feel that they're on a roll. Late last month, they landed their biggest recruit to date, when former two-term Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina declared his candidacy in the 2026 race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. "It's hard to overstate the importance of getting Gov. Cooper to run for the Senate in North Carolina, and already we are seeing a potential for a ripple effect," longtime Democratic strategist Chris Moyer told Fox News Digital. Roy Cooper, a Democrat from North Carolina, speaks with reporters on Sept. 10, 2024, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Moyer, a veteran campaign communicator, said that Cooper recruitment is "giving more faith to potential candidates who are questioning whether there's a chance for a Democratic majority in the Senate next year." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, after landing Cooper, said he "is a formidable candidate who will flip North Carolina's Senate seat." Top Democrats now have their eyes on former Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who lost last year's re-election bid in a onetime top swing state that's become reliably red over the past decade. Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, trekked to Ohio this summer in hopes of convincing Brown to take on Republican Sen. Jon Husted, Fox News confirmed. Democrats landed the candidate they were hoping for in swing state New Hampshire in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Four-term Rep. Chris Pappas' announcement in early April that he would run to succeed Shaheen has cleared the Democratic primary field, as of now, of any potential rivals for the party's Senate nomination. Democratic Senate candidate in New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas is interviewed by Fox News Digital on July 4, 2025, in Portsmouth, N.H. (Paul Steinhauser - Fox News) In battleground Georgia, which President Donald Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year. Former Rep. Mike Rogers, the 2024 GOP Senate nominee who narrowly lost last year's race, appears to have cleared the Republican, thanks in great part to Trump's endorsement and likely arm twisting by the president's political team. Democrats, meanwhile, have a very competitive primary on their hands. The primary race includes three well-known Democrats: Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, and former gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who enjoys the backing of progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And popular Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan is running for the Senate as an independent, which could potentially hurt Democrats in the general election. While Texas has long been a reliable red state, and conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz comfortably won re-election last year, Democrats are optimistic about their 2026 chances to potentially flip a red seat to blue. That's because longtime GOP Sen. John Cornyn is facing a serious primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a MAGA world rockstar. Former Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, seen on the campaign trail last October, is running for a second straight election cycle for the Senate. Paxton has long been surrounded by scandals, and is now dealing with a headline-grabbing divorce with his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxtom. But Democrats could have a competitive primary in Texas as well. Former Rep. Colin Allred, who lost to Cruz last November, launched a second straight campaign earlier this year. State Rep. James Talarico, who grabbed national attention recently for his appearance with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, and Rep. Joaquin Castro, are also mulling bids. Democrats also feel they may have a shot in Iowa – a onetime swing state that's become firmly red in recent election cycles – if Republican Sen. Joni Ernst decides against seeking a third term in the Senate. But they'll likely have a much better chance of flipping a GOP-held seat in blue state Maine if longtime Republican incumbent Sen. Susan Collins decides against seeking re-election. Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

President Donald Trump suggested that the FBI "may have to" round up a group of Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to avoid voting on the state's redistricting map. Infamous Democratic donor George Soros and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke are responsible for two major funding groups behind the Texas Democrats fleeing the state to prevent the GOP from voting on a new congressional map. Powered by People (PBP), founded by O'Rourke, has played a major role in supporting the roughly 50 Democrats who departed for New York and Illinois, paying for airfare, lodging, and helping with the $500-per-day fines the lawmakers face for skipping legislative session, the Texas Tribune reported. Meanwhile, the Soros-backed Texas Majority PAC has reportedly been working with national fundraising groups to secure additional funds for the last-ditch delaying tactic. PBP is actively soliciting donations on its website to support the Democratic effort, promising potential donors that "100% of your donation will go to supporting Texas Democrats in their fight against Trump's power grab." The organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Texas Majority PAC also did not immediately respond. A side-by-side of George Soros and Beto O'Rourke, both of whom are involved in supporting Democrats who have fled Texas over a redistricting vote. Some Texas Republicans have argued that Democrats may be committing a crime if they use political funds to pay the $500 daily fines. The 2023 legislation imposing the fine stipulates that payment may not be made "from funds accepted as political contributions." Those clued into the fundraising efforts told the Tribune that they are confident they have found a way to legally distribute fundraising to lawmakers. "Every dime of expense for this effort is being paid for lawfully," the Texas House Democratic Caucus told the outlet. Greg Abbott has already begun a legal process seeking to remove the "ringleader" of the derelict Democrats from office. "Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans," Abbott said in a statement. "Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences." Wu has yet to submit a court filing, but reacted to the press in a statement Tuesday night. President Donald Trump has even suggested that the FBI or other federal law enforcement may have to get involved. "A lot of people have demanded they come back. You can't just sit it out. That's what elections are all about," he said. Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American journalist Alec Luhn, who went missing while hiking in a Norwegian national park, has been found alive, according to the Norwegian Red Cross. Luhn was found near Folgefonna National Park by helicopter crew and has been taken for medical treatment, the organization wrote on X Wednesday. Many thanks to everyone in Norway who has helped to find him,” Luhn's wife Veronika Silchenko told local news outlet VG by phone after her husband was found. The journalist was found with some injuries to his legs, according to Svein Buer, an emergency manager for Hardanger police. Rescue teams found himat 11.34 a.m. local time on Wednesday, the Norwegian Red Cross said. “I can't remember us finding someone alive after so many days. The search doesn't always end like this – but today, it did. It's a huge relief for everyone who's been part of the effort,” Stig Hope, a Red Cross volunteer and head of the operations leadership team at Folgefonna, said. Luhn, a climate journalist from Wisconsin, was reported missing by his wife on Monday, after he failed to board his flight home. Silchenko previously told CNN she had last spoke to Luhn on Thursday, as he was setting off on his hike. However, due to the fact that phone signal can be patchy in the wilderness, she did not become overly concerned until days later. The Norwegian Red Cross wrote on X earlier Wednesday that the search for Luhn had resumed Wednesday morning, and that a large team of volunteers had been mobilized, including specialized climbing teams and drones. The search operation for Luhn began Monday and was expanded by Tuesday. Ingeborg Thorsland, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Red Cross, earlier told CNN that the operation spanned a large area and that heavy rainfall had made navigation difficult.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of singers in their 70s and 80s travel across the U.S. singing Gullah spirituals that have been passed down from their enslaved ancestors who were forced to work the cotton and rice plantations of the South Carolina Sea Islands. They're on a mission to preserve their Gullah Geechee culture for future generations. Singer and actress Marlena Smalls sings a Gullah spiritual at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Beaufort, South Carolina, Saturday, July 19, 2025. “Voices of Gullah” singer Minnie “Gracie” Gadson sings a Gullah spiritual while musicologist Eric Crawford follows along patting his thighs in body percussion, at the Coffin Point Praise House in St. Helena Island, Sunday, July 20, 2025.

On a recent summer day, her voice rang out inside Coffin Point Praise House. Today, as a Voices of Gullah member, she travels the U.S. with others in their 70s and 80s singing in the Gullah Creole language that has West African roots. James Peter Smalls, a deacon, who takes care of the Mary Jenkins Praise House, poses for a photo outside the wooden structure in St. Helena Island. A bench with wood burning designs paying homage to praise houses sits outside the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Beaufort, South Carolina. “This Gullah Geechee thing is what connects us all across the African diaspora because Gullah Geechee is the blending of all of these cultures that came together during that terrible time in our history called the trans-Atlantic slave trade,” said Anita Singleton-Prather, who recently performed and directed a play about Gullah history. At the theater entrance, vendors offered Gullah rice dishes and demonstrated how to weave sweetgrass into baskets. More than 5,000 descendants of enslaved plantation workers are estimated to live on St. Helena Island, the largest Gullah community on the South Carolina coast where respect for tradition and deep cultural roots persists. Playwright and actress, Anita Singleton-Prather, second left, smiles at members of the cast of a play that highlights Gullah contributions during the American Revolutionary period. “It's important to preserve the Gullah culture, mainly because it informs us all, African Americans, where they come from and that it's still here,” said Eric Crawford, author of “Gullah Spirituals: The Sound of Freedom and Protest in the South Carolina Sea Islands.” For most of his life, he hadn't heard the word Gullah. — all these iconic songs came from this area,” he said. “And so my question was: ‘These songs that trace back to the 1800s — were they still being done over 150 years later? But then in the evening, typically on Sunday evenings, Tuesday and Thursday, they had this space by themselves, away from the watchful eye of the owners, and they could engage in their own songs.” At the praise houses, he said, they connected with their ancestors following West and Central African practices. “Voices of Gullah” members, Joe Murray, from left, Minnie “Gracie” Gadson, Rosa Murray and Charles “Jojo” Brown, sing Gullah spirituals at the Brick Baptist Church.

But at a recent concert they clapped their hands in one rhythm, stomped the floor in another and swayed, singing at the island's Brick Baptist Church. He began to take the singers on tour in 2014. “I'm gonna continue doing it until I can't do it no more, and hope that younger people will come in, others younger than me, to keep it going,” said Brown who, at 71, is affectionally called the “baby.” “I hope and pray one or two of them will fall in my footsteps,” she said. Gullah Heritage Trails Tours founder Emory Campbell talks to tourists during a visit to historic Gullah neighborhoods on Hilton Head Island. Other community members share that mission to teach future generations. The Gullah Heritage Trails Tours take visitors through historic neighborhoods surrounded by beaches, wealthy vacation homes and golf resorts on Hilton Head Island. The tours were started by a family of 12 brothers and sisters in 1996. “We thought it was important for people to know that Gullah people live on this island,” said Emory Campbell, 82, who helped translate the New Testament into Gullah and for decades led the respected Penn Center, one of the country's first schools for freed slaves. “If we don't know who we are, we're lost,” said Marlena Smalls, a singer and actor who for decades has been performing adaptations of Gullah spirituals for new audiences and founded the popular Gullah Festival. Her work even appeared on an SAT question about Gullah culture. And I want my children to know who they are and their children to know who they are. That's why it's important,” said Smalls, who is also known for playing Bubba's mother in the film “Forrest Gump.” Singer and actress Marlena Smalls sings a Gullah spiritual at the Tabernacle Baptist Church. Given their age, Crawford sometimes asks himself “who will carry the torch.” He has been working to get grants so students can also start projects to preserve the songs, language and culture. “It is a portal into the past and a window into the future,” said Tendaji Bailey, 35, founder of “Gullah Geechee Futures,” a project that focuses on the preservation of Gullah communities and cultural sites. For the past three years, he has been bringing Morehouse students to visit praise houses. So, I know that there's power in this place, still.” Associated Press journalist Jessie Wardarski contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dutra lives a stone's throw from the timeworn neighborhood bar in her small Montana town of Anaconda. She sometimes feels like a cast member in the sitcom “Cheers” – the second home where everybody knows your name. So after a gunman opened fire inside the bar Friday morning, Dutra quickly realized she knew each of the people killed, including her coworker Nancy Kelley and three of her regulars: Daniel Baillie, David Leach and Tony Palm. These are people I spend every day with,” Dutra said. The suspected shooter, Michael Brown, was no stranger, either. “People know who he is,” said Dutra, noting Brown frequented the bar. One of Brown's relatives, who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for their privacy, told CNN they also worked at the bar for years and knew all four people who were killed. Everybody loves each other so much in there,” Dutra said. … When you walked in the bar, every single person that was sitting in the bar knew who you were.” Nearly every inch of the bar's narrow interior is plastered with glowing beer logo signs, neon strip lights and posters jeering with bawdy bar jokes and wisecracks. A photo from 2022 shows a sign above the bar reading, “Prices subject to change according to customers attitude.” Another: “Don't like guns? Painted ceiling panels stretch over high-back booths, a juke box and a pool table, forming an overhead checkerboard of local business advertisements, sports team logos and alcohol branding. “It's such a happy little town, and that's just a happy little tight knit place,” Dutra said of the bar. “It's the longest-standing bar in Anaconda,” said 31-year-old resident Sierra Fitzpatrick. Some locals swear its first iteration opened in the 1880s, and one resident told CNN he believes the portrait of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt pinned behind the bar has been there since he was elected in 1932. Smelter workers would frequent The Owl Bar in those days, when “three shots and a beer could be had for $1.50,” according to a 2018 report from The Montana Standard. Resident Chris McNaughton said his great-grandfather Hank Walsh, who worked at the smelter, “would stop at The Owl for a beer and a shot of Irish whiskey on his way home on the trolley.” Since 1980, they have held an annual family reunion at the bar – canceling only during the Covid-19 pandemic – where they play games, hand out family awards and raise a glass to his great-grandfather. “We were thankful this weekend because if the shooter had decided to wait one more day, our family of 70 or more people would have all been packed in that little bar,” he said. “We will return to The Owl next summer.” It's a scene she could not have fathomed before. “It's just so much to wrap your head around in a community like Anaconda,” Dutra said. Dutra is still coming to terms with losing Kelley, a nurse-turned-bartender who had recently retired from a long career caring for cancer patients. “It just is an extremely unfair ending for somebody who spent their entire life dedicated to cancer patients and making a huge difference,” Dutra said. Fitzpatrick said she hopes people will prioritize the victims and have deeper discussions about mental health after the suspect's family members and several residents expressed Brown had long struggled with mental illness. “I really hope that we can truly fight for mental health, really be considerate of the person sitting next to you,” Fitzpatrick said. She has been heartened to see local businesses going out of their way to feed and care for first responders – an action she said is characteristic of tight-knit Anaconda. Once The Owl Bar reopens, Fitzpatrick will be there to support Gwerder and show up for Anaconda. “I would 110% give my support to The Owl Bar” once they reopen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taiwanese authorities have detained three current and former employees of the world's largest chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), for allegedly stealing trade secrets, prosecutors said Tuesday. Law enforcement officers questioned several suspects and witnesses late last month; searched their homes and detained three of them over “serious suspicions of violating national security laws,” the intellectual property branch of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office said on Tuesday. TSMC produces more than 90% of the world's advanced semiconductor chips that power everything from smartphones and artificial intelligence (AI) applications to weapons, with key clients including the likes of Apple and Nvidia. The major Taiwanese exporter raised suspicions that its “core technologies” may have been illegally accessed by former and current staffers with authorities after an internal investigation. The prosecutor's office said it will probe the motives behind the alleged theft of trade secrets and whether TSMC's proprietary information had been leaked to other parties, in the first case of its kind since Taiwan tightened its national security law to protect its key technologies in 2022. Nikkei Asia first reported on Tuesday that TSMC had fired staffers suspected of illegally obtaining business secrets related to the manufacturing technology for the company's 2-nanometer chip, the most advanced processor in the semiconductor industry that is expected to go into mass production this year. TSMC said it discovered the potential trade secret leak after unauthorized activities were detected during routine monitoring. “TSMC has taken strict disciplinary actions against the personnel involved and has initiated legal proceedings,” the company said in a statement. Taiwanese local media reported that a former TSMC employee now works at top chip manufacturing equipment supplier Tokyo Electron Ltd., and that the Japanese firm's Taiwan office was raided by investigators. Tokyo Electron's Taiwan office told CNN it has no comment. A breach of TSMC's key trade secrets, if proven true, could have national security implications for Taiwan, as it could narrow the technological lead the company has over its competitors in advanced chip manufacturing. TSMC's technological prowess is what fuels the commonly held belief in Taiwan that the island's global dependence on its semiconductors serves as a “silicon shield” – a deterrent against a potential Chinese invasion, and a leverage in global diplomacy.</p>

Senators and deputies allied with former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro hold a press conference outside the National Congress in Brasília, Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025, to denounce the house arrest order issued against Bolsonaro by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Sostenes Cavalcante, opposition leader and congressman, speaks during a press conference outside the National Congress in Brasília on Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025, to denounce the house arrest order issued against Bolsonaro by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. Demonstrators rally in support of former President Jair Bolsonaro at the entrance to his residential complex, to denounce his house arrest order by the Supreme Court, in Brasília, Brazil, Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025. SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazilians were divided Tuesday over a house arrest order against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office. “One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,” the analyst said. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who put Bolsonaro on trial for his alleged role in the coup plot to keep him in office despite his defeat in the 2022 election, ordered the 70-year-old former president's arrest for violating precautionary measures imposed on him by spreading content through his three lawmaker sons. That decision followed one from the court last month ordering Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor and to obey a curfew while the proceedings are underway. Analysts expect another narrow election next year, with Lula running for reelection and Bolsonaro barred. The political repercussions in Brazil are getting attention from the U.S. government as President Donald Trump directly tied a 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to his ally's judicial situation. Late on Monday, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs condemned the far-right leader's order for house arrest and attacked de Moraes. Since de Moraes' order, Bolsonaro allies are pledging to stop congress unless an amnesty bill is passed in favor of the far-right leader and his supporters involved in the coup plot probe. Early on Tuesday, a group of 40 pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers told journalists in the capital Brasilia they will push hard for the former president's release. “I've already told speaker Hugo Motta that I will do that in the first moment I am working as the speaker of the house during one of his trips abroad,” Cortes said. “This is an arbitrary action,” said Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, the president of Brazil's senate. “I call for serenity and spirit of cooperation. We need to start working with respect, civility and dialogue so congress can fulfill its mission in favor of Brazil and our population.” Members of Brazil's opposition say such a move would also allow Bolsonaro to run in next year's election, from which he was barred by the country's top electoral court for abuse of power in 2022. Meanwhile, Lula and his allies initially showed they wanted to move past the issue of Bolsonaro's house arrest and focus on trade negotiations with Trump, who imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian import goods starting Wednesday. “I don't want to speak about what happened to that other Brazilian citizen who tried to stage a coup,” Lula said during a long speech in Brasilia on Tuesday. The leftist leader added he will not call Trump to talk about trade “because he doesn't want to” speak about it. Lula said he might instead “invite him to attend (November's climate summit) COP in Belem.” “I came here with the compromise of not wasting much time speaking about tariffs. And I don't want you to leave with that impression,” he said. Members of Lula's Cabinet have also avoided discussing Bolsonaro's future. “I don't like the idea of a former president not being able to speak, and even less see him get arrested for that before he is put on trial at the Supreme Court,” Leite said. “Our country does not deserve to remain hostage to this legal-political tug of war that only hinders us all.” Gilberto Kassab, the chairman of the centrist Social Democratic Party, has both Bolsonaro and Lula supporters in his party's ranks and said “exaggeration on both sides are contaminating Brazil.” This is all that the country did not need,” Kassab said in a statement.
