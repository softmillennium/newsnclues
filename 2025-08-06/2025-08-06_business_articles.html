                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beauty's profits fell 30% in its fiscal first quarter as new tariffs on Chinese imports begin to impact the cosmetic company's bottom line. In the three months ended June 30, E.l.f. The company, which sources about 75% of its products from China, also declined to provide a full-year revenue guide, citing the "wide range of potential outcomes" related to the new duties. said it's expecting sales growth to be above 9% in the first half of the year and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins to be 20%, compared with 23% in the first half of the previous fiscal year. "We're operating in a very volatile macro environment, obviously a great deal of uncertainty on tariffs, so until we have greater resolution on what the tariff picture looks like, we didn't think it made sense to issue guidance," CEO Tarang Amin told CNBC in an interview. The company has already raised prices by $1 to offset tariff costs and is working to expand its business outside of the U.S. and diversify its supply chain. "We're under 55% tariffs on goods coming from China, and we've planned against that," Amin said. "So I'm just waiting for that other shoe to drop to see OK, where do they really settle out? I never thought I would say a day that I'm happy to see 55% tariffs, but it's a lot better than 170% so I think once we have that resolution, we'll be in a better spot." beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the cosmetics company performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $33.3 million, or 58 cents per share, compared with $47.6 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to stock-based compensation and other nonrecurring charges, E.l.f. saw adjusted net income of $51.3 million, or 89 cents per share. That marks the second quarter in a row where revenue growth slowed to the single digits, a pattern the company hasn't seen since 2020. 's sales have consistently grown in the high double digits, but that momentum has started to slow down as the beauty category overall cools off following several years of outsized growth. Amin said growth is expected to improve in the current quarter. "Sometimes people forget just how much we've been growing," Amin said. There's a lot of uncertainty with tariffs, inflation." While the fiscal first quarter was slower than quarters past, Amin said Nielsen data shows the company is still taking market share and outperforming the overall category. A key aspect of the company's growth comes from buzzy product launches, which are often "dupes" of higher-priced prestige products. It recently launched its Bright Icon Vitamin C + E Ferulic Serum at $17, which is thought to have been inspired by a similar product from Skinceuticals, which retails for $185. It also released a new sunscreen and just closed on its acquisition of Hailey Bieber's beauty brand Rhode, which will launch in all Sephora stores in the U.S. and Canada in September. 's sales, and especially its launch in Sephora, won't be seen in its results until later this year. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's Zoox has cleared a key regulatory hurdle, paving the way for demonstrations of its self-driving robotaxis. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday that it granted Zoox an exemption from some requirements, a first for U.S.-built vehicles under a recently expanded program. "Transportation innovators can be confident in getting speedy review of their vehicles and, as appropriate, exemption from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards," NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in a release. As part of the announcement, NHTSA said it's closing a probe opened in March 2023 into Zoox's self-certification that its robotaxi met federal safety standards. "Through this new exemption process, we are excited to embark on this new path, put these discussions behind us, and move forward," Zoox said in a statement. The Department of Transportation in April announced it would expand a program that aims to speed up the autonomous vehicle exemption process to include domestically produced vehicles. The easing of regulations will benefit Zoox and its competitors. Tesla has announced that it plans to produce a two-seater CyberCab with no steering wheel or pedals down the line. Zoox, founded 11 years ago and purchased by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, has been gearing up for further expansion this year. The company in June opened a robotaxi manufacturing facility in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it aims to eventually produce 10,000 vehicles a year once it's at full scale. Zoox needs more of its toaster-shaped robotaxis to roll off the assembly line to fulfill its mission of deploying a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S. The company has eyed Las Vegas as its first commercial market, and said it plans to begin service there later this year. -- CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed reporting to this article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has tried to justify firing former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by claiming that her agency's gold standard employment reports were "rigged" in order to harm him politically. Trump has provided no evidence to support his allegation. "Just days before the [Nov. 5 presidential] election, they put out numbers that it was like the country was on fire," Trump claimed Tuesday morning on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "And then they did a revision about two weeks later, and the revision was down by almost 900,000 jobs," he alleged. When a host pushed back, Trump doubled down, claiming "the numbers were rigged." "They announced these phenomenal numbers the two days before the election and a little bit before that, always these great numbers ... But after I won the election, then they announced a downward number, in other words, to bring it back to reality," Trump said. But Trump's account of how the jobs report revisions were issued in 2024 is wrong. But that revision did not come after the election, as Trump suggested Tuesday morning. "New Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the Administration PADDED THE NUMBERS with an extra 818,000 Jobs that DO NOT EXIST, AND NEVER DID," he claimed in an Aug. 21 post on Truth Social. The figure came in the BLS' preliminary annual benchmark revision, when its employment estimates derived from surveys are calibrated against state unemployment insurance tax records. That Nov. 1 report — less than a week before Election Day — showed just 12,000 workers had been added to U.S. nonfarm payrolls in October. At the time, it was the smallest monthly job gain in nearly four years, and it fell well below experts' already-low expectations. As soon as the Nov. 1 report was released, it was immediately weaponized for political purposes — by Trump, who used the data to bash Harris. "Today's jobs report is a great embarrassment for our Nation. Kamala has lied for years about their pathetic job growth, which has never been real," Trump wrote on Truth Social Nov. 1. "America is a Nation in Decline because Sleepy Joe, and Lyin' Kamala, didn't do their job." Moreover, the sharp decline in October's initial report is now understood to have been driven by several factors outside of anyone's control. Major labor strikes at Boeing and at U.S. ports had the short-term effect of removing thousands of workers from payrolls in October. Hurricanes in the Southeast also impacted that initial report by closing roads and businesses, making it more difficult to collect accurate data. The White House did not respond to CNBC's request for comment or further explanation of Trump's remarks. But these are not the critiques Trump has made himself. Instead, Trump announced McEntarfer's firing in a Friday afternoon social media post that accused her of having "faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory." CNBC has reached out to McEntarfer for comment. "I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY," Trump wrote. The BLS in that report also issued two revisions to initial reports from previous months. Both of them revised the jobs numbers sharply downward, shaving a combined total of 258,000 jobs off the year's tally. By Friday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen more than 500 points. The move to fire McEntarfer drew widespread criticism over fears that government employment data, which is relied upon to gauge the health of the U.S. economy and make major policy decisions, will become politicized and untrustworthy. Experts also say that even if a BLS commissioner wanted to manipulate monthly jobs report data, it would be impossible given how the data is collected, analyzed and released to the public. Trump said he plans to announce McEntarfer's successor in the coming days. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation last week brought back a scenario that seemed to be fading but could have important ramifications for how the central bank conducts policy. With the open seat on the influential central bank board, President Donald Trump now has a number of strategic options, including one where he could appoint a so-called shadow chair whose job would be largely to serve as an instigator until a successor to current Chair Jerome Powell could be named. This in turn raises the tantalizing possibility that an institution historically known for collegiality and an ivory-toweresque approach to policy now will have to deal with a sudden dose of political intrigue. One is he can put a stop-gap appointment to fill the Kugler seat for the remaining four months of the unexpired term," Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said Wednesday on CNBC. Kugler served less than two years of Brainard's unexpired term and left with only about six months remaining, accounting for the couple of months it will take for her replacement to be confirmed. Taking into account the Senate calendar, the new governor would serve at best three or four months, then have to undergo yet another confirmation hearing should Trump decide to reappoint the person. For Trump, though, selecting a shadow chair would be in keeping with his affinity for conflict and making people prove themselves, Guha added. "He likes to run things like 'Celebrity Apprentice,'" Trump's former reality show on NBC, Guha said. "He likes to have people trialing, dueling it out with each other. So I suspect he's probably pulled in both directions here." The time span that came with Kugler's announcement carries added risk. If she had stayed in the seat, the appointment wouldn't have come at least until her term expired in January and would have been for a full 14-year term on the board. Accepting such an appointment also is a dicey proposition. Trump has made it clear he will only appoint governors who are in favor of cutting rates. The president has stated that he not only wants reductions, but is looking for dramatic moves, along the lines of 3 percentage points. Former Fed Chair and past Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on CNBC that Trump's rate demands "should be frightening to markets." "A shadow chairman with only four months to go has some risk," said Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel. Maybe there they have to take a position that Trump doesn't like. Just the time that we're talking about increases the chances of that happening so it becomes a more difficult option. That being said, I think the administration thinks it's an attractive idea, and does give them some flexibility." In that case, it would present a more conventional approach and not push the new governor into a potentially adversarial relationship with colleagues with whom he or she will serve for potentially the next 14 years. "Maybe they do this as kind of a backup plan to make sure that they have the person they want in place when the Powell chairmanship ends in in May," Gardner says. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that he has the choice for Kugler's seat down to four finalists — former Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and two unnamed candidates. One of those in contention is thought to be current Governor Christopher Waller. Other names mentioned included economist and former World Bank President David Malpass as well as economist Judy Shelton, whom Trump tried to appoint during his first term but failed to clear Senate approval. Betting markets are split between Warsh and Hassett as the favorite, with Shelton also drawing some interest. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has taken himself out of contention, Trump told CNBC. However, he would not have a majority on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which entails the seven governors plus a rotating cast of five regional presidents. His current appointees are Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who also is the vice chair in charge of bank supervision. Trump has promised a decision in the next few days. Yellen and others have criticized Trump for leaning so hard against the Fed for lower rates, something that previous presidents have done but in a much less public manner. Bush was pressuring then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan for lower rates. "I think it's in a secure enough place for now, but things can change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CEO Tim Cook will join President Donald Trump in the Oval Office for an announcement touting an update to the company's stated plans to spend and invest in the U.S. Apple will raise its previous commitment, made in February, from $500 billion to $600 billion over the next four years, a White House official told CNBC. It will also announce a new manufacturing effort called the American Manufacturing Program, the official said. Apple shares rose 5% during trading on Wednesday. Cook has had a mixed relationship with Trump over the past year. While Trump has praised the Apple CEO in the past, in recent months he has said he has a "problem" with the executive and has pushed for Apple to assemble its iPhones in the U.S., not China or India. Apple faces over $1 billion in increased costs this quarter because of Trump's tariffs on imports, primarily related to China. Also, Cook reminded investors during its earnings call Aug. 31 that "the vast majority" of its products would be subject to new tariffs under a Section 232 investigation, a kind of pending tariff on semiconductors that Apple says will hit the company. "We obviously try to optimize our supply chain, and ultimately we will do more in the United States," Cook said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a shift in global military policies, the United States has opted to modify key leadership positions in Africa to confront new threats via AFRICOM. Recent appointments in the United States military indicate a move toward greater integration of air and space power across Africa. In a nutshell, the United States Africa Command recently appointed its first Air Force commander. SEE ALSO: US Africa Command set to welcome new leader as Trump replaces Langley As the United States approaches a crucial development phase and AFRICOM focuses on air operations, here are five key points to consider regarding the U.S's involvement in Africa's security landscape. Anderson, who has a history in special operations and formerly led the United States Special Operations Command Africa, might provide a new air-and-space-focused perspective to AFRICOM's mission. After the Senate approved a new commander for U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM), the United States also began considering an autonomous military command for operations in Africa. Up until now, AFRICOM and European Command shared a headquarters, which restricted its ability to respond independently to Africa's quickly changing challenges. At the same time, AFRICOM is increasing airstrikes across Africa, and putting an airman in command rather than soldiers or marines, who have traditionally led the force, might signify a change toward more air and space-focused operations on the continent. U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) is one of the United States' 11 unified combatant commands, in charge of directing all US military activities, partnerships, and security interests on the African continent.

The company implemented the full five-day RTO policy in early July for a group within its semiconductor business and is rolling out a tool internally to track employees' compliance, Business Insider has learned. In an August internal email sent by Samsung's HR team, which was seen by Business Insider, the company said the first few weeks of full implementation had led to "more smiling faces in the hallways." It added that Samsung now expects a "greater presence" on-site and highlighted the need to "improve adherence to our policy." In an April email, which was also seen by Business Insider, Samsung told some staffers in its semiconductor division: "We look forward to a more consistently full campus environment, where innovation and collaboration can happen in real time. The South Korean company previously had a "FlexWork" policy that allowed employees to work from home up to two days a week. In June, Samsung's HR team shared an update on the rollout: "We are already experiencing increased foot traffic daily, with more cars in the parking lot and hungry mouths in our cafeterias on Fridays, to name just a few signs." In the June email, Samsung said it was developing a new tool to assist managers with enforcing the new policy. "This tool will provide each Manager with visibility to the number of days & time in building metrics for each team member," the email said. "This will ensure that team members are fulfilling their expectation regarding in office work - however that is defined with their business leader - as well as guarding against instances of lunch/coffee badging." Samsung does not publicly share head count figures for all of its numerous subsidiaries, including its semiconductor business. The broader return-to-office trend gained momentum last year when major firms like Amazon and AT&T announced plans to bring employees back five days a week by 2025. That push has continued into this year, with companies such as TikTok and Dell also mandating full-time in-office work.Read the full email Samsung sent to some workers in August below.</p>
