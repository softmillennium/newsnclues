                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tennis calendar is relentless, and can make the sport feel like a bit of a chore at times, but there's nothing quite like it when it peaks. This match should have a much different feel from that contest, which Fritz won in three sets, as both players have taken massive strides in their respective careers. It's no surprise that Fritz is the favorite Wednesday night, given his edge in experience and his higher ranking, but some signals point to this match being closer to a coin flip than even these odds imply. At the beginning of the season, you'd argue that Fritz was a good role model for Shelton in how he could advance his career. Eventually, the rest of Fritz's game got to a point where he wasn't too reliant on his serve, and he's shot up the rankings because of that. 4 player in the world (a career best), and has won 19 of his last 22 matches. It's been a banner 2025 campaign for Fritz, though he'd certainly like to add a second Masters title — and first since 2022 — to his mantle. The former Florida Gator has established himself as a real threat at Grand Slams, and he's got a couple of titles already under his belt. The 22-year-old still can stand to be more consistent, but he's already solidified himself as a top-10 player, and a little more growth in his game could see him make a push for one of the top four seeds at Grand Slams in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, there are a number of players hoping to claim the crown. Stalwarts like Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff are always a threat, while young stars such as Victoria Mboko and Mirra Andreeva could cause a shock. One observer, an acclaimed tennis coach, has made his prediction for who will win the US Open Ladies Singles title. Rick Macci is a well-respected tennis coach who is credited with the early development of Serena and Venus Williams while they were growing up in Compton, California. Macci, who has also coached Maria Sharapova and Andy Roddick, believes Iga Swiatek will win the 2025 US Open Ladies Singles title. Posting on X [Twitter], Macci said: “Was asked my pick for the OPEN. “But Iga mentally is in a different space and my pick to take first place. “The Polisher punisher I feel is on a MISSION and Grand Slam number seven she is ready to go FISHIN.” Swiatek will certainly be a threat at the US Open. She will take some stopping at Flushing Meadows. Iga Swiatek produced a dominant run at the 2022 US Open. The Pole did not drop a set in her first three rounds, defeating Jasmine Paolini, former US Open champion Sloane Stephens, and Lauren Davis. The Pole defeated Ons Jabeur in the final, winning her first US Open title and third Grand Slam title overall.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The $85 million figure represents just over 15 percent of the tournament's $559.7 million (£420 million) operating revenue from a year ago, according to financial statements published by the United States Tennis Association (USTA). The total compensation pool, including money earmarked for hotel and food costs, which is not associated with performance, is $90 million. The increase in prize money comes amid mounting player complaints over the share of tournament revenues that they receive. The top men's and women's stars have hired former WTA chief executive Larry Scott to lobby the Grand Slams on their behalf, arranging meetings with tournament organizers to make their case. While the four majors tout their record prize money, the players point to a disparity of proportion: in U.S. team sports, such as the NFL, MLB and NBA, players receive closer to 50 percent of revenues. It also comes amid an antitrust lawsuit launched by the Professional Tennis Player Association (PTPA), the organization co-founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in 2021. The PTPA has subsequently declared it is having “productive discussions” with the four majors, and removed them from an updated complaint filed in June. This context may inform the U.S. Open's prize money increases for 2025 being targeted at players who go deeper at the event, after several years of beefing up prize money in the earlier rounds. The beaten singles finalists will receive $2.5 million, which works out at more than what this year's Australian Open champions got, thanks to current exchange rates. The semifinalists will be paid $1.26 million, an increase of 26 percent, and quarterfinalists $660,0000, an increase of 25 percent. Round-of-16 competitors will take home $400,000, an increase of 23 percent. Anyone who qualifies for the singles main draw will receive $110,000, up 10 percent from last year. “This follows years of a strategic focus on redistribution to the early rounds and qualifying tournament to provide meaningful payouts to all players,” the USTA said in a statement. At this year's Wimbledon, the $72 million prize pool amounted to just over 13 percent of its 2024 revenue of $553 million. They have to spend much of the money they collect from these events to fund their operations, as well as growing and promoting tennis in their respective countries. It is an argument that does not provide a great deal of comfort for players who don't come from the Grand Slam nations of the U.S., Great Britain and Northern Ireland, France and Australia. They also all compete with one another in an arms race for supremacy in facilities, tournament experience and, ultimately, compensation. The USTA's move is likely to put pressure on the other Grand Slams to raise their compensation level into 2026, while tennis continues to reckon with its financial future in the face of player pressure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams, the tennis veteran, women's equal pay activist, and big sister, is having a year of rebirth. Fans have been waiting for this comeback, but don't call it that. Although it was her first match in over a year, Venus never left. The seven-time Grand Slam Champion shared this after that match, reports BET: "And there would be two weeks where I was like, 'Oh, God, it's not happening.' In an interview with Marie Claire UK, the often private tennis superstar opened up about her younger days coming up in the sport, her goals, and special tournaments. My dad had said, ‘Pick a tournament you want to win before any other.' Wimbledon is the pinnacle of tennis; it's one of the hardest sporting tickets to get, so I picked Wimbledon. And by the time I got there, me and dad kind of had a pact, like, here's the tournament you're going to win.” Venus didn't just win at Wimbledon, she dominated. She has held the Wimbledon trophy a remarkable five times throughout her career. Deemed a tennis prodigy, Venus' first serve reached 100 miles per hour when she was just 10 years old, she went pro at 14, and she was the first unseeded player to make a Grand Slam final at the US Open when she was just 18. In addition to four Olympic gold medals, seven Grand Slam singles titles, and 14 Grand Slam doubles titles, Venus was also a champion for women's equal pay in the sport and helped to achieve that milestone for women's tennis in 2007. Venus, the first Black woman to be ranked number one by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), is not just a tennis phenom and activist. She shared with Marie Claire UK, her love for fashion and design. “Design and wellness – this is kind of where I belong,” she shares. Venus has also recently published a book on wellness, Strive, it is the tennis icon's guide to physical and mental wellbeing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Open will once again offer the largest total prize pool in tennis history when it begins in New York later this month. The USTA announced Wednesday it will distribute $90 million to players, a 20 percent increase from the $75 million it offered last season. This year's men's and women's singles champions will each make $5 million, up from the $3.6 million that Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka took home last year. Notably, that includes the new-look mixed doubles event that will take place at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center the week before the singles main draw. The mixed doubles entry list includes eight of the top-10 men's players and six of the top-10 women, with two more teams still to be awarded wildcard entry. "I'm just going to state a fact," Novak Djokovic said at a news conference earlier this year in Australia. "The pie split between the governing bodies in major sports, all major American sports like NFL, NBA, baseball, NHL, is 50 percent. Ours is way lower than that." The Professional Tennis Players Association, an organization co-founded by Djokovic, filed an antitrust lawsuit earlier this year against the sports' governing bodies, including the ATP and WTA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a match that had everyone tuned in… and everyone had their own opinion on it and who they wanted to win. When Jannik Sinner finally lifted that Wimbledon trophy in July 2025, defeating the defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz, it finally seemed like validation of his position as the world No. Obviously, there were some pleased with the outcome, but there were some who weren't so sure – with Sinner having recently served a three-month suspension because of a doping controversy. But there are some who think he shouldn't have even been competing in the first place. So, let's go back to the beginning… Back in March 2024, Sinner twice tested positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid. He claimed that his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, used an over-the-counter spray that was bought by trainer Umberto Ferrara to treat an injured finger – and it was this particular spray that contained clostebol. Indeed, it had absolutely nothing to do with enhancing his performance, but it was simply negligence on the part of his team. Who knows… but an independent tribunal under the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) went on to rule that it was not the fault of Sinner – he was not to blame. However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) wasn't happy with the ruling, and they appealed it and pushed for a harsher ruling. So, rather than letting the case drag on and potentially risk a long ban, Sinner decided to go ahead and accept a three-month suspension, which went from February 9 to May 4, 2025… which (and this is the controversial part) meant that he wouldn't have to miss out on any of the Grand Slams. Barely one month after his suspension was done, he returned to the tour at the Italian Open and was back on form in no time. He made it through to the final at Roland Garros, and, following that, took the win at Wimbledon, where he not only managed to defend his world No. There are a number of experts, including Travis Tygart, the U.S. Anti‑Doping Agency chief, who was public in his support of Sinner. He insisted that Sinner was completely innocent of wrongdoing… and argued that anti‑doping standards can sometimes punish the victims of contamination and not just those who did it intentionally. He and other experts said that there are far more unlabelled substances in supplements and medical treatments than many people actually realise. And he went on to say that the tribunal's ruling was based on “balance of probability,” – and that Sinner's argument of being innocent and unaware of it was completely plausible. And Sinner himself accepted responsibility for what happened, saying, “I realize WADA's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love,” but he still doubled down on the fact that it was the result of an oversight by his entourage. However, there were many who saw it as a double standard. Some believed that if he didn't have the money and reputation to have a world-class legal defence at his disposal, he probably wouldn't have avoided a harsher ban. And both WADA and many other players were left questioning why a high-profile athlete ended up with such a lenient outcome. Some believe that had he been less wealthy, the same story might have ended a lot differently… maybe even in a year-long suspension Well, if you're looking at it strictly from a regulatory standpoint, then yes. Under the current anti-doping rules, if so, there's still the possibility that a longer ban, potentially up to two years, could be imposed – and this could retroactively strip him of his titles and rank points. But, until that, for now, his record stands. He accepted the ban that was given to him and stuck it out. Some were left questioning the fairness of it all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff will battle for another trophy on Wednesday night. It's been anything but an easy route to the final for Kessler and Gauff. The pair have had to win final set tiebreaks in their last three matches, including their semifinal win over Olga Danilovic and Su-wei Hsieh, in which they were a set down. A title for Gauff will serve as a much-needed boost for the American, who has struggled since her historic French Open win in May. A dismal grass-court campaign, which included back-to-back first-round exits in Berlin and Wimbledon, was followed by that fourth-round exit to Mboko. So, as Gauff prepares for her doubles final with Kessler, she hasn't shied away from trying to explain the "weird" difference in her serving ability in singles and doubles. “My doubles yesterday, I hit zero double faults,” she said. “You know, it's weird, I feel more pressure serving in doubles than in singles because I don't want to sit here and give the match away for my partner. Gauff, along with Kessler, will have to keep errors to a minimum if they are to win what will be a huge test in the final, as they face Taylor Townsend and Zhang Shuai. Third seeds Townsend and Shuai are an experienced doubles team with 25 titles between the pair, including their most recent Washington championship. While Gauff is no stranger to doubles success, having won the French Open in 2024, her partner Kessler has won zero. Furthermore, this American pairing is a new one, with Gauff going through several partners since she split with her long-term partner Jessica Pegula. Having played together at Wimbledon in 2024 - just a few weeks after Gauff teamed up with Katarina Siniakova to win the women's doubles at the French Open - the pair teamed up for a final team in Paris. Not long after the split, Pegula confirmed their intention to not play as much together, with both players choosing to focus on their singles career. "I know Coco isn't interested in playing, or at least I'm not, we're not thinking of playing, so I probably will take it easy on the doubles the rest of the year, so, yeah, we'll see," she said in 2024. Earlier this year, Pegula confirmed that they were no longer working together as a doubles team when quizzed on whether the pair might team up did not suggest a reunion was on the cards. “I mean, Coco and I played so much for a couple of years there," the heiress to the $7 billion Pegula family fortune said. Gauff has not played doubles in any of the majors this year, including at Roland Garros where she won the women's singles to claim a second career Grand Slam. Pegula has confirmed she will play alongside Tommy Paul at the U.S. Open. This service is provided on talkSPORT Limited's Terms of Use in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BBC presenter Qasa Alom has reflected on a recent health scare after working at Wimbledon, which saw him rushed to hospital, revealing it was a 'wake-up call'. Alom was the host of the Today at Wimbledon show for Britain's largest public broadcaster, a role he assumed in 2023. However, the Birmingham-born anchor pushed his body to its limit in order to work at tennis' most prestigious championships, despite knowledge of an illness that he has yet to disclose. That decision ended with Alom in an ambulance and on his way to hospital, and now the presenter has taken to Instagram to open up about the ordeal. 'I can't say the last few weeks have been easy,' Alom wrote. 'Ever since the middle of Wimbledon, I've been battling my body with a health issue. 'I put off getting proper medical care because I just did not want to miss The Championships (error). The post consisted of numerous pictures of Alom that range from being picked up in an ambulance to receiving treatment. 'A real wake-up call to all those health-conscious young seemingly fit people out there seeing this,' he continued. 'No matter how good your VO2 max might be; or what your resting heart rate is….no matter how many chia seeds you eat or interval fasts you can do….things can happen inside of our bodies that you can't control and it will completely knock you for six. When Clare Balding left the BBC's Today at Wimbledon show to lead the championships' coverage, following Sue Barker's departure, there was a vacancy to be filled. Alom, a huge tennis fan (and self-proclaimed tennis 'geek'), was the man to take the mantle from Balding. He previously presented a Radio 4 programme on one of the sport's most iconic stars, Arthur Ashe, and also takes an interest in cricket, rugby and athletics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Semifinal action at the ATP Toronto Masters promises two entertaining matches. Before the all-American battle, top seed Alexander Zverev can win his second title in Canada. The German had to play some of his most clutch tennis to end Alexei Popyrin's title defense in the quarterfinals. Reaching the final would be the bare minimum for Zverev, who took a month off after a disappointing first-round loss at Wimbledon. While Zverev has dominated Karen Khachanov in the head-to-head (5-2), he can overcomplicate things and lose all that momentum. His season has been so full of ups and downs, but patience is the rare element Zverev has shown all fortnight. Taylor Fritz is still ahead of Ben Shelton in the live rankings with a significant lead. And unless there is a shock turnaround of results in Cincinnati, Fritz is nailed on to secure a top-four seeding for the US Open. But Shelton can cut that lead, and with Fritz defending runner-up points in New York, his quest to become the new U.S. men's No. Shelton has improved considerably since their first meeting in Indian Wells two years ago, when he was competing in his first full season on tour. He was good enough to take a set from Fritz. What Shelton brings here is more than a big serve. He's also smarter in his court positioning and shot selection. There might be a gap between them in rankings, but not so much on the court. Your email address will not be published. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wednesday's Omnium Banque Nationale semifinals feature some of the usual starry suspects. There's Naomi Osaka, a four-time major winner and former World No. And there's Clara Tauson, sitting second in aces this season and at a career-high ranking, now on the verge of breaking into the Top 10 for the first time. A year ago this week, she was playing an ITF W50 in Zagreb, Croatia. And now, after improbably winning five matches on center court -- including a stunning upset of No. 1 seed Coco Gauff in 62 minutes – Mboko is into the final four riding a tsunami of momentum, backed by a wildly partisan crowd. It's a run reminiscent of Bianca Andreescu six years ago when she reached the Canadian Open semifinals as a teenager and went on to win the US Open. “I don't want to say there's really a secret,” she told reporters. “I think being calm in such stressful situations is key to kind of delivering what you want to do in those such tight moments. “The human reaction is always to kind of tense up and act out, but I think if I project calmness and relaxedness, I'm going to also have the same thing in my head. We make the case for all four semifinalists: Head-to-head: Rybakina won the only previous career meeting against Mboko 6-3 7-5 last week in Washington. The case for Rybakina: For those of you counting at home, this is her fifth semifinal of the year -- only World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka (nine) and Iga Swiatek (seven) have played more. This is also Rybakina's fourth hard-court semifinal, following Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Washington. Rybakina, 26, is the youngest player to reach back-to-back semifinals in Montréal since Caroline Wozniacki (2010-2012). When they played in Washington, Rybakina got a good look at this coming attraction. Rybakina's experience was the difference in their first meeting. While both players had three aces, Rybakina had only one double fault -- eight fewer than Mboko. Rybakina has hit 302 aces this year, more than any other woman. That will be the weapon she relies on most heavily. “I understand that a lot of people will cheer for her, and she's young,” Rybakina said. So that's going to be the goal.” After losing her first four career meetings against Top 20 opponents, Mboko won the most recent against Gauff. When Mboko defeated Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-4, 6-2 it was a more restrained fist pump. “I think that moment was just pure fight-or-flight kind of instincts,” Mboko said. “I really wanted to do the best I could to break her back, and I did everything in my power to stay in there and match her. “Every day I always want to move on to the next round, and I always want to reach for the gold and reach for the championship.” A decade ago, 18-year-old Belinda Bencic made the semis in Toronto -- and went on to collect her second career title. And do not discount the benefits of playing at home. Her coach, Nathalie Tauziat, certainly doesn't. “I don't know if she's better this week than Washington, but she have maybe more confidence, Vicky, so it can help,” Tauziat said. “The thing she have more than Rybakina this week is the public, so it can change maybe something. Head-to-head: Tauson, 1-0, via retirement with an Osaka abdominal injury earlier this year in Auckland after winning the first set 6-4. The case for Tauson:  She has beaten Top 10 players Iga Swiatek and Madison Keys back-to-back in straight sets. In a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Keys, Tauson was unbroken for the fourth time this year and won 31 of 40 first-serve points. More impressive, she was 10-for-17 on second serve.

I really wanted to come out here and show my best tennis for him. This is the seventh WTA Tour semifinal for Tauson -- and all of them have come on hardcourts, the surface that best supports her first-strike game. The three top WTA Tour players on hard courts this year: Sabalenka and Swiatek (23 victories), followed by Tauson and Keys with 22. Her 32 wins this year are more than in the previous three seasons combined. The case for Osaka: The 6-2, 6-2 victory over Elina Svitolina (in 69 minutes) was a statement win for Osaka. She's now won five of eight matches against the former World No. Osaka has won five consecutive WTA Tour matches for the first time since reaching the Miami Open's final in 2022, when she lost to then No. And, notably, the first time as a mother. Indeed, the 27-year-old is feeling the hard-court love that won her four major titles in four years, from 2018-2021. This is Osaka's best career result in Canada, and the good news is that Serena Williams, who ended her run in the 2019 quarterfinals in Toronto, has been long retired. This, after a 49-minute, 6-1, 6-0 win over Anastasija Sevastova in the Round of 16. Osaka is hitting freely, having survived two match points against Liudmila Samsonova. “I'm just having a lot of fun playing,” Osaka said in her on-court interview. I played her in Auckland this year. That was a really good goal for me. If anyone tunes in, my outfit is super fire.”</p>
