                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tulsi Gabbard refused to rule out whether late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein served as an “intelligence asset,” during an awkward interview grilling. The Director of National Intelligence sat down with New York Post columnist Miranda Devine on the “Pod Force One” podcast, which was released on Wednesday. The pair candidly discussed extra-terrestrial life, “Russiagate,” and Hillary Clinton's so-called “vendetta” against Gabbard. After speaking confidently about aliens and the mysterious drones that flew over New Jersey last year, the head of the country's intelligence nerve center suddenly appeared more reticent when Devine sprung a question about Epstein on her. Do you think there is any evidence that he could be, could've been, an intelligence asset, either for us or for foreign agencies?” the New York Post columnist asked towards the end of the interview. The DNI continued: “Um, if that were to change and there was some credible information or intelligence, um, that that did come to light, um, you know, the president has made clear if there's anything that's credible out there ‘put it out there for the American people to see,' and I would do exactly that.” She then suggested that the “mainstream media” was attempting to distract attention from President Trump's successes by dredging up the Epstein saga. It comes after recent reporting suggested that Epstein might have had links to the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad. The story, rejected by the former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, is propagated by some conservative commentators, including ex-Fox News star Tucker Carlson. “This accusation [of an Israeli connection] is a lie being peddled by prominent online personalities such as Tucker Carlson pretending they know things they don't,” Bennett said on July 14. In June last year, the Daily Beast exclusively reported that a former girlfriend and victim of Epstein claimed that he boasted of being a Mossad agent before raping her at his New York mansion. During their time together, Doe said, Epstein and his now jailed accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell hinted he was an agent for Mossad, just like Maxwell's father, Robert. Epstein's links to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and former CIA Director William Burns have led to wild speculation, creating conspiracy theories that the disgraced financier worked in intelligence. However, Adam Hickey, a former top official in the Department of Justice's national security division, suggested that the bust doesn't necessarily mean Epstein wasn't linked to an intel agency. “If you are working for the government—providing information to the government—that relationship is something that neither party necessarily wants to casually be discovered,” he said. Epstein's former lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, has denied the story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I think that ship has sailed,” Andrew Dabb, who served as the last showrunner of Supernatural, admits when it comes to the spinoff that wasn't picked up, Wayward Sisters. The episode aired in January 2018, then in May of that year, it was announced it would not be moving forward. When we spoke with Andrew Dabb about what could have been in the original series finale ending, if not for COVID shutting down production, we also had to ask about Wayward Sisters — especially once he mentioned that the pilot script he and Robert Berens wrote for it “is really good.” “I really do wish Wayward Sisters would've gone forward. We spent a lot of time building up to it,” he lamented. If Wayward Sisters had happened, “for me, the important thing was, in some ways, it was a little bit back to basics for Supernatural because you had this group of people, they weren't going to necessarily be dealing with angels and demons, at least certainly not right away,” Dabb shared with us. “That was very much kind of Sam and Dean's bailiwick.” And so with Wayward Sisters, “We wanted to focus on monsters. We wanted focus on kind of back to basics. And then the other thing that you'd have there, which you didn't have on Supernatural as much — you did in bits and pieces — was the formation of this team, which I thought was really cool and a process we had started,” he continued. “And then we were going to get into alternate realities, which, at this point now, they've been done so many times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tulsi Gabbard seems to have zero interest in publicly discussing UFOs. Gabbard is President Donald Trump's Director of National Intelligence. That makes her the ultimate authority on intelligence in America. She has access to America's most highly-classified secrets, and she's already declassified documents tied to several important topics, including the killings of JFK, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Has she also seen whatever is behind the curtain with UFOs? Tulsi Gabbard serves as the Director of National Intelligence. Gabbard was asked by Miranda Devine about UFOs on the "Pod Force One" podcast, and her response was…..interesting. Yeah, we're continuing to look for the truth and share that truth with the American people," Gabbard said when directly asked if she's discovered anything about UFOs. She's impressively sharp, and that's why I'm such a big fan. If the answer was no, I'm sure she just would have said it. Does that mean something has been found that is so secret it can't be disclosed to the public? Her intentionally vague answer is raising a lot more questions than it's answering. In fact, the DNI didn't answer anything at all! Gabbard subtly seemed to tease there might be something, but she just can't say whatever that might be. Tulsi Gabbard was intentionally vague when asked about UFOs. Do you think Gabbard found something about UFOs in the government's files or is it all hype for no reason?
