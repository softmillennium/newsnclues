                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Christian Pulisic gears up for his third season with Milan, both he and his Rossoneri teammates are set to face a game-changing new development in Italian soccer. The 2025-26 Serie A campaign will usher in a bold, transparent communication shift, one that will already be replicated in the Premier League next season. And while the full scope of these adjustments remains under wraps at kickoff, their impact is expected to be immediate and far-reaching. After years of controversy surrounding VAR decisions in Italian soccer, Serie A's governing bodies have taken the leap toward real-time transparency. Beginning this season, referees will announce VAR decisions directly to fans in stadiums and on television, providing context and clarity for some of the most debated moments in matches. “The big news for next season will be on-field announcements. “This is an important step forward in communication, which we have been managing transparently. This landmark move follows years of frustration from players, coaches, and fans who have been left in the dark during crucial game-altering decisions. In some infamous instances, VAR's lack of clarity turned post-match discussions into heated debates. These moments underscored the need for clear, live communication from officials — not just decisions handed down without explanation. “We won't impose strict time limits because every referee has their own style. This format was pioneered in MLS and trialed during the FIFA Club World Cup, receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback. In January, English referee Stuart Attwell made history by becoming the first to announce a VAR decision in real time during a Carabao Cup clash between Spurs and Liverpool. Rocchi emphasized that Italy will build on these examples but also keep its own nuances. As Milan prepares for a new campaign with Christian Pulisic, Santiago Gimenez, and Rafael Leao at the forefront of its attack, the club has finally finalized a deal that could reshape its midfield – and it comes with a historical twist. With speculation mounting over whether the Uruguayan forward will opt for Cristiano Ronaldo's Saudi Pro League or Christian Pulisic's Serie A, the soccer world waits for clarity. After two decades at Bayern Munich, Müller's move marks a new chapter both personally and professionally. World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olympique Marseille announced the signing of U.S. men's national team forward Tim Weah, completing a lengthy transfer saga that sees the 25-year-old depart Juventus. The move comes after a drawn-out process between Weah and Juventus. The American's agent Badou Sambague recently spoke out against the Turin club and its general manager Damien Comolli, claiming they showed Weah “total disrespect” by holding up his transfer. The move is now finally complete, though, ending Weah's time at Juventus. The USMNT star failed to leave his mark in Italy, recording just seven goals in 78 appearances. Much of his two-year stint with the Italian outfit was marred by injury and inconsistent minutes. Weah is in for a fresh start with his return to France. The 25-year-old began his career at Paris Saint-Germain and then played for Lille before joining Juventus in June 2023. “Timothy Weah has a passion that doesn't dazzle, but lights his way with humility and determination,” Marseille wrote in a club statement. “Far from being in the shadows, he has become a discreet light in his own right, determined to make a name for himself.” The pressure will be on Weah to succeed at his new club with the 2026 FIFA World Cup just one year away.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KC 2026 tells KMBC the deadline to sign up is fast approaching: Sept. 15. The group's focus right now is on recruiting teachers and college students, so KC 2026 is planning on setting up recruitment efforts at Mizzou and KU's campuses, as well as other community events throughout the KC metro. They're great listeners," said Lori Thomas, director of volunteer operations. As of right now, KC 2026 tells KMBC it has approximately 8,000 volunteers signed up. "If you speak multiple languages, then you could be elevated into a different type of role that would help those that speak a specific language," Thomas said. KC 2026 adds that it is hoping to reach out to companies in the area that could give their employees some paid time off to be a part of one of the biggest sporting events in the world. “The biggest perk is you get up to a 10-piece uniform. It's an Adidas uniform, FIFA volunteer branded, including shoes, so everybody — and like a fanny pack — and everybody's saying 'Oh, I'm in for the fanny pack,'" Thomas said. KC 2026 tells KMBC that volunteers will receive food and drinks during their shifts. Right now, KC 2026 leaders are working out a plan to map out where volunteer trainings will happen, and the group will be opening up a volunteer center from October 2025 through July 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The MLS is back in the limelight in world soccer after Heung-min Son decided to leave Tottenham before the start of the new Premier League season to join Los Angeles FC, a signing with a major impact on soccer in the United States. On the other hand, this important arrival does not prevent other important names from opting to leave the league, especially for Brazilian soccer. According to the latest reports, Fluminense (who played in the semi-final of the FIFA Club World Cup against Chelsea) are very close to signing Luciano Acosta, an Argentinian player who came through the ranks at Boca Juniors and is one of FC Dallas' key players. With the arrival of the Argentine striker, Fluminense will have a great reinforcement for the remainder of the Brasileirão season (which started in April this year), with a 31-year-old right-footed attacking midfielder who has a lot of finishing power. The Argentine has made 173 appearances, scoring 61 goals and providing 54 assists since joining FC Cincinnati, and has also been speculated about by other Brazilian teams such as Corinthians and Atlético-MG since then. However, it's important to note that Luciano is going through a low point in his career. Unlike last year, when he scored 15 goals and added 19 assists, the Argentine has only scored 7 goals in 2025 in the MLS, contributing one assist. Obviously, FC Dallas' collective performance is also contributing negatively to this. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reigning Italian champions Napoli reportedly have their sights set on acquiring U.S. men's national team midfielder Yunus Musah this summer. Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio reports Napoli have revitalized their interest in Musah. Milan is expected to be asking for €30 million ($35 million) for Musah despite his rather inconsistent form. The former Valencia standout had moments of brilliance at San Siro, but he ultimately spent long spells on the bench after a string of underwhelming performances in 2024–25. With the Rossoneri signing Luka Modrić, Samuele Ricci and Ardon Jashari this summer, Musah's already limited role in the team will likely be even further reduced. If the American wants to play next season, he will be eyeing an exit, and playing for the Italian champions under Antonio Conte might be too good an offer to pass up. Plus, it is in the USMNT's best interest for Musah to be in an environment that allows him to grow his game ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The 22-year-old got off to a fast start under new boss Mauricio Pochettino, recording a goal and an assist in his first four appearances, but he soon disappointed in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals and third-place match. Musah also did not feature in the 2025 Gold Cup, opting to skip the tournament along with almost all of the Stars and Stripes' starting XI. Even a player with as bright a future as Musah will struggle to break into Pochettino's lineup next summer if he is not performing for his club team—just look at Gio Reyna and Matt Turner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turner came from nowhere to become a top performer in MLS – he didn't even play organized soccer until he was 14 – and rose all the way up in the ranks to become the USMNT's first choice at the 2022 World Cup and earn a move to Arsenal. The last few years have proven to be challenging, however, and now, 10 months out from the next World Cup, he needs a reset. New England is an ideal spot for him to do it, but for reasons that go far beyond the simple fact that this was where he played more than 100 games between 2016 and 2022 and built up his name. Sure, it is nice that he's coming back to a familiar spot. His wife is from the area, he has a young family and there will be a level of comfort. It is possible to lose your sense of gravity. Playing time at Arsenal, then Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, has not been easy to come by. That kind of environment naturally affects a player's confidence. At Palace most recently, it was very clear that Dean Henderson was the first choice and the main focus. Then, when Turner was transferred to Lyon by Forest earlier in the summer, the whole situation became complicated by the French club's highly-publicized financial issues, which briefly included a forced relegation scare. So after all of that, how can Turner reclaim his top form, and why is New England the place to do it? I spoke on Tuesday with Kevin Hitchcock, the Revs' long-serving goalkeeping coach and whose presence is one of the main reasons why I think this move makes so much sense. Hitchcock is like the goalkeeper whisperer, one of the very best coaches for that position that you could find. After working with him, Turner transferred to Arsenal for $6m in 2022. In 2023, Djordje Petrović commanded around $18m plus add-ons from Chelsea. Aljaž Ivačič has improved drastically and recorded a career-high eight clean sheets this season, along with a solid 2.5 percent increase in his save percentage from last year. Hitchcock believes that over the past couple of seasons, Turner has found himself stuck in a difficult space, although not from lack of effort, but from the psychological weight of knowing that, no matter how well he trained, a real opportunity might never come. I've been there, and it can be paralyzing. But now, with a fresh dynamic and mutual respect between them, Hitchcock feels well-positioned to challenge Turner in ways he hasn't been pushed in a while to reignite the fire and bring out his very best. Hitchcock thinks it will take two weeks to bring back the sharpness, and the process of getting him back to his best will continue in the months ahead. Turner is a very vocal goalkeeper, which can help the New England backline. He will be asked to do more and to be accountable for organizing what has been a back five for most of the season, mostly featuring wingbacks Peyton Miller and Ilay Feingold, with Mamadou Fofana, Tanner Beason and Brayan Ceballos in the middle. The first challenge will also be an important one. Both his mindset and Hitchcock's are to get him back in position as U.S. No. 1, with the annual January training camp a firm target. For me, Hitchcock's input is going to be crucial. If Turner has had a lack of direction in terms of coaching, having been second-choice at his English clubs, he now has a coach who every day wants to push him to be better on certain drills and will emphasize the repetition of those drills. Of course, all will also depend on how committed Turner is to getting back to his best and the level of effort he puts in. Rewind nine years: Turner and I spent a lot of time together at the Revolution. It was a difficult time for me, as my sons had been born prematurely and then-coach Jay Heaps had given me permission to not train as frequently so I could spend time at the hospital. So I would try to make up for it at other times, and from the start Turner would always come up to me and say he was there for whatever I needed. He was young for a keeper, around 22, he was third on the depth chart and just making his way in the league. I would grab a couple of bags of balls and practice my finishing, and he would be there facing the shots for as long as I wanted. That's how he was then and I don't think it has changed. Having been a late bloomer, he knew this was his opportunity, and he was going to work as hard as needed, which meant we were able to help each other. That describes what kind of guy he is. His personality is great for the locker room. He would also hang out with all the guys, he wasn't one of those members of the goalkeepers club that would only spend time with other keepers. No one had a bad word to say about him. The foot movement and timing just weren't there, but he worked relentlessly at it. For that top USMNT spot, he is competing against guys who are also in MLS. He is not up against Premier League players like Tim Howard and Brad Guzan from previous years. It is Matt Freese, whom Mauricio Pochettino started over Turner during the Gold Cup, Zack Steffen (who has had some injury woes), Patrick Schulte and Chris Brady. When Turner is playing regularly and is sharp and in tune with himself, he can be the best of the whole bunch. His distribution is good enough at the international level. What we have seen from him recently is not the real Matt Turner, because that's what happens when you are not playing consistently. Even warming up before facing Panama at the Concacaf Nations League earlier this year, he looked a little slow to react, and the goalkeeping coach was scoring on him in the corner. His typical pushoff and explosiveness were not there. At the end of the game when Panama scored, Cecilio Waterman didn't hit his strike with great technique, but Turner didn't have the pushoff to get to what was a very savable shot. The psychological part of being a goalkeeper should not be underestimated. Decisiveness, confidence, reading each step of the game, it all drops off when you don't play. What he really wants is the feeling of being a vital player on a team again, being relied upon consistently in tough moments and the magical feeling of making big saves again. You never know if a move is going to have the perfect ending. Modern soccer comes with so much unpredictability, Turner has had highs and lows, especially recently, winning the FA Cup with Crystal Palace, then the drama around his move to Lyon, and now coming back home, just weeks apart. This change has the right feel about it though, and the prize if it goes well is clear and obvious.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turner came from nowhere to become a top performer in MLS – he didn't even play organized soccer until he was 14 – and rose all the way up in the ranks to become the USMNT's first choice at the 2022 World Cup and earn a move to Arsenal. The last few years have proven to be challenging, however, and now, 10 months out from the next World Cup, he needs a reset. New England is an ideal spot for him to do it, but for reasons that go far beyond the simple fact that this was where he played more than 100 games between 2016 and 2022 and built up his name. Sure, it is nice that he's coming back to a familiar spot. His wife is from the area, he has a young family and there will be a level of comfort. It is possible to lose your sense of gravity. Playing time at Arsenal, then Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, has not been easy to come by. That kind of environment naturally affects a player's confidence. At Palace most recently, it was very clear that Dean Henderson was the first choice and the main focus. Then, when Turner was transferred to Lyon by Forest earlier in the summer, the whole situation became complicated by the French club's highly-publicized financial issues, which briefly included a forced relegation scare. So after all of that, how can Turner reclaim his top form, and why is New England the place to do it? I spoke on Tuesday with Kevin Hitchcock, the Revs' long-serving goalkeeping coach and whose presence is one of the main reasons why I think this move makes so much sense. Hitchcock is like the goalkeeper whisperer, one of the very best coaches for that position that you could find. After working with him, Turner transferred to Arsenal for $6m in 2022. In 2023, Djordje Petrović commanded around $18m plus add-ons from Chelsea. Aljaž Ivačič has improved drastically and recorded a career-high eight clean sheets this season, along with a solid 2.5 percent increase in his save percentage from last year. Hitchcock believes that over the past couple of seasons, Turner has found himself stuck in a difficult space, although not from lack of effort, but from the psychological weight of knowing that, no matter how well he trained, a real opportunity might never come. I've been there, and it can be paralyzing. But now, with a fresh dynamic and mutual respect between them, Hitchcock feels well-positioned to challenge Turner in ways he hasn't been pushed in a while to reignite the fire and bring out his very best. Turner is a very vocal goalkeeper, which can help the New England backline. He will be asked to do more and to be accountable for organizing what has been a back five for most of the season, mostly featuring wingbacks Peyton Miller and Ilay Feingold, with Mamadou Fofana, Tanner Beason and Brayan Ceballos in the middle. The first challenge will also be an important one. Both his mindset and Hitchcock's are to get him back in position as U.S. No. 1, with the annual January training camp a firm target. For me, Hitchcock's input is going to be crucial. If Turner has had a lack of direction in terms of coaching, having been second-choice at his English clubs, he now has a coach who every day wants to push him to be better on certain drills and will emphasize the repetition of those drills. Of course, all will also depend on how committed Turner is to getting back to his best and the level of effort he puts in. Rewind nine years: Turner and I spent a lot of time together at the Revolution. It was a difficult time for me, as my sons had been born prematurely and then-coach Jay Heaps had given me permission to not train as frequently so I could spend time at the hospital. So I would try to make up for it at other times, and from the start Turner would always come up to me and say he was there for whatever I needed. He was young for a keeper, around 22, he was third on the depth chart and just making his way in the league. I would grab a couple of bags of balls and practice my finishing, and he would be there facing the shots for as long as I wanted. That's how he was then and I don't think it has changed. Having been a late bloomer, he knew this was his opportunity, and he was going to work as hard as needed, which meant we were able to help each other. That describes what kind of guy he is. His personality is great for the locker room. He would also hang out with all the guys, he wasn't one of those members of the goalkeepers club that would only spend time with other keepers. No one had a bad word to say about him. The foot movement and timing just weren't there, but he worked relentlessly at it. For that top USMNT spot, he is competing against guys who are also in MLS. He is not up against Premier League players like Tim Howard and Brad Guzan from previous years. It is Matt Freese, whom Mauricio Pochettino started over Turner during the Gold Cup, Zack Steffen (who has had some injury woes), Patrick Schulte and Chris Brady. When Turner is playing regularly and is sharp and in tune with himself, he can be the best of the whole bunch. His distribution is good enough at the international level. What we have seen from him recently is not the real Matt Turner, because that's what happens when you are not playing consistently. Even warming up before facing Panama at the Concacaf Nations League earlier this year, he looked a little slow to react, and the goalkeeping coach was scoring on him in the corner. His typical pushoff and explosiveness were not there. At the end of the game when Panama scored, Cecilio Waterman didn't hit his strike with great technique, but Turner didn't have the pushoff to get to what was a very savable shot. The psychological part of being a goalkeeper should not be underestimated. Decisiveness, confidence, reading each step of the game, it all drops off when you don't play. What he really wants is the feeling of being a vital player on a team again, being relied upon consistently in tough moments and the magical feeling of making big saves again. You never know if a move is going to have the perfect ending. Modern soccer comes with so much unpredictability, Turner has had highs and lows, especially recently, winning the FA Cup with Crystal Palace, then the drama around his move to Lyon, and now coming back home, just weeks apart. This change has the right feel about it though, and the prize if it goes well is clear and obvious.

Federation takes action after the holders pulled out of this month's Super Cup citing player fatigue

Al-Hilal will be banned from next year's Saudi Super Cup if they qualify, after their recent withdrawal from this month's four-team competition in Hong Kong.

The Saudi Arabia Football Federation's (SAFF) disciplinary and ethics committee announced the decision on Tuesday.

It came after holders Al-Hilal pulled out of the Super Cup, scheduled to be played in Hong Kong from August 19 to 23, citing player fatigue following their Club World Cup campaign. They lost 2-1 to Fluminense in the quarter-finals on July 4.

“Al-Hilal refused to participate in the Saudi Super Cup for the 2025-2026 season after the official schedule for the competition was issued,” the disciplinary committee said in a statement.

“As a result, the committee ruled that Al-Hilal had violated Article (59-3) of the Disciplinary and Ethics Regulations and fined the club 500,000 Saudi Riyals (US$133,000) to be paid to the SAFF,” the statement added.</p>
