                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It feels like history is slowly not repeating, but echoing,” tribe secretary William “Popeye” Osceola says. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. When William “Popeye” Osceola first learned about the construction of a sprawling immigration detention facility on land adjacent to the Miccosukee Reservation in the Florida Everglades, his first reaction was “shock and disgust.” “I found out about it basically when everybody else found out about it, which, considering our tribal nation status with the government, that's obviously an issue,” Osceola said in an interview. “Something so major is happening here in this environmentally damaged area.” The facility, nicknamed by the Trump administration as “Alligator Alcatraz,” was built in near-total secrecy at a decommissioned airfield in Collier County without any environmental impact study or tribal consultation, the lawsuit claims. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. “We are trying to just make sure we follow our constitutional duty to preserve our land and resources for future generations. It names the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Florida Division of Emergency Management, and Miami-Dade County as defendants. Tribal members use the surrounding area for subsistence hunting, fishing, ceremonies, and schooling. Their spiritual practices depend on dark skies and unpolluted water. Their sovereignty, they argue, has once again been ignored. “We've always been fighting for this land,” said Osceola. Federal officials, by contrast, said they did not take a position on the tribe's intervention. The tribe's motion to intervene underscores the immediate and long-term dangers posed by the detention center: environmental degradation; contamination of downstream water sources; endangered species disruption; and cultural harm from noise, lights, and militarized surveillance. You just have all these added vehicles coming through here,” Osceola said. Ron DeSantis hosted a press conference in Marco Island on July 18 celebrating an agreement with the Army Corps of Engineers to accelerate the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir, a project he called “historic” and a testament to Florida's environmental leadership. When asked whether any environmental impact reviews had been conducted for the new detention facility, DeSantis dismissed the question, claiming the site operates on an “existing footprint” and that no harm would be done to surrounding lands or waters. “There's like a fence line, and they're doing the operations. “It feels like history is slowly not repeating, but echoing,” said Osceola. The facility, which will reportedly cost over $450 million annually to maintain, is poised to be partially reimbursed with Federal Emergency Management Agency funds — diverting emergency resources in the middle of hurricane season and undermining the very resilience Florida leaders claim to champion. “We must take legal action to compel the parties to remove this facility, given its outsized budgetary, environmental, community safety, and logistical impacts,” Cypress said. “We are hopeful that the administrations will change course and preserve these lands.” Prism is an independent and nonprofit newsroom led by journalists of color.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. The Trump administration's mass detention and deportation agenda has meant lucrative contracts for GEO Group. The company is under contract for approximately 20,000 beds at 21 facilities, “the highest level of ICE utilization in our company's history,” Zoley said. Zoley said that the Trump administration's plan to detain people on military bases is another potential source of revenue for the company, and that they're identifying “existing ICE facilities where we can add approximately 5,000 combined beds using temporary and permanent facilities.” “All of these efforts are aimed at placing our company in the best competitive position possible to pursue what we continue to believe are unprecedented growth opportunities as a long standing support services provider for ICE with a 40 year long track record,” he said. GEO Group also expects to profit from increased electronic monitoring of immigrants. In July, GEO Group gave raises to Zoley and the company's CEO. The company has been repeatedly accused of detaining people in inhumane conditions. People imprisoned at Delaney Hall, the lock-up in Newark, New Jersey, have reported that they're denied food, access to clean water, medication and visits with their family. But on the call, there was no mention of human rights abuses or families torn apart. With good reason, executives were optimistic about the company's future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many key figures who now serve in the Trump administration pledged to do exactly that. On Wednesday night, that will take the form of top officials strategizing at Vice President JD Vance's residence, CNN is now reporting. And that's in large part because a growing chorus of Epstein's victims and their allies now suggest there could indeed be a cover-up afoot. But repeatedly in recent days and weeks, those victims and allies have stepped forward to raise serious questions about the Trump administration's handling of the matter. They've complained about favorable treatment of convicted Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. They've invoked the phrase “cover-up” on at least three occasions. Last week, family members of one of Epstein's and Maxwell's most prominent accusers, Virginia Giuffre, cited Trump's recent admission that he had been aware that Epstein recruited Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. In another letter, Giuffre family members and other accusers also cited the still-unexplained prison transfer of Maxwell to a lower-security prison camp that sex offenders like her don't appear eligible for, without a waiver. That news came shortly after Maxwell, who's serving a 20-year sentence, was interviewed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. And it comes as Trump has dangled the possibility of pardoning Maxwell, who's appealing her conviction. “This move smacks of a cover up,” they wrote. Two attorneys who have represented Epstein accusers, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, said in a letter Tuesday that they were given no notice of Maxwell's transfer or any chance to object. That letter was one of several entered into the record as part of proceedings over whether to unseal grand jury testimony from the investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. And some of those letters have also raised concerns about a cover-up. One unnamed victim in her letter appeared to cite a Bloomberg report that the FBI has redacted the names of Trump and other prominent public figures in the Epstein files – a report that CNN hasn't confirmed. Her lawyer cited the Justice Department's statement last month that it would not release “information related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes. “Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover up,” Farmer's lawyer said. Farmer previously told The New York Times that she urged law enforcement and the FBI two decades ago to look more broadly into Epstein's associates, including Trump, who was friendly with Epstein but has said they had a falling out. There is no evidence of Trump's involvement in Epstein's crimes, and Farmer said she had no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump. Also suggesting a cover-up last month was Alicia Arden, who alleged that Epstein assaulted her in 1997. Arden told NBC News that she supported Trump but believed “there's a cover-up of some kind going on.” She cited Attorney General Pam Bondi's comments in February indicating she had Epstein's client list on her desk – comments Bondi and the White House now claim referred to other Epstein-related documents. Another anonymous Epstein accuser told NBC: “I am not surprised Trump is now saying we should stop talking about Epstein,” adding, “These people are trying to protect themselves.” And David Boies, a prominent attorney who represented Giuffre, told NBC: “I think they ought to release the material after promising, and if they don't, people will believe they are hiding something, and that cannot be tolerated.” While Epstein-related conspiracy theories have been mostly pushed by Republicans and right-wing influencers, polls suggest large swaths of Americans buy into them, at least to some degree. A CBS News-YouGov poll last month found Americans agreed 92-8% that the Epstein files “probably include damaging information about powerful or wealthy people.” A Reuters-Ipsos poll showed Americans agreed 69-6% that the federal government was “hiding information” about Epstein's clients and 60-12% that it was covering up details of his death (with many doubting he died by suicide, as the administration affirmed he did). The comments of Epstein's victims and their allies would seem to bolster that pre-existing belief. And that makes it a lot harder to claim there's nothing to see here – whether for Trump or the many people who have built followings by pushing these theories.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After declining last year, the number of international applications for undergraduate study in the U.K. this fall grew by 2.2 per cent with a record number coming from China.Joe Giddens/The Associated Press In China, wait times for U.S. visa interviews are so long that some students have given up. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been pressuring U.S. colleges to reduce their dependence on international enrolment while adding new layers of scrutiny for foreign students as part of its crackdown on immigration. The U.S. government has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism. In the spring, it abruptly revoked the legal status of thousands of international students, including some whose only brush with law enforcement was a traffic ticket. Harvard files legal challenge over Trump's ban on entry of foreign students New international enrolment in the U.S. could drop by 30 per cent to 40 per cent this fall, according to an analysis of visa and enrolment data by NAFSA, an agency that promotes international education. Many international students pay full price, so their absence would also hurt college budgets. As the second most popular destination for international students, Britain is positioned to benefit. A record number of applications came from China, up 10 per cent compared with the previous year. Applications from the U.S. also reached nearly 8,000 students – an increase of 14 per cent and a 20-year high. Acceptances of international students for graduate programs in the U.K. grew an estimated 10 per cent from last year, driven by demand for business and management courses in particular, according to data from UniQuest, which works with many British universities on admissions. Data showing the extent of any impact will not be available until fall, said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services, a consultancy that works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Trump administration freezes $108-million at Duke amid probe into alleged antisemitism, DEI policies Demand from Chinese students has risen rapidly for universities in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, said Will Kwong, managing director of AAS Education, a consultancy in Hong Kong. Many Western universities have offshore campuses there that are more affordable than going to the U.S. or U.K. “Opting for study in Asia has been a trend since the easing of COVID-19,” Kwong said. Chinese college student Alisa, who is studying data science, plans to attend an exchange program this fall at the University of California, Berkeley. Hong Kong University said it has received over 500 inquiries from students in the U.S. and is processing around 200 applications for transfer. At another school, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, international undergraduate applications have surged by 40 per cent from last year, said Alison Lloyd, associate provost on institutional data and research. Countries including the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in attracting international students by partnering with universities elsewhere to host branch campuses. Dubai, which has designs on becoming a global education hub, hosts dozens of international institutions' satellite campuses. Illinois Tech and the University of Arizona are among colleges offering degree programs in the Central Asian country, drawing students mostly from China and Russia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina has spoken out about the deluge of hateful abuse she received online from frustrated gamblers after losing a match in Canada, including messages wishing her death and celebrating Russia killing her compatriots. Following her straight-sets loss to Naomi Osaka in the quarterfinals of the National Bank Open on Tuesday night, Svitolina posted screenshots of the messages on Instagram. The abuse was directed at her, while other racial slurs also targeted her husband, the French tennis player Gaël Monfils, who is Black. One abuser hoped that Russia “kills all you (expletive) Ukrainians” in the war raging in Svitolina's country. Sports betting is legal and growing more popular. Harassment of athletes by angry gamblers is rising too “To all the bettors: I'm a mom before I'm an athlete,” Svitolina wrote in her Instagram story. Earlier this year, British player Katie Boulter said she received death threats during the French Open targeting her and her family, while the WTA and ITF called on betting companies to do more to stem the flood of online abuse players face on social media. Boulter told the BBC in an interview that online abuse has become the norm and that she thinks many of the messages are sent by people who are placing bets on tennis matches. Her comments coincided with the WTA and ITF publishing a first season-wide report into online abuse, showing that 458 tennis players were targeted by more than 8,000 abusive comments and posts on social media in 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A decision by the US government to incinerate more than $9.7m (£7.3m) of contraceptives is projected to result in 174,000 unintended pregnancies and 56,000 unsafe abortions in five African countries. The contraceptives, many of which will not expire until 2027-29, had already been manufactured, packaged and ready for distribution. Their destruction will deny more than 1.4 million women and girls in the five countries access to lifesaving care, IPPF said. Marie Evelyne Petrus-Barry, the Africa regional director of IPPF, said: “This decision to destroy ready-to-use commodities is appalling and extremely wasteful. These lifesaving medical supplies were destined to countries where access to reproductive care is already limited, and in some cases, part of a broader humanitarian response, such as in the DRC. This shortage has directly impacted clients' choices regarding family planning uptake.” In Mali, women will be denied access to 1.2m oral contraceptives and 95,800 implants, amounting to almost a quarter (24%) of the country's annual need. In Zambia, women will go without 48,400 implants and 295,000 injectable contraceptives, while in Kenya 108,000 women will not have access to contraceptive implants. Stockpiles of long-term contraceptives had already run out, she said, which will have drastic consequences on women's health and their sexual and reproductive rights. “These systemic setbacks come at a time when unmet need for contraception remains high,” she said. “Nearly one in five girls aged 15 to 19 are already pregnant or has given birth. Unsafe abortions remain among the five leading causes of maternal deaths in Kenya. While the Kenyan constitution, adopted in 2010, allows for abortion when a pregnant person's life or health is at risk, the Kenyan penal code of 1963 still criminalises it. Munyasia said without adequate supplies of contraceptives there would be a rise in maternal mortality as a result of women seeking to end unintended pregnancies.</p>

Denmark's state-run postal service, PostNord, announced that it would cease letter deliveries at the end of 2025 due to the impact of digitalization. As 95% of its residents now use the Digital Post service, Denmark has seen a 90% decline in letter volumes since 2000, from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year. On top of that, the Postal Act of 2024 removes the government's obligation to provide universal mail service and puts an end to postal exemptions from value-added tax, raising the cost of a single letter to 29 Danish krone (US$4.20).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move follows a December 2024 exchange of potential exhumation sites between Ukraine and Poland. Exhumation is a sore spot in Ukrainian-Polish relations, particularly surrounding the Volyn massacres between 1943-1945, during which the Ukrainian Insurgent Army killed tens of thousands of Poles. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed by Polish militants in retaliation. The first exhumation on Ukrainian soil since 2017 began in April in the former village of Puzhnyky, Ternopil Oblast, marking what officials on both sides called a breakthrough after years of a de facto moratorium. The ban was imposed by Ukraine following acts of vandalism targeting Ukrainian memorials in Poland. During the exchange late last year, Poland suggested over 13 locations for exhumations, while Ukraine provided four. Work is currently underway at Zboiska cemetery in Lviv, where the remains of Polish soldiers killed during the early stages of World War II are being exhumed for reburial. According to Nadzhos, the first exhumations of Ukrainian remains in Poland will begin in the village of Yurechkova following a preparatory visit scheduled for mid-August. Nadzhos said Ukraine is trying to lower political tension by conducting joint search operations and respecting Polish concerns. While defense and diplomatic cooperation between Ukraine and Poland has intensified since Russia's full-scale invasion, historical disputes continue to complicate Ukraine's aspirations for European integration. Polish leaders have at times suggested that Kyiv's EU path could be slowed unless further progress is made on resolving these issues.

Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow on Aug. 6 for high-level talks as Trump's deadline for a Ukraine deal draws near.

Asher Watkins, 52, of Texas, died on 3 August while tracking a 1.3-ton Cape buffalo in South Africa's Limpopo province, according to a statement from Coenraad Vermaak Safaris (CV Safaris), the company that organized the hunting trip. “On Sunday 3rd August, while on a hunting safari with us in South Africa's Limpopo Province, Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers,” the statement adds. “This is a devastating incident, and our hearts go out to his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” the company said, adding that it is “doing everything we can to support the family members who are here with us and those back in the United States as they navigate this tragic loss”. Metro reported that Watkins' brother Amon, mother Gwen and stepfather Tony were waiting for him at the safari lodge when the incident occurred, and CV Safaris also said it was in touch with Watkins's teenage daughter, Savannah, and his ex-wife, Courtney. Watkins's ex-wife also reportedly confirmed his death on social media, according to People magazine, writing that Watkins died on Sunday “suddenly in a tragic accident involving a Cape buffalo while on a hunting trip in South Africa”. “It's a reality that's still hard to put into words,” she added. A Texas native and Baylor University graduate, Watkins was a managing partner at Watkins Ranch Group, affiliated with Briggs Freeman and LIV Sotheby's International Realty. Watkins had a Facebook page where he shared hunting photos, often posing beside animals he had killed, including deer and mountain lions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no place in the European Union for Ukraine because it is not a civilized country, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, referring to Kiev's refusal to investigate the case of ethnic Hungarian Jozsef Sebestyen, killed while being forcibly conscripted in Ukraine's Transcarpathia Region. According to the diplomat, if something like that happened "in a normal, civilized country," those responsible would have long been punished. "Forced mobilization is a state policy there. There is no place for such a country in the European Union; it is not a civilized country," Szijjarto pointed out in The Fighters' Hour program on YouTube. The Ukrainian authorities "have in fact admitted that the forceful mobilization campaign, which involves beatings, is a routine practice, approved, paid-for and managed by the government," the Hungarian foreign minister said. Reports from Kiev say that Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation refused to look into Sebestyen's case, citing a lack of evidence. The man's family wrote on social media that in mid-June, Ukrainian security officers had captured him on the street in Beregovo, forcibly took him to a conscription office and beat him up for not being willing to go to the front. On July 6, he died of injuries in the hospital. Hungary imposed sanctions on three Ukrainian military commanders responsible for human rights violations during the forced mobilization campaign and officially called on the EU to do the same. Budapest pointed out to Brussels that evidence of the Ukrainian authorities' brutal forced conscription was available in Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Michael O'Flaherty's recent report on the situation in Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff held “useful and constructive” talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, a Kremlin aide said, two days before the expiry of a deadline set by President Donald Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions. Witkoff met Putin for around three hours on a last-minute mission to seek a breakthrough in the three-and-a-half-year war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said the two sides had exchanged “signals” on the Ukraine issue and discussed the possibility of developing strategic co-operation between Moscow and Washington, but declined to give more details until Witkoff had reported back to Trump. Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who earlier greeted Witkoff on arrival and strolled with him in a park near the Kremlin, posted on social media: “Dialogue will prevail.” Trump, increasingly frustrated with Putin over the lack of progress toward peace, has threatened to impose heavy tariffs on countries that buy Russian exports. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington would have more to say later on Wednesday when asked if sanctions on Russia would go into effect later this week following Witkoff's meeting with Putin. He said he had spoken with Witkoff, who was on his way back from Russia, and would have more discussions throughout the day, adding there would hopefully be some announcements soon. The Kremlin says threats to penalize countries that trade with Russia are illegal. Ushakov, who was present, told Russian news outlet Zvezda: “We had a very useful and constructive conversation.” U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff held 'useful and constructive' talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, a Kremlin aide said. Bloomberg and independent Russian news outlet The Bell reported that the Kremlin might propose a moratorium on air strikes by Russia and Ukraine – an idea that was mentioned last week by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko during a meeting with Putin. Ukraine continues to strike Russian refineries and oil depots, which it has hit many times. Zelensky said on Wednesday that Russia had attacked a gas pumping station in southern Ukraine in what he called a deliberate and cynical blow to preparations for the winter heating season. Russia said it had hit gas infrastructure supplying the Ukrainian military. “Russia will insist it is prepared to have a ceasefire, but (only) under the conditions that it has formulated for the last two or three years already,” he said in a telephone interview. “Trump will be under pressure to do what he has announced – to raise tariffs for all the countries buying oil and gas, and uranium probably as well, from Russia.” The Russian leader does not want to anger Trump, and he realizes that he may be spurning a chance to improve relations with Washington and the West, but his war goals are more important to him, two of the sources said. Putin's conditions for peace include a legally binding pledge NATO will not expand eastwards, Ukrainian neutrality, protection for Russian speakers and acceptance of Russia's territorial gains in the war, Russian sources have said. Zelensky has said Ukraine would never recognize Russia's sovereignty over its conquered regions and that Kyiv retains the sovereign right to decide whether it wants to join NATO.

"A Russian Armed Forces serviceman cynically opened fire from an ambush set up in a ruined building and killed the passerby with an automatic weapon," the statement reads. Authorities said the killing has been officially entered into the Unified Register of Pre-trial Investigations under charges related to war crimes resulting in death. Donetsk Oblast has remained one of the most active combat zones since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Civilian evacuations from contested or occupied areas remain extremely dangerous, with Russian forces repeatedly accused of targeting non-combatants. Ukraine and its international partners have documented numerous cases of alleged war crimes by Russian forces, including unlawful killings, torture, and the targeting of civilian infrastructure.

"Russian Presidential Special Envoy Kirill Dmitriev met Steven Witcoff at the Vnukovo airport," the source said. Last time Witkoff came to Moscow for talks on April 25, and before that he was in St. Petersburg on April 11. Both times, Russian President Vladimir Putin held meetings with him. Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that he could impose sanctions on Russia on August 9 if a settlement to the Ukrainian crisis could not be reached by that time. However, he noted that Russia was doing a good job of handling sanctions. When asked whether Russia could avoid sanctions from the current US administration, Trump said that this requires closing a deal as a result people would stop dying. On July 14, Trump said that the US would impose import duties of approximately 100% on Russia and its trading partners if Moscow and Washington did not reach an agreement on a settlement in Ukraine within 50 days. On August 5, Trump noted that the US would later decide whether to impose the import duties. According to him, the US's further steps would depend on the outcome of the upcoming talks of his special envoy Steven Witkoff in Moscow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MICHAEL JOHNSTON is Charles A. Dana Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Colgate University. Whether he is launching cryptocurrency schemes or accepting a Qatari jumbo jet or issuing pardons for the relatives of major donors, Donald Trump has drawn frequent accusations of corruption in the early months of his second term as U.S. president. Each instance of corruption raises critical concerns about misused authority, undemocratic governance, or foreign influence. But larger trends in corruption are notoriously difficult to assess. Until recently, the United States, like most other market democracies, was generally regarded as not suffering unduly from corruption. Measures such as the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. citizens and businesses from bribing foreign officials (and whose enforcement the Trump administration has announced plans to scale back), made Washington a global leader in anticorruption. Yet amid questions about potential ethical standards violations on the U.S. Supreme Court, the increased influence of special interests in U.S. politics, and financial scandals involving several members of Congress, that good reputation was slipping even before Trump took office for the second time. At a moment when the United States' institutional guardrails are eroding, the Trump administration has embraced a style of governance in which power flows directly from a single leader, creating opportunities for personal deals to drive official decisions. That sort of corruption threatens free political and economic processes and can, eventually, become integral to the way the entire system functions—making it highly resistant to reform. In its most basic definition, corruption is the abuse of public roles and resources for private benefit. But any definition leaves considerable room to dispute a given practice as corrupt, and manifestations of corruption vary widely. It makes little sense to suggest that corruption in Denmark, a perennially high-ranking country on the Transparency International scale, is the same as corruption in, say, Cameroon, which ranks much lower, and that Cameroon simply has more of it. Yet it is possible to categorize the sources of corruption into four types: influence markets, elite cartels, oligarchs and clans, and official moguls. But they correspond to meaningful differences in how countries operate. Some forms of corruption enable violence, whereas others may be an alternative to it. Some severely disrupt economic and political development, whereas others strengthen alliances among elites that can facilitate rapid growth. Historically, corruption in the United States has primarily happened within an influence market—a system in which political influence and access are tradeable commodities. This form of corruption is typically found in societies with mature economies and open politics. Strong institutions prevent state capture but also make influence worth paying for; shaping a government decision is only valuable if it is likely to be implemented. Countries such as Bulgaria, Portugal, and Slovakia do not place legal restrictions on lobbying, either. Many others maintain lobbying registers to improve transparency; some (such as Denmark, Germany, and Sweden) require groups to register and some, such as Israel, do not. Because all these systems accommodate well-funded organized interests, outright bribery is often unnecessary. Public resentment of such activities can fuel populist grievances and help antisystem political parties gain ground. In countries with only moderately strong institutions, which are often in the process of liberalizing or reforming, a different type of corruption may emerge: the elite cartel. But that stability persists only until it doesn't; complex, ad hoc elite coalitions can perform poorly during crises or even trigger them. In South Korea, chaebols had a long-standing practice of making major payments to the country's presidents to secure favorable lending terms and thus lock up significant credit and investment for themselves; when the 1997 Asian financial crisis hit, large numbers of nonperforming loans hobbled the banking sector, worsened currency depreciation, and accelerated stock market declines. A less stable and more disruptive form of elite corruption emerges in places that have very weak institutions and that are undergoing rapid political change. Overtly criminal factions such as Mafias or drug cartels can take over policing, law and contract enforcement, and other functions that would otherwise be the job of the government. Russia fit this category in the 1990s, when oligarchs and Mafia groups seized the opportunity of post-Soviet privatization to take control of several business and government sectors. Today, oligarchs in the Philippines lead powerful political families with their own regional bases of operation; they engage in various licit and illicit enterprises, buy votes, and capture important segments of the bureaucracy. In Mexico, some regions are dominated by drug cartels whose plata o plomo (“silver or lead,” that is, take a bribe or take a bullet) practices combine bribery, extortion, and violence. In other countries with very weak institutions, a different mode of corruption develops: the official mogul. Politics and decision-making are dominated by a single individual, family, or junta. These leaders seize corrupt benefits not only for themselves but also to reward loyalists. The extensive corruption built into such a system inflicts serious damage on economic and political development, just as in a system dominated by oligarchs. But it does not lead to as much violence or insecurity, because there is little opportunity for weakened institutions and opposition groups to contest the power of the dominant leader. Trump has turned his personal brand into business ventures, entering opaque licensing agreements with firms that sell Trump-labeled merchandise. Personal deal-making has become a feature of U.S. foreign relations under Trump, too. What is notable is how Trump uses the authority of his office and how his supplicants—family members, cryptocurrency investors, business partners, U.S. government officials, and foreign governments—behave toward him. Instead of using traditional institutional channels to seek explicit influence over policy, they are currying personal favor and showing fealty to the president himself. In turn, Trump is using the power of his office not only to enrich himself but to reinforce his position as sole decision-maker, pursuing a degree of personal dominance that has not been seen before in American politics. The United States, of course, has seen its presidents tainted by corruption before. But neither episode directly involved or enriched the presidents themselves. And when more recent presidents have found themselves embroiled in scandal over abuses of power, they have faced significant pushback: Richard Nixon was forced to resign in 1974 after Watergate, and in the late 1990s Bill Clinton became the first president to face an impeachment trial in more than 130 years on charges related to his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Trump has yet to encounter such consequences in his second administration. Trump's style of corruption will not transform the United States overnight. In state and local government, the system is still operating as it did before. Patronage and pay-to-play schemes that have nothing to do with Trump will still unfold at county courthouses, and some state legislators will still gratefully receive political contributions from corporations, such as those the fracking industry has doled out in Pennsylvania. The United States' economy and political system are too large and diverse to surrender quickly to the personal domination of a president. Moreover, the main players in U.S. influence markets may resist changes to a system that serves them well. By carefully maintaining their long-standing relationships with legislators and regulatory agencies, the big-money donors, lobbyists, labor unions, and major corporations that many Americans see as corrupt could keep an even more pernicious form of corruption in check. But the United Sates could conceivably become an illiberal democracy or something akin to what the political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Ahmad Way have termed a “competitive authoritarian” state. The country has already begun drifting in this direction: the administration's efforts to intimidate universities, law firms, and media organizations are first steps toward weakening civil society and undermining the pluralism and open debate that are essential for liberal democracy. In time, the United States could come to resemble, for example, Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Corruption at the top thus further undermines democracy by weakening both institutional and political restraints on centralized power. The form of corruption Trump has displayed could have a similarly damaging effect on democratic norms and practices at home. It also exposes the United States to harmful influence from abroad. Protections against such influence are built into the country's institutions: foreign nationals are barred from contributing to federal election campaigns, lobbying by foreign governments and political parties must be disclosed under the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act, and most other foreign interests must register their political activities under the more lenient 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act. Personal wheeling and dealing is outside the bounds of anticorruption regulation. And strongmen who wield power in similar ways—leaders such as Orban, Putin, or North Korea's Kim Jong Un—recognize Trump's governing style. They will not be shy about taking advantage, offering direct deals with Trump (such as by making investments in his cryptocurrency) to secure favorable terms in diplomacy and trade, and to prevent Washington from meddling in their countries or what they consider to be their spheres of influence. When corruption becomes an integral part of the way a political leader makes decisions—or grants favors and stifles opponents to secure his grip on power—most familiar reform tactics, which are often narrowly focused on combating bribery, are insufficient to contain it. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a leader in international anticorruption efforts, even canceled its working group on bribery's long-planned mission to Hungary in 2024—the first time it has taken such a step—because the Orban government had consistently failed to act on earlier OECD recommendations. Supreme Court decisions have lifted restrictions on corporate donations to political campaigns; sharply limited the legal boundaries of what constitutes an “official act” by an elected official in federal bribery statutes (ruling in the case of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell that calling other politicians and hosting events at the governor's mansion were not, in fact, “official acts” taken in support of a businessman who had previously given him gifts); and deemed that bribes paid to elected officials are mere “gratuities” and legal, if delivered after an official decision has been made. A leader can only wield personal authority as Trump does in the absence of strong political constraints. Such checks are built into the U.S. Constitution; the Foreign Emoluments Clause, for example, prohibits federal officials from receiving gifts or compensation from any other government or ruler without congressional consent, and the Domestic Emoluments Clause prohibits presidents from receiving any compensation beyond their fixed salary from the federal government or any U.S. state. So far, however, Trump's allies in Congress have almost wholly abdicated this role, and although lower courts have issued injunctions against some of the administration's actions and policies, the Supreme Court has repeatedly found ways to expand executive power.This problem is fundamentally a political one. Because top-level corruption and the erosion of democratic constraints are mutually reinforcing, pushing back on the misuse of presidential authority will become only more difficult as time goes on. The targets of Trump's lawsuits must vigorously defend themselves, universities must defy demands that they cease programs Trump dislikes, and law firms must refuse to provide complimentary legal services to Trump's cronies and favored causes. What is happening today in the United States has clear elements of tragedy, but it is not yet a one-man show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) employee nicknamed “Big Balls” was reportedly badly beaten in an attempted carjacking. Edward Coristine was left bloodied by the attack in Washington, DC, early on Sunday morning, when he is said to have been set upon by “thugs” after trying to protect a young woman. Donald Trump, the US president, called Mr Coristine an “incredible man” and threatened to take federal control of the capital city unless its council tackled violent crime. Marko Elez, a fellow Doge staffer, claimed on social media that Mr Coristine had been attacked at an area in north-west Washington. “Edward protected a young woman from an attempted carjacking by eight thugs near Dupont Circle. Violence like this in the heart of DC is completely unacceptable.” Mr Elez, who was briefly sacked from Doge over a racist social media comment before being rehired, included a picture he said was of Mr Coristine. It showed a shirtless man, who resembles the 19-year-old, slumped on the ground, with blood covering his face and chest and staining his white trousers. Sources confirmed to the Washington Post that Mr Coristine, who is now a senior adviser at the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, had been injured after intervening in an attempted carjacking on Sunday. Mr Trump posted the photograph on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, declaring that crime in Washington was “totally out of control” and saying 14-year-olds should be prosecuted as adults. “If DC doesn't get its act together, and quickly we will have no choice but to take federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they're not going to get away with it anymore. “Perhaps this should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime.” Mr Musk, the head of Doge before his relationship with Mr Trump imploded earlier this year, echoed the president's call to put Washington under federal control.</p>
