                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anyone who's a fan of Supernatural remembers the moment where the long-running horror series kicked into a new gear: its Season 4 premiere "Lazarus Rising", which introduced the angel Castiel (Misha Collins). Castiel's presence added a new dynamic to Supernatural, particularly when he shared the screen with Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), and new enemies as Dean and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) found themselves fighting the forces of Heaven and Hell. Dominion takes place after God mysteriously disappears from Heaven. In His absence, archangel Gabriel (Carl Beukes) launches a war against humanity, intending to wipe them off the Earth. Humanity isn't going down without a fight though, setting up small armies in heavily fortified cities — including "Vega", which is built out of the remains of Las Vegas. It's here that Alex Lannon (Christopher Egan) learns that he has been chosen to be the savior of the human race; he must juggle his newfound duties with continuing the battle against Heaven's forces. Legion boasts the kind of plot that would come to define Supernatural, as the archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) travels to Earth to protect a young couple, Charlie (Adrienne Palicki) and Jeep (Lucas Black), as their child will be the only hope for humanity to survive the angels' wrath. The pilot of Dominion picks up where Legion left off, as Alex is Charlie and Jeep's son. Jeep, now played by Langley Kirkwood, even appears in the pilot episode before dying and passing on his duties to Charlie. Though Legion was packed full of horrifying Biblical imagery and managed to turn a profit, it was critically savaged, being called "dull" and that it "took itself way too seriously". Dominion fared slightly better, as its first season stands at a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes while its first season is a measly 48%. This jump in quality is credited to a deeper storyline that finds Alex dealing with the toll that the war against Heaven is taking on him, while also showcasing just how devestating said war truly is. Dominion might share the common theme of fighting angels with Supernatural, but like its predecessor, its cast featured a wide range of actors who went on to bigger and better roles. Season 2 features Christina Chong as Zoe Holloway, a soldier who grew disillusioned with the war and deserted; sci-fi fans might better know her as La'an Noonien Singh from Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans will be delighted to see that Anthony Stewart Head appears in the series, playing a villainous role for once. Ironically, Dominion wouldn't be the first time that Christopher Egan starred in a short-lived series that put its own twist on Biblical lore. Prior to Dominion's conception, he starred in NBC's Kings, a series that put a modern spin on the rise of King David. If you're looking for a series to fill the Supernatural-sized hole in your heart, Dominion is worth a watch. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

The wildest celebrity-fueled conspiracy theories of 2025 have made headlines throughout the year. Kim Kardashian reignited moon-landing doubts, prompting NASA to restate it landed on the Moon six times.

Donald Trump alleged US funds under the Biden administration bought condoms for Hamas to make bombs; records show only $45,681 in contraception sent to Jordan in 2024, with no condoms. 

Wiz Khalifa repeated flat-earth theories, despite overwhelming evidence debunking this longstanding false claim. 

Sopranos actor Drea de Matteo used OnlyFans to call airplane contrails “chemtrails,” another long-debunked claim.
