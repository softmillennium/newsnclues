                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For weeks, Barcelona have been at the center of transfer rumors. “FC Barcelona are scanning the market in search of an affordable center back with leadership qualities who can strengthen the squad in January… one of the names that fits that profile is Argentine defender Nicolas Otamendi,” Mundo Deportivo reported on Friday. Otamendi, who is approaching his 38th birthday, remains one of the most reliable defenders in Europe and has continued to shine with Benfica in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. The main obstacle surrounding a potential move for Otamendi is his contract situation. The defender is under contract with the Portuguese club until June 30, 2026, and “Benfica will not make things easy for him to leave during this winter window,” according to Mundo Deportivo. Yamal's Barcelona reportedly rule out Marc Guehi move over key issue as two Premier League players are offered As is the case with many elite soccer stars, in the coming months Nicolas Otamendi will be focused on playing as much as possible and, above all, staying healthy in order to be in peak condition for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America. For Otamendi, it would also represent his final major tournament with Argentina and his fourth World Cup overall, after appearing at South Africa 2010, Russia 2018, and Qatar 2022. He has already announced that he will not begin another World Cup cycle after 2026 and, like Messi, is expected to retire from international duty following the FIFA tournament. Nicolas Otamendi is the latest name added to a long list of players who are rumored to be closely monitored by Barcelona ahead of the January transfer window. Another Argentine defender reportedly on the Catalan club's radar is Marcos Senesi, who currently plays for Bournemouth and is also attracting interest from Atletico Madrid. While familiar icons like Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe continue to dominate headlines, the assist charts have delivered a quiet shock: a new name has risen above them both, redefining what elite playmaking looks like this year. Marcus Rashford has impressed with his performance in Barcelona, consistently demonstrating solid form. Despite this, his future with the team has been widely debated. Here's everything you need to watch the matchup, including kickoff time and full broadcast information with TV and streaming options for viewers in the USA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A controversial penalty from Mohamed Salah secured top spot for Egypt in Group B of the Africa Cup of Nations against South Africa. Salah's nerveless 45th-minute effort from the spot came after South Africa's Khuliso Mudau was punished for raising an arm to the Liverpool forward's face — following a lengthy VAR review. Egypt had to contend with going a man down at the end of that chaotic first half when right-back Mohamed Hany was shown a second yellow card for stamping on Teboho Mokoena in stoppage time before the break. Hossam Hassan's team survived a late VAR check after Yasser Ibrahim blocked a Mokoena shot with his hand after the 90th minute. It meant Egypt continued their successful start to this tournament in Morocco — and kept Salah's hopes of a first AFCON triumph very much alive. Nick Miller and Ahmed Walid analyse the key talking points from an intriguing match in Agadir that went past 101 minutes. Until the 39th minute, you could file this game under ‘not a classic'. There seemed to be only two people watching who thought Mudau had actually committed an offence worthy of being penalised when his flailing hand touched Salah's forehead. It was precisely 38 minutes and 38 seconds when Madau's hand made contact with Salah. The Egypt captain went down, as if Madau had “poked his eye out”, according to former South Africa forward Benni McCarthy in the Channel 4 studio. But aside from slightly hamming things up by occasionally checking said eye, Salah did not appeal for the penalty with any gusto. There he stood for 14 seconds while the screen was frozen, standing there like a man with questionable WiFi waiting for Netflix to load: not a huge amount of time in the grand scheme of things, but long enough to add to the general sense of farce. Former Arsenal and Cameroon defender Lauren, also in the Channel 4 studio, pointed out that Madau did not once look around and that he was simply using his arm to aid his running motion. “If you see a defender look first, then hit the opponent, then you would say it's a penalty,” said Lauren. “In this case, he was looking at the ball.” But after nearly a minute of deliberation, Ndabihawenimana pointed to the spot. There followed more arguments, jostling and prevarication, before Salah eventually stroked home the penalty insouciantly. It was a brainless act, but along with the equally illogical penalty award, it spiced up a hitherto pedestrian game. It is hard to judge Salah's performance in this game, considering Egypt's lack of attacking solutions in the first half and Hany's red card, but his presence as an outlet in the second half gave his team-mates a breather and limited the time spent under pressure. He was eventually withdrawn for Osama Faisal in the 89th minute. Ultimately, it is Salah's goals that have put Egypt into the knockouts. Since making his tournament debut at AFCON 2017, no player has scored more than Salah's nine goals — and he is now four efforts off his coach Hassan's 69-goal scoring record for Egypt. It is hard to argue with those kinds of numbers, even if we have still not seen the best of him at this edition. It is not just that South Africa had 45 minutes against 10 men to make an impact and find an equaliser that was so discouraging for them. Arguably, it was that they also had the 15 minutes before that to plan how they were going to approach so much of the game with a man advantage. That should have been ample time to come up with something, but in the early stages of the second half, it was Egypt who looked more likely to extend their lead, rather than lose it. It took until the 70th minute for South Africa coach Hugo Broos to change their shape, bringing on winger Relebohile Mofokeng, and another five before introducing another forward. From that point, it felt like a penalty would be given, even though there was no conclusive angle, but not only did he choose not to point to the spot, he reversed the decision entirely. Which suggests that he ultimately decided it was not a handball and that Ibrahim had touched the ball with his hand in a natural action, rather than deliberately. Despite that, these teams played out a cautious first half, with Hassan's switch to a 5-3-2 limiting any adventure from either Egypt or South Africa. Egypt's victory guarantees them top spot in the group. As for Angola and Zimbabwe, they took a big hit by drawing with each other. That means they both need to win their final group game on Monday, with Angola facing Egypt and Zimbabwe playing South Africa.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Craig Burley slams FIFA over World Cup ticket prices and 'The Best' awards. Yet for the USSF, there is also a more practical benefit, namely the $100 million that it expects to receive from FIFA. This amount will be split across the three countries. And, more importantly, what does the USSF plan to do with that additional windfall? There was huge skepticism that the USSF could pull off a successful tournament, and not just from people outside the country. Ticketing revenue was the primary income stream, with any surplus going to a foundation set up after the tournament. "The federation thought [the World Cup] was going to be a loser, which is why they set up the separate entity and why they agreed to let any surplus go to the foundation because they didn't expect a surplus. I knew that the United States loves a big event, and so if we could make sure that this was perceived as a big event, it would get the attention of people over and above just the core soccer fans." According to former USSF president Sunil Gulati, who also served as the executive vice president of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee, the tournament brought in a surplus of around $51 million, $5 million of which was loaned to MLS as seed money to get it up and running. At first glance, it might appear that the USSF will make more money from the 2026 edition, but when adjusted for inflation, $60 million in 1994 is worth $131 million today. For 2026, FIFA has implemented what Gulati calls "the UEFA model," one championed by FIFA president -- and former UEFA general secretary -- Gianni Infantino. That allows FIFA to keep more of tournament's revenues for itself, though it has created some financial issues for the venue cities, and the structure directs money to FIFA that would be reinvested in the U.S. instead. Pay-to-play has long been a scourge of the U.S. soccer development system, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds often priced out of the sport. "What is exciting about the $100 million is that we'll be able to use it for very targeted investments in participation and growing-the-game types of initiatives," Batson said. "And these are things that don't have natural business models. And so being able to use philanthropic funds, which of course we've grown a lot of those as well as legacy funds from the World Cup, that allows us to really accelerate our investment in that. "Ultimately our goal is to have a very large endowment that is focused specifically on participation, access, growth of the game. And this $100 million will be an awesome jumpstart to that." The U.S. has more than 340 million people, spread across four time zones. For that reason, the USSF's plan invites some skepticism, both in terms of determining the bar for success, as well as what a national federation can achieve. "[Growing soccer] is very much pushing at an open door," said Stefan Szymanski, author of the book "Soccernomics" and a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan. A lot of parents don't want their kids to play [American] football anymore. It's kind of shrewd for the federation to say 'oh, we're promoting soccer' because soccer is going to grow." Szymanski added, "I think we ought to be realistic here though about the limits of this. To create a level playing field, if I may use that expression, one really would need thousands and thousands of fields across the country, and the amount of money that U.S. Soccer is going to put in is going to be a drop in the ocean in relation to that." Batson is aware that the USSF's impact will be limited, both in terms of programming and finances. That is why he is attempting to build a coalition of stakeholders -- one that includes pro leagues, youth clubs, school districts, as well as state and local governments -- that can work together to not only draw kids and families into the sport, but keep them there. Much of this falls under the umbrella of the USSF's "Soccer Everywhere For Everyone" initiative, as well as the federation's Pathway Strategy from recreational to competitive to pre-professional to professional. "A lot of people play soccer in this country. "And so U.S. Soccer will be able to play a role in that, but also, we need local governments. We need local businesses and community organizations leaning in. "The heart of the Soccer Forward strategy is focused on how are we bringing all these people together to be able to make it to where soccer is much cheaper, much more accessible, and ultimately more fun so that millions and millions more people can go play it." Batson said the USSF has studied anti-smoking and anti-drunk driving initiatives to get a sense of how the USSF's programs can be impactful at every level of the soccer ecosystem. What were the coalitions at the local and national level that led to change in behavior -- or in soccer's case, interest -- on a massive scale?

"We did a whole lot of research on that before we designed the approach to Soccer Forward, because we believed that to deliver soccer at scale, at the sort of price point to where everyone can do it, it's going to take everybody working together on that," Batson said. Everyone's leaning in, good early progress, but this is a huge-scale effort, and that's also what makes it fun." The connection with anti-drunk driving initiatives seems specious at first glance, but Stacey D. Stewart, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), sees some similarities. In her experience, having repeated, consistent messaging is critical to growing support and awareness. Finding a shared purpose is critical, and patience will be needed as well. MADD has been in existence for 45 years, and is still going strong. For Stewart, the biggest key of all is storytelling. MADD got its start in 1980 when Candace Lightner's daughter Cari was killed by a drunken driver as she walked to a church carnival. That story of loss resonated across the country. Obviously, Batson and the rest of the USSF are telling a different type of story, but one where soccer can be "a force for good," as Batson said. She added, "It's the power of stories, individual stories, that creates that spark where people begin to see themselves in other people's stories, and that connection starts to happen." One current story the USSF can tell relates to its Soccer at Schools initiative. It is made up of a toolkit that aims to provide soccer advocates the ability to start soccer programs at schools, and address issues like funding, connecting with schools, assessing facilities, as well as activities for participants. The Rosati Leadership Academy in Lewiston, Maine, started an after-school indoor soccer program at Connors Elementary School that operates five days a week, a lifeline to an economically disadvantaged community. Beyond soccer, the program emphasized social and emotional learning for the 200 students per year that took part, with student behavior and performance both showing improvement. Facilities are part of the puzzle as well. Colder climates will require indoor fields, while urban environments require hard-top mini-pitches given that green space is often at a premium. Then there is the insatiable appetite for full-sized fields. Batson indicated that the USSF has armed soccer advocates with information and data to convince local politicians that sports fields are a good investment. But such projects require plenty of heavy lifting. Beverly Smith is the vice president for sports and youth development with Local Initiatives and Support Corporation, a nonprofit that helps facilitate housing and economic development in underserved communities. Smith's focus is on building sports fields in those locales, and is currently working with the Arthur M. Blank Foundation to build 100 mini-pitches across the state of Georgia. (Note: Smith has also teamed with ESPN to build a mini-pitch at East Point Station in Atlanta.) Smith notes that a successful project isn't just about building the facility; there has to be a maintenance plan to ensure its long-term viability. "For the U.S. Soccer Federation trying to build a coalition around this, it really requires that you have your finger on the pulse of what's happening on the ground and where you want to put this and hear the voices of everybody," Smith said. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson told ESPN that there is dedicated staff within Soccer Forward that is focused on these endeavors. The same is true of its success in coalition building. Will the USSF be an active or passive partner? Whether the level of execution follows is to be determined.</p>

Facilities are part of the puzzle as well. Colder climates will require indoor fields, while urban environments require hard-top mini-pitches given that green space is often at a premium. Then there is the insatiable appetite for full-sized fields. Batson indicated that the USSF has armed soccer advocates with information and data to convince local politicians that sports fields are a good investment. But such projects require plenty of heavy lifting. Beverly Smith is the vice president for sports and youth development with Local Initiatives and Support Corporation, a nonprofit that helps facilitate housing and economic development in underserved communities. Smith's focus is on building sports fields in those locales, and is currently working with the Arthur M. Blank Foundation to build 100 mini-pitches across the state of Georgia. (Note: Smith has also teamed with ESPN to build a mini-pitch at East Point Station in Atlanta.) Smith notes that a successful project isn't just about building the facility; there has to be a maintenance plan to ensure its long-term viability. "For the U.S. Soccer Federation trying to build a coalition around this, it really requires that you have your finger on the pulse of what's happening on the ground and where you want to put this and hear the voices of everybody," Smith said. A U.S. Soccer spokesperson told ESPN that there is dedicated staff within Soccer Forward that is focused on these endeavors. The same is true of its success in coalition building. Will the USSF be an active or passive partner? Whether the level of execution follows is to be determined.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Craig Burley slams FIFA over World Cup ticket prices and 'The Best' awards. Yet for the USSF, there is also a more practical benefit, namely the $100 million that it expects to receive from FIFA. This amount will be split across the three countries. And, more importantly, what does the USSF plan to do with that additional windfall? There was huge skepticism that the USSF could pull off a successful tournament, and not just from people outside the country. Ticketing revenue was the primary income stream, with any surplus going to a foundation set up after the tournament. "The federation thought [the World Cup] was going to be a loser, which is why they set up the separate entity and why they agreed to let any surplus go to the foundation because they didn't expect a surplus. I knew that the United States loves a big event, and so if we could make sure that this was perceived as a big event, it would get the attention of people over and above just the core soccer fans." According to former USSF president Sunil Gulati, who also served as the executive vice president of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee, the tournament brought in a surplus of around $51 million, $5 million of which was loaned to MLS as seed money to get it up and running. At first glance, it might appear that the USSF will make more money from the 2026 edition, but when adjusted for inflation, $60 million in 1994 is worth $131 million today. For 2026, FIFA has implemented what Gulati calls "the UEFA model," one championed by FIFA president -- and former UEFA general secretary -- Gianni Infantino. That allows FIFA to keep more of tournament's revenues for itself, though it has created some financial issues for the venue cities, and the structure directs money to FIFA that would be reinvested in the U.S. instead. Pay-to-play has long been a scourge of the U.S. soccer development system, with children from disadvantaged backgrounds often priced out of the sport. "What is exciting about the $100 million is that we'll be able to use it for very targeted investments in participation and growing-the-game types of initiatives," Batson said. "And these are things that don't have natural business models. And so being able to use philanthropic funds, which of course we've grown a lot of those as well as legacy funds from the World Cup, that allows us to really accelerate our investment in that. "Ultimately our goal is to have a very large endowment that is focused specifically on participation, access, growth of the game. And this $100 million will be an awesome jumpstart to that." The U.S. has more than 340 million people, spread across four time zones. For that reason, the USSF's plan invites some skepticism, both in terms of determining the bar for success, as well as what a national federation can achieve. "[Growing soccer] is very much pushing at an open door," said Stefan Szymanski, author of the book "Soccernomics" and a professor of sport management at the University of Michigan. A lot of parents don't want their kids to play [American] football anymore. It's kind of shrewd for the federation to say 'oh, we're promoting soccer' because soccer is going to grow." Szymanski added, "I think we ought to be realistic here though about the limits of this. To create a level playing field, if I may use that expression, one really would need thousands and thousands of fields across the country, and the amount of money that U.S. Soccer is going to put in is going to be a drop in the ocean in relation to that." Batson is aware that the USSF's impact will be limited, both in terms of programming and finances. That is why he is attempting to build a coalition of stakeholders -- one that includes pro leagues, youth clubs, school districts, as well as state and local governments -- that can work together to not only draw kids and families into the sport, but keep them there. Much of this falls under the umbrella of the USSF's "Soccer Everywhere For Everyone" initiative, as well as the federation's Pathway Strategy from recreational to competitive to pre-professional to professional. "A lot of people play soccer in this country. "And so U.S. Soccer will be able to play a role in that, but also, we need local governments. We need local businesses and community organizations leaning in. "The heart of the Soccer Forward strategy is focused on how are we bringing all these people together to be able to make it to where soccer is much cheaper, much more accessible, and ultimately more fun so that millions and millions more people can go play it." Batson said the USSF has studied anti-smoking and anti-drunk driving initiatives to get a sense of how the USSF's programs can be impactful at every level of the soccer ecosystem. What were the coalitions at the local and national level that led to change in behavior -- or in soccer's case, interest -- on a massive scale?

"We did a whole lot of research on that before we designed the approach to Soccer Forward, because we believed that to deliver soccer at scale, at the sort of price point to where everyone can do it, it's going to take everybody working together on that," Batson said. Everyone's leaning in, good early progress, but this is a huge-scale effort, and that's also what makes it fun." The connection with anti-drunk driving initiatives seems specious at first glance, but Stacey D. Stewart, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), sees some similarities. In her experience, having repeated, consistent messaging is critical to growing support and awareness. Finding a shared purpose is critical, and patience will be needed as well. MADD has been in existence for 45 years, and is still going strong. For Stewart, the biggest key of all is storytelling. MADD got its start in 1980 when Candace Lightner's daughter Cari was killed by a drunken driver as she walked to a church carnival. That story of loss resonated across the country. Obviously, Batson and the rest of the USSF are telling a different type of story, but one where soccer can be "a force for good," as Batson said. She added, "It's the power of stories, individual stories, that creates that spark where people begin to see themselves in other people's stories, and that connection starts to happen." One current story the USSF can tell relates to its Soccer at Schools initiative. It is made up of a toolkit that aims to provide soccer advocates the ability to start soccer programs at schools, and address issues like funding, connecting with schools, assessing facilities, as well as activities for participants. The Rosati Leadership Academy in Lewiston, Maine, started an after-school indoor soccer program at Connors Elementary School that operates five days a week, a lifeline to an economically disadvantaged community. Beyond soccer, the program emphasized social and emotional learning for the 200 students per year that took part, with student behavior and performance both showing improvement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time in English football history, Saturday 3PM kick-offs could reportedly be broadcast live on domestic television, with the Premier League and the English Football League set to open formal discussions early next year about lifting the long-standing blackout. England is now the only major footballing nation in Europe to maintain the restriction, which prevents live broadcasts between 2.45PM and 5.15PM on Saturdays. With both leagues preparing for future domestic media rights negotiations, there is a growing consensus that selling every match may be the only realistic way to protect and increase revenues, as revealed by The Guardian. Crucially, both competitions want clarity on whether 3PM matches can be included before those tenders begin. Without an early agreement, broadcasters would be bidding without knowing the full scope of games available, a scenario neither league wants to repeat in a market where rights inflation has slowed. This season already represents unprecedented domestic exposure. The Premier League is showing a record 270 live matches, while the EFL has 1,059 games broadcast, primarily through Sky Sports.

While its current domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is worth a headline-grabbing £6.7bn, that figure masks a quieter reality. Many Premier League clubs' American owners have long questioned the logic of the blackout, pointing to the US model, where every game across major sports is available to viewers. From their perspective, restricting access in a digital era limits growth, particularly among younger audiences accustomed to on-demand viewing. Those voices have grown louder as revenue growth has flattened. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting The restriction is rooted in Article 48 of UEFA's statutes, which allows live football broadcasts to be prohibited for up to two and a half hours on a Saturday or Sunday. In England, it applies when at least half of Premier League and Championship fixtures are scheduled for 3PM on a Saturday. Any decision to lift the blackout would not exist in isolation. Article 48 is also enforced in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and leagues there could seek compensation if English football suddenly gains a commercial advantage. There are also fears about unintended consequences. That concern has historically underpinned resistance to change, with supporters' groups warning that easy access to televised football might discourage fans from attending matches in person.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the soccer world looks ahead to 2026, questions continue to swirl around Lionel Messi and whether the sport's most decorated modern icon will once again step onto the game's biggest stage. Speaking with the calm certainty of someone who has lived through multiple tournament cycles, Zanetti offered a perspective that cuts through the noise. While doubts persist externally, his stance is clear: Messi remains capable of helping Argentina in a meaningful way at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That triumph, led by Messi, ended years of pressure and debate about his international legacy. Since then, the national team has continued to collect silverware, reinforcing its status as one of the strongest sides in global soccer. He now plays his club soccer away from Europe, prompting inevitable questions about rhythm, intensity, and physical sustainability. Lionel Messi of Argentina kisses the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Winners' Trophy. “I don't agree with that,” he said when asked whether Messi should step aside as a leader. “Messi is fully capable of continuing as a leader. He's intelligent, knows better than anyone how to interpret what the team needs, and is surrounded by great players in the national team.” For Zanetti, leadership is not about running more kilometers than anyone else. It is about understanding moments, managing teammates, and raising standards in decisive situations. Zanetti went even further, making it clear that Messi's presence alone elevates Argentina's status. “I'm convinced that with him, Argentina will be a major contender again at the next World Cup,” he added. Reflecting on where the forward stands in his career, he said: “The time has come for Messi to enjoy football.” Rather than framing 2026 as a burden or a final obligation, Zanetti sees it as an opportunity—a space where Messi can contribute without the suffocating pressure that defined earlier chapters of his international career. According to the former defender, enjoyment does not mean detachment. “That has to be his decision,” he said. The former captain highlighted an important distinction: Messi no longer needs to prove anything. Every major trophy is already in his cabinet. The World Cup itself, he suggested, will serve as a personal checkpoint. “The World Cup will surely be an important testing ground to see how he feels, and then he'll decide, calmly, whether to continue.” Inter Milan is entering the UEFA Champions League final with high spirits and full motivation. Vice president Javier Zanetti, a club legend, spoke ahead of the match, expressing confidence in the team's preparation and mindset.

Barcelona are searching for a defender and have reportedly shown interest in a World Cup winner with Lionel Messi's Argentina national team.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Lewandowski has reportedly moved a step closer to leaving Barcelona as his representatives prepare to hold a fresh round of talks with the Saudi Pro League over a lucrative move to the Middle East. In a new report from Spanish publication AS, Lewandowski's Israeli agent, Pini Zahavi, is due to hold a new meeting with Saudi Pro League officials ahead of the January transfer window opening on New Year's Day. The report claims Lewandowski has already received an offer from the Saudi Pro League, though it does not state which clubs are keen to sign the striker, who has scored eight goals in 18 appearances in all competitions for Barcelona this season. Fire, who have previously tried to sign Neymar and Kevin De Bruyne in 2025, are believed to have made Lewandowski a priority signing for at least six months - with Chicago holding the USA's largest Polish community. Lewandowski is widely regarded as Poland's greatest ever footballer, having scored 88 goals in 163 caps for his country. The BBC claim Lewandowski is also open to joining Fire, with wages not expected to be an issue, though AS claim the Saudi Pro League have presented a larger financial package to the attacker's camp.

After scoring a remarkable 344 goals in 375 games during an eight-season spell with Germany heavyweights Bayern Munich, Lewandowski joined Barcelona in July 2022. The ex-Borussia Dortmund and Lech Poznan hitman has won five trophies at Camp Nou, including league titles in the 2022-23 and 2024-25 campaigns. He has scored 109 goals in 165 games for the Blaugrana. However, Lewandowski's future at Barcelona remains in doubt after seeing fellow striker Ferran Torres step up for Hansi Flick's champions this season. When asked about his long-term future in November, Lewandowski said: “I still don't know the answer. Even if, for example, the club contacted me now, I still wouldn't answer that question. Because I also have to feel what's best for me.

Flick's men will then take on Athletic Club - led by former Blaugrana boss Ernesto Valverde - in the semi-finals of the Spanish Super Cup four days later. Following the victory over Villarreal, in what was their final fixture of 2025, Barcelona boss Flick said: “I think we've overcome a lot of things this year. You can see in training how we are. We need to rest and live Christmas as a family.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They are joined by a former solicitor general of Jersey and a UK-based human rights specialist, with imminent legal claims for £2.5m in costs also being prepared. The stand-off intensified last week when UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly urged Abramovich to "pay up now", insisting that the proceeds of Chelsea's sale should finally be deployed for humanitarian relief in Ukraine. The legal saga centres on Abramovich's claim that Jersey authorities unlawfully handled data linked to investigations against him. He pursued court action after discovering that government records, including messages and emails referring to him, were missing or deleted. That effort led to a significant ruling in his favour. Advocate David Michael Cadin, master of the Royal Court, declared that the Government of Jersey had breached its obligations, finding that Abramovich's data protection rights had been violated. A licence has already been issued permitting the money to be spent on humanitarian causes and ministers insist Abramovich has no legal justification for delaying. Complicating matters, however, are financial records published by Fordstam, Abramovich's UK-registered vehicle that received the Chelsea sale proceeds. Those accounts show an outstanding £1.5bn debt to Camberley International Investments, the Jersey-based parent company whose assets were frozen. Yet Abramovich's lawyers have repeatedly refused to engage on the mechanics of release while their Jersey challenge remains unresolved. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Correspondence revealed during the case has highlighted a striking shift in Jersey's stance towards Abramovich. In September 2017, he was warmly welcomed by the island's authorities when applying for residency. That tone changed dramatically after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In April of that year, just a month after Abramovich pledged that Chelsea sale funds would go to "all" Ukraine war victims, the Royal Court of Jersey imposed a freezing order on $7bn (£5.3bn) worth of assets linked to him. The island's attorney general said Abramovich was a suspect in a criminal investigation, though officers later admitted that raids on his properties had been unlawful. A spokesperson for Abramovich had previously said: "The attorney general's decision to investigate Mr Abramovich was illegitimate and politically motivated and linked to improving Jersey's reputation as a financial centre in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, at a time when the Jersey government's previous policy of encouraging Russian wealth to move to the island was now seen as politically inconvenient." The Government of Jersey has firmly denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, it said: "The government of Jersey is aware of recent media reports concerning ongoing legal proceedings involving Mr Roman Abramovich. We categorically reject allegations of conspiracy, misfeasance in public office, or bad faith. These claims are entirely without foundation and will be addressed through the appropriate legal channels."

Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty has insisted that the UK Government remains confident in its legal position, including with regard to the Jersey action. Insiders familiar with the case suggest Abramovich's decision to assemble such a heavyweight team reflects the scale of Jersey's own legal resources.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MADRID, Dec. 26 (Xinhua) -- In a year without a major men's international tournament, club football dominated the headlines, with Paris Saint-Germain emerging as one of the standout winners. PSG capped the season by winning the UEFA Champions League in late May with a 5-0 rout of Inter Milan, as coach Luis Enrique underlined the value of cohesion over a collection of star names. The former Spain coach has built a side that blends technical quality with pace and aggression, and after years of domestic dominance, PSG fully justified its first European crown. Despite a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea in the FIFA Club World Cup final, PSG looks well-placed to maintain its grip on French football and mount another Champions League challenge. However, after heavy summer spending, expectations of further dominance have given way to a difficult campaign, with new signings struggling to gel and Slot facing growing pressure. Barcelona enjoyed a successful first season under Hansi Flick, winning La Liga despite strict financial limits and playing home matches at the former Olympic Stadium while Camp Nou undergoes renovation. Lamine Yamal drew the biggest headlines, but Flick also earned credit for elevating players such as Raphinha, Pedri, Fermin Lopez and Ferran Torres. Madrid was then outclassed by PSG in the semifinals, and the year ends amid reports of dressing-room unrest and renewed questions over Alonso after poor results. Fluminense beat Al-Hilal before losing to Chelsea in the semifinals, while Chelsea produced a strong final to defeat a fatigued PSG. The tournament also raised concerns about player workload, with many heading into a long season without a proper summer break ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Extreme heat and storms that forced temporary stoppages also offered a warning for next summer. Looking ahead, Spain goes into 2026 World Cup preparations as one of the leading contenders after an impressive qualifying campaign, while Thomas Tuchel appears to be gradually stamping his authority on England. Argentina is also expected to challenge, although there are doubts over whether Lionel Messi will be involved. Messi continued to make headlines in the United States as Inter Miami won the MLS title, with Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets also playing key roles. In South America, Flamengo lifted the Copa Libertadores, with Filipe Luis enhancing his reputation as one of the continent's most promising young coaches. Al-Hilal's Club World Cup run and Al-Ahli's AFC Champions League title underlined the impact of big spending in the Saudi Pro League, although questions remain over whether the league's rise reflects imported stars or genuine local development.</p>
