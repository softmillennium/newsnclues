                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year, Taylor Swift spent her Christmas at Arrowhead Stadium, where fiancé Travis Kelce played his final Kansas City Chiefs home game of the NFL season. Showing up in her signature red lip and a matching bomber jacket alongside her parents, the pop star was all smiles as she entered the venue, as captured in clips posted online by the NFL. She hunkered down in her usual suite at Arrowhead Stadium to watch the tight end and his team play against the Denver Broncos, who ended up winning 20-13. He was also clearly fired up as he first entered the field, striking his signature archer pose at the center of flashing lights, smoke and thunderous applause. Their last game will be against the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium in Sin City on a soon-to-be-scheduled date. But the Chiefs' final home game might have had even more significance for Kelce. Throughout this year, the Grotesquerie star has faced much speculation about whether he will retire after this season, something he has not yet confirmed or denied. “I'll let that be a decision I'll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes,” he reportedly said, adding that he was feeling “a whole lot of emotions.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Darlene Love first recorded “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” in 1963, while U2 covered the track for the 1987 benefit compilation A Very Special Christmas. Maybe it was the Irish flute that fueled him this time. The evening ended with an all-star jam on the Pogues' “Fairytale of New York,” which found May wishing a happy birthday to the song's late songwriter, Shane MacGowan, who was born on Christmas Day.

Darlene Love recorded “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” on a hot August day in 1963 for Phil Spector's A Christmas Gift for You compilation, which came out in 1963.

Nearly a decade ago, Rowlson-Hall first collaborated with Fastvold and her creative partner Brady Corbet on their musical drama “Vox Lux.” Unlike her previous film work, where she worked on a scene or two, “The Testament of Ann Lee” required an entire film's worth of choreography. It had me thinking, how would the body be after dancing for 10 hours?” Related Stories Raphael Saadiq Counts ‘Sinners' Director Ryan Coogler Among the ‘Visionaries' Inspiring His Best Work Paul Schrader Dismisses ‘Eyes Wide Shut' as  a Descent Into ‘Sex Party Crazyland' Right in Time for Christmas Co-written by Fastvold and Corbet, the film centers on the life and work of Ann Lee, a visionary spiritual leader from 18th-century England who believed herself to be the female reincarnation of Christ. Played with gusto by Amanda Seyfried, Lee was a founding member of the Shaker movement, who later settled in New England after seeking spiritual freedom across the Atlantic Ocean. “The film is about movement in a way,” Rowlson-Hall told IndieWire. She added that there are some “beautiful artworks of the Shakers in worship once they're in America,” showing them “making these very tight, circular spirals, which I recreated at the end of the film. But that's really all I had to go off of. Rowlson-Hall began work on the choreography for the film two years ago, working at first on short tests in January of 2024 before the film began shooting in Budapest in May that same year. “I had one week to put all the dances together,” she said. When creating with an actor or dancer in mind, Rowlson-Hall starts with one question: “What is their character going through and how can the dance get them to that next place?” More questions follow, Rowlson-Hall adds, like “Are they moving through grief? What do they need at this moment?” She finds that these questions are helpful for the actor because they know that they are not just doing dance movements, “They're moving with such specific intention that,” Rowlson-Hall said, “it's almost like it's not dancing.” “I very much knew that sequence was going to be the most exacting dance,” Rowlson-Hall said. Filmed aboard an operational replica of an actual 18th-century ship, the Götheborg of Sweden, the sequence sees Lee and her congregation worshipping through movement daily on the ship's deck, rain or shine. As the Shakers are disparaged by the ship's crew and pummeled by violent squalls throughout their arduous seafaring journey, Fastvold keeps her camera as centered and steady as the worshipers themselves, with their bodies moving in and out of the frame as they pray. Rowlson-Hall knew the choreography here needed to be sharp and clean because, as she recalled, “we were going to be going from sunshine, snow, wind, and rain. I knew that those were the hard cuts that [Fastvold] wanted to do, and so the movement couldn't have that sort of flow thing going on, or you won't get a clean edit.” Rowlson-Hall also felt that the movement here needed to feel like a military exercise, or some other repeated action like going for a walk or riding a bike, that becomes so routine, “you don't have to think about how to do it anymore,” she said, adding that editor Sofía Subercaseaux “found such a beautiful edit in that dance.” Rowlson-Hall also kept in mind that in the story, the actors and dancers are not playing actors and dancers; they are ordinary people who use movement in their worship. In an earlier sequence, Lee believes she's found freedom and love with a fellow Shaker named Abraham (Christopher Abbott). Seyfried channels the ecstasy of their union with joyful movements, a smile on her face. As she worked on Seyfried's show-stopping number “Hunger and Thirst,” performed in an asylum where Lee has been locked up after having a breakdown after her fourth child's death, Rowlson-Hall said that she could do the dance only once before she felt like she was either “going to throw up or start crying,” she recalled, “because if I really sat with what she was going through… It's just so much, and what do you do with it?” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

Americans have Black Friday, but in most other parts of the world, Boxing Day (a.k.a. Once reserved as a day for packing Christmas boxes to deliver to people in need, Boxing Day soon became a day where people would open boxes (I.e. their holiday presents) as well. Related: The Best Gift Cards to Get Delivered Instantly In many countries around the world, Boxing Day is a national holiday, with many referring to it as the second day of Christmas. Despite the growing popularity of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Boxing Day continues to be big business for retailers in Canada, along with Australia, New Zealand, the UK and other countries in Europe and the Caribbean. New data shows more and more U.S. stores getting in on the Boxing Day buzz this year as well, with retailers using the day to clear excess inventory and off-load goods before new products and pricing come in for 2026. What that means: Boxing Day 2026 offers a chance to save big, with some analysts noting that “discounts during Boxing Day are often deeper than regular seasonal sales,” thanks to “extreme markdowns, especially online.” Last year's statistics revealed the biggest Boxing Day deals on electronics, clothing, housewares and beauty products, with discounts up to 70% off. Sites like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Nordstrom were among the retailers offering the largest selection of products on sale for Boxing Day. Other sources say to expect the best deals on women's clothing and “practical categories,” like everyday household items and essentials. Where to find the biggest discounts: look for “overstocked items, discontinued models, or seasonal products that cannot carry over into the next retail cycle.” From Amazon to Zappos, here's a look at some of the best Boxing Day deals to shop online this year.

Sara Blakely is taking her love of comfy fashion to new heights. “Like my first business, Spanx, I created Sneex because I was a frustrated consumer,” Blakely tells Page Six Style, calling her sporty-chic heels a “love letter to all the women who have been told that beauty is pain.” Since Sneex's 2024 launch, the quirky shoes have gotten off on the right foot with stars; Hoda Kotb, Reese Witherspoon and Gayle King have all raved about them, while Oprah featured the innovation on two back-to-back “Favorite Things” lists. “When Latto wore Sneex on stage during one of her concerts last year, I was elated,” Blakely adds of her favorite celebrity moments. Below, the business mogul dishes on her six top style and beauty staples, from her “signature” red lipstick to a pair of surprisingly comfortable jeans. I am drawn to jewelry that doesn't feel too serious. These earrings from Roxanne Assoulin are classic with a wink.” I saw Gayle King wear these denim look-alikes on ‘Watch What Happens Live' (with Sneex!) “One of my favorite Sneex styles is the Tepper in Taupe. It's made with the most beautiful Italian fabric called Leone mesh. You can wear it with everything from jeans to party outfits.” “During the winter, hats are always a part of my outfit. This beanie from Missoni is on my wish list.” This article was written by Hannah Southwick, Commerce Associate Editor for Page Six. Hannah spies deals on actually affordable celebrity-worn styles, puts Hollywood's favorite labels to the test and finds the beauty products that keep stars red carpet-ready.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I'd been living in my car,” he admitted. “This was the best news I had ever gotten.” Taking on the role of Ace proved to be a huge career move for Sutherland, and it's one he has always been grateful to Reiner for facilitating. “I had no idea, the course change in my life that it would make,” Sutherland said of playing Ace. “But he did.” Reiner created a resonant, classic story that became a massive hit once it hit the big screen. “Rob Reiner had an incredible point of view,” the actor said. “A point of view that was inspired by real humanity, kindness, intellect… And all of those elements combined and allowed him to become a real American storyteller.” “Stand By Me,” as it turned out, was just the beginning for Sutherland, who starred in “The Lost Boys” and three other films in 1987, the year after Reiner's film hit theaters. He has since built an impressive resume in Hollywood, as have many stars who worked with Reiner early in their careers. Sutherland also posted a heartfelt tribute to Reiner after his tragic passing in December, but he is far from the only one who did so. Outside of social media posts from individual stars, the Associated Press also released a joint statement on December 16. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The singer went method with her fireside recitation of Jim Carrey's harried monologue about his busy schedule. The iconic pop superstar went fully method for her holiday video this year, slipping into a lime green Grinch costume on Christmas Eve (Dec. 24) for a recitation of the holiday baddie's overstuffed schedule. In a clip shared this week, the singer posted up in a chair by a fire pit in the backyard and crooned her indelible cover of Eric Carmen's maudlin ballad “All By Myself,” which Dion first recorded for her fourth English-language album, 1996's Falling Into You.

Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn't allow it!” Dion says as the dog wearing antlers like the Grinch's pooch, Max, wriggles out of her grasp. The dramatic recitation goes on, as Dion-as-Grinch honks, “I'm booked! The video winds down with Dion crooning a bit more of the song, casually singing, “When I was young/ I never needed anyone.” The appearance was one of the rare public outings this year from Dion, who was diagnosed with the neurological disorder stiff-person syndrome in 2022, which seriously affected her voice and caused uncontrolled tremors, forcing her to cancel a planned 2023-2024 world tour to focus on her health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the conclusion of Heated Rivalry‘s rookie season, writer/director/creator Jacob Tierney is taking a breath before hitting the ice again with the wildly popular LGBTQ hockey drama series. “But we have a whole universe here, and so there's loads of other things that we're thinking about and that we're gonna explore and that we're gonna start to take more seriously now that we know that there's an audience for it,” explained Tierney, following the show's Season 2 renewal. “And that's pretty exciting, so I'm looking forward to really digging into this world.” Taking LGBTQ and female audiences by storm with its bold depictions of gay sex and romance, Tierney revealed that his favorite intimate scenes were in the finale. “What I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it's one thing to just make smut—which I'm thrilled to be doing. No shame in that game,” he said. “But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers.” Tierney added, “That's why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it's both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. That's when I feel like they're a real couple, like when you're giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. Read on about the Heated Rivalry, Season 1 finale's sex scenes, why the show's depiction of LGBTQ fame appealed to him and what's ahead for Season 2. DEADLINE: Are you surprised that the show has taken off on this level, outside of Canada? It was such a good wrap-up for that episode. TIERNEY: It was very moving to see all those reactions. TIERNEY: I'm telling you, no Canadian's that excited. Because I've seen a lot of people are really anticipating it. I didn't think anybody was gonna care this much. I mean, there was pressure for me internally to end the show well. And I think that the thing that I was aware of, though it might not seem that way on the surface, it's a big swing cause it's a two-hander essentially. To go from an episode like 5, which is so big and epic, into ‘The Cottage', which is relatively tiny—I think 38 of the 52 minutes are the two of them alone in a cottage. DEADLINE: And I really appreciated the scene with Shane's parents because coming out was obviously such a big fear for him, and just seeing how perfectly they handled it. Tell me about bringing something that gay kids really need to see to the screen like that. TIERNEY: Yeah, it's a big part of the book, so I certainly didn't invent it whole cloth. But yeah, that stuff is very important, and it's always been an interesting distinction between Shane and Ilya. And I think it's quite stark when Ilya—it's a small line that he says in episode 5, but he says that about his father, “I wish he could have known me.” And I think that's what he means, and I think that Ilya's very aware. Part of the reason that he's kind of gently probing Shane in that episode and being like, “Do they know about you?” And he's like, “No, about you. If they don't, you'll regret it at a certain point. You need to take this leap.” And it's scary as those of us who've come out to parents [know], which is most gay kids at this point, or queer people in general. And what was important to me throughout the show was to make sure that we had sophisticated and complicated relationships with parents going on here. It was why it was so important for me to keep Skip's dad in the show, to see somebody be supportive like that, to see somebody whose love cup is endless. And I think that to see Yuna [Shane's mom, played by Christina Chang] is such an important part of this show, and she's such an important part moving forward, especially. And I think that in these moments, you see that her and Shane are so similar, and they have very similar limitations, and that it was really important to me for the two of them to have a moment together beyond what was already in the book and what was already in the story. It felt very important to me that these two have—I don't think it's a reckoning, but that they have their own moment of intimacy where they can clear things up for one another. Because I think they're both the kinds of people that build things up in their heads, and when you say things out loud, I think you can kind of take the air out of them, and it suddenly becomes a lot more manageable than whatever you've created in your brain. And it helps to have two very, very good actors there to do the heavy lifting for me. DEADLINE: And one thing that's really tragic, even though it was such a great finale, just the fact that Shane wants to just keep their relationship a secret until they retire. And it kind of struck me how it's almost like art imitating life, or vice-versa, with the pressure and speculation that the actors are facing. I've known loads of actors in the closet. I've known loads of actors who have come out. And I do think that part of the reason that this story appealed to me is because I can relate to it. And I think that's also part of what makes the story resonate with so many people is that we're not pretending we live in a world without homophobia, and we're not pretending we live in a world where coming out is easy. I think that's part of the beauty of what Scott does is so brave, and it's so big, and it does crack something open for other people, but I think what it cracks open for them is just allowing them to know that they are allowed to be together. The rest of it, they can figure out at a later date—and the fans of the book know how this is gonna go—but I think that part of what is interesting and different and unique about Shane and Ilya's story is that this journey that we're watching them go on in this first book, in this first season of TV now, is a journey to just understanding that they love each other. And that's such a hurdle for them. That's hard enough for them, that to then add in the rest of the world, I think will take a whole other season of television. But I have a lot of empathy and I have a lot of time for Shane's journey with that stuff. It's hard, and I do think that there's actors, a lot of professionals, especially people who begin their professional journey at 12 years old. There's so much baked in, and there's so much built in around you that you can often lose yourself. DEADLINE: Speaking of which, I just recently discovered that you were in Are You Afraid of the Dark?, which was such a big part of my childhood. TIERNEY: I am a campfire kid forever. Were there moments on Heated Rivalry where you had to compromise your vision or the story? TIERNEY: Sure, there were moments along the way … my execs at Crave were so f*cking amazing about that. But my execs, they didn't want it toned down at all. DEADLINE: Well, it's great to see such a fearlessly queer show, especially when GLAAD recently released their study that almost half of LGBTQ characters are disappearing. TIERNEY: We added a bunch, so at least there's that. It's not a great time for stuff like that, and I think, unfortunately, the more there's consolidation among broadcasters and streamers too, it's not gonna get a lot better, I don't think. But it is nice to be a part of a show that is doing something like this, that's reminding people that there's loads of audiences here and that they can be queer and queer adjacent, our allies, our friends, our families. If this was just gay people watching this show, we wouldn't be talking about it right now, let's be real. So, the fact that it's gotten to this level of conversation in the culture is because there are people that want to watch this, and they don't care if it's two men in a love story, or maybe even want that specifically. And then even more so, it's just such a pleasure to be involved in a show that's making people happy and that is providing joy. I still read people being like, “I know that this show is gonna end on a cliffhanger.” And I keep wanting to shout it from the rooftops, “It won't! DEADLINE: Honestly, I had that thought too, watching it. It's such a good ending, and then they get in the car. I'm like, “Oh, they're about to get into a car accident or something. TIERNEY: You know what's really funny, is that if I let that footage just run and run and run, because we shot that in the studio, my producing partner Brendan [Brady] will run out in front of that car and get hit by it. So you will see our straight producer dying. DEADLINE: Another thing I thought was funny, I'm reading a lot of the social media reactions, and you've introduced a lot of viewers to frottage. So that's cool, it's really opening a lot of eyes to queer sex. And I've also seen some people talk about how very accurate the sex scenes are to the book, and I'm wondering if you were very committed to maintaining accuracy to those scenes. TIERNEY: Some of them are super accurate to, or close to the book, and some of them go different ways. But what I would say I was committed to, that Rachel and I are both committed to, was kind of using this sex to tell their story, that this is not separate from their story. The sex isn't like, “And then they fuck! Let's put it in a new room or do it on a kitchen counter.” Their sex is the way that they understand each other, and it's the way that we understand them as a couple. So, what I was committed to was making sure that we watch this relationship evolve through the sex, because it's one thing to just make smut—which I'm thrilled to be doing. But it would be numbing and boring to watch the same f*ck scene over and over again. We are certainly not starved for sex, as viewers. That's why I love the sex in episode 6 so much, because it's both incredibly sweet and then incredibly playful and funny. That's when I feel like they're a real couple, like when you're giving somebody a blowjob to annoy them. DEADLINE: But there's a lot more emotional intimacy, and it made it feel so earned and real. Like when Ilya tells Shane “I love you” in Russian. TIERNEY: I think that's part of the evolution too, it's a story. This stuff, it has to imprint on you, and then, you get that those big feelings like that. And I don't think you get those big feelings that you get in 5 if you haven't sat through how painful 4 was for them, or the ending of 2, where you're like, “Oh God, will these two ever f*cking learn to talk to each other?” And then when they do in 5, it's in two different languages. I think that's also part of what's amazing when romance works, that you're just endlessly watching two people bypass each other. When they hit, you're like, “No, wait! TIERNEY: It's all gonna be underwater. It takes place in the lost city of Atlantis—no, listen, Season 2 will be based around The Long Game. I guess, here's what I can say too, is that Heated Rivalry will always be centered around Shane and Ilya, this show. And that's pretty exciting, so I'm looking forward to really digging into this world. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Because this show deserves all the flowers. Episode 5 is the best episode of television I have ever watched, never have I felt such visceral emotion watching a TV show. I have been incredibly impressed with each episode, and I'll be watching it again and again until season 2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club will return to recap Stranger Things‘ series finale on December 31.] “It gives me a headache trying to understand all this,” Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) says toward the end of Stranger Things‘ latest round. Granted, she's recently woken up from being under Vecna's (Jamie Campbell Bower) spell, so her confusion about the latest plan to kill the enemy is warranted. But there is a considerable amount of exposition packed into these three episodes—each clocking in at least an hour, with the sixth (and, admittedly, the best) coming up to 75 minutes. The bloated runtime is bound to cause fatigue at various intervals, like when poor Holly Wheeler's (Nell Fisher) friends turn against her and kick her(!) or when Steve (Joe Keery) and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) beat each other up. Stranger Things has a lot to accomplish in these final few outings, so the pacing seems annoying. First, we had a monthlong gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and now, the finale releases on the night of December 31. If you have made New Year's Eve plans and hate spoilers, well, stay away from social media until your hangover recedes on January 1. At least the Duffers try to justify this batch of overlong episodes by introducing game-changing Upside Down lore and a dangerous new dimension that sets up a challenging mission for the gang. We get to see plenty of that in these episodes. “Shock Jock” and “Escape From Camazotz” keep everybody separate before a much-welcome reunion in “The Bridge.” There are lots of moving parts, though, so for my sanity and yours, I'm divvying this recap based on the pairings. There's a lot to appreciate about this pairing because of what they bring out in each other. Together, though, Max and Holly make for a dynamic duo. The most engaging parts of this season stem from their adventure across Henry's memories. With dipshit-turned-delightful Derek's help, Holly escapes from Henry Creel's house, but not before meeting the 11 other children Vecna has kidnapped. She knows no one will believe her about Mr. Whatsit's true identity, so Holly and Max leave on their own by revisiting all the times Holly interacted with Mr. Whatsit before being taken. As they hop from the playground to a library to her home, Holly witnesses the demogorgon attack on her mother. (They escaped with a timely assist from Will entering Vecna's mind.) However, it leads to an interesting personality switch between the two in episode six. Holly becomes pessimistic about their chances of escape, claiming she isn't Heroic at all. Max encourages them to keep going until they find the exit, which they eventually do—or at least Max does, when she sees Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) sitting by her hospital bedside, playing Kate Bush on repeat. Holly's gate is nowhere to be found, but Max gives an encouraging, emotional speech about her strengths. Sink and Fisher, much like Keery and Matarazzo, have such easygoing camaraderie that you can't help but fall for their friendship here. Speaking of Steve and Dustin, I won't lie: Watching them punch each other in “Shock Jock” was maddening. Their feelings are heightened, but come on, we need them to be pals. Their goal is to find an energy shield that's keeping the Upside Down safe, per Dustin's theory. What they don't know is that upstairs, Nancy has already fired a gun at the shield, leading to some sort of melting gray goo that's destroying the building they're in. When they realize this, Steve—ever the hero—wants to climb right up and rescue his friends. He can't lose Steve after watching Eddie die in his arms. It's an incredibly sweet moment that reminds us that, in the end, Dustin is just a kid, too, even if he's been spending the past 18 months riling everybody up in that torn Hellfire Club T-shirt and looking for a fight. It's a coping mechanism, but the walls finally break, leading to Steve comforting his best friend. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, the couple finally has a much-needed heart-to-heart about the state of their relationship. They perform an autopsy of it, essentially, talking about how they both want different things and that spending time apart when Jonathan was living in California emphasized this. They trauma bonded after Will's kidnapping and Barb's death. So they share their confessions and happily break up, despite Jonathan showing her the ring, assuming death is on its way. Of course, Dustin and Steve manage to rescue them. For any Stancy shippers, though, Nancy shuts down the idea of liking Steve, primarily because she remembers how he wants to be a dad of six kids. (Someone tell Steve he's already a dad of sorts to the multiple teens around him!) Vecna, using Will as a spy one last time, figures out where Max is being kept. He sends a bunch of demogorgons to attack her physical body, hoping that if she dies, Holly will be alone and return to him. But he underestimated the power of a determined mom. But before she does, Lucas runs around with Max's body in his arms, getting help from Robin and her girlfriend, Vickie (Amybeth McNulty). Still, there's plenty of tension in these chase scenes, which end on the happy note of Max waking up and reuniting with Lucas. The “Let's wake up Will Byers” crew: As it turns out, Joyce (Winona Ryder) has learned her lesson about keeping Will away from danger after seeing him gain powers. While it works at first, Vecna's power overtakes Will. It isn't until El (Millie Bobby Brown) and Hopper (David Harbour) return from the Upside Down with Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) in tow that a new plan to wake him up emerges. El jumps into a water tank to try and find Will in the void and gets him out of Vecna's control. Meanwhile, Erica taps Mr. Clarke into the team, using his skills to make another telemetry tracker and figure out where Dustin, Steve, Jonathan, and Nancy are in the Upside Down. For starters, Kali tells Eleven that their blood will be in constant demand. Killing Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) isn't enough because someone else will take her place so that the military can keep making new weapons. Kali suggests the only option is to, um, kill themselves. I do not support this insane plan, even though Kali feels burdened after witnessing how Kay was infusing her blood into pregnant moms. Please, Eleven, you gotta come up with a better plan. Plus, season five has oddly sidelined its main protagonist so that Will gets a lot of the focus as the new Sorcerer. Eleven has been stuck in Hopper's charge, but she's the OG powerful superhero, and I am hoping the finale doesn't forget that. Then there's Steve, who comes up with the ultimate plan of destroying The Abyss, which has already begun its descent into Hawkins. Hey, at least it now makes sense why the premiere had a scene of him racing Jonathan to climb up to the top of that damn tower. It's a deceptively simple goal because we just know things aren't going to entirely go their way. Still, most of the gang head into the UD to make it happen—El, Hopper, Nancy, Jonathan, Murray, Steve, Mike, Lucas, Robin, Dustin, Will, and Kali. Meanwhile, Joyce, Max, Erica, Mr. Clarke, and Vickie are still above ground. Will, extra traumatized after being under Vecna's control again, makes a hearty confession to everyone. I do think watching it will be beneficial to younger ST fans, but it's a bit wild to shoehorn this huge moment right at the end of the penultimate hour. Let's meet back in 2026 to figure out how this all wraps up, huh?</p>
