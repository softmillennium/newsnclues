                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amplify ETFs is expanding its digital asset offerings with the launch of two new ETFs that aim to capture the infrastructure driving blockchain's next phase, without requiring investors to hold cryptocurrencies directly. These funds provide exposure to companies generating revenue from stablecoins, tokenized assets, and the systems that support them. Both funds follow diversified indexes that focus on blockchain-related business models rather than speculative tokens. Amplify stated that the dual launch reflects increasing institutional interest in the foundational aspects of digital finance, as stablecoins and tokenization move from niche uses to mainstream acceptance. The stablecoin-focused ETF targets companies earning significant revenue from payment technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms. Amplify pointed to regulatory progress as a major advantage. The firm noted that clearer rules are giving financial institutions the confidence to develop compliant stablecoin products and explore related revenue opportunities. The Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF concentrates on companies creating systems to digitize real-world assets and financial processes. Tokenization has gained momentum as regulators engage more with the concept, including discussions about tokenized stocks and other traditional assets. Financial institutions view this technology as a way to improve settlement efficiency, cut costs, and create new market structures. Crypto and blockchain ETFs surged onto the market in 2025 after the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chair Paul Atkins, eased approval standards. This regulatory change opened the door to products that target specific segments of the crypto ecosystem instead of just offering broad, price-linked exposure. Amplify's latest launch highlights a wider trend: investors are increasingly seeking options beyond volatile cryptocurrencies, focusing instead on the companies building compliant, revenue-generating infrastructure for blockchain-based finance. For those cautious about crypto's ups and downs, Amplify's new ETFs provide a way to engage with the industry's growth without the intense volatility.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As 2025 draws to a close, bitcoin BTC$87,242.74 faced a tough year, down about 7% year-to-date, while gold, the S&P 500 and technology stocks continue to hit all-time highs. As a result, public bitcoin mining stocks have shown stark contrasts, driven largely by diversification into artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. The standout performers have been companies aggressively pivoting to AI. Cipher Mining (CIFR) followed strongly at +230%, expanding AI hosting partnerships specifically with Fluidstack. Hut 8 (HUT) also soared, up around +139%, capped by its recent AI announcement: a $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease for 245 MW at its River Bend site in Louisiana. CleanSpark (CLSK) (13,011 BTC) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) (19,324 BTC) saw modest gains of 16% and 32% respectively, without aggressive AI diversification until much later in the year. Core Scientific (CORZ) stayed independent after shareholders rejected a $9 billion all-stock takeover bid from CoreWeave in October, betting on higher standalone value amid AI demand. This year underscored a clear trend: miners repurposing sites for AI data centers which outperformed pure-play bitcoin operators. L1 tokens broadly underperformed in 2025 despite a backdrop of regulatory and institutional wins. 2025 was defined by a stark divergence: structural progress collided with stagnant price action. Institutional milestones were reached and TVL increased across most major ecosystems, yet the majority of large-cap Layer-1 tokens finished the year with negative or flat returns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Law enforcement agencies are being warned to expect more cases involving stablecoins and other digital assets, according to a recent FinTRAC report.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press Stablecoins are being envisioned as an alternate form of payment. Ottawa's new stablecoin framework a key step toward monetary sovereignty, advocates say That requires a few critical elements,” Mr. Macklem said during his year-end speech in Montreal. Unfortunately, those are the same attributes that make stablecoins attractive to financial criminals such as money launderers, terrorist financiers and sanctions evaders. Indeed, law enforcement agencies are being warned to expect more cases involving stablecoins and other digital assets, according to a financial intelligence report by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FinTRAC. The confidential document – titled “Trends in Large Virtual Currency Transaction Reports and Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing Implications” – was prepared by the federal anti-money-laundering watchdog in March, 2024. Rita Trichur: Financial crime loopholes in U.S. stablecoin law offer a cautionary tale for Canada Ryan Wedding organization allegedly used cryptocurrency to launder drug money (As an aside, the task force is currently reviewing Canada's anti-money-laundering regime. FinTRAC's findings are based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of Large Virtual Currency Transaction Reports. (Although LVCTRs do not necessarily prove suspicious activity, it is widely recognized that digital currency transactions are being increasingly exploited by criminals.) FinTRAC's analysis is based on 148,358 LVCTRs received from January, 2022, to December, 2023. Those reports encompassed 953,295 virtual currency transactions totalling $14.7-billion from 118 businesses, according to the analysis. That burst of activity means stablecoins are “increasingly prominent in money laundering cases,” even if many of those digital assets have features to “reverse transactions” and seize funds tainted by crime. A U.S. indictment alleging that former Canadian Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding and his accomplices made extensive use of cryptocurrencies, including the stablecoin Tether, to launder the proceeds of drug trafficking is a timely reminder of how suspected criminals could abuse digital currencies. Canada's Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act was updated in 2020 to ensure money-services businesses that deal in virtual currencies register with FinTRAC. That means ensuring that foreign stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, cannot participate in any centralized or decentralized exchanges or peer-to-peer transfers without robust regulatory oversight. Canada must also make certain that secondary-market participants, including digital asset exchanges, custodians and brokers, all have reporting obligations under the updated act. The Carney government should also offer assurances that anonymizing technologies, such as mixers and other intermediaries that obscure funding sources, are captured by existing and proposed legislation. Canada should consider bolstering client due diligence for stablecoin issuers. After all, legitimate stablecoin advocates aren't the only ones anticipating all the money to be made – old-fashioned fiat currency, that is – once final rules are in place.

Until now, it has routed all the fees to liquidity providers, leaving UNI as a governance-only token with no direct economic link to the platform's activity. A full100 million UNI from the treasury — worth over $590 million at current rates — will be also burned in a retroactive move intended to reflect fees that could have accrued had protocol fees been active since Uniswap's creation in 2018.

Bitcoin eyes $100K if $90K breaks, ETH struggles below $3K, while XRP and SOL show mixed signals after major options expiry. Bitcoin accounts for the biggest share of today's expiry, with over $23.6 billion in BTC options rolling off. Data from Deribit shows 268,000 option contracts settled at the same time, clearing a major amount of risk from the market in a single session. The put-to-call ratio stands at 0.38, which means more traders were betting on higher prices than lower ones. The “max pain” level, where most option holders would see losses, was near $96,000. This level often acts like a price magnet around expiry, even if briefly. Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has remained stuck in a tight range, repeatedly testing both sides. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe noted that sellers have failed to push BTC below $86.5K, showing strong buyer support. However, every move above $90K has been rejected, highlighting heavy selling pressure at that level. Ethereum is also under the spotlight, with nearly $4 billion in ETH options expiring. Although ETH has seen small price gains, traders remain cautious rather than confident. Ethereum has once again failed to hold above the key $3,000 level, which is worrying traders. Crypto analyst Ted noted that unless ETH clearly moves back above $3,000, the risk of another drop stays high. If the price falls below $2,800, selling pressure could increase quickly. Below that, the next strong support lies around $2,600, $2,500, where buyers stepped in during earlier sell-offs. XRP options show continued pressure, with traders closely watching the $1.80 support level. A break below this could lead to further downside. Options data remains neutral, and SOL has already seen a small recovery around $123. Large expiries can influence market sentiment, affecting XRP support at $1.80 and Solana's price recovery around $123.

Merchants participate because Bitcoin Lightning fees are typically under 1%, compared with the roughly 3% average charged by credit card networks. Residents can pay municipal bills, including taxes, parking fines and tuition, in BTC or USDT using standard QR-code invoices. The city balances the ecosystem by using BTC for payments, USDT for stability and LVGA as a local loyalty token. The city does not hold volatile crypto assets. Payments are converted instantly into Swiss francs (CHF) through Bitcoin Suisse, limiting the city's exposure to crypto price volatility. The cobblestone streets of Lugano, Switzerland are better known for their Mediterranean-style piazzas and high-end boutiques than for radical economic shifts. But look closer at storefronts along Via Nassa, and the familiar “Visa” and “Mastercard” stickers have a new neighbor: a bright yellow “Plan ₿” decal. Launched in 2022 as a partnership between the City of Lugano and Tether, Plan ₿ was not designed as a marketing stunt. It was conceived as a structural overhaul of the city's financial rails. While countries such as El Salvador have pursued top-down Bitcoin mandates, Lugano's approach is quintessentially Swiss: voluntary, highly organized and focused on reducing merchant friction. The ecosystem rests on three pillars: Bitcoin BTCUSD for sovereign value, Tether's USDt USDTUSD for price stability in larger commerce and the LVGA token, a local stablecoin that powers a city-wide loyalty program. Traditional credit card processors in Switzerland can charge merchants upward of 3% per transaction. By contrast, Bitcoin payments made via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 protocol that enables instant, low-fee transactions, often cost less than 1%. One local shop owner describes the shift as an organic process. It's “like a tree growing,” he told the BBC. “This tree will grow very big in five, 10 years.” While crypto payments currently account for only a small share of his daily sales, the infrastructure is already in place, waiting for the “mass” in mass adoption. When users pay with crypto at participating local shops, they receive up to 10% cashback in LVGA tokens. By keeping value within these digital rails, the city reduces reliance on certain traditional banking fee structures, keeping more transaction value within the local ecosystem. Governance on the blockchain through taxes and fines Lugano is one of the few places in the world where all municipal invoices, from property taxes to parking tickets, can be paid using Bitcoin or Tether. An invoice arrives with a standard Swiss QR code. This growth is not merely about tourism; it reflects a deepening level of institutional interest. In 2025, Lugano further consolidated its position by issuing its fifth digital bond on SDX, the SIX Digital Exchange, demonstrating that blockchain infrastructure extends beyond retail payments to sophisticated municipal debt markets. The city has also become a magnet for brain gain, attracting more than 110 crypto-related startups that have relocated to the region, drawn by the regulatory clarity provided under Switzerland's FINMA framework. However, any professional analysis must account for friction. Local critics, including university students and some academics, remain wary. In Switzerland, traditional bank deposits are protected by state-backed guarantees. Crypto assets held in digital wallets, however, do not benefit from the same protections. “If the platform where my digital wallet is recorded fails or goes bankrupt, my cryptocurrencies disappear,” warns Sergio Rossi, an economics professor at the University of Fribourg. Finally, while the technical infrastructure may be fully in place, “psychological adoption” remains a generational challenge. By focusing on three specific workflows, the city has created a repeatable model for municipalities worldwide: Ensure the currency can be used for routine obligations such as taxes, not just discretionary purchases like luxury goods Use a local loyalty token to keep value circulating within the city. As the world watches central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) with a mix of curiosity and concern, Lugano offers a contrasting model: a city experimenting with private, decentralized and stable digital assets, positioned as an alternative to state-issued digital currencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>zkPass Listing on Bithumb: A Game-Changer for Privacy and Korean Crypto Trading This zkPass listing is not just another token addition; it's a powerful endorsement of privacy-enhancing technology within a major regulated market. Scheduled to go live at 9:00 a.m. UTC today, this event signals growing institutional interest in projects that prioritize user data sovereignty. For traders and blockchain enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment where advanced cryptographic concepts meet mainstream financial accessibility. Bithumb is one of South Korea's largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore, its decision to list a token like ZKP carries substantial weight. Moreover, it validates the project's underlying technology—zero-knowledge proofs—in a market known for its rigorous compliance standards. For those new to the concept, zkPass is a protocol built around zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). In simple terms, this technology allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any underlying information. Imagine proving you are over 18 without showing your birthdate. zkPass applies this to digital identity and data verification. The zkPass listing on a major fiat gateway like Bithumb highlights a growing real-world application for ZKPs beyond theoretical use cases. The South Korean market is a powerhouse, known for its high retail participation and tech-savvy population. This direct fiat on-ramp could lead to increased trading volume and price discovery for zkPass. Other exchanges may follow suit, and more privacy-focused projects might seek listings, thereby diversifying the offerings available to Korean investors. While the announcement is bullish, investors should proceed with informed caution. The regulatory environment for privacy-enhancing tokens remains complex and can change rapidly. Price volatility is often high following a new listing as the market seeks equilibrium. Additionally, the success of zkPass will ultimately depend on the widespread adoption of its protocol, not just its token's trading activity. Therefore, while the zkPass listing is a monumental step, its long-term impact hinges on the project's execution and broader market trends. This move provides legitimacy, liquidity, and visibility to a crucial technological innovation. Q1: When exactly does zkPass (ZKP) start trading on Bithumb? Q2: Can I deposit ZKP tokens to Bithumb before trading starts? A2: Typically, exchanges open deposits a few hours before trading begins. A3: zkPass is a decentralized protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow for private and secure verification of personal data without revealing the data itself. Q5: Are there any risks associated with trading a newly listed token? Q6: Does this mean privacy tokens are becoming more accepted? Found this breakdown of the pivotal zkPass listing helpful? The fusion of privacy tech and mainstream trading is a story every crypto enthusiast should follow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This ride-hailing app—called TADA—uses blockchain technology to connect drivers and riders via smart contracts. Its use of decentralized tech enables greater transparency, fairer earnings for drivers, and cost savings for riders, co-founder Kay Woo told Fortune in a Dec. 24 interview. We are becoming the software for both [drivers and riders] and while they're using our network, they just need to simply pay a small fee,” Woo says. The ride-hailing app is best known for its “zero commission model”, which charges drivers a flat software fee (of around 78 to 92 cents) rather than a cut of their earnings. The platform has a significant and growing share in Singapore's crowded ride-hailing market, constituting 11.1% of market share in 2022, according to data platform Measurable AI. TADA's entry to NYC marks a full-circle moment for Woo, who had first begun his entrepreneurship journey in the city. In 2012, alongside a friend, Woo created a social gathering application with the goal of bringing people together—but the app flopped. We were just a bunch of nerds,” Woo says. According to Woo, although Uber and DiDi were popular in the region, ride-hailing apps didn't yet offer cross-border transport services. After a successful test run in Hong Kong and mainland China, TADA's founders officially launched their ride-hailing business in Singapore, choosing the city-state as it is densely populated and has “superb infrastructure support.” “Among Southeast Asian countries, Singapore is super important to showcase all other neighboring countries in Southeast Asia,” Woo says. Besides generating a profit from the broader Web3 platform by its parent company, MVL, TADA sells anonymized vehicle and driving data—with consent—to ecosystem partners, and offers MVL tokens to be traded on external cryptocurrency exchanges. After growing the business in Asia, Woo now has his sights set on the U.S., where he is ready to take on industry giants like Uber and Lyft. “Whenever I go to New York, I interview the old drivers, and everybody says the same thing: current ride-hailing services take too much commission, but they don't have any choice,” quips Woo. He alludes to ‘legacy' ride-hailing apps like Uber and Grab as part of the “first wave”, which disrupted the traditional taxi market. But these platforms were built with capitalistic goals, he says, leading to skyrocketing platform fees and prices. “And now it's their time to be disrupted with a new type of model,” Woo adds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company now generates millions in toy sales, though Netz acknowledged that margins remain thin in the consumer products space. What started as a strategy to extend the operating runway has become a core revenue stream, positioning the project to close 2025 with an estimated $50 million in total revenue. Pudgy Penguins has built a social media presence of approximately 2 million followers on Instagram, where the company focuses its significant marketing efforts. The NFT sector faced substantial headwinds throughout 2025, with first-quarter transaction volumes dropping 63% year-over-year to $1.5 billion from $4.1 billion in the same 2024 period. March sales plunged 76% to $373 million compared to $1.6 billion a year earlier, though select collections including Pudgy Penguins showed relative stability. Total NFT market capitalization reportedly fell to approximately $2.5 billion in December, marking the lowest level of 2025. Despite widespread declines, certain segments found traction during the year. Real-world collectible-backed NFTs emerged as an area of strength, particularly trading cards linked to physical assets. Platform Courtyard.io connects authenticated Pokémon cards to on-chain tokens that can be traded or redeemed for the underlying physical item. CryptoSlam data shows Courtyard processed over 230,000 transactions and generated roughly $13.9 million in sales during the past 30 days. Courtyard CEO Nicolas le Jeune emphasized the use of blockchain as a tool rather than the primary value proposition, noting that NFTs provide improved ownership experience for assets that derive value from their physical backing.</p>
